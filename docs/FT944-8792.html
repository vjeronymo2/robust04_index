			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / GDP statisticians aim at a 'moving target' Financial markets will pay particularly close attention to today's third quarter gross domestic product figures. With the City on tenterhooks about a possible interest rate rise, any upwards revision to the preliminary estimate published this month could create a stir. But the reaction from economists may be more sceptical. In spite of the attention paid to GDP, many economists suspect the data are one of the more ambiguous elements of the statistical series. Part of the problem is that calculating GDP requires a huge pool of data on output, expenditure and income. Since this data arrives at different times, new data can prompt revisions, not least because the three methods the Central Statistical Office can use to calculate GDP rarely result in the same figure. The CSO points out that these revisions have fallen in the past four years. It recently set itself a target to keep revisions in annual GDP data below 0.4 per cent. Some observers believe the data still understate the recovery. Mr Andrew Cates of brokers UBS points out that annual GDP data have been revised upwards on average by 0.5 per cent over the past 25 years. But the second difficulty dogging the statisticians is the speed of economic change. As Mr Doug McWilliams, head of the centre for economics and business research, said: 'The CSO is chasing a moving target. The economy is restructuring so fast it is hard to pick up these shifts.' The issue revolves around 'weightings'. The CSO calculates the relative weight of sectors in the economy every five years. The weighting given to the oil and gas sector, for example, fell from about 60 parts per 1,000 in 1985 to 21 parts in 1990, following the decline in the North Sea sector in the late 1980s. But since this rebasing occurs only every five years, changes in the performance of sectors within this period are not reflected. A big question mark hangs over rapidly changing sectors such as financial services and electronics. With the computer sector having increased turnover by 50 per cent in the past year, according to the Engineering Employers Federation, observers such as Mr McWilliams suspect a five-year rebasing is too clumsy to reflect these shifts. The CSO itself argues that any discrepancies from this are small. Nevertheless alternative systems of updating are being considered, not least because other approaches are being developed elsewhere. The Danish government has introduced a continual rebasing method into its data. CSO officials fear that introducing this would be costly, could lead to less accuracy in the actual rebasing used, and provide an additional statistical burden for businesses. Faced with these problems most observers, such as Ms Kate Barker, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry, simply take the data with a pinch of salt. She said: 'I am not sure it is worse now than before. But the general point is that financial markets sometimes get too excited about figures, as if they represented reality - which of course they don't'</p>

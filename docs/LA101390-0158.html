			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS GIVE HARPER GUARANTEED 4-YEAR DEAL  </P> <P> The Clippers, facing the rare situation of negotiating with an injured free  agent, signed Ron Harper to a four-year guaranteed contract worth more than $11  million Friday because they view him as a rare talent.  </P> <P> Although no details were disclosed, the Clippers have made a bold move by  guaranteeing the majority of the money to a player who must again prove his  talents after undergoing reconstructive knee surgery on Jan. 23. This season,  for example, it is believed that Harper will earn more than $2 million although  he is expected to miss almost half the campaign. January is the target for his  return.  </P> <P> "Ron is a superstar, and the challenge was to pay him as a superstar while  still addressing the risks involved in this situation," said Bob Steele, chief  executive officer of the Sterling Corp. and the team's negotiator. "The truth  is, we recognize Ron as one of the very top players in the NBA and we are going  to pay him accordingly on a guaranteed basis. That's the bottom line.  </P> <P> "Very few players in the NBA would ever get a guaranteed contract in this  situation. But Ron is one of them."  </P> <P> The deal, completed after three months of negotiations devoid of rancor,  includes incentives for games and minutes and performance bonuses such as  making the All-Star team and All-NBA. More important, there are no medical  contingencies for a minimum number of games that might lessen Harper's pay.  </P> <P> "It was the culmination of a long process made very complicated because of the  status and the stature of the player involved," said Mark Termini, Harper's  agent. "Those two facts made this very, very complicated negotiations, one for  which we -- the Clippers and I -- could find no precedents. We went onto new  ground when we structured this one."  </P> <P> The Clippers apparently accepted the risk because of what Harper means to the  franchise. He averaged 23 points for 28 games after arriving last Nov. 16 as  part of the package that sent Reggie Williams and the rights to Danny Ferry to  the Cleveland Cavaliers. The flair that came, too, was a bonus for a marketing  department trying to sell tickets.  </P> <P> Harper earned $650,000 then, in the final season of a four-year contract he  signed after the Cavaliers made him the eighth player drafted. The Clippers  were not fazed by trading for someone who would soon be a restricted free agent  and said from the start they would match any offer sheet Harper signed. They  never had to exercise that right of first refusal.  </P> <P> "It's a sign of faith that they asked me to sign a four-year deal," said  Harper, who has not had any setbacks in the rehabilitation of his injured right  knee. "If they had no confidence in my return, they would have asked for only a  two-year deal."  </P> <P> After a hectic 11 days that included signing Harper and first-round draft  choices Bo Kimble and Loy Vaught and deciding not to match the offer sheet Joe  Wolf got from the Denver Nuggets, Clipper negotiators will get a rest until  mid-November. Then, talks will begin on a long-term deal for Benoit Benjamin,  about to begin the option year of his contract.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Armen Khanbabyan: "AES Will Resume </F> Operations--But an Alternative Is Still Being Sought"]    [Text] A few days ago the Armenian state statistical  administration published the data on the results of national  industry operations for 1993. And some amazing things came to  light. Despite the cutbacks in the volume of power engineering  that brought its output to one-third of the 1992 level,  industrial decline has been halted, and in some sectors--for  instance, radioelectronics--there was even a perceptible upturn.  VPK [Military-Industrial Complex] enterprises undergoing  conversion did especially well; overall, 1 percent more of  output was produced in 1993 than in 1992. The trend toward  stabilization and growth continued in the current January as  well.    The government maintains that this success is the result of  a  correct economic policy, the beginning of structural  restructuring, and the change of the import-export ratio in  favor of the latter. And most importantly, in the opinion of the  Council of Ministers, this is the result of calculated and  judicious use of scarce fuel and power resources. Everybody in  Armenia, however, also knows quite well that in most cases  enterprises are able to operate because they have a priority  with respect to power supply at the expense of cutting back the  consumption for social and household needs. For instance, this  winter electric power for household needs was available for no  more than three hours a day, and lately even that has been cut  down to one hour.    This is why the government's intention to resume operations  at the Armenian AES [nuclear electric power station], which was  shut down immediately after the 1988 earthquake, today meet with  practically no protestations. True, the AES has a lot of  opposition outside the country. Both Tbilisi and Ankara are less  than happy about the idea of its resurrection. The objections  are mostly ecology-related. In Washington and other Western  capitals there is less concern about the environmental health in  the region; they, on the other hand, do not hide concerns that  resumption of AES operations, which will produce spent nuclear  fuel, may allow Armenia to start working on creating its own  weapons of mass destruction. Moscow also has always entertained  some suspicions of this kind. This may be the reason why all of  Yerevan's pleas for credits for the station's restoration went  unheeded.    The issue was suddenly resolved in an unexpected way. While  on an official visit to London last week, President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan announced that Russia and Armenia will soon sign  an agreement on creating a joint Armenian-Russian enterprise on  the base of the AES. Thus, it was made clear to the West that it  should not fear potential "nuclear ambitions" on the part of  Yerevan: the station's operation will be under the control of  one of the great powers which, of course, will never allow the  AES to be used for military purposes. This already makes  possible the prospect of receiving targeted credits from the  West for development of the fuels and power sector. Meanwhile,  Russia will undertake the main burden of financing AES  restoration work. This should make it possible to restart one of  the station's generators as early as the end of this year and to  produce an additional 400 megawatts of electric power. One half,  of course, will belong to the Russian side, and this factor will  reinforce even more Yerevan's traditional economic and political  dependence on Moscow, which literally will gain the ability to  turn on and off the light in the Armenian population's  apartments. In addition, transfer of electricity from Armenia to  Russia is not economically effective because of the great  distances. Therefore a piquant situation may arise whereby  Russia will be selling electric power produced in Armenia to  neighboring countries, with which Armenia at this point has  strained relations, to put it mildly--to Turkey or even  Azerbaijan.    The upcoming restart of the station is in every respect a  forced step. The AES is situated in a troublesome area and may  at any moment become the subject of a military attack.  Therefore, Armenia is working on a parallel track searching for  alternative solutions in finding reliable sources of energy for  the country. In April, prospecting drilling probably will  finally begin in Ararat Valley, where there are assumed oil and  gas deposits. A program of building a score of medium- and  small-capacity hydroelectric stations is in the development  stage. In the production sphere the priority is given to  energy-saving technologies. Certain hopes are also pinned on the  plans for building a new major gas pipeline between Iran and  West Europe.    In any event, implementation of even a part of these plans  and projects will require considerable resources which Armenia  today does not have. The restart of the AES will allow, however,  achievement of a qualitative improvement in national industry  operations and will seriously expand the republic's export  potential. Another thing is clear as well: the soonest possible  restoration of the AES, with all attendant costs, is necessary  in order to create future conditions that will allow it to shut  down again as soon as possible--this time, hopefully, for good.</p>

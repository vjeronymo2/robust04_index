			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: ``Agni's Launch Raises Questions''] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 21--The successful launch of the  Agni-III technology demonstrator on Saturday begs more questions  than it answers. The Angi-III, 21 metres in length, with a  take-off weight of 19 tonnes, is a substantially modified  version of Agni-I, featuring a new stage separation system as  well as an advanced design manoeuvering-type warhead.    The Agni project was sanctioned in July 1983 at a cost of Rs  35 crores for testing three launch vehicles. Now that the series  has ended, the government must decide what to do. Does it accept  the Western diktat and abandon efforts to deploy long-range  missiles? Or does it continue ``testing'' and ``technology  demonstration'' of some more different kinds of missiles ad  infinitum?    The other logical option is to instruct the DRDO and  sanction  funds to fabricate prototypes of missiles that will be deployed  in a specific time frame. Given the existing deployments in  China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran, India will not be  pre-empting anyone, only reacting, somewhat belatedly, to  existing capabilities in our region.    The first of the Agni series were launched after six years  of  efforts by 5,000 engineers and staff. The 600 sec. duration of  the flight tested a re-entry vehicle structure as well as a  control and guidance package. In addition a multi-node,  automatic checkout system was also proved. The test was  successful in fulfilling the requirements in all the parameters.    The second test took place on 29 May 1992, but proved to be  a  failure when two seconds after launch Agni-II began to veer  off-course and came apart, plunging into the sea hundreds of  miles away from the planned point of descent near the Car  Nicobar islands.    The reason for the failure was beguilingly simple. Agni-II  was modified by extending its length to 21m from the 19m. length  of Agni-I. Its weight was increased from 14 to 16 tonnes. This  change altered the vehicle's vibration characteristics which are  measured by sensors and which report to an on-board computer  which orders the various instruments to correct the trajectory.    Amazingly the scientists failed to adjust the sensors  following the modification of the weight and length of the  vehicle. Last year, upon a Russian consultant's advice the  problem was resolved in one day.    The first attempt to launch Agni-III was made earlier this  year and it failed when the launch had to be aborted seconds  before ignition. Agni-III, which looks like Agni-II, has been  sent up to test a new re-entry vehicle (warhead container). This  RV has fins which allow it to manoeuver and hence attain greater  accuracy.    Another aspect that the test is designed to prove a more  advanced stage separation process. Agni-I used ullage motors  which powered the vehicle for the fraction of a second when  stage one burnt out and stage two ignited. In the case of  Agni-III, there is a split-second period in which stage two  ignites even before stage one has burnt out. This is a complex  business but it must be mastered to make any modern missile.    What happens now? The record of tests is not a happy one.  Technically four tests have taken place (including the aborted  one earlier in the year) in a span of five years of which two  have been failures.    Notwithstanding the current success, Agni is a technology  test-bed too fragile and complex for becoming a rugged  transportable weapons system.    The question that comes to mind is: Has the DRDO been too  ambitious with the Agni project? The level of innovation between  Agni-I and Agni-II was quite substantial. But there is the basic  question of the vehicle itself which has an SLV-3 first stage  and a modified Prithvi as the second.    This is all right as a test-bed but with two different  propellents it would be too cumbersome a missile. The DRDO could  have gone for a single-stage liquid propelled missile, something  not very modern and fashionable, but useful with its existing  technology.    Building a solid-propelled multi-stage missile means going  to  the ISRO for technology and that is not the easiest of processes  given the jealousy with which that organisation guards its  technology.    These and other issues need to be looked at in the coming  months. A programme which has been delayed some four years  already requires urgent attention now.</p>

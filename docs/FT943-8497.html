			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / People: Northern Rock Like father perhaps like son: Matt Ridley has been appointed as a non-executive director of Northern Rock, of which his father, Viscount Ridley, is a former chairman. Northern Rock will become the UK's 10th largest building society when its merger with North of England building society goes through later this year, but its board seems to be expanding even faster than its assets. As well as Ridley, who is a new appointment, it is acquiring three non-executive directors from North of England, taking the board total to 16 from its current 13. Ridley (left), 36, is a journalist who spent nine years at The Economist and was one of the nine candidates tipped last year for the editorship, which went to Bill Emmott. Appropriately for someone who will be expected to give an outside perspective on how the society is performing, he writes a column for the Sunday Telegraph called 'Down to earth'. (See Observer)</p>

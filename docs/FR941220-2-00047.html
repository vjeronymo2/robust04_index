(``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE is proposing amendments to Para. 203.02 of its Listed Company Manual (the ``Manual'') regarding the mailing of interim financial statements to shareholders of listed companies. The rule, as amended, would state that corporations that distribute interim reports to shareholders should distribute such reports to both registered and beneficial shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the Exchange requires listed companies to publish interim earnings statements as press reports, but does not require that such statements also be sent to shareholders. The practices of listed companies vary: Some companies mail these reports to all shareholders, some mail only to registered holders, and some companies do not mail interim reports at all. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various groups, including the American Society of Corporate Secretaries and the Securities Industry Association, have been reviewing this area in an attempt to achieve some uniformity among listed companies with respect to their dissemination of interim earnings reports to shareholders. In balancing the benefit of requiring that these reports be mailed to all shareholders, and the high cost of doing so, particularly as to ``street name'' holders, a compromise position developed. While companies would continue not to be required to mail interim reports to shareholders, if a company did conduct such a mailing, it was believed to be fair that such reports be mailed to both registered and beneficial holders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The compromise position is proposed as an amendment to Para. 203.02 of the Manual in the discussion of reporting and disclosure by listed companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

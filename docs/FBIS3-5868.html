			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary] Dear Friends: Today marked yet another great day  for the communications and transport sector as the Thang  Long-Noi Bai Expressway officially opened to traffic. It is  Vietnam's first six-lane, 14.56-km expressway. The expressway's  construction cost was 16 billion dong per kilometer. "Attending  the inauguration ceremony were Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet,  Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong, Hanoi party committee  Secretary Pham The Duyet, Communications and Transport Minister  Bui Danh Luu, and many other leading cadres of ministries and  sectors at the central level and in Hanoi."    The expressway was built according to international  standards  and is of the highest-ever quality in Vietnam.    At the ceremony, Comrade Le Ngoc Hoan, deputy communications  and transport minister, delivered a speech in which he said:    [Begin Le Ngoc Hoan recording] "The construction of the  Thang  Long-Noi Bai Expressway was completed thanks to the great  efforts of all the concerned agencies. The success of this  project was indeed possible due to the state's close guidance,  effective coordination between construction units, and  cooperation between the people of Hanoi and Vinh Phu Province.  The expressway will bring about great economic benefits because  it cuts almost 10 km from the trip to the center of Hanoi. It  will also help to beautify the gateway to the capital city to  welcome foreign visitors; facilitate the development of the  industrial-tourism-business complex in northern Hanoi, being  built to mark the 40th anniversary of Hanoi's liberation; and  facilitate economic development in the northern region.    Once again, I would like to express our gratitude to the  party and state leaders, the agencies concerned, the local  people, and the workers for their creativity and hard work in  successfully building this new project for the socialist  Vietnamese fatherland. It will contribute to fulfilling our  esteemed and beloved Uncle Ho's aspiration of making Vietnam a  more beautiful and prosperous nation." [end recording]</p>

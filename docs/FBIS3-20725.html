Pasic: "Four-Member Hostile Group Sentenced"] </F>   [Text] A three-member board of judges of the District Court  in Pec, presided over by Judge Dusan Micanovic, has pronounced  Afrim Mehmeti (age 38), Gazmend Muhadjeri (age 34), Mehmed Lekaj  (age 34), and Ibrahim Mehmeti (age 35), all from Pec, guilty of  the criminal act of threatening the territorial integrity. Afrim  Mehmeti was sentenced to five years, Gazmend Muhadjeri and  Mehmed Lekaj to four years, and Ibrahim Mehmeti to three years  of imprisonment.    During the proceedings, it was established that all of the  accused, from April to the end of September 1993, carried out  preparations for the secession of Kosovo and Metohija from the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They proceeded from the  assumption that the so-called Kacanik assembly, in declaring the  "Republic of Kosovo," had created the legal conditions for the  secession of Kosovo and Metohija from Yugoslavia. It was  established that the accused started forming illegal  paramilitary bodies and prepared the founding of paramilitary  units. The hostile group received instructions from the illegal  republic defense headquarters which acts within the framework of  the ministry of def ense of the "Republic of Kosovo." The group  intended to start armed action at an appropriate time and to  have Kosovo and Metohija secede by force from Yugoslavia.  According to information from the so-called republic  headquarters, the accused Afrim Mehmeti was appointed the  commander of the headquarters in Pec, and Muhadjeri and Lekaj  were appointed his deputies. One of the aforementioned deputies  was tasked with military action on rear lines and the other with  security. The fourth acccused, Ibrahim Mehmeti, had the specific  duty of finding reliable people for forming paramilitary units  in local communities.</p>

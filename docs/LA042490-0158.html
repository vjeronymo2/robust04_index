			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHAVEZ PLAYS PATIENT GAME WITH SIXTH-ROUND KNOCKOUT  </P> <P> Ernie Chavez figured he would have plenty of time to get a knockout in his  fight with Juan Alonzo Villa in the main event Monday night at the Irvine  Marriott.  </P> <P> Chavez seemed content to just throw a right jab here and a left hook there  until the sixth round. At that point, Chavez landed a pair of impressive lefts,  one to the body then another to the head, and Villa backed up to the ropes.  </P> <P> Chavez followed with some inside combinations and referee Ernie Swanks stopped  the fight at the 1-minute 48-second mark, which brought mostly cheers from the  crowd of 1,056.  </P> <P> "I got him with the left a few times earlier but I wasn't following up," Chavez  said. "I just felt confident that I would get him. I knew I had 10 rounds to do  it."  </P> <P> Chavez, who is 10-0 with six knockouts, including three in a row, dominated the  fight. He was more aggressive from the outset, and punished Villa with mostly  hard lefts and solid combinations.  </P> <P> Chavez jabbed Villa's chin almost at will.  </P> <P> In the fifth round, Villa of Los Angeles countered with a strong right that cut  Chavez's left eyelid.  </P> <P> Villa's best blow came in the third round, when he stunned Chavez with an  accidental head butt.  </P> <P> "It caught me right between the eyes and sort of stunned me," Chavez said. "He  hit me with a couple of good shots also, but nothing that made me see stars.  Mostly it (being hit) just made me mad."  </P> <P> An otherwise poor undercard was saved by an action-filled four-round fight  between Jose Castro of Westminster and Antonio Gonzales of Mexico City.  </P> <P> Castro and Gonzales, who both weigh 132 pounds, punched wildly for four rounds.  After the fight, which was a draw, fans threw several bills, including at least  one $50 and a couple of $20 bills, into the ring.  </P></p>

			<p>920606 FT  06 JUN 92 / Docklands move plan arouses resistance MORE than 1,000 civil servants from the Department of the Environment held an angry meeting in London yesterday to protest against plans to move them from Westminster to Docklands. The meeting, organised by four Civil Service unions, heard calls for a campaign - including industrial action - to stop the move. 'Hell, no, we won't go]' said one civil servant to loud applause, echoing the slogan of US draft dodgers during the Vietnam War. Another demanded that staff unwilling to move to Docklands should be found alternative work in other Whitehall departments. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said on Tuesday that Canary Wharf was among three sites under consideration for rehousing civil servants from its Marsham Street headquarters which are due for demolition. The other two are Harbour Exchange and East India Dock, both on the Isle of Dogs. Speakers at the protest meeting queried the economics of the move. Mr Paul Noon of the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Scientists challenged ministers to publish the figures that the government claimed showed relocation to Docklands was good value for the taxpayer. Another 3,000 civil servants are expected to join the Environment Department staff in Docklands, from, among others, transport and radiocommunications.</p>

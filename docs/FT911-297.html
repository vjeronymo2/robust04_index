			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / US team to advise on Soviet food distribution THE US will send a team of agriculture experts to Moscow this week to help solve the Soviet Union's food distribution problems. President George Bush's offer to provide advice on a distribution system follows a 45-minute telephone conversation between him and President Mikhail Gorbachev at the weekend. It comes as the US administration considers a Soviet request for a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 880m) agricultural export credit. White House officials have said that, while Mr Bush is sympathetic to easing any shortage of food on humanitarian grounds, he is worried by the lack of movement towards a market economy. A senior US national security adviser said last week that Mr Bush believed that what the Soviets needed most was technical assistance. 'There is almost certainly enough food in the Soviet Union. What's happening is it's not getting to the markets, partly because of transportation, partly because prices are so low that people are holding off the market, thinking that prices are going to go up.' The mission of farm experts could thus be a prelude to approval of some form of credits, which are backed by legislators from farming states. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader from the grain state of Kansas, said yesterday that the Senate should take up the export credit guarantee issue this week as long as there was provision for certain individual Soviet republics to participate. The experts' team will be lead by Mr Richard Crowder, under-secretary of agriculture, and will include Mr Ed Hewett, the leading Soviet specialist on the national security council staff. Mr Bush and Mr Gorbachev also discussed remaining arms control issues, notably the proposed agreement on reducing strategic arms and remaining problems over implementation of the treaty to reduce conventional forces in Europe, according to the White House.</p>

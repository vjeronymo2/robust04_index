			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> IKE TURNER SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS  </P> <P> Rhythm-and-blues musician Ike Turner, ex-husband of Grammy Award winning rock  star Tina Turner, was sentenced in Santa Monica today to four years in state  prison on his latest conviction in a string of cocaine arrests.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Robert Altman gave Turner, 58, a year's credit off his  sentence because of time already served in custody.  </P> <P> Turner will have to serve about 18 months before he is eligible for parole.  </P> <P> "He's been a drug abuser for 15, 20 years, but has never done any hard time  until now," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Mayer. "He's going straight to state  prison."  </P> <P> Turner was convicted Jan. 16 of driving under the influence of cocaine and  being under the influence of the drug. Jurors, however, deadlocked on charges  of possessing cocaine and transporting the narcotic. The four charges stemmed  from Turner's arrest in West Hollywood in May, 1989.  </P></p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Action on modem imports urged A UK-based electronics manufacturer is to press the government to outlaw foreign-made computer communications equipment which has not passed UK safety tests, Alan Cane writes. Dataflex Design, a leading modem manufacturer, said yesterday that it would begin importing and selling 'grey' modems - those not passed by the watchdog overseeing the safety of telephone network equipment - on March 1 unless the government took immediate action. It would continue to sell approved modems. Some 30,000 modems, which convert computer messages for transmission down a telephone line, are sold in the UK each month. It is not illegal to sell 'grey' modems, but attaching non-approved equipment to the telephone network is a breach of the Telecommunications Act. Sales of non-approved modems from the US and Asia, which cost much less than products put through exhaustive UK testing procedures, have risen sharply recently, leading UK manufacturers last year to form a defensive lobby. The government agreed that, over a number of years, legislation would be introduced outlawing non-approved modems. This is not fast enough for the manufacturers.</p>

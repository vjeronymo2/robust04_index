			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen: "Irresponsible Sex Will Be </F> Punished"]    [Excerpts] At its weekly chairmen's meeting yesterday, the  coalition government gave Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social  Democrat) the go-ahead to find a way to prevent HIV-infected  individuals from going unpunished if they practice unsafe sex,  thereby exposing their partners to the lethal danger of AIDS.    Inger Stilling Pedersen of the Christian People's Party and  Bjarne Orum of the Radical Liberals did not quite agree over  when and how severely unsafe sex should be punished. But they  did agree that an HIV-positive person who knowingly engages in  sex without protection should be punished. [passage omitted]    "We want to end this wanton recklessness. This is not  criminalizing the AIDS disease," Olsen said after the meeting.    Consequently, he has instructed his officials to determine  how the penal code can be changed without having HIV-positive  persons and AIDS-infected people in general criminalized by the  politicians.    Decriminalization was the motivation for Folketing's  abolition of the law on sexually transmitted diseases in 1988.  At the same time, however, it also eliminated the basis for  punishing reckless sexual acts.</p>

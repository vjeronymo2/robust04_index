			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, NSCC's fee structure relating to correction fees is being amended to reflect that correction capabilities are being accelerated in conformity with comparison capabilities. These fee changes conform all bond correction fees to the fees implemented in connection with municipal securities transaction processing in that participants will be charged for supplemental input on or after T+1. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Currently, NSCC charges participants for supplemental input relating to corporate bond and UIT transactions on or after T+2. In addition, the bond system correction fees for ``don't know'' and ``questioned trade'' input is being deleted because NSCC no longer processes such transactions. The proposed rule change also makes certain conforming changes and deletions to NSCC's Procedures in order to reflect greater uniformity in NSCC's bond comparison system and to eliminate certain language which has become obsolete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a detailed description of NSCC's correction fees for municipal securities transactions, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34193 (June 10, 1994), 59 FR 31284 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;08] (notice of filing and immediate effectiveness of a proposed rule change modifying NSCC's fee schedule for correction fees). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F). <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Section 17A(b)(3)(A) requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that the proposed changes to NSCC's comparison procedures should help achieve higher rates of trade comparison at earlier points in the comparison process and thus help increase certainty and reduce risk in the clearance and settlement of corporate bond and UIT transactions. Use of NSCC's bond comparison system should significantly improve the comparison rate for corporate bonds, baby bonds, and unit investment trusts and should facilitate moving from a five business day settlement cycle to a three business day settlement cycle. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Moreover, the Commission believes that by expanding the bond comparison system to include corporate bond, baby bond, and new issue transaction processing, NSCC is aiding in the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On October 6, 1993, the Commission adopted Rule 15c6&hyph;1 under the Act, which establishes three business days after the trade date instead of five business days as the standard settlement timeframe for most broker-dealer transactions. The rule becomes effective June 1, 1995. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33023 (October 6, 1993), 58 FR 52891 (release adopting Rule 15c6&hyph;1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC's fee structure will be amended with regard to correction fees to reflect that correction capabilities will be accelerated in conformity with comparison capabilities. The Commission believes that these changes to NSCC's fee structure are appropriate and in conformity with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act which requires the rules of a clearing agency to provide for equitable allocation of reasonable fees among its participants. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(D) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing so that NSCC can begin utilizing the new comparison procedures for trades executed on October 21, 1994. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed rule change because accelerated approval will allow NSCC to implement the new procedures as scheduled. Additionally, the Commission does not anticipate that it will receive any significant negative comment on the proposed rule change in view of the fact that no comments have been received to date by the Commission or NSCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly with Sections 17A(b)(3)(F) and 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;16) be, and hereby is, approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

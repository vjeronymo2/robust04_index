			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Banque Hervet in black Banque Hervet, the French retail bank, recovered to return profits in the first half of the year of FFr28m (Dollars 5.3m) compared with losses of FFr361m in the previous corresponding term. Hervet was scheduled last year to be sold by the government as part of its privatisation programme, but the plan was shelved this spring pending a recapitalisation. The bank said the privatisation plans were still suspended, although a recapitalisation agreed with shareholders was completed in June this year. Hervet reported provisions down substantially and said all of its operations has been profitable except Hervet Credit, specialising in property financing. Its solvency ratio stood at 10.5 per cent, against a regulatory minimum of 8 per cent.</p>

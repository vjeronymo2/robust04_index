			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Arts: A little light music - Ronald Crichton visits Paris and Nantes in search of comic opera IN THE days after Christmas Paris looks surprisingly empty, except for queues - queues for theatres, big stores and above all for major art exhibitions. On New Year's Eve the queues spread to food shops and not, you may be sure, because of shortages. At one famous traiteur, not a mile from the Madeleine, staff were offering champagne to queuers. Inside, the assistants were disobliging enough to qualify for automatic British citizenship. There was however a difference. Their impatience is not caused by ignorance or lack of interest but by unconcealed feelings of superiority. In and around the Champs-Elysees, the trees glisten after dark with ropes of tiny white lights - simple but magically effective. The Southern end of the Madeleine is shrouded in mysterious, pearly blue, but I was disappointed to find no special illuminations this year for the old Opera, the Palais Garnier. Indoors, the house was full and well sprinkled with children for a Saturday matinee of the ballet Romeo and Juliet in Nureyev's 1984 version, resplendent with Patrick Dupond, Monique Loudieres, Eric Vu An and Yann Bridart. A centenary offering to Prokofiev, no doubt, but I must confess that, coming back to it after some time, the score as a whole does not wear terribly well. Lovers of that splendid building will be delighted to hear that culture minister Jack Lang has announced the completion of the redecoration and considerable enlargement of the West wing, where the Opera's mouth-watering museum collections have long been housed in cramped conditions. They will now be displayed in showcases specially designed by Richard Peduzzi. The space, with larger reading rooms and better facilities for temporary exhibitions, will presumably embrace Garnier's gaunt Egyptian staircase at the foot of which one half-expects to discover the crouching form of Aida. At the Opera-Comique down the boulevard, where formerly a fine line of distinction existed between comic opera and operetta, the barriers are down with a vengeance. The Christmas show was not even an operetta but a twenties-style revue by Patrice Thomere and Alain Lagarde, punningly called L'as-tu revue? Not, as you might think, a pure nostalgia trip but a fantasy on 1920's entertainment themes with a few old songs. The new ones in the old style and the linking passages are by Jean-Michel Dalmase. Little evocation of stars of the past - not a sight of Maurice Chevalier's straw hat. The only Josephine Baker number I identified was sung by a Nordic-type blonde, Arielle Dombasle. Built around the personality and versatile talents of the indomitable, inextinguishable, veteran baritone Gabriel Bacquier, smoothly directed by Olivier Benezech in decors by Lagarde and brilliant costumes by Christian Lacroix, eye and ear were agreeably entertained. It was nice to hear the music-hall song about a wooden leg which Stravinsky used in the fairground music in Petrushka. Otherwise big musicals loom large, with West Side Story at the Chatelet, Les Miserables at the Mogador and Peter Pan at the Casino de Paris. To find a real French comic opera I went to Nantes, where at the handsome theatre-promoted-to-opera-house queening it over the Place Graslin, a stone and stucco circus with streets radiating star-wise (imagine a theatre in such a commanding position in a British city]) there is a new production of Messager's La Basoche. Messager was a conductor of great distinction, responsible among other good deeds for the first performance of Debussy's Pelleas. He was also a composer of light music of the finest quality. La Basoche appeared at the Opera-Comique in 1890 and remained in the repertory for years. D'Oyly Carte staged it in London as The King of the Students at the short-lived English Opera House,where it succeeded Sullivan's Ivanhoe. The Basoches were student associations traditionally granted some licence: they elected their own 'king' and gave performances of satirical and no doubt scurrilous plays. One of their 'kings' was the poet Clement Marot, who in the opera (Albert Carre's libretto is ingenious but complicated) catches the eye of the young English Princes Mary, sister of Henry VIII, coming to Paris as the second wife of Louis XII. Being a lively young woman she arrives a day early, incognita, to see Paris for herself. One result of their meeting is that Marot's wife Colette has to be passed off as the Princess. When the truth comes out Mary is dismayed, Marot being a more attractive proposition than the ageing genuine King (in real life, Louis died soon after the marriage, leaving Mary free to return home as Duchess of Suffolk). The music is light as air, with the subtle harmonic touches Messager managed so well, equally happy in pastiche 16th century songs and in ensembles with an unexpected whiff here and there of Die Meistersinger - Messager, a fine Wagner conductor, had recently enjoyed that work at Bayreuth. One is grateful to Nantes for rescuing La Basoche, now surely due to join the rediscovered Fortunio in the repertory, even though the production by Philippe Arlaud is not very distinguished. Two performers stood out - the stylish, experienced Jean-Louis Soumagnas as Matre Roland, Marot's rival for the student kingship, and Sophie Fournier as Marot's wife Colette. Her singing was sometimes insecure but she perfectly caught the note of warm-hearted rural innocence with a touch of slyness. As the Duc de Longueville, sent to accompany Mary to France, Vincent Le Texier showed why 'Elle m'aime]' became the opera's best-known number, but elsewhere forced the comic note relentlessly. Conductor Jean-Louis Forestier's feeling for tempi was sure. Perhaps the grandly-named Orchestre Philharmonique des Pays de la Loire slightly underrated the difficulty of accompanying comic opera at this level.</p>

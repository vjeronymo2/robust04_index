			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Ashdown steps up 'dialogue' campaign MR PADDY Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday stepped up his campaign to expand 'dialogue and debate' across British political parties while keeping his party's 'distinct' identity. He urged Liberal Democrat councillors at a conference in Eastbourne, East Sussex, to work with other parties 'who might share in our agenda for reform' on local and national political stages. He said: 'We must create the forum, not owned or dominated by any party, in which the exchange of new thinking can take place and in which the battle of ideas on which our movement will depend can be organised and won.' Mr Ashdown, reflecting pressure from his party's MPs not to consider deals with either Labour or the Tories, said the Liberal Democrats had to build on their identity in local, national and European elections. The party had to show 'that there is a new sort of politics which can be built in Britain out of the barren soil of a system which is dominated by the Conservative party'.</p>

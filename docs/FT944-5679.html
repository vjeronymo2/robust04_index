			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Management: 'World-class' delusion of multinationals Two of the surest signs of a well-managed company are its awareness of its shortcomings and readiness to be open about them. Witness, for instance, the degree of self-criticism that frequently emanates from 3M, Canon, Federal Express and other organisations that actually practise the fashionable creed of constant corporate renewal. At the other extreme are organisations that, by failing to make adequate use of competitive 'benchmarking' - or by refusing to believe its damning results - delude themselves that they are at the 'leading edge', when the truth is very different. An IBM-London Business School study published last week* found that only one in 50 manufacturing sites in four European countries is genuinely 'world class', although three-quarters believe they can compete with the best of their international rivals. Such myopia is more than dangerous - it can be positively suicidal. Between these two extremes lies a sizeable body of companies that have some sense of their competitive deficiencies but do not realise their full dimensions, and are not doing enough to rectify them. This is all too evident from a broader study of 'international competitive capabilities' in 12 leading multinationals around the world, which is about to be published**. It concludes, among many other things, that most multinationals are far less globally-minded than they think they are - their rhetoric is dangerously ahead of reality. They are also much less customer-focused and organisationally flexible than is necessary to win in global markets. Not all of them have yet realised that operational excellence in total quality and customer service is no longer a source of sustainable advantage, but merely a qualification for competing. To make matters worse, many of their attempts to create continuous corporate regeneration and 'transformation' are being hampered by a 'trust gap' between leaders and employees. The survey covered nearly 1,500 managers of two dozen nationalities working around the world for American, Asian and European multinationals such as AT&amp;T, British Airways, BHP, Daimler-Benz, Electricite de France, Fiat, Kao of Japan, Siemens and Ssangyong, a Korean conglomerate. The survey, called Champions of Change, was carried out by the Massachusetts-based International Consortium for Executive Development Research, a multinational think-tank. Its findings are to be published jointly with Gemini Consulting, which sponsored the research. But the trenchant conclusions are very much those of the consortium's executive director, Douglas Ready. Respondents were given a list of 34 'organisational capabilities' and 45 'leadership competences', and asked to rank them in two ways: in order of their importance to competitiveness; and in terms of organisation's current performance in those areas. This enabled the researchers to identify performance gaps, as well as discrepancies in managerial attitudes. Ready's report is most scathing about the discrepancies that surround the issue of globalisation. The senior executives in the survey all emphasised, in what he calls a 'relentless, almost numbing' fashion, that change and uncertainty are being caused primarily by the increasingly global competitive environment. Yet they rated their company's effectiveness at developing a 'global orientation or mindset' last out of the 34 organisational capabilities. Ready is equally concerned that no globally-related factor was ranked by the respondents as one of the five most important organisational capabilities or leadership competences; these were all more general. The importance and effectiveness of items such as managing a culturally diverse workforce, alliance management, living outside one's home country, and managing transnational teams, were all rated relatively low. As Ready asks, if these particular companies, already in the thick of the global battle, are so 'conflicted about the implications of being global', as he puts it, what does that imply for those just embarking on globalisation? One probable cause of the problem is what Ready calls a 'cavernous gap' between what chief executives say is important and what they actually value and reward. In other respects, too, the survey found that most organisations are doing a poor job of linking performance to a range of their own strategic priorities. However, middle managers of most nationalities rated a global mindset as more important than did senior managers. So there may be hope for the next generation of leaders, although for some companies this will come too late. On many other aspects in the survey, Ready says its ratings of importance versus effectiveness identified not just the usual performance gap but a yawning gulf. Particularly alarming, he says, was the perceived lack of effectiveness in the two items cited by respondents as most critical to competitiveness: organisational adaptability and customer focus. On the 'trust gap' that bedevils many companies, the study found that one in five respondents said that 'instilling trust between our leaders and our workers' was one of the top five requirements for creating organisational effectiveness. Yet it was rated 33rd in terms of actual effectiveness. As on so many other counts in the survey, wish and reality were miles apart. But at least the companies' openness to outside scrutiny has helped them face that fact. *Made in Europe. From IBM UK. Tel: 081-575 7700. Pounds 99. **From Francis J.

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE HEIGHTENS CONCERN ABOUT BUILDINGS' SAFETY  </P> <P> As flames and smoke poured from the grimy nine-story RK Building on Tuesday,  Maria Mazariejo watched in horror from across South Los Angeles Street as a  woman in the burning building came close to jumping out of a window.  </P> <P> The woman was saved by firefighters, but Mazariejo, a clothing inspector who  works on the 10th floor of another garment district building, said she and  co-workers were left shaken by how close they were to witnessing a tragedy.  </P> <P> More to the point, they saw themselves in that woman's place and feared the  same could happen to them one day.  </P> <P> "We're going to talk to the owner about our business next week," Mazariejo  said. "We're going to tell him we want more protection."  </P> <P> Throughout the hundreds of sewing factories and clothing shops that pack the 20  square blocks of the garment district, fear of a disastrous fire always lingers  in the back of people's minds, workers said Tuesday.  </P> <P> They speak of buildings without sprinkler systems, adequate escape routes or,  as in the case of the RK Building, without fire alarms.  </P> <P> Garment workers who fled the nine-story building said that amid the screams and  cries for help, they never heard an alarm. Fire officials said there was none.  </P> <P> "It makes you mad," said Selina Ko, who works on the ninth floor of the  building. "We heard nothing, no alarm, not a thing."  </P> <P> "Just look at those buildings," said Renee Cohen, who owns a shop across the  street from the RK Building. "They look like hell. For fire, nobody should feel  comfortable in one of them."  </P> <P> By most accounts, the RK Building is no different from many of others in the  garment district that workers contend could be dangerous in a fire.  </P> <P> "What we see here is pretty typical of the kinds of problems we commonly see  throughout the city in commercial buildings like this," said Assistant Fire  Chief Tony Ennis.  </P> <P> Bob Gershon, owner of a building across the street, said he believes most  owners are conscientious about maintaining their buildings.  </P> <P> "These buildings are worth too much money," he said.  </P> <P> Rosalind Alfieri, who manages a building at 9th and Main streets, said owners  are constantly upgrading their buildings, but that it takes time and money to  bring them up to modern safety codes.  </P> <P> She said the Fire Department recently notified the owners of her building that  they will have to submit plans for a fire protection system in the next year.  </P> <P> "We have to enclose the stairwells, elevator doors, install a sprinkler system,  new lighting system and electrified exit signs," she said. "It's a  multimillion-dollar operation."  </P> <P> Those are measures that some wish had been taken at the RK Building years ago.  </P> <P> "If you work here, you know how really dangerous it is," said Chris Jong,  manager of a sewing factory on the seventh and eighth floors of the RK  Building. "I talked with employees about starting work again. If you look at  their faces, you can see they are not coming back. They are really scared."  </P></p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Towards a monetary union Sir, In the article 'Debate on Emu timing hots up' (November 28) it is said that, according to me, 'it is already too late to contemplate Emu starting in 1997' because of the long period required in the private sector to make the necessary preparations. In fact what I have argued in a number of reports is that it is too late for the single currency - replacing all national currencies - to come into operation in 1997. It is possible for Stage 3 of Emu to start without the single currency. There are three possibilities: Exchange rates are locked and nothing is done to introduce the single currency; At the other extreme we have a 'big bang' where the single currency replaces all participating national currencies simultaneously; Or we have a 'dual-currency' approach in which the single currency is used - for some purposes - alongside participating national currencies. The 'big bang' is not feasible for both technical and political reasons in 1997 but stage 3 of Emu could - from a technical point of view, leaving aside economic convergence and political considerations - be possible in 1997. I feel it is important to make this distinction between the start of stage 3 and the introduction of a single currency quite clear.

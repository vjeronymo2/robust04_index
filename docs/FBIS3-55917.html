But as we belong to the West and  not to the East, we want to get closer as soon as possible",  Lithuanian ambassador at NATO Adolfas Venckus told a Polish  daily "Rzeczpospolita" on Monday [10 January].    Venckus said in the interview that the Baltic states were  ready to give over one battalion to the European peacekeeping  forces, were proposing centre of medical training, were ready to  participate in NATO military exercises, paid a lot of attention  to learning of foreign languages by senior military personnel.    "Our wish to join NATO is not directed against Russia. We  would like to have the best possible relations with that country  but some fears appeared after the elections in Russia and  statements of Vladimir Zhirinovsky concerning the Baltic  states", he said.    Asked how Lithuania would react if Poland was the first to  join NATO, Venckus said that "Lithuania is not harmed by the  success of others. But, if Poland offered the Baltic states to  go to NATO together, we would be very happy".    Lithuania and Albania are the only states that have formally  applied NATO for membership.</p>

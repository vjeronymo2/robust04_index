			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Hard questions from the BIS AS BEFITS an organisation controlled by central bankers, the Bank for International Settlements is normally not an aggressive international watchdog. But this year's annual report barks loudly. Doubts about the European Community's plans for economic and monetary union have, for example, dismayed a few of the central bankers present at the BIS annual meeting. But Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the BIS general manager, and the staff are to be congratulated on their honesty. Otherwise, what is the point of such reports? Emu is not the only topic on which the report has controversial things to say. In a subtle discussion of financial problems, it insists that 'the benefits of deregulation and financial innovation are worth striving for. They are not, however, a free good and the costs of attaining them were underestimated.' The BIS report points to a long string of financial disasters: the developing country debt crisis; the collapse of the US savings and loans institutions; the global stock market crash of 1987; and the excessive lending both for highly leveraged transactions and for real estate. 'The changes in the financial environment helped to make such collective errors of judgment more likely,' it concludes, 'and their implications more serious and widespread internationally.' This dismal performance poses at least four challenges to the authorities: to improve prudential regulation; to create system-wide checks and balances; to improve crisis management; and to reconsider the boundary between market discipline, on the one hand, and government involvement, on the other. Greater market discipline is needed to deal with the vagaries of a financial system unduly underpinned by the state. But shifting the balance is, notes the report, 'no easy task'. The BIS is still more outspoken on trade policies. 'Most industrial countries have in recent years strayed further from the free trade ideals they profess to uphold while many developing countries have taken decisive measures to open their economies.' This has, indeed, been one of the most deeply depressing features of the world economy. The BIS is entirely right, even if repetition of this truth can be boring. Where the BIS cannot be boring is on Emu, the topic of the moment. The BIS evidently feels that EC governments deserve the egg on their faces. 'Having managed to spring the programme on a largely unprepared public', it remarks, governments 'are now faced with debate and dissension very late in the day'. The BIS staff evidently believes that such debate and dissension are deserved. The report notes that members of the ERM have already given priority to their exchange rate objectives 'even though this meant accepting tighter policies than were considered desirable on domestic grounds'. Would Emu solve the problems? Not necessarily. The report casts doubt on the assumption that a currency union would achieve price stability, noting, instead, that the objective 'is inherently vulnerable to any faltering of the political consensus in support of it'. It points to exchange rate policy as Emu's Achilles' heel. It warns that the agreement to link convergence criteria with a rigid timetable suggests 'some risk that political considerations could play a role in the application of standards'. The report also fears that efforts to meet those standards 'could render exchange rate and, perhaps, budgetary policy in some countries too rigid in the next few years'. Moreover, 'the possibility that large shocks with asymmetric effects will occur in future cannot be ruled out. Conceivably, financial pressures on exchange rates could increase as the effect of recent liberalisation of exchange rates is felt more fully.' The BIS points to the regional problems of existing currency unions and to the case for larger fiscal transfers than seem likely. As if all this were not enough, it also worries about premature pressures for real wage equalisation. This watchdog is barking loudly. Government may be inclined to shrug its shoulders. Given the source of the warning, it should think carefully before doing so.</p>

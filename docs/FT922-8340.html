			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation data fail to spur Dow to 3,400 Wall Street GOOD inflation news and another fall in bond yields failed to boost US stock prices yesterday, as investors passed up the opportunity to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 3,400, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow was off 12.46 at 3,385.12. At one point the index was more than 20 points down, but a late rally halved the mid-afternoon losses. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.20 to 416.29, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 3.17 to 583.96. Turnover on the New York SE was 193m shares. The day's inflation news - a 0.2 per cent rise in April producer prices - was well received. The increase in prices was slightly smaller than expected, and some analysts said fresh evidence that inflation was not a threat to the economy left the door open for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further. That the inflation numbers, and the subsequent fall in bond yields, failed to provide a boost to prices was primarily due to technical factors. Dealers said that a short-term ceiling on prices had been set at 3,400 on the Dow, and profit-taking emerged as soon as the index threatened to breach that level. Citicorp dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 18 7/8 in heavy trading after the banking group offered to exchange newly issued common shares for all of its second and third series adjustable rate preferred shares. General Mills put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 on news that its three continental European snacks businesses would be merging with three similar operations owned by Pepsico, which lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 35 7/8 . News Corp rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 in the wake of a turnround in the Australian parent group's fiscal third-quarter earnings. The Limited fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 21 3/4 after disappointing the market with first-quarter net profits of Dollars 51.5m, barely higher than a year ago in spite of enjoying a one-off pre-tax gain of Dollars 9m. On the American Stock Exchange, Sbarro plunged Dollars 11, or almost a third, to Dollars 27 after Morgan Stanley cut its earnings estimate and investment ratings for the stock in the wake of the company's poor first-quarter performance. On the Nasdaq market, Midlantic jumped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 10 1/4 in turnover of 3.5m shares after senior executives from the regional bank holding company were reported to have told analysts in New York that the company anticipated a further decline in its problem loans. In the same sector, Star Banc moved forward Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 37 and Fifth Third Bancorp declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 on reports that institutional investors were putting pressure on Star Banc to consider a bid from its rival Ohio banking group. Canada TORONTO stocks tumbled from midday highs to end flat as bullish sentiment over the slight rise in the US producer price index waned late in the day. The downturn in New York muted growing optimism that has been seen in the Toronto market over the last few days. Traders noted, however, that Toronto may continue to outpace New York as it has over the last two sessions. The composite index was up just 0.7 at 3,427.9 after reaching 3,444.8. Volume totalled 26.06m shares. Advances ran neck and neck with declines, finishing at 286 each.</p>

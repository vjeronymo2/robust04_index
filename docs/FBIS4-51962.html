			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- Ham Sok-yo, who lives in  Ongjin County, South Hwanghae Province, sent letters to various  organisations of South Korea and her brother Ham Se-hwan, who  refused to be converted despite his long prison life, with  regard to his repatriation to the North.    In a letter dated May 4 to the headquarters for the  promotion  of the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners Kim In-so  and Ham Se-hwan to the North, the Human Rights Committee of the  National Council of Christian Churches, the Bar Association for  Democratic Society and the Family Movement for Realizing  Democracy in South Korea, she said she believed no one would  dare block her brother's return home because these organisations  are making much effort for his repatriation and the  international law provides for the return of prisoners of war,  though the South Korean authorities take issue with his  guerrilla activities and "acquirement of (South Korean)  nationality" [word indistinct] fetched way.    She denounced the rude behavior of the South Korean  authorities in refusing to comply with the just demand of the  Red Cross Society of the North for the return of Ham Se-hwan who  was taken prisoner while in action during the last Korean war.    She continued:    "My brother is not willing to live in the South and cannot  live there.    "He has not abandoned his principle despite all manner of  persecution and has asked South Korean and international Red  Cross organisations to help him return to the Northern half of  the country. This is because my brother Ham Se-hwan is  earnestly hoping to come back to the homeland where his family  and relatives including me, his sister, live.    "I wish I could see once the face of my youngest brother,  whom I raised on my back, before I leave this world. Please  understand the anxious feelings of me, an old woman above 80 who  is eagerly waiting for her brother to return home."    In a letter dated April 25 to her brother, she informed him  of her happy life in her eighties, without any inconvenience  under the care of the country as well as of the lives of the  relatives.    She denounced the South Korean authorities for subjecting  her  brother to 34 years of imprisonment and all sorts of sufferings  in a place away from home, without kith and kin for the mere  reason that he refused to be converted ideologically.    She said:    "The day will surely come when we brother and sister will  meet because efforts are being made here and in the South by  kind-hearted people for your repatriation.    "I ask you to actively fight in order to return to the DPRK  at an early date."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 30 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen indicated Friday [29 April] that China is not  well-informed on North Korea's nuclear development program  despite its friendly ties with Pyongyang, Japanese officials  said.    Qian told a Japanese delegation led by House of Councillors  President Bunbei Hara that China does not know for sure for what  purpose North Korea is trying to develop nuclear facilities, the  officials said. Qian said he cannot determine whether North  Korea wants to use the facilities peacefully or develop nuclear  weapons, or to use the nuclear issue as a means of improving  relations with the United States, according to the Japanese  officials.    North Korea has been accused of trying to develop a nuclear  arsenal and of refusing to accept full inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Qian also said that as the North Korean nuclear issue has  had  effects on Japan and South Korea particularly, China will try to  find a solution through dialogue, the officials said. The  foreign minister, noting Pyongyang's dissatisfaction with  China's establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea,  said Beijing set up ties with Seoul so as not to isolate North  Korea, the officials said.    Meanwhile in Vienna, an IAEA spokesman on Friday denied  reports from South Korea that the international nuclear watchdog  has shown willingness to compromise with the North on the  contents of inspections in a letter to Pyongyang. The IAEA has  not changed its stance of not sending any inspectors unless  Pyongyang agrees to full inspections, the spokesman said.    According to the reports from South Korea, the IAEA informed  North Korea it would send inspectors on condition that an  important radiation measurement be conducted at a key nuclear  facility at a later date.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Daf delays recovery plan TALKS aimed at devising a long-awaited recovery plan for Daf, the loss-making Dutch truck maker, ended inconclusively last night but efforts were due to be resumed today, writes Ronald van de Krol in Eindhoven. Daf was due to unveil a recovery programme yesterday afternoon but its plans were thrown into disarray by hitches between the four parties involved - Daf, its bankers, the Dutch state and Belgium's Flemish regional government. The recovery plan is forecast to include fresh financing for the company.</p>

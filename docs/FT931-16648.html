			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Observer: Swap shop It may not surprise the cognoscenti of the art world to see Hugues Joffre, the 34-year-old Frenchman who headed Sotheby's contemporary art department in London, resurface as senior director of 20th century pictures at arch rival Christie's. But such a switch at this level is highly unusual. Both auction houses live in dread of experts, together with their clients and contacts, being nabbed by the competition. Indeed, there is supposed to be a gentlemanly 'no poaching' agreement. A few years ago Sotheby's so dominated modern art that Christie's was thinking of abandoning its London sales in this market. But now Christie's is on a high, and claims to out-sell Sotheby's in post-1870 pictures. So the arrival of Joffre has caused some turbulence. Tobias Mayer, at 29 one of the firm's young high-flyers, has already jumped ship and can now be found heading contemporary art at Sotheby's. At this rate the world's two biggest auction houses could find themselves juggling, like football clubs, with an expensive transfer market in top players. Somehow one senses that they have too much to lose for this to happen.</p>

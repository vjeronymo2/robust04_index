			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene by anchorman </F> Jan Becaus in the studio -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Becaus] Mr. Dehaene, the city  of Kigali has been almost entirely taken [by the Rwandan  Patriotic Front, RPF]. Rwanda is about to have a completely new  regime, that of the rebels. What will your government's  attitude be toward this new regime?    [Dehaene] I do not believe that we can anticipate how the  situation will shape up. I believe that, in a country such as  Rwanda with two tribes, only a negotiated settlement will offer  a long-term solution. I believe, however, that it is still too  early to comment on this. We have to continue our efforts,  together with the United Nations, to find a negotiated  settlement, just like we did for the Arusha agreement.    [Becaus] Professor Doom of Ghent University has reproached  the government for not not having an Africa policy, that it is  acting like a fire brigade in Africa. What is your reaction to  this?    [Dehaene] I have much respect for professors who give advice  after the fact. I believe that today, as a result of the  president's killing, we are facing a new situation which we  could not have anticipated. We indeed are facing a new  situation, and, as we told the parliamentary commission earlier  this week, together with Parliament we will have to define a new  policy, or at least adapt our policy to the new situation. This  applies both to our African policy in general and to the way in  which we will organize our African development aid. Given the  current sensitivity and emotions, we have to avoid making rash  decisions which will have a long-term consequences. I believe  that, in the long term, we will have to continue our aid to and  development work in Rwanda and in Africa, although today we can  provide only humanitarian aid. But we will have to examine this  more carefully once we understand the new situation in Rwanda,  and then make decsions based on a long-term perspective.</p>

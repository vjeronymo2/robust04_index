			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Subpoena for White House over aide's suicide Mr Robert Fiske, the special counsel appointed to investigate President Bill Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater financial affair, yesterday issued a sweeping subpoena to the White House for documents relating to the death last year of Mr Vincent Foster, deputy White House counsel. Mr Fiske's investigation is reported already to have confirmed the US Park Police's conclusion that Mr Foster's death was a suicide, but the subpoena appeared to be intended to determine whether any documents were taken from his office after his death. Mr Lloyd Cutler, the White House counsel, promised to cooperate 'fully and promptly' with the subpoena, and some documents are expected to be handed over by Tuesday. Separate allegations against Mr Clinton, meanwhile, were surrounded in mystery yesterday after a lawyer who had threatened to file a lawsuit accusing the president of sexual harassment did not appear at a press conference he had scheduled in Little Rock. The White House has denied any encounter with Ms Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, but has hired a prominent Washington lawyer to defend Mr Clinton. Ms Jones accused Mr Clinton at a press conference earlier this year of making sexual advances to her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991. A senior White House official said Mr Fiske's subpoena requested all documents written by, sent to or referring to Mr Foster, but that the special counsel's priority was to examine all the files that were in his office when he died, and find out where they went. Besides his other White House duties, Mr Foster had worked on some personal legal matters for the Clintons, including their involvement in Whitewater, an Arkansas real estate company in which they invested in partnership with the owner of a now bankrupt savings and loan institution.</p>

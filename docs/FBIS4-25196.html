			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sally Blyth, political correspondent and Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] Britain has effectively issued an ultimatum to  China, warning that there has to be an agreement on the future  of Hong Kong's military sites by the end of this month.    The deadline has angered Chinese officials who said they  would not tolerate any suggestion of a British ultimatum. "We  think we have been too lenient towards all sorts of British  requirements in this regard," a mainland official said last  night. "In principle, Britain should hand over all the sites to  us."    British sources said that unless an accord was endorsed by  the next full meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group  [JLG], likely to be held by the end of this month, many of the  military facilities to be built for the People's Liberation Army  would not be completed by 1997. There are fears that without an  agreement on the military land, construction projects, in  particular the Central-Wan Chai reclamation, might have to be  put on hold.    Britain is aiming for a settlement before the Legislative  Council's summer recess next month. Officials say this is  dictated by "practical considerations", such as the finance  committee having to approve any funds required to build a new  naval base for China. Negotiations are scheduled to start this  week between experts from China and Britain. Talks have been  under way for seven years.    A party of Chinese experts arrived in the territory last  night to prepare for the meeting expected to be held this  afternoon at the venue for the JLG meetings. The dozen  delegates will hold a meeting this morning to discuss whether  there is a need to meet their British counterparts this  afternoon.    A British JLG official refused to confirm the meeting but  said informal contacts between the two countries had been going  on.    An agreement seemed likely last month but the British said  China changed its position by making further demands. China, in  turn, has accused Britain of playing "propaganda tricks".    "Nothing was settled after last month's meeting," a Chinese  official said. "We have never given Britain a definite yes to  their offer. We only said we needed to report back to a higher  authority. Then, when we finally responded to the British, they  said we were making new demands. What a trick. They probably  just want us to accept whatever is on the list. As to which  sites and how many of them should be passed to the Hong Kong  government for redevelopment, it is purely a matter between the  People's Liberation Army [PLA] and Hong Kong's future  government. Look at how many sites the British army has  occupied and look at how many the Chinese PLA will be able to  get."    He complained that Britain was willing to give China only 30  per cent of the residential blocks available. "This is also  despite the fact that all expenditure for the PLA garrison to be  stationed in Hong Kong will be borne by the Chinese Government,"  he said.    He then criticised Britain for making public some unresolved  matters in a bid to create a false impression that the two  countries were close to a deal.    It is already known that the PLA will take over The Prince  of  Wales Building and the land to the west of it but Britain needs  agreement from China to redevelop the naval base which forms  part of the reclamation project.    China was furious when the government unilaterally announced  that it was relocating the British naval base to Stonecutters  Island.    It would be almost impossible to persuade private developers  to build on the site, even if it was filled in, without an  agreement with Beijing.    In all, it is estimated the Government would stand to lose  more than $1bn from the military sites it is hoping to sell off.</p>

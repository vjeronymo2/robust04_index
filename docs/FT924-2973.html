At the same time, the Institute of Directors launched a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of over-regulation and to promote measures to reduce burdens on business. Mr Peter Morgan, institute director-general, said that small companies in particular faced a 'systems overload' when dealing with regulations. Mr Hamilton told an IoD seminar that government departments should complete their reviews of business legislation within a few weeks. They would then decide how to reduce the burden.</p>

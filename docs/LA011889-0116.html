			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUIT SETTLED, CLEARING WAY FOR IRVINE COAST PROJECT  </P> <P> With a trial about to start Tuesday, attorneys for the Irvine Co. and the  Laguna Conservancy reached a settlement that allows the county's biggest  landowner to proceed with development of the Irvine Coast.  </P> <P> Last spring attorneys for the Laguna Conservancy sued in Superior Court to  invalidate a bargain struck between the company and the Orange County Board of  Supervisors that protects the company's 9,432-acre Irvine Coast project in  return for company financing of new roads and public facilities, including a  new sheriff's substation.  </P> <P> The project includes three hotels and 2,600 housing units, with 76% of the land  set aside as open space.  </P> <P> Tuesday's settlement is the latest in a series involving about 20 controversial  development agreements approved by the supervisors. All but a few have been  settled out of court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suit Still Pending  </P> <P> Among the cases still pending is a separate lawsuit, scheduled for a court  hearing next week, seeking to block the Irvine Co.'s controversial Laguna  Laurel planned community near the north end of Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> The Laguna Conservancy claimed in the Irvine Coast lawsuit that the development  agreement, approved last April, was intended to circumvent the countywide  slow-growth ballot initiative then pending on the June 7 ballot. The measure  was defeated, 56% to 44%.  </P> <P> But in the settlement reached Tuesday, the conservancy dropped its claim that  such development agreements are unconstitutional because they bind future  boards of supervisors to land-use policies approved by current board members.  </P> <P> In the settlement, the conservancy admitted that the development agreement is  legally valid in return for extension of an offer by the Irvine Co. to sell two  small parcels of flatland to Laguna Beach. The parcels, next to Laguna Canyon  Road, are considered crucial to environmentalists seeking to preserve Laguna  Canyon's rural character.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawyer Questioned  </P> <P> In court Tuesday morning, Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam sharply  questioned conservancy lawyer Gregory A. Hile about whether his lawsuit had  actually obtained any benefit for his client. Hile cited the Irvine Co.'s offer  to sell the small land parcels to Laguna Beach, but later, outside of court,  company officials said they had a previous agreement with city officials  containing the same offer.  </P> <P> "That's true," Hile said, "but the city hasn't acted on it yet, and the offer  was set to expire in May."  </P> <P> Under the settlement reached Tuesday, the Irvine Co. cannot revoke the sales  offer for at least a year.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the city recently received  about $10 million in state parkland money and hopes to use it in negotiating  the purchase of these and other small parcels next to the canyon.  </P> <P> As part of the settlement, the Irvine Co. agreed to pay Hile's law firm $6,250.  </P> <P> The settlement also provides that Caltrans can use the land, if necessary, for  the planned widening of Laguna Canyon Road.  </P> <P> Laguna Conservancy officials did not return The Times Orange County Edition's  phone calls Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Appearance of Abuse'  </P> <P> While praising the settlement, Gary Hunt, senior vice president of the Irvine  Co., said the suit "represented an inescapable appearance of abuse of the legal  system by the attorneys representing the plaintiffs."  </P> <P> "They have already settled the majority of lawsuits filed against development  agreements and have gained approximately $150,000 in settlements, and for no  apparent reason other than their own self-aggrandizement," Hunt said. "It has  been a distasteful experience."  </P> <P> Hile and his partner, Belinda Blacketer, have defended cash payments to them as  necessary to defray the costs of filing and researching the lawsuits involved.  However, slow-growth advocate Russ Burkett broke ranks with the lawyers last  summer over the issue.  </P> <P> Still pending are lawsuits involving the planned community of Aliso Viejo, in  which a tentative settlement was reached last week, the planned expansion of  Coto de Caza, Talega Valley, Bear Brand Ranch and Laguna Laurel.  </P></p>

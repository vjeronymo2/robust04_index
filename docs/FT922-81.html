			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Accords in rail disputes CONRAIL and Amtrak, two of the biggest US rail operators, said they had reached tentative labour accords with their track workers, a significant step toward resolving the various disputes affecting the US industry, writes Alan Friedman in New York. Conrail, one of the largest freight operators, said it reached an agreement with representatives of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWE), which has 3,100 Conrail workers. Amtrak, the passenger service, said it struck a deal with BMWE officials representing 2,100 of its workers. Both settlements were reached last weekend and announced last night. The accords came after Congress acted last Thursday night to end a 48-hour strike against one big operator by approving legislation that ordered rail employees back to work. Congress also set guidelines for binding arbitration should parties find it impossible to settle their disputes. Amtrak said the accord meant it had resolved outstanding labour problems with 17 of its 19 unions.</p>

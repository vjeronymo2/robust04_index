			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jun 06, BNS -- Major General Aleksander  Einseln, the commander-in-chief of the Estonian Defense Forces,  told reporters on Saturday that there was no way Raul Opik, one  of the candidates for the defense vacancy, could return to the  army.    Einseln discharged Opik the same day the general staff  officer gave his consent to being nominated for the ministerial  post.    "Since he got mixed up with politics, that's where he's  going  to remain," Einseln told reporters. "Military men have no place  in politics, nor politicians in the defense forces."    Opik as a candidate for defense minister has already faced  several parliamentary factions. While some political forces  have remained neutral, others, like some members of the Estonian  National Independence Party [ENIP] and the Liberals factions,  are opposed to him. There is a rumor that, because of  opposition from the ENIP, the premier has considered other  possibilities. The name of Juri Valge, an advisor to the  defense forces commander, has been mentioned in this context.    Prime Minister Mart Laar hasn't so far submitted any names  for the president's approval.    Opik, who served on the general staff of the Estonian  Defense  Forces, has graduated from Tartu University in biology and  taught his subject at several schools in Tallinn. In November  1993 he completed a course for U.N. peacekeeping forces' staff  officers in Sweden. He has done a stint in peacekeeping in  Croatia.    Several general staff officers predicted that Opik would  have  a brilliant military career in the Baltic peacekeeping battalion  under formation.</p>

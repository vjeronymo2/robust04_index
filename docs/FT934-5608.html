			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / International Company News: Henkel hit by costs of early retirement plan Pre-tax profits at Henkel, the German chemicals, cosmetics and cleaning products group, fell by 16 per cent to DM422m (Dollars 251.2m) in the first nine months of the year. Mr Hans Dietrich Winkaus, chief executive, said the decline was partly due to extraordinary expenses to pay for the early retirement of workers in 1993 and 1994. The company plans to cut 1,300 jobs by the end of 1994, of which 1,000 will be in Germany. Sales for the period fell 2 per cent to DM10.5bn. The decline was mostly the result of currency fluctuations, Mr Winkaus said. Without this, sales would have improved by 0.4 per cent for the nine months. The chief executive said he expected sales for the whole year to show a 2 per cent decline, despite earlier statements this year predicting turnover would remain constant. Depressed demand caused sales for the period to drop 8 per cent in Europe.</p>

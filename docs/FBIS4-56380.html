			<p>Section 2  <F P=103> 94SM0331A </F> <F P=104>  Buenos Aires LA PRENSA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eugenio Andrea Bruno including interviews with </F> Carlos Alvarez and Alfredo Bravo: "Those to the Left of the  Government"; place and date not given]    [Text] Responding to those who criticize them for evading  economic issues, Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez, Alfredo Bravo, Anibal  Ibarra, and Norberto Laporta spoke with LA PRENSA about  privatizations, competition, deregulation, economic  liberalization, and the Cavallo Plan.    In his now classic column in LA PRENSA, Javier Gonzalez  Fraga  stated last Sunday that the future opposition to capitalism  would no longer renounce its economic principles, but would try  to criticize it from the inside, in effect acknowledging its  economic success.    The alternative presented by the Argentine left, on the  other  hand, was based on a virtual replacement of private activity by  the state, although it maintained the notion of private  property. The choice was clear: capitalism or socialism.    The economy would function on the basis, not of the free  market, but state planning. Terms such as privatization,  deregulation, liberalization, strong currency, and competition  were not in the left's vocabulary.    On the international level, they identified with the  democratic socialist movements that were implementing planning  policies. The Weimar Republic in Germany, the first  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico, which  reformed its country's constitution, the postwar British Labour  Party, and Salvador Allende's government in Chile could be  considered valid points of reference.    At present, the state vs. market debate appears to be  dominated by capitalism, insofar as it has recovered  academically and has triumphed in the sphere of economic policy.  Governments are no longer advocating more state and less market,  but instead are trying to expand the market. And the governments  labeled socialist are also participating in this era, applying  capitalist models.    The question, then, is this: Where do leftists in our  country  fit into all these changes?  <H5>  Inside and Outside </H5>   In theory, it could be said that there are two successful  political movements of the left (and the elections this Sunday  will serve as a measure of how representative they are): the  Grand Front (FG) and Socialist Unity.    Their economic proposals are marked by criticism of the  capitalism of President Carlos Menem's government. Both maintain  that the Cavallo Plan does not have social measures to protect  the most defenseless segments of society. "It is for the benefit  of a few," agree Alfredo Bravo and Carlos Alvarez.    When asked by LA PRENSA if there are indeed fresh winds  blowing in the left and if Felipe Gonzalez is an example of  that, the first convention candidates almost agree.    "Each situation must be considered separately," says Bravo.  "Spain is not the same as Argentina. It is impossible to imagine  Spain outside of the European Community, so Gonzalez has been  forced to accept some economic freedoms that I would not  accept." "Chacho" Alvarez, on the other hand, contends that  "although the countries' circumstances are different, I should  point out that Felipe Gonzalez's social democracy has failed to  achieve a society without poverty."    A comparative analysis reveals that the Grand Front's  economic proposal differs from that announced by Socialist  Unity. The latter's representatives stated at the outset of our  dialogue that if they were in power, they would review all  privatizations, and they would not under any circumstances  accept the current market economy. The Grand Front is not so  radical: "We have not yet defined an alternative economic  program," says "Chacho" Alvarez, "however, we believe that  stability is one of the government's great achievements. If we  were called upon to run the government, we would maintain it. We  also think that economic activity should be assigned a very  significant role in the economy. We favor economic policies that  view the market as a complement to the state. For example, in  the case of the economic liberalization, Argentina should gain  competitiveness to export more goods."    Each of them appears to have different cricitisms. While the  socialists under Bravo's leadership criticize capitalism from  the outside, the Grand Front prefers to do so from the inside.    In this regard, there is one fact that "Chacho" Alvarez may  perhaps have realized, and that is that to win elections, it is  necessary to move toward the center, and especially toward what  society thinks. Today, Argentine society is imbued with the  ideas of economic stability based on price freedom.    In short, neither of the two lefts will defend free-market  economics, and both advocate policies for employment, housing,  business-labor-government coordination, nationalizations, and  market control, plus broad social policies aimed at promoting  the most backward sectors.    They differ, however, on how much state intervention there  should be. This proves that the triumph of capitalism has left  different impressions on the Argentine left, and that its  leaders have not reacted in the same ways.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  Anibal Ibarra: "The State Is Not a Corporation" </H5>   Grand Front Councilman Anibal Ibarra believes that his party  is in the center-left. "We do not identify with any  international model, however," he told LA PRENSA.    "In general, we aspire to achieve monetary stability, but  with a state presence in the economy, complemented by the  private sector," the councilman concluded.    With respect to the privatizations, Ibarra favors them, but  with limitations: "We want to privatize only those areas that  are not so economically and strategically important that they  affect the control of the national government." When asked what  those sectors might be, he responded that hydrocarbons,  telecommunications, and air traffic should not be privatized.    He also maintains that the state cannot be run as if it were  a big company that must yield profits. "The state is not a  corporation that is merely interested in the bottom line. There  are social gains that cannot be assigned monetary value."    "If we were in office, we would administer public resources  by spending money on clothing for children rather than compact  discs," concluded Anibal Ibarra cheerfully.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  Norberto Laporta: "Stop the Neoliberal Advance" </H5>   "There is a new left that must try to stop the neoliberal  advance. Our thinking is in accord with the position of Michel  Rocard in France, who contends that although socialism has  changed, it should not borrow principles from neoliberalism."  This was the opening salvo in LA PRENSA's dialogue with Norberto  Laporta, Buenos Aires city councilman for Socialist Unity.    As for the national situation, the second convention  candidate of that same party argues that the privatization  process was handled wrong. "The government sold the state for a  song," explains Laporta.    The councilman also outlined his position on social issues:  "The government's neoliberalism amounts to the repeal of the  workers' conquests, given that capital-labor relations continue  to be exploitative. The current government's capitalism is  Manchesterian in nature."    Laporta believes there are three economic spheres: public,  private, and mixed. "The public sector includes strategic  economic activities such as public services, petroleum, and the  airlines. In the mixed sector there are initiatives that are  important for the economy, but they are not of the caliber of  the first group. And finally, the strictly private sphere  encompasses the rest of the economy," explained Laporta.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  Carlos Alvarez: "The Stability Is Undeniable" </H5>   The creator of the Grand Front says that after the elections  (today), he will get to work on an economic program for  governing, first the federal capital, and then the country.    Speaking about the economy for the first time, Alvarez  outlined his party's future economic proposal: "We are going to  maintain stability, although we will add social measures to it;  we will not reverse the privatizations, and the opening up of  trade will be accompanied by a policy of complementarity between  the state and the market."    [Bruno] How do you define the Grand Front?    [Alvarez] The Grand Front occupies the center-left portion  of  the political spectrum. I define it as an open political  alternative that is recovering values currently being lost in  Argentina.    I do not know if proposing the modernization of the economy  with the inclusion of social programs means being to the left of  the government. We do indeed contend that Argentina needs to be  more equitable and more balanced.    [Bruno] Do you identify with any socialist movement in  Europe?    [Alvarez] I think there is a crisis of paradigms. Marxism  has  failed. The authoritarian socialisms collapsed. Social democracy  has failed to achieve more equitable societies, and there is  also a failure of the idea of market fundamentalism, the  corollary of which is the rise of racism and xenophobia.    Our challenge is to construct a new paradigm, and there is  no  reason why it should resemble any of the options that are  dominating the international scene.    [Bruno] If you were in charge of the public administration,  what model would you promote?    [Alvarez] In principle, it is difficult for us to place  ourselves in different situations. Today we are expressing  Argentine society's demand for a political force that can be  effective when it comes time to control the excesses and abuses  of power.    I should point out, however, that we must draw up an  alternative economic program for after the constitutional  convention elections.    Our growth is based on gradualism. First we must  institutionalize the political strength of the Grand Front.    [Bruno] In that connection, what truth is there to the  rumors  that you are working on a minicabinet for an eventual mayoral  candidacy?    [Alvarez] I am not married to any candidacy. I do want to be  a part of a political movement that will provide an alternative  for government. In that regard, we have been up front with the  socialists, proposing that they head the list in these elections.    We are going to work on the issues that are important to the  city, however, because people will not vote for us to govern the  country if we cannot first show that we can run a local  government efficiently.    [Bruno] But they will not vote for you to run the city,  either, unless you tell them what you are going to do ahead of  time....    [Alvarez] That is right. We must present a clear alternative  for administration and government, and at the same time prove  that corruption is not a matter of a few scattered officials  lining their pockets fortuitously. Corruption is systemic,  structural, and it is affecting services that are essential for  improving our quality of life. For example, the most pessimistic  estimates peg this dirty money at $4 billion a year.    [Bruno] One indication of the Grand Front's economic policy  is its assertions that stability is an accomplishment that it  intends to maintain.    [Alvarez] It would be crass of us to deny that there is  stability. Nevertheless, we believe that although the stability  is an incontrovertible fact that is beneficial for society, we  must bring to the fore the issues that it cannot resolve by  itself.    [Bruno] Do you believe in privatization?    [Alvarez] I believe that we must look at each privatization  individually. It is an instrument that we cannot ignore.    I think that there is no Cavallo model. There are  instruments. So we will analyze each instrument, one by one.  With regard to the privatization instrument, we have no  ideological prejudices that cause us to oppose it.    But we still must analyze each privatization, one by one.  For  example, we believe that the privatization of the airline was  very badly handled, because we ended up with a single flag  airline in foreign hands. We know, however, that we will not  have a chance to review it, although we would like to discuss  its efficiency, the quality of service, and the rate structure.    In short, we agree with the way some of the privatizations  were carried out and not with others.    We also do not think it prehistoric to question whether the  state could have run a profitable company effectively, as is the  case in other countries in the world.    [Bruno] What about the economic liberalization?    [Alvarez] The external liberalization is aimed at improving  the competitiveness of the Argentine economy. We can propose  another liberalization model that looks at how the most advanced  countries in the world set up industries so that they can be  competitive and gain a market position that they do not now  have. The idea is to find an economic design with complementary  roles for the state and the private sectors, in which the state  provides orientation and infrastructure and seeks out  competitive niches.    If we leave everything up to the spontaneous development of  the market, Argentina may end up without any production of  high-value-added goods. I do not see anything wrong with the  state helping private industry.    [Bruno] Could the government of Patricio Aylwin be a  reflection of your policies?    [Alvarez] The Chilean model was phased in gradually. First  they achieved economic efficiency, although with a much less  dogmatic vision. For example, they have the Chile Foundation,  which helps small and medium-sized companies become competitive  in the world.    But I think there was also some neglect of the sectors that  remained on the sidelines, excluded from the ideological  reconversion.    In this regard, it seems to me that Argentina would not have  to wait for a new government to become aware of this situation.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  Alfredo Bravo: "We Would Review all Privatizations" </H5>   In a tone sharply critical of the government's economic  policy, Deputy Alfredo Bravo of Socialist Unity told LA PRENSA  that this plan ignores the individual. "It takes into account  only concepts like efficiency, surpluses, and competition."    When asked about the socialist movement in the world, and  specifically about Felipe Gonzalez's economic policy, the deputy  responded that socialism has not changed. "To determine whether  there have been political mutations, we must place ourselves in  the situation of each country. For example, Felipe Gonzalez was  forced to introduce economic freedoms in Spain that I would not  accept. But he had to do it, since it was a prerequisite for  joining the European Economic Community."    [Bruno] How would you sum up the socialist program?    [Bravo] First of all, we believe that the dogmatic part of  the Constitution should be amended. We advocate the recognition  of the rights of workers, children, women, and the elderly. In  the educational sphere, our program calls for free education as  a constitutional right.    If the spirit of the Constitution of 1853 was liberal and  that of the Reform of 1949 was social, the spirit of our program  is socialist. On the worker's side.    Furthermore, it is obvious that there are some concepts that  were impossible to get through in 1853, such as democracy and  social rights.    Our reform program is to the left of the government and of  the Radical Civic Union (UCR). We socialists have always  occupied that position on the political and economic spectrum in  Argentina.    [Bruno] Is there a new concept of socialism in the world?    [Bravo] It is not that socialism has changed, but it has  adapted to the specific situations present in each country. The  circumstances of Felipe Gonzalez's government in Spain are  different from those of the socialist movements in Latin  America. It is impossible to imagine Spain outside of the  European Community. And joining the European Community has  necessitated the acceptance of economic freedoms that I would  never accept.    [Bruno] Where do you stand on the old "state vs. market"  debate?    [Bravo] I think that the state should regulate the economy.  In an effort to give priority to social issues, I think it is  necessary for it to intervene in economic activity by monitoring  private companies and promoting worker participation. I favor  direct productive activity by the state.    [Bruno] What is your opinion of the Cavallo Plan?    [Bravo] The Cavallo Plan is devoid of social content. We  think it is a program that considers only efficiency, surpluses,  and competition, and ignores the most important issue, the  individual.    If we were in power, we would carry out social measures, and  we would review all privatizations.    The roots of the socialist movement are Marxist.  Nevertheless, this does not mean that we would adopt all the  precepts of Marxism, or that we are Marxists. For example, it  was Alfredo Palacios who did the Spanish translation of "Das  Kapital" that was used to train many socialist leaders.</p>

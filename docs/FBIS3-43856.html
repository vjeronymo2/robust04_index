Four helicopters of the Lesotho Army flew into South Africa  yesterday, and apparently the plan was to escape the skirmish in  Maseru, and are grounded at Ladybrand.    The South African foreign minister, Mr. Pik Botha, arrived  in  Lesotho aboard a private jet today to discuss the Lesotho Armed  forces' fracas with Defense Minister, the Right Honorable Prime  Minister, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle; cabinet ministers; commanders of  the army and the police; as well as the opposition leader, Mr.  Sekhonyane.    In an interview with our reporters Mr. Botha said South  Africa will never recognize any government taken by force in  Lesotho. He said he had come to Lesotho to establish the nature  of the fracas within the Lesotho armed forces, but not to  dictate terms to the Lesotho Government. Mr. Botha said after  consultations with the Lesotho authorities he was assured that  the military problem will be solved peacefully.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu at the Grand </F> Parade, Cape Town -- live]    [Text] Good afternoon. Let me introduce those who are on  the balcony before we introduce the person we have come to see.  We want to introduce the state president and deputy state  president-elect, Mr. F.W. de Klerk -- give him a warm hand.  [applause] Thank you. And then we want to introduce the deputy  state president-elect, Thabo Mbeki [applause], and Mrs. Zanele  Mbeki. [applause] I want to introduce to you the chief justice,  Mr. Justice Corbett, and Mrs. Corbett. [applause] And then we  want to introduce Her Worship, the Mayor of Cape town, Alderman  (Patricia Cryner), and the Mayoress, Mrs. (Di Barrell).    Friends, this is the day that the Lord has made, and we will  rejoice and be glad in it. This is the day for which we have  waited for over 300 years. This is the day of liberation for  all of us, black and white together. This is the day of  celebration. My fellow citizens -- hey, I can rightly call you  fellow citizens, for on 27 and 28 April South Africa voted, and  millions of us voted for the very first time, and a miracle  happened. We discovered that we were South Africans, and we  have discovered that we are proud of that fact.    Yesterday at the FNB [First National Bank] Stadium I sang  "Die Stem" ["The Voice"] for the very first time in my life, and  I loved it. Who will ever forget the picture of Tokyo Sexwale  taking the salute as the SAP [South African Police] and the SADF  [South African Defense Force] filed past?    A new South Africa has come to birth. We have said a  resounding no to racism. What have we said to racism? What  have we said to injustice? What have we said to oppression?  What have we said to hatred? What have we said to violence?  What have we said to alienation and division?    And we have said a loud and reverberating yes to freedom.  What have we said to freedom? What have we said to  reconciliation? Yes. What have we said to forgiveness? What  have we said to peace? What have we said to unity? We of many  cultures, languages, and races are become one nation. We are  the rainbow people of God, and one man embodies this new spirit  of reconciliation and unity. One man inspires us all. One man  inspires the whole world. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, fellow  South Africans, I ask you, welcome our brand new state president  -- out of the box -- Nelson Mandela.</p>

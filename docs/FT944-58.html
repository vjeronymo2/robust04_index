			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: How to remain safe in Africa - War and Peace (Travelling in Troublespots) I was once staying in a game lodge in Uganda when a Belgian tourist met a painful death because he tried to feed a sugar lump to an elephant. No doubt his friends back home concluded that Africa was a dangerous place and resolved never to visit the savage continent. They would not have understood that this had been a most rare and unlikely accident. Many potential visitors to South Africa, who do not already know the country, probably have similar, and excessive, fears about what might happen to them. After all, an awful lot of people get killed there - you see it on television all the time, and this is no longer political violence but criminal (ie anyone can be a victim). South Africa is a world leader in the incidence of violent crime (just one statistic: 60 of every 100,000 South Africans are likely to be murdered next year, compared with 10 in the US and two in Britain). The overall crime rate continues to rise, with heavy increases in rape and assault this year. Is this not bound to enter the mind of the first-time visitor? Is it safe (or rather, because South Africa palpably is not as 'safe' as Bournemouth or Biarritz) - is it safe enough? The answer, as foreigners begin to pour into South Africa to visit this most beautiful of countries, is that the new South Africa is adequately 'safe' so long as you are sensible, which is to try to understand the roots and the manifestations of a security situation which obviously cannot be compared with the Cotswolds: The present situation in certain districts of the big cities is undeniably tricky, by which I mean that it demands caution and commonsense on the part of the visitor. Downtown Johannesburg is the best example: you would not dream of walking the streets after dusk and you would exercise some care during daylight. More generally, the visitor should learn the habit of locking car doors on the inside, concealing handbags and parcels, driving through red lights if there are suspicious youths at the junction, not flaunting jewellery, not carrying too much cash. Outside the towns, the open countryside is much safer on the nerves. But the sensible rules still apply: do not drive through certain areas (eg the Transkei) at night - not so much because of any danger of brigands as of cattle on the unfenced roads; do not drive yourself into a township unless you have a guide or know where you are going; do not pick up people at the roadside without looking carefully; and do not go walking in remote areas without taking advice (best to stick to the national parks, where security is good). Bear in mind that South Africa has an appalling record for simple road accidents. Drive very carefully. There is no point in denying that South Africa today is an even more violent society than it used to be, which is saying something. But that does not begin to make it a no-go area. Let us keep a sense of proportion. How much of the above would also apply to New York City or Florida, Rio or Zimbabwe? I am writing this from a delightful hotel on the Indian Ocean coast of the Transkei. We are protected by an electrified fence. At least, that is what it says: I have not tested whether the current is turned on. PS: I am actually filing this piece from another, equally delightful hotel on the edge of Zululand. We are only a few miles from an area where horrifying tribal bloodletting has featured in the international press this year, yet they do not bother to lock the doors. But they do have a dozy Alsatian, a puppy, in the garden.</p>

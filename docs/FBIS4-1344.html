			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Raphael Banda] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- Voting got off to a  slow start on Tuesday [26 April] in South Africa's first  all-race elections, overshadowed by a spate of bombings aimed at  scuttling the process but appeared only to harden black voters'  resolve to usher in a new era of non-racialism. The handicapped,  ill, infirm, pensioners and pregnant women cast their votes in  hospitals and other centres on the first of the three-day  national and provincial elections marking the end of apartheid  rule.    Members of the security forces, South Africans resident  overeas, and some categories of prisoners also cast special  votes on Tuesday.    South Africa's financial markets improved as the country  started voting, with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's overall  index gaining 117 points by early afternoon and the Industrial  Index soaring 155 points. The all gold index rose 45 points.    People arrived at polling stations as early as 4AM, but  voting began with hitches following delays in delivery of ballot  boxes, papers and other paraphernalia. Voting picked up by  mid-morning.    Voters went to the polls on crutches and in wheelchairs,  with  many escorted by children and grandchildren.    Black voters' enthusiasm for the historic elections appeared  undiminished by the bombing spree which killed 21 people and  wounded more than 150 since sunday.    Police said a bomb exploded at a goldmine near Klerksdorp,  Western Transvaal on Tuesday, but no injuries were reported.    "Bombs and intimidation won't stop us. This is the new South  Africa," said Catherine Makgongwana, 55, who arrived to vote  outside Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto.    In spite of the terror campaign, about 6,000 exuberant  voters  who did not qualify for special voting streamed to a polling  station in Klerksdorp's Jourberton township. Police battled to  convince the voters they could vote only on Wednesday and  Thursday.    In Ciskei several voting stations opened for normal voters a  day early and were ordered to close by IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission] officials.    Among the elderly casting their votes on Tuesday, was  President F W de Klerk's 89-year-old mother Corrie de Klerk, who  was escorted to a Pretoria polling station by the president.    Mr de Klerk said technical hitches experienced at some  polling stations earlier had been ironed out.    Special voting at most Northern Transvaal stations failed to  get off the ground when electoral officials did not turn up with  voting material. Only one polling station opened in Pietersburg  for a steady flow of voters to cast their ballots.    An Independent Electoral Commission situation report after  noon said two vehicles carrying ballot papers had been burnt in  Katlehong on the East Rand, but this had not affected voting.    The IEC said that by 10AM, a total of 246 incidents had been  reported countrywide by IEC monitors, 175 of them concerning  problems with receipt of voting materials. The problems had been  dealt with. The IEC said its investigators had reported a  serious and widespread problem in the issuing of temporary  voting cards.    In KwaZulu/Natal, the IEC said voting was delayed because of  late changes to the ballot paper and logistical problems,  especially transport. Some voting material had also arrived late  from Johannesburg.    IEC spokesman Glenn McDougall said no serious disruptions  had  been reported in the region by 10AM.    In Soweto, long queues formed because Inkatha Freedom Party  stickers had not been stuck to the ballot papers. The IEC had  been looking into the hitch.    Electoral officials also reported two ballot boxes were  tampered with at Evander, but they said it was not known if  ballot papers were removed.    Faulty or missing voting materials and the non-arrival of  party officials delayed polling in parts of Bloemfontein's black  and coloured townships.    Some polling stations in the town reported faulty  ultra-violet lights for the checking of invisible ink on voters'  hands and were awaiting replacements from Johannesburg, the IEC  said.    Meanwhile, reports that khaki-clad rightwing militants had  occupied the voting station at Settlers in the Northern  Transvaal, vowing that nobody in the area would vote, were  denied by police. The IEC said later the building which had been  occupied was not one designated by the IEC as a voting station.    An IEC office in the Eastern Cape was evacuated following a  bomb scare. The SA Defence Force and SA Police destroyed a  suitcase they suspected was a bomb. Only clothes were found in  the suitcase.    Delays in voting irked some voters, who had to wait for at  least two hours before ballot boxes and papers were ferried to  stations.    "This is Mr de Klerk's strategy. He doesn't want us to  vote,"  fumed one old man who had been waiting to cast his vote since  dawn at mdantsane's Cecilia Makiwane Hospital. The voting  equipment arrived at 9.30AM.    "It's something which is very irregular. Our people are  getting confused. Some have decided to go home," said a business  leader in Mdantsane.    By mid-morning, voting picked up.    In the Eastern Transvaal, for example, voting was reported  to  be going smoothly and patients at most hospitals in the area had  already voted by early afternoon.    Despite the technical hitches and slow start, hundreds of  voters were reported to be arriving at polling stations across  the country, enthusiastic to cast their special votes and help  determine the future.    Handicapped Miss Nokuzola Gxarisa arrived at Cecilia  Makiwane  Hospital at 5.30AM and told a SAPA reporter she did not mind  waiting for the ballot boxes and papers. I think it's worth it.  I want to vote. I think there's going to be a change in  everything," she said.    "It feels very nice to be voting for the first time," said  Mrs Martha Molosewoe, 65, a pensioner wrapped in a heavy blanket  against the early morning chill as she waited for polling to  start in a township in Bloemfontein.    "It's a special day," said a 76-year-old who was proud to be  older than her candidate of choice. "I want a new life and a new  future."    One-legged Abel Lephoo has just turned 60 and had a simple  sentiment about his historic first vote. "It feels good," he  said, limping to join the queue he would probably have to endure  for much of the day.    South Africans living overseas also voted on Tuesday with  the  niece of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela the  first to cast her vote in New Zealand.    The IEC said voting stations in eastern Australia had  closed,  with just under 5,000 people having cast their ballots. Detailed  breakdowns would be released later.    Prisoners convicted of lesser crimes as stipulated in the  Electoral Act, also voted. Voting at Robben Island Prison was  delayed when the boat carrying electoral officials broke down  after leaving Cape Town harbour. Officials were processing about  80 prisoners an hour, the IEC said.    About 2,500 prisoners ready to vote since dawn at Leeuwkop  prison, north of Johannesburg, were told voting would begin  after 2PM when electoral officers would arrive.</p>

President Zhelev said this himself in today's  50-minute interview on the national radio. Rising crime and the  possibilities of fighting it were the main topics in the  interview broadcast two days after the parliamentary debate on a  motion for no-confidence in the government made by the Union of  Democratic Forces, which claims that the cabinet is incompetent  to enforce law and order and guarantee people's safety. In less  than a month, the Bulgarian president pays particular attention  to the problems of growing crime for the second time. Only two  weeks ago he addressed the nation commenting on the same issue.    "In principle, I am a convinced opponent to capital  punishment, but in view of soaring crime rates I am inclined to  agree to temporary lift the moratorium on it until the issue is  resolved commuting the death sentence to one of life  imprisonment by law," President Zhelev said in the interview.    The president described the accusations made against him by  some people that he had granted amnesty to 12,000 criminals as a  gross and brazen lie. They were released by former President  Petur Mladenov in 1990, Dr. Zhelev pointed out. So far I have  pardoned just a few hundreds of people, mainly seriously ill  women and old people who can no longer commit any crime, he said.    One can draw two basic conclusions from the parliamentary  debate and the press publications on crime control: The need of  purging the state machine of corruption and of the political  forces reaching consensus, the president believes.    The crime control effort will not be serious without  declaring a merciless war on corruption not only in the Ministry  of the Interior but in the governing authorities as a whole and  in all state institutions, President Zhelev emphasized. Any  attempts to fight organized crime without eliminating corruption  at the state institutions are doomed to failure, Dr. Zhelev said  categorically. The Presidency has always been uncompromising on  the issue of fighting corruption. Dr. Zhelev cited a number of  cases when presidential advisers, suspected of servicing the  interests of certain financial and industrial groups, had been  dismissed. He named Zdravko Popov, his former adviser on  foreign affairs, Piere Tabakov, former adviser on defence  industry problems, former military adviser General Stoyan  Andreev.    What has been done to curb crime so far is less than modest,  the president said. He blamed mainly the two major political  forces for the present condition of the society and for the  inefficient crime control saying that they always placed their  interests above the national ones. The president believes that  they are obliged to reach consensus on the problem of curbing  crime. The institutions whose duty is fighting crime cannot be  stable without such consensus, the president stressed.    According to him, the presidential institution can play the  role of an integrating factor concerting the efforts of the  institutions directly involved in crime control. It can play  this role through the Consultative National Security Council  which has the right to ask the separate institutions for  cooperation, the president believes.    Dr. Zhelev emphasized his view about the need of developing  a  national programme for crime control. The political forces must  unite for the sake of resolving the problem. Without consensus,  combating crime is doomed to failure, the president said in  conclusion.</p>

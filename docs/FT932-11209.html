			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Botin family fuels Spanish lending war THE POWERFUL Botin family delivered its second assault on Spain's domestic financial sector within a week with the announcement yesterday that Bankinter, its smaller retail banking unit, was offering interest of 16 per cent on one-month deposits of Pta1m (Dollars 8,695). The development followed a rapid counter-attack by most of Spain's leading banks which sought to neutralise a bold initiative by Banco Santander, the Botin family's major bank, to capture the domestic mortgage market by offering sharp rate cuts to homebuyers. Santander launched a 'lending war' on Friday by cutting its variable mortgage rate by 0.75 per cent to 11.50 per cent and by offering, as a new product, 12-year mortgages at a fixed 11.50 per cent. With the notable exception of Banesto, all Santander's rival banks had by yesterday announced similar rate cuts. Although Bankinter and Santander are formally separate institutions Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of Santander, is deputy chairman of Bankinter and his brother Mr Jaime Botin, chairman of Bankinter, is deputy chairman of Santander. The Botin family owns nearly 6 per cent of Santander and, both directly and indirectly, close to 50 per cent of Bankinter. The interest rate now being offered by Bankinter is well above anything that is being offered by the domestic high street banks. At best, depositors could obtain around 13 per cent for one-year deposits in excess of Pta20m. Bankinter, which is very tightly managed bank, is able to offer 16 per cent because it is a net lender on the interbank market where current rates are between 15.75 and 17 per cent. Overheads at Bankinter are minimal - a key element in the 16 per cent interest on offer is that clients may arrange their high interest deposits on the phone - and the bank is clearly willing to accept a very small margin in order to widen its deposit base. Santander, which has an extremely large deposit base largely as a result of a pioneering venture into high interest accounts four years ago, is now pursuing the strategy of breaking forcefully into the mortgage market. Mortgages have up to now been dominated by the savings banks and by the state-controlled institutions of the Argentaria banking group.</p>

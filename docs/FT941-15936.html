			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigerian group finds more oil and gas The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has proven reserves of over 25m barrels of oil and gas in the Niger delta, a rare boost for the corporations which faces mounting debts to contractors, arrears in payments for exploration and production, and big losses on its downstream operations. The state company's own operator, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company has found nine hydrocarbons levels at the Oziengbe south field, five km from Koko in Delta state, in one of the few onshore concessions that is 100 per cent owned by NPDC. The find takes NPDC's proven reserves to 169m barrels. The company has one small oil field in production at Apura, a joint venture with British Gas, but the rest of Nigeria's 1.8m barrels daily quota is produced by NNPC's minority joint venture partners who are all international oil companies, except Dubri Oil, the only indigenous private sector producer in Africa. The Nigerian government last year signed a series of exploration and production contracts for deep water concessions that shifted all the initial costs of developing fields to the oil majors as part of its drive to increase proven oil reserves from 20bn to 25bn barrels by the end of the decade.</p>

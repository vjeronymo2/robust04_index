			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 2 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic, said in Belgrade today that  one-sided support for the Muslims by some international circles  and leading countries is making peace prospects in Bosnia more  distant.    At a roundtable -- "A TANJUG guest" -- Karadzic expressed  doubt that the negotiations on Bosnia, due to take place in  Geneva on 10 February, can produce any result due to a lack of  political will to influence the Muslims to accept a peaceful  solution.    According to him, Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic will, as  he  has done so far, act "as his sponsors say."    "It is therefore to be expected that the Muslim parliament,  at a session due to take place in Sarajevo on 7 February, will  adopt a platform unacceptable to both the Serbs and the Croats,  or at least to the Serbs, in order to make sure that the war  continues," Karadzic said.    He explained that the Muslim ambition to achieve domination  in Bosnia and their obligation to secure the whole of Bosnia for  Islamic interests in Europe caused the war and is the reason for  its continuation.    He added that "the United States has said that the Muslims  have the right to try to achieve their objectives by military  means" and that this is the first time they said they will  recognize the results of the armed struggle. "We, the Serbs,  have nothing against this, provided the same standard is applied  to us," Karadzic said.    He recalled that the Serbs have made huge concessions in  exchange for an urgent peace and lifting of sanctions and added  that, if the concessions do not result in peace and a solution,  they will be withdrawn.    Karadzic underlined that the Serb side will continue to make  any future agreement on Bosnia conditional on the lifting of  sanctions against Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (1): In search of security - In spite of continuing hardship, steady progress has been made on the economic front. But with stability at risk as the far right reawakens ethnic rivalries, much now depends on patience and restraint THE STATES and peoples of east and central Europe are re-discovering the historical, cultural and economic forces which shaped their identities. The old search for reasonable prosperity, a modus vivendi between ethnically and culturally different neighbours and an acceptable degree of social fairness and liberty was never easy. Seeking a more secure future, through market reforms and full integration into a democratic and prosperous Europe is proving no easier. Hungary has come closer than most to the point of self-sustaining economic growth and irreversible political and institutional reform. But this perception appears to be more widespread among foreigners, who have invested more than Dollars 4.1bn over the past three years, than among Hungarians, many of whom have seen their living standards drop and social security eroded. Although 10m Hungarians are still governed by the same conservative coalition elected in 1990 - a record of stability unsurpassed in the region  -its achievements have failed to impress an electorate disenchanted by the sacrifices demanded and rendered nervous by the disintegration of neighbouring Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. With Serbia, Slovakia and Romania in the hands of former communists thinly disguised as nationalists, the re-awakening of ethnic intolerance has underlined the potential vulnerability of 3.5m ethnic Hungarians, and other minorities, in the neighbouring states. Inside Hungary itself, the government's encouragement of foreign investment, its desire for integration into Europe and its willingness to submit to IMF disciplines have also aroused growls of protest from nationalist conservatives. Two months ago Mr Istvan Csurka, the writer who is one of six vice-presidents of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF), warned fellow Hungarians to beware of 'a Paris, New York, Tel Aviv' plot and complained that control by the IMF was equivalent to that by the Red Army. At the most harmless level Mr Csurka expresses the outrage of an older generation having to come to terms with the alien consumerism of McDonalds hamburger joints and 'finger-lickin' chicken' bars. At a deeper level he has brought to the surface deep-rooted xenophobia and anti-semitism in sections of a country which retains the largest and most influential Jewish community in the region. Most Hungarian Jews, and those who escaped from other, Nazi-occupied areas, were spared the fate of Jews elsewhere in the region until 1944 when Hitler, afraid his Hungarian allies would defect as Italy had, imposed direct Nazi control. Mr Csurka has re-opened resentment against prominent Jews in the former communist regime and aired the new envy of Jews as successful bankers and businessmen in post-communist Hungary. Even the motives of Jewish benefactors, such as Mr George Soros, have been called into question, prompting an open protest letter from the latter to Mr Jozsef Antall, the beleaguered prime minister, who has played down the Csurka affair in the interests of party unity. With his HDF party trailing badly in opinion polls and elections due in 1994, Mr Antall, who is not in good health, faces defeat unless he retains the loyalty of the nationalist wing of the HDF, to whom Mr Csurka appeals, and unless the hoped for economic recovery materialises. As time runs out for the economy to come to Mr Antall's rescue, he faces a challenge both from the Hungarian Socialist party, made up largely by former communists seeking new credentials as social democrats and Fidesz, the youth party led by Mr Viktor Orban. The party's members and leaders are all under-35-year-olds untainted by participation in public life under the old regime. They are inspired by hopes of repeating the successful leap across an entire political generation achieved by the Spanish socialists under Mr Felipe Gonzalez a decade ago. The Free Democrat (SDS) party, which leads the opposition in parliament, appears to lack a clear identity, sits uneasily between old style liberalism and social democracy and seems unlikely to retain its present electoral strength. But, if western Europe, and especially Germany, avoids a full-fledged recession over the next two years, there is a chance that the economy may oblige Mr Antall by pulling out of three years of overall decline. The decline has masked underlying changes which reflect domestic reform and the activities of foreign investors who have chosen Hungary for more than half the Dollars 7bn total investment pumped into east and central Europe over the past three years. Underlining their vote of confidence in Hungary's future is evidence that over 60 per cent of this has gone into industrial investments which will require a 15-year cycle before they are likely to be fully justified. Apart from the dozen or so large investments by US and European multinationals, Hungary now has 13,000 joint ventures with foreign companies. More than 10 per cent of exports come from companies with a turnover of less than Dollars 1m, the activities of which are frequently neither reported in official statistics nor effectively taxed. As a result, the private sector of the Hungarian economy - much of it in the hands of young, well educated people with strong faith in Hungary's future - is richer and more dynamic than recorded. But this is at the expense of the state budget. Delay in implementing the new income and VAT tax systems, and slower than expected privatisation, means that the treasury is deprived of new tax income at precisely the moment when the profits of state companies and the banking system - the main traditional sources of tax revenue - are in sharp decline. At the same time expenditure on unemployment pay, modernisation of the structure of government and other costs linked to structural reform, is proving difficult to control. The need to keep next year's budget deficit to around 6 per cent of GDP in order to comply with IMF loan conditions is likely to be the main constraint on economic policymakers next year. Against this has to be balanced the prospect for further vigorous growth in exports. The net result of strong capital inflows, coupled with a successful shift from eastern to western markets following the collapse of Comecon trade, has been to lay a solid basis for future export-led economic growth. By the same token Hungary has also improved its ability to service its declining foreign debt. Foreign investment has been crucial in facilitating structural change in the economy. Within the short span of three years, for example, Hungary - which was forced by the old Comecon division of labour to concentrate on producing rugged buses for the entire region has put itself in a position to become a leading producer and exporter of GM cars and engines, as well as up to 60,000 Suzuki cars a year and motor components made by Ford and other multinationals with new plants in the country. Blessed with fertile land and a tradition of good farming which largely survived collectivisation, Hungary has also attracted investment from food and consumer goods multinationals such as Ferruzzi, Unilever and Philip Morris. Unlike Poland, with its many thousands of small peasant plots, most Hungarian farms are already on the large scale demanded by modern farming. With so much achieved, and so much on the brink of achievement, success depends on the patience, restraint and common decency of ordinary Hungarians in the face of siren songs from the past.</p>

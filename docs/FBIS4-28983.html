			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- A seminar of literary  men and artistes was held here on the lapse of 30 years since  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to work at the  Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.    Speakers said Korea has met a great heyday of literature and  art thanks to the chuche-based literary and art thought and  energetic guidance of the dear leader. They noted that with a  revolutionary change in film, opera, drama and all other domains  of literature and art, immortal classical masterpieces were  adapted in various art forms and the theoretical and practical  problems arising in creation and representation including the  portrayal of the leader in literary and art works were  successfully solved.    Noting that the Korean writers and artistes have grown up to  be ranks of loyalty unfailingly faithful to the party and the  leader, the speakers said it is one of big achievements in the  efforts to model literature and art on the chuche idea.    Referring to the feats of the dear leader who established a  regular system of guidance over the party life in the domain of  literature and art, they stressed that it was a precious result  of the new system's superiority and vitality that writers and  artistes remain boundlessly loyal and devoted to the party and  the leader.</p>

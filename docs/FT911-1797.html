			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Single Europe idea gathers strength MOST people in the European Community think that by the end of the century they will be able to work anywhere in an enlarged EC, be paid in a single currency and defended by a common EC military force. This majority feeling that Community integration is inevitable, as well as generally desirable, emerges from the latest Eurobarometer opinion poll, sponsored by the Commission and published yesterday. Out of some 13,000 people interviewed in March, 55 per cent said they thought it was realistic to expect east European countries in the EC by the year 2000. The ratio rose to 63 per cent in the case of neutral European countries joining. Some 64 per cent expected a single currency, while 58 per cent thought a common military force was realistic. The wish, however, is father to the thought. In Denmark, 91 per cent believed the accession to the EC by fellow Scandinavians was imminent, but only 45 per cent of immigration-sensitive Danes considered free residence rights were on the cards. The one, predictable, drop in Euro-enthusiasm was detected in east Germany, where the ratio of those giving the EC a positive endorsement dropped to 79 per cent, from 87 per cent last autumn.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: IRWINDALE;  </P> <P> SUIT AGAINST CITY REINSTATED  </P> <P> Reversing an earlier decision, a Pomona Superior Court judge ruled that a  countersuit filed against the city by a former redevelopment consultant will be  heard in court.  </P> <P> Monday's decision by Superior Court Judge Thomas Nuss will allow Fred Lyte, who  was fired by the City Council in December, 1988, to countersue the city for  $1.38 million that Lyte says he is owed.  </P> <P> Early last year, the city sued Lyte, charging he recommended projects from  which he stood to benefit financially. The city's suit claims Lyte owes  Irwindale more than $1 million in commissions he received on redevelopment  projects.  </P></p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (11): Payment guarantees a step nearer - Jon Marks and Kevin Godier say an EBRD move to provide guarantees against non-payment by Macedonia is an important step for exporters trying to secure payment in difficult markets / Credit watch A Dollars 10m trade facility provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for Macedonia marks a small, but potentially significant step forward for exporters trying to secure letter of credit (l/c) and other payments guarantees in difficult markets. The EBRD facility provides guarantees against the non-payment of l/cs confirmed by four correspondent banks on the Skopje-based Komercijalna Banka: Deutsche Bank, Swiss Bank Corporation, Turkiye Garanti Bankasi and Citibank. L/cs are a standard trade instrument around the world, but can be hard to secure in economies with poor credit ratings, where banks are loth to build up even the most short-term exposure. 'The reality, based on western risk perceptions, is that in countries like Macedonia many banks need at least 100 per cent cash collateral for l/cs,' says David Hexter, head of the EBRD's financial institutions group. The EBRD, like other multilateral institutions, is not a natural alternative supplier of export credits. Only minimal amounts of this form of financing is available to more difficult markets - and after a period of debate over how best to stimulate trade flows. However, the general principle of trade facilitation allowing the EBRD to intervene in trade finance has been accepted, Mr Hexter says. The EBRD guarantee makes confirmation a more attractive prospect for correspondent banks. It should help to build confidence in, and new contacts for financial institutions such as Komercijalna Banka, whose opportunities to develop trade are diminished by wider risk considerations. Similar facilities could follow in Russia and Belarus. The EBRD trade facilitation project focuses on a key problem: how to build capacity to secure commercial deals in difficult markets. Even in countries with more established credit ratings, there may be limited capacity to provide the support needed to allow adequate flows of imports. It is often necessary to shop around to find a bank which will open an l/c, or to find a forfaiter or another specialist trade financier to facilitate a deal. A good indicator of capacity and country risk perceptions is whether forfaiters are prepared to provide financing. Forfaiting is a specialised trade finance instrument. The forfaiter, usually a bank, buys the exporter's debt at a discount, providing cash up-front and reducing the exporter's risk to zero. To do this, the forfaiter must be attracted by the margins offered and see repayment prospects as a 'good risk'. Usually, the longer the maturity (repayment period) the forfaiter is prepared to buy, the better the risk. Banks and specialist trade finance houses, such as forfaiters, make the following country observations: Colombia is attractive to banks, who are increasingly prepared to confirm l/cs of over 360 days. Forfaiters will finance deals of up to three years. Ecuador: securing confirmation for even sight (immediate payment) l/cs is problematic until wider debt problems are overcome, but a few market specialists may back 180-day deals. Venezuela: the collapse of Banco Latino in January has reinforced bankers' caution about doing even short-term deals. These are mainly limited to the largest five banks and the best-known corporates. Forfaiters may provide up to one-year financing, but the market is cautious. South-east Asia is another focus for the emerging markets boom, but trade financiers generally tend to be more cautious than the investment community and funding capacity may be limited. Vietnam continues to excite exporters but banks are less enthusiastic while payment and exchange delays of up to five months remain. An overhaul of the banking system is under way and Standard Chartered Bank already reports significant improvements in handling l/c business. Laos: smaller short-term deals are possible. Barclays Bank is among those opening Laotian Bank for Foreign Trade l/cs (up to 90 days) for consumer goods. Cambodian l/cs may be confirmed by specialists, with Asian banks taking a lead, but capacity to do deals is constrained. India continues to win praise from bankers for its economic reform and, while l/cs (usually sight drafts of up to 180 days) remain the norm for trade transactions, private importers are increasingly buying goods without l/cs. In the Middle East and North Africa, the increase in oil prices recorded in June has come too late to improve the outlook for the most indebted countries. Iran continues to arrange bilateral reschedulings of l/cs and insured debt with its leading creditors. Agreement has been reached on debt worth more than Dollars 6bn, usually following the pattern of a ground-breaking German rescheduling. Accords are expected soon with France and Italy. Algeria has agreed to reschedule its Dollars 14.5bn official debt with the Paris Club of creditor governments. This will provide an estimated Dollars 5.3bn debt relief in the year to May 1995. Substantial new funds from the IMF, World Bank, EU and other institutions, and Ffr6bn in fresh export credits from France are in the pipeline.</p>

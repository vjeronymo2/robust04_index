			<p>BFN     [Text] A key coalition figure was responsible for making  public the U.S. drug charges against a Chat Thai MP to discredit  the biggest opposition party for fear it would replace his own  party in Government, an opposition source alleged yesterday.    The source said the resurrection of the U.S. Drug  Enforcement  Administration marijuana-trafficking charges against Chat Thai  MP Thanong Siriprichaphong were "timely" as they came amid  speculation that the Chat Thai Party under new leader Banhan  Sinlapa-acha might be considered to replace some coalition  partners.    The source, who is close to both Chat Thai and Chat  Phatthana  leaders, said the DEA charges against Mr Thanong lodged with the  Office of the Narcotics Control Board [ONCB] late last year and  with the Office of the Supreme Attorney-General two months ago  were "dug up and publicized" to serve the coalition party's  political survival.    The DEA has been asking Thai authorities to seize the assets  of Mr Thanong, nicknamed Po Pet, in Thailand under a Thai-U.S.  legal agreement. His property in the U.S. has already been  seized.    "It was not news today as it all happened months ago. But he  was smart enough to dig it up and try to tarnish Chat Thai so  his party would continue to remain with the coalition," said the  opposition source.    He said Phalang Tham deputy leader Prasong Sunsiri should be  asked for more information about the Thanong drug case. Dubbed  Thailand's CIA chief, Foreign Minister Prasong was formerly  secretary-general of the National Security Council.    Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong yesterday said the charges  against Mr Thanong had tarnished the reputation of all MPs.    He said it would be up to the Chat Thai Party to issue a  clarification and decide what to do with the MP.    Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan said the incident was a  personal affair but it put the reputation of the entire nation  at stake.    Mr Banhan said he had asked Mr Thanong, who was somewhere in  his constituency of Nakhon Phanom yesterday, to rush to Bangkok  today and address a press conference to clear himself of the  charges.    He said he had asked the ONCB and several other agencies  about the DEA charges against Mr Thanong but none could confirm  the Chat Thai MP was guilty.    The Chat Thai secretary-general who is set to assume the  party leadership Saturday, said Mr Thanong had told him over the  telephone he was innocent of all the DEA charges.    Mr Banhan said the charges were a personal matter involving  Mr Thanong and the party would not do anything to protect him if  he is found guilty.    But he said it was "possible" the whole thing was simply a  rumor designed for political purposes.    Mr Banhan said he knew something about the drug scandal but  could not say anything for lack of hard evidence.    "There are so many rumors in Thailand but we are never moved  by them," he said.    The case was not discussed at the weekly luncheon of  opposition leaders yesterday, according to Social Action Party  secretary-general Chaloem Yubamrung.    SAP leader Montri Phongphanit said he wondered if the recent  bombings in the South were the work of the coalition rather than  the Opposition.    "I wonder if the coalition partners might be trying to  topple  one another through these bombings in the South. This came to  me after all the accusations that the Opposition is trying to  overthrow the Government," he said.    Pol Capt Chaloem said there was not a single opposition MP  in  the South.    Chart Thai leader Praman Adireksan complimented the police  for having arrested a woman in connection with the bombing at a  railway station in Nakhon Si Thammarat on April 23 which killed  three people and wounded 18 others.</p>

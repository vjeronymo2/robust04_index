			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Technology: Cutting the cord - Japan's handy phone system may become the pan-Asian standard The government of Hong Kong this summer became the first outside Japan to opt for Japan's Personal Handy Phone System. Hong Kong's decision to go ahead with PHS instead of rival systems even precedes Japan's formal adoption of its own system. Not that there are any doubts that PHS - the latest attempt to provide wireless personal communications at costs low enough for most people in developed nations - will begin operations in Japan early next year. Most Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers (including Toshiba, Sanyo, Casio, Mitsubishi, Nippondenso, Aiwa, JVC, Kenwood and Sony) have produced telephones for the new system and Matsushita has had a PHS-compatible cordless phone on the market since April. Japan's government is developing a proposal which, if accepted by its neighbours, will make PHS the pan-Asian standard for wireless communications. It would be hard to come up with an example of a product that has generated so much enthusiasm and national commitment so far ahead of official approval, let alone market acceptance. PHS may just turn out to be the 'killer product' that Japan's high-technology industries need to disperse the clouds over the Japanese economy since the boom of the late 1980s. The roots of the PHS concept can be traced back to the first cordless telephones of the 1970s. Dubbed CT1, these early attempts to cut the cord were limited to a range of only a few yards. But the second generation CT2 technology gave cordless telephone users a wider range of several hundred feet. PHS aims to break the constraints and allow users to roam anywhere within a few hundred feet of cell stations installed and operated by service providers. There have been previous attempts to achieve that goal, including the Telepoint system tried with little success in the UK and Hong Kong and the Digital European Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) system. Hong Kong's geography is particularly well suited to PHS technology, which is based on much smaller cells than existing cellular telephone systems. Countries such as the US or Australia have large areas that must either be covered with large numbers of unprofitable cell stations or left as holes in the system. The small area of Hong Kong, on the other hand, requires a relatively small number of cells for complete coverage. Japan is aiming for only 50 per cent coverage of its population in the first five years of the PHS service. When used near its base station, a personal handy phone functions as a cordless telephone and is billed as if it were any other home or office telephone. Out of range, however, the handy phone switches to the nearest cell station. Like a cellular phone, it can originate or receive calls as long as it remains within range of a cell station, but it cannot be used in cars and other fast-moving vehicles. In return for that shortcoming, it enjoys two important benefits. The first is drastically reduced cost: calls can be made and received at about a third of the cost of cellular services. That fact alone has led to projections that 90 per cent of the population of developed countries would subscribe to the system. The second benefit is a very wide usable bandwidth. Unlike cellular phones, which use much of their available bandwidth to provide the fast cell-to-cell switching required for communication from moving vehicles, PHS has sufficient bandwidth for multimedia use. According to Sachio Semmoto, co-founder of the DDI telecommunications company and a pioneer of PHS, the personal handy phone opens the door for small operators to compete with telephone and cable television companies that have wired infrastructures in place. This month, a Tokyo cable operator will launch the first tests of PHS for wireless multimedia applications. Fifteen ground stations will be built for the test, connected to the Tokyu Cable Television network and then tied to the switchers of the Tokyo Telecommunication Network. Other Tokyo-based companies involved in the project include Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Tokyo Electric Power and Tokyu. The ability of PHS to transmit multimedia data is especially important to many areas in China and south-east Asia that lack a copper telecommunications infrastructure, let alone the 'fibre to the home' that technologically advanced nations are talking about. PHS offers the potential of moving into the multimedia age using wireless technology. But there have been some false starts. Hong Kong had an earlier, unsatisfactory experience with the Telepoint system and its CT2 technology. The Hong Kong telecommunications authority chose PHS over DECT and the American B-CDMA systems. The decision was largely based on the results of Japanese field trials that have been under way in Sapporo and Tokyo since last autumn. The Tokyo trials will finish at the end of September, but in Sapporo 98.7 per cent of male non-business users said they wanted to use a handy phone as soon as commercial service begins. Female non-business users were only slightly less enthusiastic at 97.5 per cent. Hong Kong decided on PHS after the Japanese system was promoted by Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and a consortium of 28 companies including Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, DDI, Kokusai Denshin Denwa, NEC, Nippon Motorola and Sweden's Ericsson. Hong Kong, which has already asked MPT for technical assistance in introducing the system, will be able to accommodate approximately 6m subscribers within its confined geographical area by allocating the same 1,895-1,918.1 MHz band that Japan will use for its system. Other technical issues such as voice transmission speed and switch specifications have yet to be decided. Licences will be awarded to telecommunications carriers in the first quarter of 1995 and the Hong Kong service is expected to begin by late summer or early autumn. MPT hopes that Hong Kong will be the first of many Asian governments to adopt PHS. At the end of August, the ministry set up a task force to promote the acceptance of a single wireless communications standard throughout Asia. Called the Office of Multimedia Mobile Communications Promotion, the task force will begin by establishing a multimedia mobile communications study group to evaluate the feasibility of establishing PHS as that standard. The ministry's goal is to promote the development of a multimedia information infrastructure for Asia. Wireless technology is essential because most Asian countries are not expected to create a 'hard-wired' infrastructure until well into the next century at the earliest.</p>

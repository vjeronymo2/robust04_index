			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (18): Hopes for stability - World Markets / The recovery in the US is tentative At the end of July, McDonnell Douglas, the world's largest manufacturer of military aircraft, put its competitors on notice that it had no intention of leaving the commercial end of the business, despite its withering share of a shrinking market. The St Louis-based company announced that it would offer its customers a new 100-seat passenger jet known as the MD-95, taking the first step towards full-scale production of the short-haul jetliner. By diversifying its civilian product range, McDonnell Douglas hopes to begin reversing a decline that has seen its commercial production rate shrivel by 75 per cent in just three years. The decision to proceed with the MD-95 is a good illustration of how the US aerospace industry as a whole is struggling to cope with a severe cyclical downturn which began in 1990. Last year, the net rate of orders for all manufacturers - defined as new orders minus cancellations - reached a 20-year low, while the US industry's total workforce sank 32 per cent below its peak of 1.33m, reached in 1989. In terms of orders, a tentative recovery appears to be under way. In terms of deliveries, the numbers are only now touching bottom. In 1995, production is expected to stabilise at this year's projected level of 465 aircraft - down from 844 three years ago, according to Moody's Investors Service. Boeing, which still commands a dominant 63 per cent of the commercial market, projects its 1993 deliveries at 260, well below its 1992 level of 442. McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group hardest hit by the contraction, is well aware that it can no longer count on the Pentagon to help offset downcycles on the civilian side. The easing of international tensions in the 1990s, coupled with stepped-up political pressure to cut the massive US budget deficit, have all but assured that the bounty reaped during the Reagan military build-up will never return. Indeed, the Clinton administration has accelerated the timetable for a downsizing process which began at the end of the cold war. It projects the Defense Department's outlays at Dollars 233.7bn in fiscal 1997, nearly 21 per cent lower than the high-water mark reached in fiscal 1989. By contrast, the final Bush projection for fiscal 1997 was a relatively hefty Dollars 273.7bn. The response of the aerospace industry to this unprecedented challenge is well documented. A wave of market-driven consolidation has swept over the industry since 1991, forcing companies either to seek a leading position in a particular segment through acquisitions, or to sell off their marginal operations to a competitor seeking to do the same. Some companies, such as Lockheed and Martin Marietta, have become aggressive buyers, while General Dynamics, General Electric and others have sought to limit their exposures to shrinking military allocations. The latest twist in the industry's reshaping came in April, when Northrop won a month-long bidding war with Martin Marietta to acquire Grumann, a Long Island group specialising in defence electronics. The move, which carried a Dollars 2.17bn price-tag, was seen as a last-ditch effort by Northrop to thwart the possibility of its own takeover. By and large, defence contractors assured their continued profitability by reshuffling the business portfolios. McDonnell Douglas, which has stayed out of the fray, is an exception. Still, its defence business remains on solid footing. The division, which makes the F/A-18 and F-15 fighter jets, as well as the controversial C-17 transport, recently posted record operating earnings for the three months to the end of June. On the commercial side, its position is decidedly more precarious, with production plunging to 48 aircraft last year, from 169 in 1991. Prudent cost-cutting has enabled the business to remain marginally profitable, however. The announcement of a Dollars 2bn order from Saudia, the state-run carrier of Saudia Arabia, this spring was timely. Its factories at Long Beach, California, are steadily whittling down the backlog of unfilled orders for its larger three-engine MD-11 jetliner and modern versions of its venerable DC-9. (The lion's share of the Saudi order - 46 aircraft worth Dollars 4bn - went to Boeing.) The new MC-95 is a variant which fits into a crucial market niche. With US carriers emulating the success of Southwest Airlines and other profitable operators, many of them are likely to scrap their hub-and-spoke flight networks in favour of point-to-point flying. It is a strategy sure to accelerate orders of smaller aircraft, with 100 seats or less. The conundrum facing McDonnell, however, is that the market has been flooded with new aircraft over the past five years, at a time when world air capacity has expanded twice as fast as traffic. The result is a huge stockpile of used aircraft waiting to be put back into service when demand picks up. To make matters worse, air traffic is expected to recover more slowly than in past cycles, with slow economic growth forecast for the late 1990s. As a consequence, Moody's expects a 22 per cent increase in annual aircraft deliveries from 1993 to 2002. Though that level of growth appears to be sufficient, an unprecedented number of aircraft programs will compete for a piece of the pie. The most promising - and most risky - of these programmes is Boeing's B-777, the largest twin-engine airplane ever built. The 400-seat wide-body, which cost Dollars 4.5bn to develop, is scheduled to begin commercial flights next May. 'The question is, will everything go as planned,' says Mr Jack Modzelewski, an analyst with PaineWebber, the New York securities house. 'If the planes don't ship, Boeing may have a few billion dollars worth of inventories stacking up very fast.' About 145 of the flying behemoths, at Dollars 135m each, are already on the order books, but the Seattle aerospace giant needs twice as many to recoup its investment. To encourage demand, Boeing has requested US regulators to allow the aircraft, which initially will have a range of 4,600 miles, to fly over the oceans immediately, without the normal trial period over land. The waiver has raised heated opposition. The world's biggest aerospace group can ill afford a setback. Net income in the second quarter was down 48 per cent from the 1993 period, and would have come in lower if not for an unexpected tax break. For the year, revenues are expected to reach Dollars 21bn, about a third of the 1992 level. Mr Modzelewski, among others, doubts whether its annual orders will return to the 400-plane level before the turn of the century.</p>

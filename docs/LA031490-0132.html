			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ILLNESS FORCES CARL TO THE SIDELINE;  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL: FORMER MATER DEI PLAYER HAS TO SIT OUT SENIOR YEAR AFTER SECOND  BOUT OF MONONUCLEOSIS. HE'S HOPING TO RESUME ATHLETIC CAREER AT LOYOLA  MARYMOUNT.  </P> <P> Greg Carl, one of the top high school baseball players in Orange County,  transferred from Mater Dei High School before this season, but he won't be  playing for his new school.  </P> <P> Carl, a third-team all-Southern Section and a first-team selection on The  Times' All-County list last year as a junior, left Mater Dei in January after  doctors told him he needed rest to recover from his second bout of  mononucleosis in 1989.  </P> <P> Carl is working in a home-study curriculum administered by Horizon High, a  school run by the Orange County Department of Education that offers no athletic  program. The curriculum does offer Carl the chance to get his high school  diploma and maintain the hope that he will be able to attend Loyola Marymount  on a baseball scholarship.  </P> <P> As the Monarchs' leadoff batter last year, Carl stole a school-record 20 bases  and batted nearly .500. But in the last few regular-season games and during the  Monarchs' three games in the Southern Section playoffs, Carl didn't steal any  bases. No one realized it at the time but his unusual lack of base-running  aggressiveness was an indication that he was running out of steam.  </P> <P> The week after Mater Dei lost to eventual champion El Dorado in the  quarterfinals of the Division 5-A playoffs, Carl was diagnosed as having  mononucleosis.  </P> <P> "We're going to miss the leadership he would have given," Mater Dei Coach Bob  Ickes said. "We're going to miss the work ethic he had."  </P> <P> Carl's work ethic may have been just the thing that has put him in his current  situation. He said he kept himself awake nights last season thinking about the  game the next day. "With his hard work and everything, it just wore him down  and his body couldn't take it," Ickes said. "It just pushed him too far past  the point, and I think it just wore him down physically and mentally."  </P> <P> In June, doctors told Carl he contracted the disease early in the season. But  he said it only affected him during the last few regular-season games and the  three playoff games. Until he started to really feel sick, Carl said he was too  excited about the season to notice his illness. "When you start playing  baseball your adrenaline goes so you don't feel it during the game," he said.  "You don't feel it before the game, you don't feel it after the game, you feel  it when you wake up in the morning, the first part of the day and really late  at night (when) you wake up and you can't sleep."  </P> <P> Heeding his doctor's advice, Carl didn't play baseball in the summer. There  were weeks when he was so weak he couldn't get out of bed.  </P> <P> In the fall, he started training with the baseball team at Mater Dei.  </P> <P> "I got right into baseball after the summer," Carl said. "I did everything else  I was supposed to do, ran hard, worked hard and all this stuff, and it was just  too early."  </P> <P> "(Coach Ickes would) always tell me to take it easy but you know you can't do  that," Carl said.  </P> <P> Despite Carl's efforts, Ickes said, he wasn't the athlete he used to be. Where  he used to lead the Monarchs' training runs, he now struggled to keep up.  </P> <P> "You could tell he didn't have the strength he had in the past," Ickes said.  </P> <P> The baseball games he played for a scout team affiliated with the San Francisco  Giants also took their toll and eventually Carl ran himself down again. "We'd  play at night and it would be wet," he said. "I think the first time I got sick  we didn't think anything of it, but then I kept getting sick every week."  </P> <P> In January, doctors told Carl he had mononucleosis again. The virus that causes  the disease, they told him, can stay in a body for six or seven months and  because he wore himself down, his resistance was low. The prescription was  rest, away from the demands of athletics.  </P> <P> Despite Carl's medical problems, Loyola Marymount Coach Chris Smith still wants  to offer a scholarship to Carl if he can meet the school's admission standards.  Smith said he doesn't care that Carl can't play his senior season.  </P> <P> "It's so disappointing (for Carl)," Smith said. "The only thing I've tried to  make him understand is, 'Hey, your life's not over because you miss one high  school season.' The best thing he can do is get healthy. This doesn't mean he's  not going to be a great baseball player."  </P> <P> However, Smith said, he has some questions about the manner in which Carl  became ill.  </P> <P> "Maybe he needs to rest some," Smith said. "He's got an awful lot of energy,  maybe he needs to back off a bit."  </P> <P> Carl, 17, is trying to relax. He says he will not repeat his mistakes,  promising to get enough sleep and eat proper meals. Thursday, he will have his  tonsils removed, which should relieve the sore throats that have plagued him.  </P> <P> Although he feels weak because he has been inactive since late December, Carl  is ready to start getting in shape. After he was found to be free of the virus  that causes mononucleosis last week, Carl was cleared to exercise.  </P> <P> He said he is not rushing to get in shape as he did in the fall. This time, he  is leisurely hitting off a tee and throwing himself ground balls in his back  yard.  </P> <P> "I'm taking it slow, real slow," Carl said.  </P> <P> Until doctors give him clearance to play, Carl is keeping occupied by working  on his truck and talking to the mechanics at a local automotive shop. He also  helps his mother with the household chores and works two to three hours a day  on his school work.  </P> <P> "When you have to sit home and do nothing, it's no fun," Carl said. "It's hard  because you know your buddies are out there practicing, hitting, fielding  ground balls, laughing and having fun, and you're not.  </P> <P> "But you learn to handle it, I guess. What else can you do?"  </P></p>

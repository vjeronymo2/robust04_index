			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Spain has a head start on Delors plan for job creation Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, who is grappling with the worst unemployment record in the European Union, has only an academic interest in discussing Mr Jacques Delors' white paper on competitiveness, growth and job creation at today's Brussels summit, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. This is because the Spanish leader has already begun to implement many measures advocated by Mr Delors. As Spain enters its second year of recession, Mr Gonzalez has unveiled a legislative package that aims to curb union bargaining power, reduce costs of hiring and firing, make it easier to relocate employees and make job classifications more flexible. The government also plans to peg wage rises to below the inflation rate over the next three years. Parliament will debate a draft law to deregulate labour laws when it reassembles after Christmas. A law which came into effect this week introduces an apprenticeship scheme for under-25s, who will get less than the minimum wage for three years, and removes impedi- ments to part-time work. But the Brussels discussion will help Mr Gonzalez to sell his package to Spaniards. 'The white paper is a useful umbrella to withstand the storm,' said a diplomat. The main critics, the unions, accuse the government of creating 'junk jobs' and are planning a 24-hour general strike next month. The government is determined to push its reforms through. It believes the malaise afflicting the EU economy is sharper in Spain, where labour market rigidities are deeply ingrained and labour costs are considered to have risen faster than elsewhere.</p>

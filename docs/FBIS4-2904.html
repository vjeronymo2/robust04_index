			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lu Te-yun (4151 1795 0336): "Mainland China </F> Buys Three K-Class Submarines From Russia"]    [Text] Taipei--The age in which noises like the sounds of  drums and gongs made by mianland Chinese submarines will soon be  over. Overseas information shows that mainland China has  ordered three large kilo-class K110 diesel-powered attack  submarines from Russia. Their operational level of silence is  quite high, and they will constitute a threat to shipping safety  in Taiwan waters and the entire western Pacific.    Sources pointed out that the unit price of the three K110  submarines ordered by the mainland is possibly around $250  million, and three quarters of the payment will be made in the  form of barter trade. The mainland also used this form for most  of the payment in buying 26 Su-27 fighter planes from Russia.  Since this transaction includes importing Russian technology  and personnel to develop the capacity to produce K-class  submarines, the main force of submarines using traditional  motive power of the mainland navy may possibly be K-class  submarines.    However, Russia is not satisfied with the mainland's "buying  only" three submarines and is ready to ask the mainland to buy  more "to show sincerity," and may expresse reservations about  the transfer of technology during the upcoming visit to Russia  of Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission  and admiral of the mainland navy.    A national report published at the end of March this year  predicted that the mainland may put the K-class submarines on  the list of arms to be obtained from Russia. However, when  asked about the matter, Taipei naval officers were still quite  surprised and pointed out that at present the mainland has only  six "quite modern" Han-class nuclear-powered attack submarines  and that although it has over 80 Ming-class (model 035) and  R-class (model 033) traditional diesel-powered submarines, more  than half of them cannot not perform on the high seas, and they  are old and make a great deal of noise in operation. If in  addition to the nuclear-powered submarines, the mainland obtains  K-class submarines from Russia, and if Taipei wants to carry out  a counter-blockade to safeguard shipping, the two existing  Stegosaur submarines are not enough in terms of fighting  capacity.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Pilot job match schemes extended - Unemployed The chancellor announced the extension of one of the most novel of the back-to-work schemes aimed at giving the long-term unemployed a second chance. The job matching schemes, pioneered by two Training and Enterprise Councils at the request of the Department of Employment, give people who have been jobless for more than two years Pounds 50 a week for six months if they obtained a part-time job or move into self-employment. It is called 'job match' because the Tecs unite hopeful job applicants with employers willing to give them work. Mr Kenneth Clarke announced yesterday that the scheme was to be extended to other areas to take on 3,000 people a year for the next three years, at a cost of Pounds 5m a year. Mr David Rossington, chief executive of Lincolnshire Tec, which piloted schemes with Aztec - which covers Kingston, Surrey - said the scheme arose out of a Department of Employment plea for initiatives to help the long-term unemployed. He said: 'We aimed to encourage two things. We wanted people either to build up a portfolio of part-time jobs that could equate to a full-time job at the end of the day or to work their way into full-time employment.' Portfolio working is one an employment concept of the 1990s. The thinking is that if people cannot find a full-time job, they might build their own job by a series of part-time and casual appointments. Lincolnshire Tec, which has attracted 350 starters among the long-term unemployed, paid them Pounds 50 a week for the first six months. Mr Rossington that after 50 initial dropouts, only 14 others had gone back on the dole. The Tec also gave out Pounds 300 worth of training vouchers. The Aztec scheme provided 100 opportunities at Pounds 70 a week for the first 20 weeks and Pounds 40 a week for the final six weeks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Weekly Political Newsletter" by Dr. Mohammad </F> Javad Larijani, Tehran Majles deputy and head of the Islamic  Majles Foreign Affairs Committee: "Stupidity"]    [Text] 1. Two important issues were discussed at the  recent meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign  ministers. One was how Israel would be permitted entry into the  region, and the other was what policy these countries would  adopt toward Iraq. It is interesting to note that the two  issues are ultimately interrelated!    2. The United States is closely following the issue of  Israel's entry into the region and Israel is also awaiting the  decision impatiently. During the course of the current talks,  Israel will only take steps to help it make major gains toward  an extensive presence in the Arab (and Islamic) world,  especially in the Persian Gulf region!    3. Why should Israel enter the Persian Gulf region? It is  obvious that the various parties involved would supply different  answers to this question. For Israel, it is an opening to the  Arab and Islamic world, in addition to the immense oil  resources. The people in these regional countries have not  evolved any cohesive national identity; they are merely  naturalized in those countries, which were born from the unclean  womb of British colonialism. Even today, their affairs are  directed by other hands. This is why entry into this region is  easier than into Egypt, Syria, Algeria, or similar countries.    It was a great achievement for the United States to keep the  current regime in Iraq in the present disgraceful circumstances.  Every time the U.S. wishes to intimidate the regional rulers and  to shovel in their wealth, it just smiles in the direction of  the Iraqi regime and this immediately instills fear in the  regional rulers and gives them nightmares. The statement issued  at the latest GCC foreign ministers' session in Riyadh clearly  shows their psychological state.    In other words, what has transpired in Iraq has not only  destroyed the longstanding prestige and sovereignty of that  country, but has also dragged the entire Arab region of the  Persian Gulf into the jaws of the United States.    4. This fragile status quo is fraught with danger, and it  can very easily get out of control, as in Somalia. Therefore,  the Zionists are to be brought in in order to help stabilize  conditions in the region. In other words, the Zionist element  will have to do the following:    First: Prevent all ties between the regional Arab countries  and Iran.    Second: Keep a watchful eye on conditions in Iraq and  escalate dangerous crises!    Third: Plan and direct changes in the regional governments,  particularly in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab  Emirates.    In my view, this is the minimum that the United States  expects from Israel. It is obvious that extensive benefits from  generous "pockets" and unlimited resources of the region will  accrue to the United States.    5. What is the outlook for the future? The Islamic world  will never accept the Zionist entity. Even if this element is  forcibly thrust down its throat today, it will be spat out even  more forcefully tomorrow or in the near future! This trend can  be easily perceived in the nexus of the deep and extensive  social and political events currently taking place in the  Islamic world.    If our friends in the Persian Gulf littoral countries are  prudent and rely on expediency instead of being willful, they  will realize that paving the way for Israel's ingress into the  region would be tantamount to striking at their own roots! They  will not only be consigning the region's resources to  destruction but their own existence as well! Why have you let  Zionism dominate the House of God and now strive to pave the way  further? Regardless of religious considerations, have you even  thought about preserving your own power?</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KARL WEBER; LONGTIME RADIO ACTOR  </P> <P> Karl Weber, a mainstay on many of the most popular radio shows of the wartime  and postwar years, whose resonant voice later was heard in commercials for the  presidential campaigns of Lyndon B. Johnson and Nelson A. Rockefeller, has died  in a Boston hospital.  </P> <P> Weber was 74 when he died July 30 of congestive heart failure near his home in  Edgartown, Mass., where he had continued to record commercials until his death.  </P> <P> A graduate of the University of Iowa, Weber -- possibly best-known as the  husband of "The Woman in White," a medical melodrama of the mid-1940s heard  over NBC -- began as an actor with Midwestern Shakespearean troupes before  settling in Chicago where many of the nation's top radio shows then originated.  </P> <P> He went to New York in the late 1940s to help found New Stages, an off-Broadway  group that helped popularize Jean Paul Sartre's "The Respectful Prostitute"  before it moved to Broadway.  </P> <P> His radio credits over the years included featured roles in "The Strange  Romance of Evelyn Winters" and "Dr. Sixgun" and ongoing performances in "The  Barton Family," "Lone Journey," "The Romance of Helen Trent," "Stepmother" and  "When a Girl Marries."  </P> <P> He also recorded more than 200 books in the Talking Book program of the  American Foundation for the Blind and served as president of the New York  chapter of the Screen Actors Guild from 1968-69.  </P> <P> He is survived by a daughter, two sons, four grandchildren, two  great-grandchildren, two brothers and a sister.  </P></p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / S African parties in pact on talks WHITE and black politicians in South Africa have agreed to resume constitutional negotiations within a month. Agreement was reached, however, only after a preparatory conference in Johannesburg at the weekend agreed to postpone consideration of all potentially contentious issues: a sub-committee must resolve them before the talks can begin. Problems remain over such vital issues as how the talks should be structured, who should attend, who should chair them and what they should be called. Several delegates stressed that the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, which often proved obstructive in a previous round of multi-party talks, demonstrated what one ANC delegate called an 'unusual degree of conciliation'. They said an atmosphere of goodwill and co-operation characterised the closed-door sessions of the two-day talks, which brought together traditional enemies such as the white supremacist Conservative party and the black radical Pan Africanist Congress for the first time. Discussion of constitutional issues, such as whether South Africa should be a federal or unitary state, was also deferred. Delegates to the conference, attended by some 26 political parties from right and left, said the aim was to avoid confrontation in the weekend plenary, and merely to set a deadline (April 5) before which talks must resume. The talks provided evidence of the gap between the 26 parties on constitutional issues, such as the form of the future state, and on the the process of constitution-making.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Teachers oppose truancy tables THE National Association of Head Teachers yesterday urged Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to change his plans for publishing truancy league tables for schools next month. Mr David Hart, the association's general secretary, described the proposed tables as 'dangerously false' because they would be based on how many pupils had missed at least one half-day of school, rather than on the total amount of days missed.</p>

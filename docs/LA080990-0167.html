			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: SONIC DRIVE-INS ARE TEXAS-SIZED BLAST TO THE PAST  </P> <P> As a kid in Texas, I regarded the Sonic Drive-In hickory burgers, cheddar  cheese-drizzled tater nuggets and root beer floats as staples of teen-agers'  diets across the Lone Star State. So, when a Sonic opened in Westminster, you  betcha this misplaced Texan was, like, totally stoked.  </P> <P> Nearly every aspect of this drive-in is perfect. From the Texas-sized drinks  (even the straws are big) to the bodaciously hot-to-handle onion rings, this  restaurant chain's blast to the past is a fun and surprisingly inexpensive  adventure. Pull in underneath the turquoise-and-white canopy and park next to a  red-and-white squawk box. With the sounds of Chubby Checker drifting from the  rafters and hot neon signs screaming "onion rings," you might not be surprised  to find prices that are out of an earlier decade as well. Big burgers run a  couple of bucks, Coney dogs cost a buck and a quarter, fries are pretty cheap  ($1.16) and are cooked in low-cholesterol oil, too. (Some blasts from the  present cannot be avoided when attempting to convince yuppies to order an extra  bag of fries.)  </P> <P> The service is snappy. Red-vested car hops practically sprint to each station  while balancing red trays stacked high with burgers wrapped in foil-paper.  (That's what burger joints used before Styrofoam and other insidious,  multisyllabic containers were invented.)  </P> <P> In the way of extras, for thirst-quenching relief from the heat, try a limeade.  It's a bubbly concoction of lime juice squeezed into club soda and poured over  those little round ice pellets -- nice and cold, very refreshing. And for the  non-frozen yogurt crowd, a Sonic Blast. Take an extra thick milkshake and smash  your favorite candy bar into it. Awesome sugar blast, dude.  </P> <P> Whatever your taste buds crave, if you're hungry and on your way home from the  beach or heading out for a meal, the Sonic Drive-In cooks up mean burgers,  Coney dogs and chicken-fried steak sandwiches that will leave you a-hootin' and  hollerin' under the stars, chowing down in your car to the beat of the Beach  Boys. Sonic Drive-In, 15640 Brookhurst St., Westminster. Open Sundays through  Thursdays, 10 a.m. to midnight; Fridays and Saturdays till 1 a.m. (714)  531-8000.  </P> <P>  Sonic Drive-In, 1632 N. Lemon St., Anaheim. Hours are same as above. (714)  773-0800  </P> <P> APRIL JACKSON  </P></p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Production increase at Honda seen A FIRM prediction that Honda will move fairly quickly to production of 200,000 cars a year at its Pounds 300m plant now under construction at Swindon, Wiltshire - twice the officially-declared capacity - was made yesterday by Professor Garel Rhys, a senior motor industry economist. The forecast was based on the size of component purchases Honda has indicated it will make in Europe, and on the economy of scale disadvantage the plant would otherwise face in comparison with Japanese competitors in the UK. Prof Rhys, of Cardiff Business School, said Honda envisages spending between Pounds 600m and Pounds 800m a year in full production. Toyota was planning spending of about Pounds 700m at its 200,000-cars-a-year plant due to come on stream in Burnaston, Derbyshire, and Nissan Pounds 850m at the 300,000-car-a-year level in Sunderland. Because of this, said Prof Rhys, it was 'virtually inconceivable' that Honda would not move to at least 200,000 units annually, perhaps by the mid-90s.</p>

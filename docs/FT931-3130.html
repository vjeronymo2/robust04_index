			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Brazil moves closer to accord on debt: Most banks agree deal but the IMF remains a serious obstacle THE restructuring of Brazil's commercial debt moved a step nearer yesterday, with financial institutions owed more than 95 per cent of the country's medium-term bank debt agreeing the proposed accord. The achievement of this 'critical mass' will trigger payment of about Dollars 150m of interest owed to banks from the first half of last year. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, which heads the Brazilian bank steering committee, said the accord was 'doing very well'. About 800 financial institutions, accounting for almost 97 per cent of the Dollars 44bn of commercial debt, had assented to the restructuring agreement, which allows banks the choice from six options, he said. Bankers said two issues now had to be tackled:the so-called balance of the deal, and Brazil's relations with the International Monetary Fund. Demanding balance, Brazil has reserved its right to reopen negotiations if too many banks concentrate on the option that would prove most costly to Brazil, the so-called par bond. Mr Pedro Malan, Brazil's chief debt negotiator said: 'We feel that the demand for par bonds has been a bit excessive.' Bankers said the deal would need 'rebalancing' but that this process would be easier than in the recent Argentine agreement. Citibank and some other banks had chosen to make some new loans. The biggest problem remains Brazil's lack of progress with the IMF. A fund delegation yesterday met Mr Eliseu Resende, the new finance minister. An old IMF agreement is in place until August, and although the government has failed repeatedly to meet its targets, this would formally satisfy the requirements of the commercial debt accord. However, a new fund agreement would release money from the IMF, World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank to provide some of the Dollars 3.2bn that Brazil needs for guarantees on instruments to be issued under the accord. The country could use foreign exchange reserves - a healthy Dollars 20bn - to provide a bridge until new funds from the multilateral institutions arrive. This is one issue the banks and government are likely to discuss in the weeks ahead.</p>

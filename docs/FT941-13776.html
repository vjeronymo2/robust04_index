			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Reforms have taken Mexico a long way Sir, In your editorial, 'Strife in Mexico' (January 20), you fail to mention that without the Salinas administration's reforms, long-term financial stability and, therefore, lower-cost, long-term financings would be further unattainable for the population than they are today. Only in the past several years has a 15-year business loan or mortgage been conceivable for any but a small fraction of the population. With or without democratic reform these measures, secured by international treaties, will go a long way to enabling the people in Mexico to put food on their own tables.

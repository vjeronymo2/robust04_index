			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CIVIC PLAYHOUSE'S 'BABY' SCORES AS A VALENTINE FOR YUPPIES  </P> <P> In the program for Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse's "Baby," director Craig V.  Fenter describes the musical this way: "Babies are cute. Babies are fun. Babies  are charming. One would expect a show called 'Baby' to be the same. But . . .  'Baby' is a show about realism (and) life and death issues that touch at the  core of human existence."  </P> <P> That's one interpretation. Another is that "Baby," cynicism aside, is a  precious and fairly naive flattering of parenthood -- bringing up baby as the  fullest of full experiences, a valentine for Yuppies with a mind toward  procreation.  </P> <P> It's the flip side of Christopher Durang's twisted slap at babydom, "Baby With  the Bathwater," recently staged at Orange Coast College just a few blocks away  from the Costa Mesa playhouse.  </P> <P> To be sure, Sybille Pearson's 1978 show does aim for a realistic edge in  places. The three couples the audience is asked to follow -- all white, all  middle-class, by the way -- do have some big problems along the way. Mid-life  crisis brought into focus by a surprise pregnancy, a low sperm count that makes  conception difficult and the possibility of abortion come up.  </P> <P> But as spryly as they surface, they are just as spryly resolved, all to an  effervescent but redundant score that rarely finds the downbeat. We're supposed  to root for these folks all the way through, and Pearson can't let the home  team come up short on any score.  </P> <P> Pearson has organized "Baby" into sort of a three stages of man, at least from  a fertility standpoint: the youngest couple, Danny and Lizzie (Brian Harvey and  Ann Milton),are about 20; the next couple, Nick and Pam (Grant E. Crowl and Pat  Boldt), are around 30, and Alan and Arlene (Bil Barratt and Marisa Froton) are  in their early 40s.  </P> <P> Each, of course, has a different attitude about having a baby, all reflecting  their places in the world. Danny and Lizzie, both college students, are giddy  about the idea but aren't sure what the impact will be; they're kids about to  have a kid.  </P> <P> Nick and Pam, more settled, can't wait to have one, even though Nick keeps  shooting blanks. The most interesting couple is Alan and Arlene, who now must  decide whether having another family (their other children are in college) is  such a good idea at this stage in their lives.  </P> <P> There are many times when Fenter's direction is annoyingly upbeat -- even the  infrequent somber moments have optimistic shadings -- but, in his defense, he  does keep faith with the musical's general tone. Still, the few bits of grit  Pearson tosses in, as when Nick and Pam go through an absurdly complicated  ritual to ensure his meek sperm have a chance to find the target, don't have  the satire they could.  </P> <P> His cast plays it all pretty bouncy, too, often going overboard. But the voices  are generally good, with varying degrees of technique and talent. Milton and  Harvey usually shine the brightest. Fred Genge pleases in a brief appearance as  a hyper obstetrician with faulty eyesight and an even faultier bedside manner.  </P> <P> 'BABY'  </P> <P> A Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse production of Sybille Pearson's musical.

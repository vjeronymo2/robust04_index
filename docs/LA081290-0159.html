			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST MEETS WEST AS 4 GERMAN PARTIES DECIDE ON MERGER;  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION: THE COMBINING OF POLITICAL ORGANS ANTICIPATES AN END TO  PARTITION AFTER ELECTIONS PLANNED FOR LATE THIS YEAR.  </P> <P> The Free Democrats on Saturday merged with three centrist parties of East  Germany to form the first party representing all of Germany. All-German  elections are slated for Dec. 2.  </P> <P> At a special congress in Hanover, the FDP, political base of Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher, was united with the East German Free Democrats, the  Federation of Free Democrats and the German Forum Party.  </P> <P> The new party is called FDP-The Liberals. Outgoing West German FDP Chairman  Otto Graf Lambsdorff, 63, was elected to head the combined all-German party.  </P> <P> In a declaration adopted at the congress, the new party declared that it aims  "to fill German unity with a liberal spirit."  </P> <P> The West German FDP is a junior partner in the Christian Democratic Union-led  coalition of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  </P> <P> Although the FDP seldom gained more than 7% of the votes in West German  elections, it has played a crucial role in helping the majority party form a  coalition. The FDP has been allied with both the Social Democratic Party and  Kohl's CDU.  </P> <P> The CDU and the opposition SPD also intend to merge with their East German  sister parties in September.  </P> <P> The combined parties will face their first test on Oct. 14, when elections are  held in the five states East Germany will form before it politically rejoins  West Germany.  </P> <P> There is growing support in Bonn and East Berlin for having German unification  take place on the day of the state elections.  </P> <P> The Christian Democratic Party, led by Kohl in West Germany and Prime Minister  Lothar de Maiziere in East Germany, both favor unification and all-German  elections on Oct. 14.  </P> <P> The opposition Social Democrats, the second-largest party in both countries,  want unification in September and elections in December, in the hope that a  later elections date might railroad Kohl's quest to head a united Germany and  improve their election chances.  </P> <P> The Social Democrats favor unification as early as possible, but contend that  Kohl wants early elections to avoid the political repercussions of a growing  economic crisis in East Germany.  </P></p>

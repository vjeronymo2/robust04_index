			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Appointments: East thru west, home's best Indulging in its own minor form of devolution, the Royal Bank of Scotland is expanding its treasury and capital markets operations north of the border, putting 45-year-old Scotsman Bill McKay in charge of trading and sales for Scotland. McKay, who set up the bank's trading room in New York in 1978 and later had a stint in Hong Kong, has moved north at a time, he believes, when Scottish fund managers, insurers and industrial companies have advanced hugely in the sophistication of their foreign exchange and interest rate risk management. He will report to Tim Goode, director of treasury and capital markets in London, who says the move demonstrates that 'we plan to have the best treasury and capital markets operation in Scotland'. It has yet to be decided whether the expanded outfit will be centred in Glasgow, with the foreign exchange operations, or in Edinburgh, where sterling money market activities have been located. Proximity to customers is the name of the game, according to McKay - as well as being Scottish. 'All things being equal, most institutions north of the border would rather deal with a Scottish dealing room.' Making his 18 or so dealers as efficient and speedy as the 60 odd traders in London will be part of his task.</p>

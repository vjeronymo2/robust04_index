			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / People: Taylor leaves National Express Keith Taylor resigned yesterday as managing director of National Express, Britain's largest scheduled coach operator, after only a year in the job. The company, which obtained a London Stock Market listing last December, said the reason for Taylor's departure was a difference in management style and minor, internal policy differences. Taylor (right), 45, joined National Express after an early career spent in marketing and product development with Forte and GrandMet. It appears that Taylor's approach to business, honed in large companies, did not match the more entrepreneurial style of the National Express Board. 'We are a very small management team and inevitably someone who has worked in very large companies probably finds the transition rather difficult,' said Adam Mills, deputy chief executive. 'But this is not a one or two-man band. We are very Cadbury.' Mills acknowledged that Taylor's rapid departure might raise questions about the company's recruitment procedures but said it had employed 'a distinguished headhunter and had gone through all the due process'. Mills and Ray McEnhill, chief executive, acquired National Express with the help of venture capital finance after an earlier management and employee buy-out ran into difficulties. They both had a background in the bus industry. Taylor was on a one-year rolling contract so his redundancy payment will not be 'a headline figure', said Mills. Taylor is to stay on to provide advice until March 31 but the company expects to have a new managing director in place by then.</p>

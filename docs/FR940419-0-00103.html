			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;92.205(a)(1), the reference to specific eligible costs at the end of the paragraph is revised to include &sect;&sect;92.206 through 92.209, in accordance with the reorganization of sections dealing with eligible costs, as described in the following preamble paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The listing of eligible costs is reorganized in this rule. Rather than listing all eligible costs at &sect;92.206, eligible costs are listed, starting at &sect;92.206 and continuing through previously reserved &sect;&sect;92.207, 92.208, and 92.209, by the type of cost. Thus, &sect;92.206 now covers only eligible project costs; &sect;92.207 covers eligible administrative and planning costs; &sect;92.208 deals with eligible CHDO operating expense costs; and &sect;92.209 covers eligible costs related to tenant-based rental assistance. Within these sections, clarifying changes are made as explained below. In addition, conforming changes throughout part 92 to reflect the new section numbers of eligible costs are made by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 92.206(a)(2) is amended to permit the refinancing of secured, existing debt on a single family, owner-occupied unit when  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> lending <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  program funds to rehabilitate the unit, if overall housing costs of the borrower will be reduced and made more affordable. This means a PJ can make one loan to the homeowner to repay existing private debt and provide the rehabilitation loan. HOME funds cannot be used to pay the transaction costs of privately refinancing the existing debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 92.206(a)(3) is revised to clarify the eligibility of demolition, utility connections and site improvements associated with new construction and rehabilitation. This section clarifies that off-site utility connections from the property line to the adjacent street are eligible. It also provides that site improvements may include on-site roads and water and sewer lines necessary to the development of the project. The project site is defined as the property, owned by the project owner, upon which the project is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 92.206(c)(5) is clarified by adding the modifier ``project'' before ``operating expenses'' to distinguish these costs from CHDO operating expenses, which are now covered under &sect;92.208.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, a new &sect;92.206(c)(6) makes staff and overhead costs eligible as a ``related soft cost'' of a project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new &sect;92.206(c)(7) is added to make the payment of impact fees that are commonly charged for all projects within a jurisdiction, an eligible cost for new construction and rehabilitation, and the prohibition against impact fees at &sect;92.214(a)(8) is deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 92.206(g) is redesignated as &sect;92.208, and a technical correction is made in this section to change the reference concerning requirements and limitations on the receipt of operating expenses by community housing development organizations from &sect;92.301 (e) and (f) to &sect;92.300 (e) and (f). Capacity building costs under &sect;92.300(b) are also specifically listed as eligible HOME costs in &sect;92.208(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A request was received for clarification of &sect;92.211(a)(2), amended by the December 22,1992 interim rule to implement an HCDA 1992 amendment that replaces the use of the Section 8 waiting list as the selection criterion for families eligible to receive HOME-funded tenant-based rental assistance. This assistance is now provided in accordance with a participating jurisdiction's written tenant selection policies and criteria that are consistent with the purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably related to preference rules established under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et. seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Questions arise because of uncertainty concerning the meaning of ``reasonably related to'' the preference rules under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These preference rules provide for local rental assistance programs in which at least 70% of the families assisted meet Federal preferences and 30% meet local preferences. For example, a Federal preference exists for homeless families. The HOME tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) written selection policy may provide a preference to families that, although not presently homeless, are likely to be homeless in the near future. This may be the case for families in transitional housing, which is provided for only a set time period, or for families living temporarily with relatives or friends. Section 92.211(a)(2) is amended by adding a clarifying sentence to state that ``reasonably related'' means that the PJs may provide TBRA to families who currently meet a Federal preference or who because of circumstances would qualify in the near future for one of the three Federal preferences under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 without tenant-based rental assistance. These preferences are: (1) Families that occupy substandard housing (including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless families); (2) families that are paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent; or (3) families that are involuntarily displaced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were received that objected to the requirements at &sect;92.211(f)(3) that limit a PJ's ability to establish TBRA payment standards based on local market conditions and a determination of rent reasonableness. The Department agrees that participating jurisdictions should be given greater discretion in the implementation of the HOME program, and &sect;92.211(f)(3) is amended accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to several questions concerning eligible acquisition costs, the list of prohibited activities at &sect;92.214 is revised to prohibit the use of HOME funds to acquire property owned by a participating jurisdiction, except for property acquired by the participating jurisdiction with HOME funds, or property acquired in anticipation of carrying out a HOME project. Such a transaction could not be considered a bona fide acquisition, since the participating jurisdiction owns the property and is providing assistance to buy the property. The element of an arm's length transaction is not present. This prohibition is added as paragraph (a)(8), which previously referred to impact fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Fayeds to float House of Fraser store chain: Brothers believe they can repay debts and retain control of Harrods THE House of Fraser department store chain, which includes such names as Army &amp; Navy and Dickins &amp; Jones, is to be floated on the stock market next year. However, the Fayed brothers, who bought the group in 1985 for about Pounds 600m after a bitter battle with Mr Tiny Rowland and his Lonhro conglomerate, are excluding Harrods, the chain's flagship store, from the sale. The brothers believe the flotation of the 59-store chain will enable them to pay off their debts and keep Harrods, always seen as the main object of their takeover of House of Fraser. House of Fraser group denied yesterday that the Fayeds were under financial pressure and said they had arranged a refinancing in April. House of Fraser said the Fayeds had been told by SG Warburg, their advisers, that a flotation was in the best interests of the chain and of the brothers. The group had not ruled out the possibility of a trade sale but 'we are not anticipating that'. Warburg is thought to have valued the stores at more than Pounds 500m, although analysts expressed scepticism at this. Mr Ali Fayed stepped down as chairman of the stores chain yesterday and will be replaced by Mr Brian McGowan, who recently announced he was retiring as chief executive of Williams Holdings at the end of 1993 to spend more time fishing. Yesterday, Mr McGowan, 48, said he was sufficiently convinced of House of Fraser's strengths to postpone his retirement. The flotation of the chain, which stretches from Inverness to Plymouth and has property assets valued at Pounds 250m, is expected by early next summer. The Fayeds will not retain a stake in the stores and their holding company name will be changed. As well as Harrods, the brothers will retain control of Turnbull and Asser, the upmarket shirt-maker, the Kurt Geiger shoe chain, the Barkers shops and office complex in Kensington, the Carlton Highland Hotel in Edinburgh and the Harrods depository in Barnes, west London. A management buy-out of the stores in April is believed to have failed because the management was unable to raise the Pounds 320m asking price. In the same month, the Fayeds sold their 10.6 per cent stake in the Sears retailing group, raising speculation that the group was in financial difficulties with debts of about Pounds 650m. Both Mr McGowan and SG Warburg have made it clear they will resign if the Fayeds try to exert any influence on the House of Fraser stores. Mr McGowan said: 'From today the Fayeds have bowed out. If they try and come back I will resign . . . We are running the House of Fraser as a separate autonomous business.' Before becoming non-executive chairman, Mr McGowan insisted that he should be able to resign without having to give any notice to the Fayeds. 'That preserves my independence,' he said. Mr McGowan plans to add to the board with the appointment of two or three more non-executives over the coming months.

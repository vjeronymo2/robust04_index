That, he stressed, is the acceptable minimum. He praised the  attitude of the Arab and Islamic groups and their full support  for the PLO demands.    It should be noted that the United States and the PLO were  until yesterday evening trying to break the deadlock over the  drafting of a Security Council resolution condemning the  massacre. Two draft resolutions have been submitted to the  Security Council since last Friday. One of them is a  Palestinian draft resolution, supported by the Arab and Islamic  states and also by some other states, requesting protection for  the Palestinians in the occupied territory, in addition to  condemning the massacre and being binding on Israel. The other  is a U.S. draft resolution just condemning the massacre without  any commitment.    The council is supposed to have resumed its consultations  last night. On the Palestinian draft resolution, al-Qudwah told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Our position has, from the first moment,  been that the council should convene officially and pass a  resolution containing the following elements:    1. A clear and strong condemnation of the massacre;    2. Confirmation that the fourth Geneva Convention applies to  all the occupied territory including Jerusalem;    3. A call for a UN presence in the occupied territory to  provide protection for the Palestinian people there;    4. A request that Israel and the occupation forces take  specific measures against the settlers, including disarming them.    He added: "At the beginning the Americans insisted that a  statement by the chairman would be sufficient, but now their  position is gradually drawing closer to ours. We will not  change our position because it is not a tactical position. We  are asking for the minimum." In response to the U.S. position  that what the draft resolution calls for in connection with the  protection point is based on the Declaration of Principles on  Gaza and Jericho and as such is an attempt to expand its scope  prematurely, al-Qudwah said: "My understanding is that there is  no qualitative difference between Gaza and Jericho and the rest  of the occupied territory. There may be a differentiation only  as far as the time factor is concerned, but that does not mean  that there should be discrimination on the principle,  particularly as the Declaration of Princples stipulates that it  is a first step that would extend to all the occupied  Palestinian territory."    On early participation by the Security Council in measures  not agreed on with the Israelis, as the Americans say, the  Palestinian representative declared: "As far as we are  concerned the Security Council was and remains the body solely  responsible for anything connected with Israeli violations of  the fourth Geneva Convention whether there is a peace process or  not. This is based on the understanding we reached with former  U.S. Secretary of State James Baker before the Madrid  conference."    He added: "We are not trying to find an alternative  mechanism to the current peace process, but we stress that the  council's role on matters which only it has the power to  legislate or confirm should be preserved." On the reference to  Jerusalem, he said: "The phraseology regarding it in the draft  resolution cannot be changed at all because that is the same  phraseology used in all the UN General Assembly and Security  Council resolutions since 1967. Any change would mean some kind  of concession and acceptance of the Israeli position on it.  Jerusalem is an integral part of the occupied territory and  nobody can deny our right to it." He added: "As regards the  claim that, having agreed to the postponement of the  negotiations on the status of Jerusalem and the settlements, the  Palestinians should drop their advance demands regarding them --  that claim is rejected. The legal status of the settlements is  still the same, and there has been no political change that  would make it incumbent on us to abandon our position on them.  They remain illegitimate irrespective of when the negotiations  on them take place. The same thing applies to Jerusalem, which  remains an occupied territory regardless of when the  negotiations on its final status take place."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il sent a centenary birthday table to Chong  Chae-myong, an old man residing in Tokchon City, South Pyongan  Province.    The birthday table was conveyed to him on May 21.    Born into a poor peasant family in Chongdo County, North  Kyongsang Province, he barely eked out his livelihood during the  feudal period and under the Japanese imperialist rule as a farm  hand, tenant farmer and day labourer.    He could enjoy a worthy life and happiness only after the  liberation of the country. During the fatherland liberation war  he took an active part in the drive for increased wartime grain  production and in aiding the front. In the postwar period he  was the first to join an agricultural cooperative and worked  hard to reap bumper crops every year.    Now, he has a big family of nearly 50.</p>

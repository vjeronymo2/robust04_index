			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] HANOI, March 25 (AFP) -- Foreigners have stolen at  least 60 confidential files from Vietnamese army archives, the  head of the military security protection department Colonel Cao  Long Hy said in a report here Friday.    The documents, including secret "internal documents," give  details of the history and activities of several branches of the  army dating back to their creation, said Hy in an article  published in the army's daily newspaper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN. The  papers have been taken out of the country by "foreigners" since  the beginning of 1993, he said without identifying the culprits.    Observers say this is the first time that such a  high-ranking  army official has talked publicly of documents being leaked from  military archives and taken abroad. The colonel said bad  management of the print-works and archives, as well as  negligence and the breaking of rules on the protection of  military secrets, had contributed to the disappearance of  certain files.    He said other documents had also vanished but acknowledged  that the reason for their disappearance was not known.    Observers say the files could have been stolen by army  employees to be sold later outside the country.    Colonel Hy said the documents had been "deformed, modified  and re-written" before being published by "hostile foreign  media" organisations, in order to "criticise the `doi moi'  (renovation) policy, to caricature the army's role and to  sabotage Vietnam's relations with other countries in the region."    He called on the army to protect internal secrets and  redouble its vigilance "in the face of sophisticated enemy  manoeuvres and the bad elements of society."    The colonel added that "the enemy takes advantage of  diplomatic, economic, humanitarian and tourism activities, to  examine Vietnam's... politics, economy, defence and security in  order to commit sabotage by establishing contact with  reactionary groups based inside the country".    He said the issue of the protection of state and army  secrets  was a "task which has now become imperative," referring to a  1992 directive on the subject by Vietnam's defence minister.    Conservative elements in Vietnam, especially military  officials, have publicly expressed concern that economic and  political pressure from the West since the lifting of the US  trade embargo last month will destabilize the country.</p>

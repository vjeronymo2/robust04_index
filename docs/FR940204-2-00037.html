The proposed cost of the project will not be point scored. Applicants are advised, however, that notwithstanding the lower relative importance of the cost considerations, the evaluated cost may be the basis for selection. In making the selection decision, the apparent advantages of individual technical and business applications will be weighed against the probable cost to the government to determine whether the application approaches (excluding cost considerations) are worth the probable cost differences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Selection: Applications will be evaluated under the Office of Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy Merit Review of Discretionary Financial Assistance Applications Review Procedures for Solicited Proposals. The Source Selection Official (SO) will make the selection for negotiation and award in accordance with the above evaluation criteria and in a manner that furthers the DOE programmatic goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conditions, Instructions and Notices to Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

Applicants are therefore requested to state on the application cover sheet if they do not consent to an evaluation by such non-government personnel. The applicants are further advised that DOE may be unable to give full consideration to an application submitted without such consent. Information contained in the applications shall be treated in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in 10 CFR 600.18.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE reserves the right to fund, in whole or in part, any, all, or none of the applications submitted in response to this solicitation.

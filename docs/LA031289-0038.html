			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRASH TO MATCH OUR MOUNTAINS: CALIFORNIA'S GROWING WASTE WOE  </P> <P> Public officials throughout California pray for a scientific messiah to rescue  them from the growing garbage crisis. Ideally, the technological rescuer would  recycle California's daily mountains of waste through an inexpensive and  non-polluting process that is unseen, unheard, unsmelled and located in  somebody else's back yard.  </P> <P> "There is no laser beam that zaps waste and makes it go away," reports George  T. Eowan, chief executive officer of the state Waste Management Board. "That's  what everyone is looking for."  </P> <P> Prayers unanswered, state and local officials are at last dealing with  solid-waste as a major, urgent problem. The state board estimates that landfill  capacity will be exhausted for 70% of California in less than eight years.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian announced in his State of the State address that a top  1989 priority is "development of an integrated waste-management proposal,"  working "toward the goal of waste reduction and greater recycling."  </P> <P> Eowan and other specialists plan to present the Legislature with a detailed  proposal later this month. The program is expected to take a carrot-and-stick  approach, forcing each region to take action while providing funds -- perhaps  through a bond issue -- to lighten the fiscal burden on cities and counties.  </P> <P> Traditionally, California depended on landfills or garbage dumps close to urban  areas. The state is so prosperous, it has become the world's foremost throwaway  society, producing more than 40 million tons of waste a year -- about 8 1/2  pounds of waste per day per person, compared with five for the nation as a  whole, three for Canada and two for Japan.  </P> <P> Landfills are now undesirable because they leach toxics that contaminate ground  water and because garbage dumps are no longer acceptable close to developed  areas. Local officials tried to reduce landfill need by exploring  waste-to-energy incineration, a process used extensively in many other parts of  the United States.  </P> <P> Environmentalists protested: Such plants create smog and produce an ash residue  that can contain additional pollutants. Neighborhood groups joined the  opposition. In San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, the waste-to-energy  solution was abandoned. California now has only three fairly small plants in  the City of Commerce, Long Beach and Stanislaus County.  </P> <P> Environmentalists push maximum recycling. But that poses new problems. Some  materials are difficult to reuse. There is no demand for others. Even the  market for newsprint may be fading away. The American Paper Institute, an  industry trade association, predicts that so much old newspaper will soon hit  the market that some of it may have to be dumped in landfills. And the  NIMBYsyndrome -- "not in my back yard" -- now applies to recycling plants and  even drop-off centers.  </P> <P> So "garbology" is a lose-lose issue for politicians. Few state elected  officials have chosen to deal with the subject other than on the safe turf of  recycling. One exception is Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Union City), who  describes the paralysis this way:  </P> <P> "City officials want waste disposal that's cheap and easy but not nearby -- a  patently inconsistent set of objectives. The disposal industry wants to cut its  legal exposure by surrounding landfills with buffer zones. But it doesn't want  to buy the land. Environmentalists oppose burning and landfilling, and they  support recycling. But today only 10% of our trash is recycled and nobody wants  to wade around in the other 90% until recycling can handle more."  </P> <P> She has come up with her own acronym,TWABAL -- "there will always be a  landfill" -- to help put the issue in focus. She says it is unrealistic to  expect Californians to learn the lost art of efficient consumption and recycle  to the maximum. State growth and continued use of non-recyclable materials  guarantee that dumping grounds will always be needed; even with incineration,  the ash must be buried.  </P> <P> Five years ago, companies selling waste-to-energy technology thought California  garbage would turn to gold. They spent fortunes trying to sell their technology  in metropolitan areas. Now, having been defeated all over the map, the industry  has essentially written off California. Wheelabrator Environmental Systems,  after investing several million dollars in San Diego, announced withdrawal from  the California market. Ogden Martin Systems built the Stanislaus plant but lost  the big prize in Los Angeles; now it concentrates on other states.  </P> <P> Ogden's Joey Garcia claims that California will one day face the choice between  traditional landfills and waste-to-energy plants. Given that choice, surveys by  the National Solid Waste Management Assn. show that the public will choose  incineration. Garcia offers yet another acronym to explain why local officials  have delayed the day of decision: NIMEY -- "not in my election year." NIMEY no  longer applies to Deukmejian, who has already announced he will not seek a  third term; that may explain why his Administration is suddenly attempting to  take the lead on the issue.  </P> <P> The governor a few weeks ago told The Times' George Skelton that he wants to  abandon landfilling and employ incineration or "some other form of destroying  waste." What form? "I don't know. I'm not an engineer. You know the way they do  things now. They come along with lasers or something and all of a sudden, zap,  it's gone," he said. Meanwhile, his aides try to develop a program that will  work until the zapper arrives.  </P> <P> Even in the tightly controlled Deukmejian Administration, mounting waste has  produced mounting internal conflict. Rivalry developed between the Department  of Conservation, which runs the statewide container recycling program, and the  Solid Waste Management Board, which generally supervises garbage-disposal  programs. The governor recently ordered the agencies to cooperate because he  wants his Administration to speak with one voice before the Legislature.  </P> <P> Like local officials, the state has been looking for an easy solution through  technology. Meanwhile, Eowan reports some scientific advances that may relieve  a little pressure. Two examples:  </P> <P>  -- German and French firms have developed techniques -- yes, using lasers --  that sort materials by color, texture, weight, toxicity and other factors.  Plastics, in heavy demand by recyclers, can be isolated by this technology. On  the downside, the process is very expensive, untested in the United States and  still doesn't dispose of non-recyclables.  </P> <P>  -- A Minnesota plant is taking shredded tires, adding chemicals and producing  molded consumer products. Eowan thinks this could at least solve the problem of  discarded tires.  </P> <P> Minus a major technological breakthrough and with opposition to incineration  still strong, some communities look for landfills far from the urban centers.  </P> <P> California is growing at the rate of 600,000 residents a year; there isn't much  land left that won't soon be in somebody's back yard or in a protected  open-space zone. One day state and local officials will be forced to give  citizens what they don't want -- refuse restrictions and much higher garbage  bills.  </P> <P> The problem piles so high, Eowan warns that Californians can't pick and choose  between alternate solutions: "We've got to do everything," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Minister hints at M-way permits MOTORISTS were yesterday given a strong hint that the government is shifting away from electronic tolls towards annual permits as the best way of raising extra money for motorway building. Until recently Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, maintained that the fairest method of charging for motorway use was through electronic tolls. Yesterday he told a transport conference in London: 'Electronic tolling offers much more flexibility in the long run, but probably won't be technologically achievable until at least 1998. 'So if we are going to move fast to get the benefits that road pricing offers, then vignettes (annual permits displayed in the windscreen) are the most realistic option.' Last month the government published a green paper exploring the options for introducing motorway charges as a means of funding road infrastructure expansion. At a meeting in Luxembourg last weekend European Community transport ministers agreed a package allowing countries to introduce annual permits costing up to Ecu 1,250 (Pounds 979) for lorries using their motorways, with the option of introducing permits for cars. Pressure for the EC deal was led by Germany, which faces heavy costs in providing infrastructure for transit traffic but receives little in return. Nine member states including Britain are considering the introduction of motorway charges to raise more money. Germany, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg plan to introduce vignette systems in January 1995. Mr MacGregor said the introduction of vignettes to Britain would require primary legislation, so it could not come quickly. The earliest feasible date would be 1995.</p>

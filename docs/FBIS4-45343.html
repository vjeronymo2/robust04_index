His appointment was a surprise,  given the official's personal background. While he was governor  of Jalisco, the drug traffic began to thrive in that state. The  "narcos" were operating under the protection of Miguel Angel  Felix Gallardo, who had total impunity.    As attorney general, Alvarez del Castillo admitted having  had  "the misfortune to learn, during my term as governor of Jalisco,  that Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was the brains of the group"  formed by Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Carrillo.    However, he said nothing about the 14 arrest warrants  against  Felix Gallardo, three of which were issued while he was  governor, without ever being implemented.    During the trial for the murder of the DEA [Drug Enforcement  Administration] agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar, Javier Vazquez  Velasco, an ex-judicial policeman and aide of Caro Quintero,  claimed: "Alvarez del Castillo was involved in the drug traffic."    At the time, the official responded: "That is loose talk,  attempting to implicate me."    During his brief stay (a year and a half) in the PGR,  Alvarez  del Castillo was accused of systematically violating human  rights and tolerating corruption and impunity among PJF [Federal  Judicial Police] agents. For that reason, he had serious  confrontations with the National Commission for Human Rights  [CNDH], especially in connection with the cases involving Norma  Corona and Francisco Valencia Fontes. [passage omitted]    Ignacio Morales Lechuga arrived to replace him and, as soon  as he took office, asserted that the PGR must be an agency  promoting legality. He also promised to do an effective job in  maintaining absolute respect for human rights and in forcefully  combating impunity, "which is defeating our legal standards and  has undermined the rule of law."    The now Mexican ambassador to France immediately revised  plans and work programs, dismissing some 100 federal agents and  remanding others implicated in human rights violations. The  latter included Mario Alberto Gonzalez Trevino, accused of being  the brains behind the death of Norma Corona.    Nevertheless, the cleanup did not include police chiefs who  later were accused of illicit acquisition of wealth and of  giving protection to drug traffickers. They included Guillermo  Gonzalez Calderoni (a fugitive from justice), Fulvio Jimenez  Turengano, and Adolfo Mondragon Aguirre.    Despite Morales Lechuga's intentions of making the PGR an  institution promoting legality, it was soon realized that his  words were having no repercussions on his subordinates.    Human rights violations prevailed, although to a lesser  extent. The first Morales Lechuga-Carpizo confrontation occurred  over the case relating to political columnist Victor Manuel  Oropeza, murdered in Ciudad Juarez. The CNDH accused the PGR of  having fabricated the charges against those blamed. The CNDH  opinion in the Tlalixcoyan case (a confrontation between the  military and the Federal Judicial Police involving a drug  trafficking matter) was another severe blow to Morales Lechuga.    After this incident, which occurred on 6 November 1992, his  right-hand man, Federico Ponce Rojas, was dismissed, just as  Javier Coello Trejo had been in Alvarez del Castillo's time.    Morales Lechuga became embroiled in more problems when the  PGR exonerated Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, after the Los  Angeles court suspended the trial being held against him as a  presumed participant in the death of DEA agent Camarena Salazar.  On 27 April 1990, Alvarez del Castillo had claimed that the PGR  had more than sufficient evidence to take action against the  Jalisco physician.    At the end of 1992, the battle among various drug  trafficking  groups intensified, causing a heightening of the violence in the  northern part of the country. The shooting confrontation  occurred at the Christine discotheque in Puerto Vallarta,  persons close to Caro Quintero were killed in Iguala, and bombs  exploded in Culiacan. It was later learned that in all these  cases the PJF had given protection to drug trafficking rings.    Displeased by this situation, Salinas de Gortari decided to  oust Morales Lechuga. To replace him, he named Jorge Carpizo,  the present secretary of government, then head of the CNDH.  Direct, and without misgivings, the ex-rector of the UNAM  [National Autonomous University of Mexico] and minister on leave  from the National Supreme Court criticized the performance of  his predecessors. He declared: "It is impossible for agents of  the law and of society to violate legal standards in combating  crime."    He maintained that this battle must be waged based on the  legal system and human rights: "Mexico demands a better  prosecution of justice and better public safety. Crime,  especially that associated with the drug traffic, must be fought  with complete firmness and total determination."    Carpizo's first victims were the PGR agents linked with the  drug traffic and engaged in acts contrary to the law. Over 100  policemen were dismissed, removed, or subjected to penal remand.    Rodolfo Leon Aragon, chief of the PJF, was one of the first  to leave the PGR. The departure of the police commander who had  survived the first two shakeups in the PGR enabled Carpizo to  create the National Institute To Combat Drugs, with Jorge Tello  Peon as director. Upon Carpizo's arrival in the Government  Secretariat, Tello Peon was transferred to the National Center  for Investigation and Security.    Then Carpizo, contrary to his principles of acting with the  law as his criterion, directed a campaign against journalists  presumably implicated in the drug traffic. Congressman Cesareo  Morales, Mario Munguia, Mario Rivas, and Heriberto Deandar  Martinez, among many others, were accused. In all four cases,  the judges rejected the evidence submitted by the PGR.    The weakness in remands submitted by the PGR during the  Carpizo era also enabled gunmen and small-scale drug dealers to  obtain their release. For example, there was the case of Ramon  Alcides Magana and Adan Segundo Canales, gunmen for the "capo,"  Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Both were later arrested and remanded in  connection with the incidents that occurred on 24 November 1993  at the Ochoa Bali-Hai restaurant.    After this, Carpizo charged that members of the Federal  Judicial Branch were acting suspiciously when they were required  to issue their court decisions. [passage omitted]    Dedicated to capturing drug traffickers, Carpizo disregarded  the criminals engaged in kidnapping, which has increased  considerably in the country.    Salinas de Gortari removed Carpizo from the PGR, sending him  to the Government Secretariat. Diego Valades, who was in the  capital's attorney general's office, became head of that  department, in the fourth shakeup of officials in five years.    Like his predecessors, Valades promised to guarantee the  population's public safety. The recent incidents occurring in  Tijuana and Mexico City, where crime has risen five percent over  last year's level, according to official data, prove that there  has been little progress in that area.</p>

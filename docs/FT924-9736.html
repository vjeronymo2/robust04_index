			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Observer: Generosity With gold prices languishing, analyst Graham Birch has long been recommending producers to cash in on the huge mark-ups available in the jewellery market. The message seems to be getting through: Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's big gold producers, is now offering shareholders and employees 'the rare opportunity to purchase quality, 18 carat gold jewellery'. Birch points out that the WMC scheme shows what 'added value' in the gold market is all about. The corporation is offering, among other items, a bangle containing not quite one ounce of gold. At today's prices the intrinsic value of this bauble is about Pounds 175. The price WMC is charging is Pounds 762. But, as Birch says, 'WMC is generously throwing in postage and packing for nothing'.</p>

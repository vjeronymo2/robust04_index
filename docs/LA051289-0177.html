			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TEST SHOWS DETROIT MAYOR IS FATHER  </P> <P> Detroit Mayor Coleman Young almost certainly fathered a baby boy six years ago,  as alleged in a lawsuit by a former city employee, according to blood test  results released today.  </P> <P> The results from Edward W. Sparrow Hospital in Lansing show that Young, 70, has  a 99.99% likelihood of having fathered Joel Loving, now of Fontana, Calif.  </P> <P> The blood test results were released at a news conference by Noel Keane,  attorney for Annivory Calvert, a former Detroit assistant director of public  works who sued Young earlier this year seeking unspecified child support.  </P> <P> Keane said Calvert also wants Young to exercise visitation rights. No date has  been set for a hearing on the lawsuit.  </P></p>

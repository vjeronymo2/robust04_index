			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart falls to Pounds 12m HEWDEN STUART, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company, yesterday sounded cautiously optimistic about recent signs of recovery following a 20 per cent fall in profits, but said it was too soon to say whether these would be sustained. Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said there had been an increase in demand in late February and March from a broad spread of industry, though there was little sign as yet of price recovery, and directors were more relaxed about the short-term outlook than they were a few months ago. The Glasgow-based group reported a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 12m in the year to January 31. Sales were down from Pounds 171m to Pounds 165m. Sir Matthew said: 'These results must be considered extremely satisfactory, having been achieved in the depths of the recession and covering, as they do, the winter months which saw the failure of two of Britain's largest contractors, Budge and Lilley, and other bankruptcies.' The tower crane division incurred a loss of Pounds 923,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 1.85m. Sir Matthew said that after stripping out the tower crane figures, the remainder of the group almost maintained profits at Pounds 13m (Pounds 13.2m) in an extremely difficult period. The hire divisions virtually held profits at Pounds 12.26m (Pounds 12.53m) in spite of a drop in sales from Pounds 112m to Pounds 108m, excluding cranes. Sir Matthew said the division met fierce competition on price, and on many occasions deliberately sacrificed turnover in the face of pricing policies by others which appeared solely dictated by the need to generate cash in the short term. 'JCBs were being hired out, with a driver, for Pounds 10 an hour - you couldn't get a plumber with his bag to fix your washing machine for that sort price.' Strong cashflow meant that the group increased net cash from Pounds 7m to Pounds 13m, in spite of capital expenditure of Pounds 23m. Earnings per share fell from 5.35p to 4.4p. A final dividend of 2.365p (2.285p) makes a total for the year of 3.24p (3.15p). COMMENT These were excellent results from a company which continues to shine in an otherwise grim sector. Having shrunk its tower crane fleet from a boom-time peak of 180 to 60, the group is confident that they should now operate at break-even this year and might even make some money. The group is bringing forward capital expenditure and its tax rate should benefit from capital allowances. Forecast profits of Pounds 14m put the shares - up   1/2 p at 104 1/2 p - on a prospective multiple of about 20. That is high, but the group is operationally highly geared and will not hesitate to use its strong cash position to expand when recovery comes through. Looking at cashflow and longer-term prospects for earnings, it still looks a quality recovery play.</p>

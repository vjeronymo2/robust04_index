			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Halifax cuts rate but warns on savings Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, yesterday announced a cut in its base mortgage rate by 0.35 of a percentage point to 7.64 per cent. It did not say, however, what its new savings rates would be and issued a warning that further mortgage rate reductions might be limited if the government offered savings rates out of line with the market. The cut follows the 0.5 point cut in base rates a week before the Budget. It reflects the relief among mortgage lenders that the Budget eroded rather than abolished mortgage tax relief, in a way which was seen as unlikely to damage the housing market. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society, swiftly followed the Halifax move and similarly cut its mortgage rate by 0.35 per cent from 7.99 per cent. Other mortgage lenders are expected to announce rate reductions later this week. Societies have faced fierce competition this year both for mortgages, where banks' fixed rates have proved popular, and for savings, where investors have been attracted by other forms, such as unit trusts. Yesterday's reductions mean a drop in payments of Pounds 11.75 a month for a Pounds 60,000 repayment mortgage. They will apply to new borrowers immediately, and to existing borrowers from January. Announcing the cut, Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, signalled that if the government made National Savings products too attractive to investors, then it could face a dispute with the societies, which have to rely largely on retail funds from individual savers. 'For investors, we are conscious of the impact of falling rates and concerned at the prospect of subsidised National Savings competition, which might limit future mortgage rate cuts,' Mr Blackburn said. This would not be the first clash between societies and the government over savings rates. Last year, Mr Andrew Long-hurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, led the assault that culminated in the government's withdrawal of the National Savings First Option bond temporarily. Societies have been particularly concerned at the Budget announcement of a guaranteed income bond for people over the age of 65. Details are to be announced early next year.</p>

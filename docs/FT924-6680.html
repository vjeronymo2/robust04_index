			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Tajikistan KGB chief killed Unidentified gunmen have slain the pro-Islamic deputy KGB chief in former Soviet Tajikistan, whose deposed Communist leaders have been fighting their way back to power, writes Steve LeVine in Tashkent. Mr Jurabek Aminov, among the warring Central Asian nation's most articulate and effective leaders, was killed in a spray of bullets on Wednesday night as he drove to the airport in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. There was no indication who was responsible. The murder removed probably the most skilled military organiser for the anti-Communist coalition of Islamists and secular moderates, a politically diverse alignment that was already fractured. The murder occurred as Tajikistan, the former Soviet Union's most unstable republic, seemed headed for more war. Rebels loyal to former Communist President Rakhman Nabiyev have surrounded and besieged Dushanbe, which is controlled by the anti-Communist coalition.</p>

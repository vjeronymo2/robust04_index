			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Leontyev report in the "Resignation" column: "The </F> Economic Coup Has Occurred," incorporating statement by former  Finance Minister Boris Fedorov]    [Excerpts] After a talk with the president yesterday  morning, Boris Fedorov made a final decision to decline the post  of finance minister in Mr. Chernomyrdin's new government. The  president either did not want to or could not accept Fedorov's  tough terms. [passage omitted]    As a result, what has been expected actually happened:  Fedorov resigned. The bitter struggle between the finance  minister and the chairman of the Russian Central Bank ended with  the latter's victory. Today Mr. Gerashchenko, enjoying bucolic  delights in the company of the prime minister who has given him  shelter, can settle his scores with Fedorov, who has really  annoyed him, with relish. The paradox is that now Gerashchenko  will have to bear the entire responsibility for the state of the  monetary system. Meanwhile the current chairman of the Central  Bank does not want to assume such responsibility. Selective  support for the basic production sectors and the "nonmonetarist  methods" of economic policy espoused by Mr. Gerashchenko are so  popular in the new Cabinet today that there will be no place  under the nonmonetarist sun left for the Central Bank chief.  Gerashchenko is not so stupid or unprofessional not to  understand the danger of this sweeping craze for similar ideas:  Therefore there is no way that he can satiate the appetites of  all the agro-industrial zaveryukhas [apparent pun: Zaveryukha,  the last name of the non-reformist minister, sounding close to  "zveryukha," meaning "(large) animal"]. Therefore the financial  situation will be progressively, although perhaps not  catastrophically, deteriorating while relations with his  colleagues in the economic leadership will be cooling. [passage  omitted]    Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is more than a pragmatist;  generally, he is little interested in the long-term economic  consequences of his current decisions. While being much more  qualified, from the apparatus point of view, than most of the  "reformers," the prime minister is at the same time profoundly  and hopelessly illiterate economically. This does not allow him  to make unpopular decisions without outside pressure because he  is incapable of understanding or believing in the inevitability  of a positive outcome.    Today a most serious danger is looming over the premier --  what has now become the traditional Russian "vice presidency  syndrome." By virtue of his makeup and former experience, the  incumbent prime minister is less than any others inclined to  yield to emotions. Even so, the temptation of power has broken  tougher men. Especially since Viktor Chernomyrdin has  demonstrated his ability publicly to accentuate his independence  from the president. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Statement by Boris Fedorov </H5>   Boris Fedorov, who has resigned the post of finance  minister,  has announced the impermissibility of joining the Cabinet of  Ministers or keeping in their posts "people who have caused  colossal economic and political damage to the state and who are  intransigent and open opponents of the reform policy." This is  said in Mr. Fedorov's statement Wednesday after his meeting with  Boris Yeltsin.    "I cannot agree with the turn of policy that has recently  been formulated by the premier and is now being implemented in  practice," Boris Fedorov stressed. "The triumph of the  nonviable and illiterate ideology of Gosplan [State Planning  Agency] and the red economic managers in the cabinet, in the  context of the market economy, inevitably dooms the country to  collapse and the people to falling living standards," he stated.    "There is no alternative to our policy, and we will soon be  able to see this in practice. The turn away from the  stabilization course means soaring inflation, the people's  declining real incomes, the dollar rate surging to 10,000 rubles  by the end of the year, the deprecation of savings, the  beginning of a commodity shortage, increasing capital flight,  and Russia's isolation from the world markets," Boris Fedorov  stressed. "Moreover, there will be neither production growth,  nor fresh capital inputs, nor ways to deal with the employment  problem. The threat of a social explosion from theory becomes  reality."    Boris Fedorov appealed to the president: "An economic coup  is under way in the country -- a retreat. The only hope is you!  What matters is not Fedorov, who is always ready to come back  and defend Russia's interests to the end. What matters is the  fate of the country, which is being decided in these days and  these hours. I hope that no one has any illusions that  economics can be separated from politics."    After his meeting with the president Boris Fedorov said in  an  interview with INTERFAX that "a team of red economic managers  has come to power who know how to run large enterprises but do  not know the meaning of macroeconomics." He thinks that the  present government will be able to stay in office until fall  1994 when strong manifestations of social discontent are  possible.</p>

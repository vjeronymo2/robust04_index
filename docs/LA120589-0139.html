			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> E. GERMANY'S HONECKER UNDER HOUSE ARREST  </P> <P> Former Communist Party chief Erich Honecker and other members of his ousted  leadership were placed under house arrest today, and the government disarmed  the Communist Party's private army.  </P> <P> Authorities placed Honecker and other former top officials under house arrest  in their luxurious Wandlitz compound north of East Berlin. The compound has  become a symbol of corruption and abuses of the past.  </P> <P> "The former General Secretary (of the Communist Party) and President Erich  Honecker is among those who are not allowed to leave their houses in the  elegant compound," the official ADN news agency reported.  </P> <P> The house arrests were an act of "national self-defense" and resulted from "the  will of the people," said Harri Haarland, the deputy chief prosecutor.  </P> <P> The house arrests are intended to keep the former Politburo members from  fleeing the country. Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, the former top foreign  trader with the West, fled after allegations that he was involved in huge  weapons deals.  </P> <P> Honecker, 77, has been in ill health after gallbladder surgery last summer and  had been a virtual recluse in Wandlitz even before his arrest.  </P> <P> The Interior Ministry said the government was disarming the "fighting groups,"  the Communist Party-run militia based in the nation's factories.  </P> <P> The ministry said the weapons taken away included automatic rifles,  rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft guns as well as armored personnel  carriers. The ministry said it was taking charge of the weapons.  </P> <P> Western estimates said the militia counted 3,000 active members, but could draw  on reserves of 500,000 people.  </P> <P> Also today, East Germany's top lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, was arrested on  suspicion of "criminal extortion," the news agency said.  </P></p>

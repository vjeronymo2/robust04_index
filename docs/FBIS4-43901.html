			<p>BFN     [Text] Halle (DPA) -- According to Federal Chancellor  Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union), Germany needs a  performance elite. Without such an elite, the country can have  no future, Kohl said. "We need initiative, responsibility, the  courage to undertake ventures, the readiness to make personal  sacrifices, and patience in pursuing great goals," the  chancellor said at the annual meeting of the German Research  Community (DFG) in Halle on 21 June.    Even though Germany was holding an international top  position  in important fields of research, it had lost ground in  competition, which had become sharper on the world markets.  Kohl said that research results should, therefore, be put into  practice more swiftly. "In the research laboratories and  scientific institutions of today, decisions are made on our jobs  of tomorrow," he told an audience of approximately 500  scientists and guests of honor at the DFG festive meeting.    The chancellor said that in the important areas of high  technology and biotechnology, industry largely depended on the  swift and smooth transfer of research results. To this end,  borders had to be more permeable. In addition, more joint  ventures between industry and research and a closer dialogue  with broad sections of the population were required. The  country of poets and thinkers should not become a country of  doubters and hesitaters, said Kohl.    His most important concern was to increase and improve the  dialogue between industry, science, and the state. Kohl said  that, without intending to patronize research, he held the view  that its structures had to be reviewed. They had to be revised  where they had become entrenched and were dominated by thinking  in terms of entitlements.    The chancellor struck a favorable balance on the development  of universities and research in the new laender. He said they  corresponded to international standards and compared well with  facilities in the new laender. Kohl stressed that the  universities in eastern Germany could stimulate the renewal of  the university system throughout Germany.    Earlier, DFG President Professor Wolfgang Fruehwald was  unanimously confirmed in office for another three years. With  its meeting in Halle, the German Research Community paid tribute  to Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, which  celebrates its 300th anniversary this year.</p>

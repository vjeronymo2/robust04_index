			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 24/6/1994 -- The chief of the  Federal Intelligence Service of Russia, Sergey Stepashin [name  as received], arrived today in Chisinau. Sources from the  Moldovan Ministry of National Security stated to BASAPRESS that  the Russian dignitary is in Chisinau to sign an agreement of  cooperation between the security services of both states. The  draft agreement stipulates the coordination of joint activities  in combating terrorism, smuggling, drug business, and illegal  armament trade. The parties also intend to come to an agreement  concerning joining forces in combating the illegal immigration  of citizens of underdeveloped countries to Western Europe, by  using the territories of Russia and Moldova as transit stations.  The same sources announced to BASAPRESS that Sergey Stepashin  will stay in Moldova two days and will meet President Mircea  Snegur and Premier Andrei Sangheli. Stepashin also intends to  pay a visit to Tiraspol. No terrorist acts were committed this  year in Moldova. In 1993, the Moldovan frontier guards  prevented the attempts of dozens of illegal immigrants to  traverse Moldova.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) --- China is becoming  increasingly involved in worldwide economic competition by  exporting its own goods, technologies, labor services and  capital, according to a researcher at the China Foreign Policy  Studies Center.    In an interview with XINHUA today, Yan Xuetong noted that  commodities exports furnish the best example of what he calls  "two- way exchange between the Chinese and world economies."    Yan estimated that such exports may reach 91 billion U.S.  dollars in 1993, up from 85 billion in 1992 and compared with a  mere 9.74 billion in 1978 when the policy of reform and opening  to the world became official.    "There was an annual average growth of 18 percent between  1978 and 1992," he said. "In 1978, China ranked 32nd among all  countries in terms of annual commodities exports and in 1992, it  advanced to the 11th."    Manufactured goods now account for at least 80 percent of  China's exports. In 1978, however, the bulk of China's exports  were primary products, he added.    China was a pure importer of technologies before 1981 when,  for the first time, it signed six contracts on technological  exports. Since then, the country has concluded 1,100 contracts,  involving 3.4 billion dollars.    However, Yan was far from being satisfied, noting that the  1992 transactions -- 1.4 billion dollars -- was only two percent  of the country's commodities exports.    Export of capital was also something new for China. By the  end of 1982, the country had invested 37 million dollars in 43  projects abroad.    By the end of 1992, Yan said, China's overseas investment  had  snowballed to 1.85 billion dollars in 4,117 projects.    "Few Chinese-funded projects are in commerce or trade meant  for direct profits," he noted. "Instead, 86 percent of the  Chinese investment has gone to projects producing iron ore and  other raw materials to make up for domestic shortages."    At the end of June 1993, 157,000 Chinese workers were  working  abroad to perform labor service contracts, mostly in  construction and other manual labor jobs.    Yan, an economist trained at the University of California at  Berkeley of the U.S., held that China should start organizing  the export of intellectual labor services by making use of its  eight million scientists and engineers.    "Economically, the country is linked with the world, and has  to prepare itself for closer links," concluded Yan, who serves  as deputy director of the center which operates under the China  Institute of Contemporary International Relations.    Since 1985, China has published a series of laws designed in  part to promote integration of the Chinese and world economies,  including laws on patents, trademarks and copyrights. Also,  China has joined the world intellectual property organization  and acceded to the Paris Convention for the Protection of  Industrial Property and the Universal Copyright Convention.    Meanwhile, China has lowered its import duties.</p>

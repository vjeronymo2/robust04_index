In an arrival statement, he  said that 'Arafat will arrive in Cairo during the weekend to  discuss with President Mubarak the latest developments in the  peace process. He will also meet with U.S. Secretary of Commerce  Ronald Brown, who will visit Egypt to discuss the U.S. role in  supporting Palestinian establishments in Gaza and Jericho.    Sha'th said that he briefed president 'Arafat and the PLO  Executive Committee members on the progress in the Taba  negotiations. He received instructions from the Palestinian  leadership regarding the next round of talks that will begin  tomorrow morning. He said that during tomorrow's round the two  sides will complete discussions of transferring the civil powers  and we hope that this week we will discuss the crossing points  and the size of the Jericho area. He expressed his hope that  the Israeli side will show more flexibility in view of the  timetable for withdrawal.    Discussing the summit meeting between U.S. President Bill  Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and its effect on the  Palestinian-Israeli track, Dr. Sha'th said that this meeting was  met with satisfaction because it represents U.S. recognition of  the importance of a comprehensive solution. He stressed that  the success of this summit will lead Syria to return to the  peace process under the title of complete withdrawal from the  Golan Heights and Syrian sovereignty over them. He noted that  this is important to the peace process for two reasons: first,  Syria's return to the peace process will lead to Lebanon's and  Jordan's return as well, making the peace process comprehensive,  and second this reasserts that the implementation of Security  Council Resolution No. 242 means withdrawal from all the  occupied territories.</p>

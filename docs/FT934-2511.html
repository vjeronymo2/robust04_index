			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Vodafone granted fixed-wire licence Vodafone, the UK's largest mobile phone network operator, has been granted a national licence to offer 'fixed-wire' services in competition with British Telecommunications, Andrew Adonis writes. Until now Vodafone, which has 1m mobile customers, has been forbidden from building or operating a fixed network. It has been restricted to competing with Cellnet, the mobile operator jointly owned by BT and Securicor, and Mercury One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury and US West. Vodafone said it did not intend at present to compete head-on with BT. Mr Terry Barwick, Vadafone's director of corporate affairs, said: 'The fixed market is already highly competitive, and we intend to stick to what we do best.' The move follows a review two years ago which led the government to abolish the BT/Mercury duopoly in the provision of fixed services.</p>

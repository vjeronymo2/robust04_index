			<p>BFN     [Text] Narita, Chiba Pref., May 17 KYODO -- Thirty  Japanese volunteers from the Japan International Cooperation  Agency arrived at Narita Airport Tuesday [17 May] after fleeing  strife-torn Yemen via Paris.    The group included five medical and technical experts and 25  Japan Overseas Cooperation volunteers and family members, agency  officials said.    The only Japanese remaining in Yemen are five Japanese  Embassy officials in Sanaa. Some 100 Japanese have already left  the country, the Foreign Ministry said.    The embassy advised Japanese residents and tourists to  evacuate Sanaa on May 7, three days after the Yemeni Government  declared a state of emergency because of fighting between  northern and southern army units and shelling in the capital.</p>

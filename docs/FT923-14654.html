			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hachette to sell Paris building for FFr500m HACHETTE, the heavily- indebted French media group, has reached agreement to sell its landmark building on the Boulevard Saint Germain in Paris to the Immopar group for FFr500m (Dollars 98m). The Saint Germain building has been up for sale for some months as part of Hachette's attempts to raise capital and reduce its debts. The group last year sold its Nouvelles Messageries building in central Paris for FFr2.78bn and has since sold a number of subsidiaries including some French and Spanish printing businesses. Hachette has been burdened by heavy debts - of around FFr8bn at the end of last year - since a period of active acquisitions in the late 1980s. Its main deals were the purchases of Grolier encyclopedias and Diamandis magazines for a total of FFr1.16bn in the US. The group was also hit earlier this year by the collapse of La Cinq, the French television station of which is was the controlling shareholder with 25 per cent of the equity. The losses on La Cinq, which cost Hachette FFr1.79bn last year alone, contributed to a net loss of FFr1.93bn on sales of FFr30.41bn in 1991. Last week, Hachette announced that it had reached an agreement on compensation for La Cinq's creditors. The company is pressing ahead with its proposed merger with Matra, the defence electronics group chaired by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the flamboyant French businessman who also heads Hachette. Mr Lagardere is concluding negotiations with Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications group which last week emerged as a 20 per cent shareholder in Matra's telecommunications division, to take a 5 per cent to 8 per cent stake in his new merged company. The merger is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</p>

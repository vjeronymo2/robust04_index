			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Japan's LDP 'tried to pay off extremists' THE REPUTATION of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was further tarnished yesterday when Tokyo prosecutors alleged that senior party officials offered a total of Y5bn (Pounds 25.3m) to an extreme right-wing group to stop a public campaign against the party. Prosecutors were presenting evidence to a Tokyo District Court trial of executives at Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the trucking company at the centre of an illegal donation scandal, when they yesterday outlined alleged dealings between seven LDP leaders and the far right group, Kominto. Mr Shin Kanemaru, the godfather of Japanese politics, resigned last month after admitting that he accepted a Y500m donation from Tokyo Sagawa. He was also under suspicion, as are several other LDP politicians, of having regular contact with a prominent gangster organisation. However, the ruling party was shaken by the unexpected prosecutors' statements yesterday, as they lengthened the list of senior officials who attempted use gang links, money or personal contacts to silence Kominto, which launched a noisy campaign against a former prime minister, Mr Noboru Takeshita, in 1987. There was further embarrassment when the prosecutors said Mr Kanemaru had contacted executives at a leading Japanese commercial bank last year to ask that it provide assistance to the financially troubled Tokyo Sagawa. The prosecutors ensured that the LDP's largest faction, formerly run by Mr Kanemaru, would remain in turmoil, as they alleged that Mr Keizo Obuchi, the new faction head, had used 'agents' to persuade Kominto to end its campaign against Mr Takeshita. Mr Obuchi said he had no direct contact with Kominto, but four of the six other politicians mentioned by the prosecutors conceded that they or their representatives had arranged meetings with the group, well known for both its use of violence and its underworld links. The new allegations threaten to dominate the present sitting of the Japanese parliament, which is supposed to give its approval to an emergency economic package announced by the government in August. Opposition parties have wanted Mr Takeshita to testify under oath about his links to Tokyo Sagawa, but there may now be a move to force all seven politicians listed yesterday to answer questions in parliament. Naming the politicians was an apparent reaction by the prosecutors to strong public criticism of their handling of the illegal donation case against Mr Kanemaru, who was not questioned directly and did not face a court action, in spite of admitting that he broke the Political Funds Control Law.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Canon agrees to use IBM's PC technology Canon, the Japanese camera and office equipment maker, has agreed to use US computer group IBM's PowerPC microprocessor technology in future computer products. It will also help refine technology for use in consumer products and hand-held devices. The Canon endorsement is a breakthrough for IBM, which aims to establish PowerPC as an industry standard competing with Intel's microprocessor technology. Canon is the first computer systems manufacturer, other than Apple and IBM itself, to adopt PowerPC as a strategic technology. The agreement does not entail Canon incorporating PowerPC in its printers, cameras or copying machines.</p>

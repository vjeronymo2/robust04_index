			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (4): Rao faces storm over market abuses - Congress has regained self-confidence. But one issue now dominates politics WHEN PARLIAMENT reconvenes next month for the monsoon session, there will be one issue on the agenda - the government's handling of the Bombay stock market scandal. Opposition leaders have already claimed that ministers are involved. They seem likely to press their demands for the resignation of Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the central bank governor, and for Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, as the two men who should accept moral responsibility for the abuses that occurred. But as yet, the political fall-out of the stock market scandal has still to make its full impact on political parties or public opinion. Interpreting the results of a handful of by-elections held earlier this month, a Congress party spokesman triumphantly claimed that their message was that 'that the nation has no alternative to the Congress and the Congress has no alternative to Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao'. This is the hyperbole of party political machines. Nonetheless, the claim reflects what had been a growing self-confidence within the Congress. A year ago the party would have been ridiculed if it had dared to make it. The Congress was returned to power in 1991 as the single largest party in parliament, but it lacked an absolute majority. In the election it gathered only a handful of seats in the Hindi-speaking north - once the stronghold of its power - and the bulk of its new parliamentary membership came from the south and west. With the assassination of Mr Rajiv Gandhi during the election campaign - and thus the end of the Nehru family's long domination of Indian politics - Congress looked a rudderless ship. Mr Narasimha Rao, 71, was a compromise choice to head the party. He seemed to have little chance of imposing his will on it or on the government he formed. By contrast, the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which surged in strength in the 1989 and 1991 elections on a platform of anti-Moslem sentiment and populist national rejuvenation, seemed rattling at the doors of power. It won 123 seats in the 1991 election and also consolidated its grip over state assemblies in the north. It is in power in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. Many political observers thought that the combination of a weak Congress and a resurgent BJP would result in a political instability that would force an early general election. But this month's by-elections - though only a partial indicator - confirm the shift in the landscape that has taken place since last year. The Congress regained the New Delhi constituency that Mr L. K. Advani, the BJP leader, won in the 1991 election and gained a state assembly seat in the north. It lost seats in the south - but nonetheless its performance was much better than the BJP which found itself on the retreat in most areas where elections were held. There is thus no longer talk of an early general election. The government faces a stormy passage over both the political fall-out from the financial scandal and unrest over high prices and a bad monsoon. But this parliament could still last another two years - or even run its full term. The cold calculation behind this is that no political party has an interest in an early election. The Congress wants to wait until it has refurbished its image, brought down inflation and until the economic reforms have had time to show what are hoped to be their beneficial effects. The BJP is equally unwilling to risk a poll at a time when its own popularity is waning and the BJP governments in the northern states have yet to make an impact. The Janata Dal and the left are also too fragmented and too disorientated to seek an early election. This turnaround in Congress fortunes has mainly been due to Mr Rao. He declined to bring any of the other parties into a coalition when he came to power - preferring to seek a fresh majority in parliament on different issues and counting on divisions within the opposition to work to his advantage. This strategy has worked. The Janata Dal of Mr V. P. Singh, the former prime minister, has disintegrated over the year with some of its factions now supporting Congress from the outside and some joining it. With Mr Advani, the BJP leader, Mr Rao sought ad hoc alliances to pass key reforms such as the first budget and the earlier measures of trade and industrial deregulation. But this cosy working relationship has run into opposition from the rank and file of both parties who want a more confrontational relationship that allows them to establish their different identities and to mark the differences. Nonetheless, with the help of defections and windfalls such as the holding of postponed elections in Punjab, which were boycotted by the Akali (Sikh) parties, Mr Rao has a de facto majority in parliament. The Congress also benefits electorally from being perceived as a party with a programme. Liberalisation has its enemies - both within the party and without - but the Congress is now building an image as a party of change. In the past, disillusionment with Congress as a tired institution more preoccupied with patronage than policy played a large element in the erosion of its support. By contrast to the modest recovery Congress has been making - it still remains weak in the north - the BJP has allowed its advantages to fritter away. It did itself much damage in January by its march on Kashmir. An occasion intended to mobilise Hindu opinion behind a nationalist campaign to show that Kashmir was an integral part of the Indian union, it ended up by revealing the vulnerability of the Indian state in the face of Kashmiri nationalism. The march also broke the myth of the BJP as a successful organiser of mass populist movements. The failure of the Kashmir march also showed up the divisions within the BJP leadership - a party that has prided itself on its discipline and unity. Its image received a further blow when one of its female activists - and an MP as well - attracted large publicity as a result of an alleged affair with a another senior party leader. Adding to its woes, the younger generation in the party has been frustrated that they have been given no real access to power. The paradox in all this is that before the financial scandal broke, Mr Rao was not able to exploit more fully the growth in confidence of the Congress party and his own authority within it. As prime minister, his hesitation over taking decisions and his reluctance to face confrontations with powerful lobbies such as the unions and the farmers have, if anything, grown. He called a meeting of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) - the party's main policymaking forum, which meets at only rare intervals - at Tirupati in the south in April. The occasion was intended to endorse his own leadership over the party and to give him a freer hand in pursuing his reform programme. But after the conference did just that, Mr Rao seemed to stumble and has not recovered his footing since. He took elections to the party's working committee - which handles day-to-day management of the party - as a challenge to his authority. He called on the 10 elected members - including Mr Sharad Pawar, the defence minister, and Mr Arjun Singh, the natural resources minister, to resign. Both refused. Mr Rao then took a long time to find a compromise to his party problems. He also postponed a cabinet reshuffle - in part needed to replace Mr M. Solanki as foreign minister. Mr Solanki was forced to resign after handing over a letter to the Swiss authorities requesting them to go slow on investigations into the payments of commission by Bofors, the Swedish arms manufacturer, to win an Indian arms contract. The opposition alleges that part of Mr Rao's indecisiveness and discomfort since then is that he was more aware of the contents of the letter than he has let on. It is the resurrection of the Bofors affair that makes the government even more on the defensive when faced with charges that ministers were involved in the Bombay financial scandal.</p>

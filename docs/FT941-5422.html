			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Smith 'furious' at leak of Major meeting Mr John Smith yesterday warned that Labour may not take part in bipartisan meetings after a private talk with the prime minister was leaked to the Sunday Express. The private meeting focused on the forthcoming renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which Labour regularly votes against. Mr Smith wanted to see if Labour's disagreement with the government over two specific measures of the act could be bridged before it comes up for annual renewal on Wednesday. The Labour leader asked for the removal of internal exclusion orders and the provision which allows suspects to be detained for seven days before a charge is made. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, yesterday said the government had rejected the demand because such a two party 'approach would have weakened the fight against terrorism'. Mr Smith was reported to be 'furious' that the meeting had been made public and called for an independent inquiry into how it had been leaked. The meeting, which took place at 10 Downing Street, was just between Mr Smith and Mr John Major. The Labour leader has warned that unless he receives a satisfactory explanation it may not be possible to have meetings on security matters. His office accused the government of 'playing politics with Northern Ireland'. Downing Street denied that it leaked the meeting. Mr Howard regretted the fact that the meeting had been made public. 'These meetings were private. They should have remained private,' he said. However, Mr Howard was unapologetic for refusing to accept the offer of a bipartisan approach. He told BBC TV: 'Just as Labour supported the Prevention of Terrorism Act until 1983 we believe it is essential in the fight against terrorism today.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] Egyptian President Husni Mubarak arrived in the  Saudi capital, Riyadh, as part of a regional tour of the Persian  Gulf and was welcomed by Saudi King Fahd. Before his visit to  Saudi Arabia, Mubarak visited Oman, the United Arab Emirates,  and Bahrain and held talks with officials.    During the visit, Mubarak is discussing regional and Arab  problems with the host countries. The Egyptian president and  the countries' officials still place special emphasis on  developments in the Persian Gulf and on the process of the Arab  governments' talks with the Zionist regime.    The Egyptian president's visit to Persian Gulf countries is  noteworthy. First, basically speaking, the Egyptian  regime--especially during the Mubarak era--focuses special  attention on the Persian Gulf in its regional policy. This  interest stems largely from the Egyptian regime's economic  desires for the Persian Gulf countries' wealth. Thus, this  regime is always seeking a pretext to expand its relations with  these countries and to score economic points through these  relations.    After the Persian Gulf war, on the pretext of ensuring the  security of the Persian Gulf's southern littoral countries,  Egypt became one of the founders of the Damascus security pact,  the six-plus-two pact, which failed because of its ambiguous and  suspicious nature and because it lacked a specific identity.  Since then, the Egyptian Government has constantly resorted to  political intervention and propaganda efforts to create security  tension in the Persian Gulf in a bid to ensure a base for  itself. But apart from exporting manpower to Saudi Arabia to  replace the 1.5-million-strong Yemeni manpower, which was ousted  because of Yemen's political stance in the Persian Gulf, Egypt  has been unable to achieve much.    The second noteworthy point in Mubarak's Persian Gulf tour  is  the link between this tour and the Persian Gulf's move to  welcome the Zionist regime under the guise of multilateral  sessions, the first of which was held in the Omani capital,  Muscat, last week. The second such session is to be held in  Qatar in a few days, while the third is to be held in Bahrain.  The Egyptian regime is playing the role of middleman for a  compromise between the occupying Zionist regime and Arab regimes  and considers itself as having a special mission in this.    When the Muslim public is enraged with the direct or  indirect  establishment of ties and with publicizing these ties, Mubarak  considers it his duty to support a compromise. It is noteworthy  that Mubarak's tour coincides with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's departure for the region to activate the  slow, heavy wheels of compromise. Some sources say that on the  first leg of his tour, Christopher will visit the Saudi capital,  Riyadh, and will hold a joint session on Wednesday morning with  the foreign ministers of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council.    Another point that should not be ignored is the scheduling  of  Mubarak's visit, which is being carried out before the  religious-political Hajj pilgrimage. Last year too the head of  the Egyptian regime visited southern Persian Gulf states, most  notably Saudi Arabia.    Political observers are considering the negative impacts of  Mubarak's visit.</p>

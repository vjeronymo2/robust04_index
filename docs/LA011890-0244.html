			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRONCOS' OWNER STICKS HIS FOOT IN HIS MOUTH -- AGAIN  </P> <P> Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, who apologized to Asians after comments he  made about San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice, now has upset  officials in New Orleans, where the Broncos will play the 49ers in the Super  Bowl on Jan. 28.  </P> <P> "New Orleans is a tough place," Bowlen said this week. "One thing I would say  is, I don't think it's a very good place for children and families. There's not  a lot for kids to do."  </P> <P> Bowlen confirmed Wednesday that the quote attributed to him was accurate and  that he believes New Orleans is "an adult experience."  </P> <P> Beverly Gianna, the director of New Orleans' Tourism and Convention Commission,  and Mickey Barthelemy, wife of Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, have taken exception to  the remarks.  </P> <P> "Has he even been here lately?" Gianna said.  </P> <P> Gianna said Bowlen's comments reflected an impression of New Orleans that is  outdated. "New Orleans has never been known predominantly as a family  attraction, and that's something we're trying to tout," she said.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Bowlen issued a written apology for comments he made Monday in  referring to the 49ers' Rice as "a Chinaman . . . whose feet don't touch the  ground." The Chinese for Affirmative Action in the Bay Area demanded that he  answer to charges of racism.  </P> <P> Informed that Bowlen had attended an NFL owners meeting in New Orleans, Gianna  said: "From what I know of those owners meetings, they're in and out. Has he  heard about the Audubon Zoo, which is one of the top five zoos in the nation?  Not only that, we have our Children's Museum by the riverfront area."  </P> <P> Barthelemy acknowledged that New Orleans offers its share of nightlife  inappropriate for youngsters. But she said, "Any city you visit, you make a  determination of what you want to do, and if you have children with you, you  just stay away from Bourbon Street."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARREST MADE OF ALLEGED 'DOCTOR' IN CHECK SCAM  </P> <P> A Canadian man hunted by law enforcement authorities from several states was in  the San Diego County Jail Tuesday on charges of posing as a wealthy doctor to  pass as much as $1.6 million in bad checks for jewelry, watches and coins.  </P> <P> John Compton Harvey, 58, is suspected of running a multi-state scam for the  past several years in which he posed as a distinguished physician and altered  cashier's checks to buy from $800,000 to $1.6 million worth of goods, said Bill  Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego police.  </P> <P> "He was a big tipper and led an affluent lifestyle, making sure people thought  he had a lot of money," Robinson said. "He was well-dressed, gray hair, blue  eyes and distinguished looks. He fooled a lot of people."  </P> <P> Harvey was being held in County Jail on $15-million bail. He was charged with  two counts of burglary and three counts each of forgery and grand theft  property.  </P> <P> Law enforcement authorities from 10 counties in California, Arizona and Utah  have arrest warrants pending against Harvey for a variety of fraud, forgery,  embezzlement and stolen property charges, and he is wanted for questioning in  Georgia, Florida, Kentucky and Nevada, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Police are hoping that publicity about Harvey's arrest will prompt additional  victims to come forward, Robinson said.  </P> <P> According to police, Harvey would arrive in a city and obtain doctors' business  cards and assume their identities, including establishing bogus answering  services.  </P> <P> He then answered classified advertisements from private parties selling  expensive jewelry, watches and coins, Robinson said.  </P> <P> After meeting with the sellers and persuading them to accept cashier's checks,  Harvey would buy $10 cashier's checks, erase the amount, substitute a higher  figure, and purchase the merchandise with the false check, Robinson said.  </P> <P> He would make up to six purchases over three to five days in a given city  before moving on, Robinson said.  </P> <P> San Diego police became involved nine months ago when Detective Dennis Sadler  was assigned the case after Harvey apparently purchased merchandise with bad  cashier's checks here, Robinson said.  </P> <P> "He (Sadler) followed Harvey's track from city to city" and finally tracked him  to a Palm Springs restaurant where he was arrested at 11:45 p.m. Saturday by  U.S. marshals and police from Long Beach and Palm Springs, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Harvey's activities were attracting a growing amount of attention -- the TV  program "Unsolved Mysteries" planned to broadcast a segment on the scam -- as  the number of his victims increased, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Additional arrests are expected, but police would not release additional  information.  </P></p>

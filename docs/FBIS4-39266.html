			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A greater council of the People's Movement  of Ukraine [Rukh] took place on 4 June. The council determined  the position of the Rukh at the coming presidential elections.  The resolution particularly notes that the current political  situation in Ukraine is characterized by an intensification of  the offensive by antistatehood, pro-Communist forces.  Therefore, the results of the election of the president of  Ukraine will to a considerable extent affect the fate of the  Ukrainian state. The greater council also noted that the main  threat to the country's future comes from Oleksandr Moroz and  Leonid Kuchma, who heads the pro-Russian, pro-imperialist  forces. It was decided to support one of the candidates in the  presidential election who stands for statehood positions.</p>

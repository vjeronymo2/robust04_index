			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nasir Yahya: "Struggle in Yemen and Unknown </F> Future"]    [Text] Sanaa--Yemen's political crisis continues to run in  place, even though the intensity of the propaganda campaigns has  diminished greatly. This intensity is what contributed to  fanning the fires of disagreement and to inciting secessionist  and provincial emotions.    While the crisis is turning into a reality entrenching the  existence of two governments, each imposing its presence and  control over a part of the country, Yemeni political forces  continue their dialogue on a number of issues that are assumed  to be the cause of the crisis! However, all are aware that this  dialogue will not lead to a strong solution as long as 'Ali  Salih, the president, and 'Ali Salim, his vice president, have  not met face to face to discuss the issues causing the conflict.    Ordinary Yemenis have been awaiting the outcome of the  anticipated meeting between the Yemeni president and his vice  president in al-Jund on 9 January in response to an invitation  from a number of ulema. This area was chosen as a good omen  because it witnessed the meeting between Yemeni people and  Mu'adh Bin-Jabal, one of the prophet's veneered companions, and  the announcement of the Yemenis' adoption of Islam.    But the fact is that the country's political crisis is  becoming more complex and that it exceeds all popular  expectations. It is extremely difficult to expect a bilateral  meeting, unless sudden developments crop up.    Within this context, limited reports have begun to be leaked  to the press about a confidential dialogue between the GPC  [General People's Committee] and the YSP [Yemeni Socialist  Party] to develop an agreement to settle their disagreements in  a way that allows each party to maintain an equal share of power  and enables it to use a veto against anything it rejects or  anything it feels is damaging to its immediate or future  interest.    Some informed sources add that the accord that is being  concocted secretly will restore "bilateral" power and will  exclude the Islamic tendency from power, even though this  tendency ranked second in the elections! But the socialists  [YSP] say that the Islamists gained a share of the power at  their expense. Therefore, the accord will force the GPC to give  the Islamists a part of its share of the power. In return, the  YSP will give a similar part of its share to its allies. This  will make the government look like a national coalition that  combines all of the country's political tendencies, whereas it  will, in fact, be a new bilateral sharing of power! Thus, Yemen  will be unable to overcome its true problems, and it will be led  anew into a dark tunnel of administrative negativism and the of  organized plundering of money.  <H5>  Reality of Separation </H5>   Unless a new confidential accord exists, it can be said very  clearly that some sort of a regime that combines the features of  confederalism and federalism will be entrenched by reaffirming  the control of the two strong parties over each (former) part of  Yemen. The actual daily administrative, fiscal, and security  actions confirm this reality. The government in Sanaa can no  longer impose any decision on the governorates in which the YSP  has firm control and where the socialists carry out all their  actions as if they were an actually independent state.    Perhaps what confirms this point is the way the security  authorities deal with arrivals from the northern governorates.  Members of the House of Representatives itself are promptly  prevented from entering the southern governorates if the  security authorities see a need to prevent them. This happened  when delegations went to take part in the funeral of Brigadier  General Husayn 'Uthman 'Ashshal, a YGR [Yemeni Grouping for  Reform] leader and the first army commander in Aden after the  British evacuation!    Within the same context, Yemen's television Channel 2 (Aden)  announces repeatedly that any citizen wearing a janabiyah, a  small dagger that Yemenis wear around their waist as an ornament  and as a symbol of pride in the Yemeni heritage, will be  prevented from entering the city of Aden. Perhaps the serious  nature of this announcement becomes obvious when we realize that  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, a Presidential Council member,  and Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of  Representatives speaker, cannot enter Aden unless each of them  removes his janabiyah.    Last month, YSP papers published the text of a message  addressed from the leadership of the party branch in Sanaa, the  capital, to the party leadership in Aden, urging it to a  establish a model local government and a society of law, order,  and progress in the southern and eastern governorates and then  to spread this model to the rest of Yemen.    This message aroused opposition even within the parties  supporting the YSP, because it means, very simply, an undeclared  secession in the interest of a single party that controls  everything!  <H5>  Failure of Democratic Experiment </H5>   The most significant indications of the latest crisis is  that  it has declared the failure of the experiment involving  political pluralism and peaceful rotation of power. Consequences  of the disagreements have led to a reliance on the special armed  forces of each of the YSP and the GPC. The YSP has refused to  confine the disagreement to the halls of the House of  Representatives, where the presumed constitutional legitimacy  exists, because it knows that it represents a minority that  possesses nothing.    It can be said that the YSP's plan on this affair has  succeeded because the other parties--the GPC and the YGR--are  eager not to use the House of Representatives card, considering  that the rejection of any decisive House resolution could be  tantamount to a unilateral declaration of secession by a party  that has gathered all its leaders in Aden and has withdrawn most  of its deputies from the House of Representatives.    Even though the GPC and YGR position toward the House of  Representatives has affected the House's role negatively and has  depicted the House as being unable to perform its constitutional  role, this position has greatly curtailed the wish to secede and  has embarrassed the YSP, compelling it to stay, even if only  theoretically, within the framework of the officially  acknowledged state.    But the final outcome will be the burial of the democratic  experiment and the use of armed force to bolster partisan gains.  This means that the Constitution is no longer the umpire that  settles political disputes.  <H5>  Economic Crisis </H5>   Parallel to the political crisis, Yemen is experiencing a  ferocious economic crisis. Since the vice president retired to  Aden, prices have risen sharply. On the other hand, the value of  the local currency has dropped by 60 percent vis-a-vis the  dollar. Economic circles are overwhelmed by varied feelings of  concern and by fear that living conditions will worsen and that  the inflation wave will rise, thus posing a threat of the  recurrence of the riots that Yemen witnessed in December 1992.</p>

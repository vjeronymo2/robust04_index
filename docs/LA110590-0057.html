			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS PUT A MUZZLE ON SEAHAWKS;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: ALL QUIET ON THE SEATTLE FRONT AFTER LEWIS' PUNT RETURN, MILLER'S  FUMBLE RECOVERY SPARK FIRST CHARGER VICTORY IN KINGDOME SINCE 1980.  </P> <P> They yelled, they booed, and the noise rained down upon the Chargers in the  Kingdome again, but this time 59,646 fans were only whispering sweet nothings.  </P> <P> Not since 1980 when Dan Fouts was the starting quarterback and punt returner  Nate Lewis was a youngster of 14, had the Chargers enjoyed such serenity in the  raucous Kingdome.  </P> <P> Sunday, the Chargers muzzled the local screamers and broke a 7-7 tie with 24  consecutive points, including Lewis' 63-yard punt return for a touchdown, and  overran the Seahawks, 31-14, to snap an eight-game losing streak in the  Kingdome.  </P> <P> "They were telling me that people didn't think we could win here," Lewis said,  "so we came here to prove them wrong."  </P> <P> The Chargers (4-5) had lost three games in a row to Seattle and 10 of the last  12, but this one was over before they changed ends in the fourth quarter. The  Chargers had a 31-7 lead, and the Seahawks (3-5) were trying to cross the  50-yard line for only the second time all day.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you, one of the best things about this win is to see the way that  our special teams did the job," linebacker Billy Ray Smith said. "Because  that's always been Seattle's trademark. They assume immediately they are going  to win that phase of the game outright, and boy, our guys took it to them."  </P> <P> Lewis' touchdown return, the first for the Chargers since 1987 when Lionel  James went 81 yards against the Cardinals, came with 43 seconds remaining in  the third quarter.  </P> <P> "I had one in college at Georgia against Clemson for 73 yards," said Lewis, who  was a seventh-round pick from Oregon Tech after transferring from Georgia. "All  I had to do was get past the kicker, and no kicker is going to tackle me. That  would be embarrassing."  </P> <P> Lewis, projected to make his living in the NFL as a wide receiver, became the  team's punt returner only last week after Scott Schwedes was released.  </P> <P> He now has run back seven punts for an average return of 14.8 yards; New York's  Dave Meggett began the weekend as the NFL's leading punt returner with an  average return of 13.5 yards.  </P> <P> "It's designed to part the inside blockers and he did it to perfection," said  Larry Pasquale, special teams coordinator. "Whether he knows it or not, he did  a little wiggle, and that's the wiggle we're looking for to shake him free.  That's a tremendous feat against a team like that."  </P> <P> Lewis' punt return became a harbinger of disaster for the Seahawks. Defensive  lineman Les Miller fell on a Dave Krieg fumble in the end zone 32 seconds  later, and in less than a minute, the Chargers had two touchdowns, and a 31-7  advantage.  </P> <P> "I thought we were still in the game when we were down 17-7," Seattle Coach  Chuck Knox said, "but then in a short span of about three plays they get 14  points."  </P> <P> Linebacker Leslie O'Neal forced the fumble, and was credited with a 30-yard  sack. But he would also have been credited with the touchdown had the ball not  squirted out from under him.  </P> <P> "I'm just a scoring machine," Miller said after swiping the ball from O'Neal,  and collecting the third touchdown of his career. He recovered a fumble earlier  this season in the end zone against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and did the same  thing against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1987.  </P> <P> The Seahawks had won three of their last four games, and were coming off a bye  week. And at times, it appeared they all hadn't returned to work.  </P> <P> "The bye didn't have anything to do with it," Knox said. "The bye didn't return  a punt on us. The bye didn't miss a tackle or miss a block or anything like  that. They just beat us, and that's all there is to it."  </P> <P> The Chargers' defense limited Tampa Bay to 157 yards, eight first downs and  two-of-10 in third-down conversions a week ago. They gave up 194 yards to the  Seahawks, and Seattle converted only three of 10 third-down opportunities.  </P> <P> "It makes a big difference when our offense controls the ball like they did,"  linebacker Gary Plummer said. "And then we went out there, we did a good job of  stopping them on first down and putting them in long-yardage situations. In  those situations, we're at our best."  </P> <P> While the Chargers' defense sacked Krieg four times and forced an interception,  the offense was rolling.  </P> <P> The Chargers, who have scored on their first possession in seven games, went 72  yards in 11 plays to earn a 7-0 lead. Running back Ronnie Harmon, left  unguarded on a safety blitz, took a short pass in the flats, then went 11 yards  for the score.  </P> <P> The Seahawks drew even early in the second quarter on running back John L.  Williams' zig-zag 21-yard touchdown run. Williams appeared to be pinned down  for a loss after taking a pitch and running right, but he reversed himself and  ran across the field to post his first rushing touchdown against the Chargers  in eight meetings.  </P> <P> When the Chargers took possession, they went ahead to stay on Billy Joe  Tolliver's 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Quinn Early. It was the  Chargers' longest completion of the season, Early's first touchdown since 1988  and the longest reception of his pro career.  </P> <P> "I went to the sideline and I told Billy I needed justice," Early said, after a  diving catch in the first quarter at the goal line was negated by an official's  ruling that the ball had hit the turf. "So he came back to me on the post  pattern."  </P> <P> Tolliver said he would have been looking for Anthony Miller on the play, but  the Seahawks came with the blitz. "At least, I think they were blitzing," he  said.  </P> <P> Tolliver, who was six of 17 for 41 yards with an interception in his NFL  starting debut in Seattle last season, was 11 of 24 for 145 yards with two  touchdowns Sunday. He has now thrown 94 passes in a row without an  interception.  </P> <P> The Chargers moved to the Seattle two-yard line on their first possession of  the second half, and kicker John Carney extended the team's lead to 17-7 with a  20-yard field goal.  </P> <P> A restless crowd began booing their heroes a few moments later after Lewis took  Rick Donnelly's 46-yard punt and returned it the distance.  </P> <P> "It's the new streak of the '90s," Plummer said. "That's something Dan  (Henning, coach) emphasized all week. It had been kind of a joke among us that  the 1990 Chargers had not lost in the Kingdome, but I think a lot of guys took  it to heart."  </P></p>

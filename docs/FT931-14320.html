			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal increases dividend BANK of Montreal, which posted the strongest earnings growth among Canada's six big banks last year, has raised its quarterly dividend and plans a 2-for-1 share split. BMO announced at its annual meeting yesterday that the quarterly dividend would rise to 56 cents a share from 53 cents. The increased dividend will be paid to shareholders of record on February 8. The share split will be achieved by declaring a 100 per cent stock dividend, to be paid on March 20 to shareholders of record on March 5. BMO lifted net earnings by 7.5 per cent to CDollars 640m (USDollars 499m) in the fiscal year to October 31, compared with an average 50 per cent drop for the big six. It also posted the second-highest return on shareholders' equity, of 14 per cent. Although its loan-loss provisions rose substantially last year, BMO has a smaller exposure than most of its competitors to Olympia &amp; York and other troubled property groups. Except for problems with a western Canadian coal mining company, the bank said in its latest annual report that 'the rest of our portfolio withstood economic pressures very well.' BMO is gradually integrating its services with those of its wholly-owned US subsidiary, Chicago-based Harris Bankcorp. The two banks have merged their services to large corporate clients. BMO's new trust-company subsidiary, officially launched last week, is expected to draw heavily on Harris's experience in fiduciary services. PWA's Canadian Airlines International is reinstating 14 of the 32 flight segments it had suspended from its schedule earlier this month in an effort to tackle overcapacity. 'We cannot maintain reduced capacity in the double digits when Air Canada responds with a 3 per cent reduction,' said a Canadian Airlines official.</p>

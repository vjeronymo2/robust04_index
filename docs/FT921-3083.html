			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (20): Heavy rains hit crop - Cocoa NIGERIA'S COCOA production, like that of other big West African producers, appears to be heading for a significant slump. Production for the 1991-92 crop years is expected to fall to 105,000 tonnes from 160,000 tonnes last year; and foreign exchange earnings are set to drop from an estimated Dollars 190-Dollars 210m last year to Dollars 110-Dollars 120m this year. Cocoa traders in Lagos say heavy rainfall in August and September, coming after a large mid-crop which put the cocoa trees under stress, hampered the drying of the new cocoa crop and hit pod survival. A significant increase of black pod disease was also recorded and early assessments suggest quality is very poor, particularly as farmers have been blending bad with good quality beans. This is the first appreciable decline in production since the structural adjustment policy, introduced in 1986, spearheaded a revival of the cocoa industry. Boosted by significant devaluation of the naira over the past 12 months on the parallel market, prices have already increased significantly from an average of N10,000 a tonne last season to N17,000-N19,000 a tonne this year - a function primarily of foreign exchange speculation before the floating of the naira. The setback in production has come at a bad time because of the continuing uncertainty over whether the government intends to pursue its stated long-term policy of banning the export of raw cocoa beans to force an expansion of local value added processing. Moreover, one of the key weaknesses in the sector - the failure to deliver adequate extension services to the estimated 400,000 smallholder cocoa farmers - continues to inhibit growth. It is now beginning to appear that, failing a dramatic increase in world market prices, Nigerian cocoa production may not be able to recover to the 300,000-tonne level of the late 1960s. However, the foreign exchange liberalisation carried out earlier this month may at last have resolved a fundamental problem in the sector - the absence of long-term stable price signals which are established by demand and supply and accurately reflect the world market price. Prices to farmers will increase from the recent devaluation and cocoa should no longer be the object of speculators and businessmen exploiting the commodity for capital flight and foreign exchange profiteering. Since 1986 the abolition of Nigeria's inefficient state marketing boards, price and trade liberalisation and devaluation have all significantly reversed the local terms of trade for cocoa and boosted production, exports and foreign exchange earnings. With the recent real devaluation, the macro-economic climate for Nigeria cocoa producers is favourable. But on the micro-level there has been no improvement in the lack of proper extension services to farmers to encourage them to replant old trees, use adequate fertiliser and pesticides at the right time or improve the quality of their drying operations. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the government will or will not introduce the ban on the export of raw beans it threatened 18 months ago. The aim of the ban, as stated by Alhaji Abubaker Alhaji, now finance minister, was that semi-processed and processed forms of cocoa were more economically advantageous to the country in creating value added to raw materials, more employment opportunities in agro-processing and enhanced foreign exchange earnings. However, at the time the ban was announced Nigeria had a total processing capacity of 90,000 tonnes. The ban was suspended but in response at least eight companies have gone ahead with plans to build processing plants; two new ones have already started operations. Most of the new plants have benefited from about Dollars 160m-Dollars 200m of concessional African Development Bank loans disbursed through the import-export arm of the Central Bank. Dr Christopher Kolade, managing director of Cadbury Nigeria, says his processing plant will come on stream within the next year and that some sort of an export ban on beans will be introduced next year. 'At the time I was against the ban because we did not have the processing capacity we needed,' he said. 'But by the end of this year we will have installed capacity of 147,000 tonnes so that is the time to put the ban into effect and make sure that cocoa prices are determined by local conditions and not speculation and terminal prices for raw materials.' However, the ban has stimulated fierce debate. Many traders argue the ban will force down prices paid to farmers. A report prepared by a leading cocoa trading company argues value added in local processing in countries of origin does not cover the costs of processing. Among the other criticisms of the policy, the report argues: Local processors may have difficulty meeting stringent world quality standards; Processing requires substantial investment in sophisticated machinery and recruitment of skilled staff; Proximity to main markets and ability to supply a consistent product at short notice gives processors in consuming countries a competitive edge; A high level of working capital is required to purchase the necessary beans; Local producers cannot mix origin beans according to taste and colour specifications of consumers, or draw beans from cheapest sources or those with best quality/price ratio. Dr Kolade says most opponents of the ban are speculators who fear their 'get rich' trading operations are threatened by a viable processing industry. Nigerian processors, he says, have been exporting cocoa products for years and have achieved good quality and found a market. Whatever the merits of the ban, many analysts believe ultimately the government will go ahead with a restriction on raw bean exports. 'The government is thinking about socio-economic development so it is strategic for me to start up processing because the government will inevitably protect processors either through a levy on exports or a complete ban,' says one trader turned processor. 'The government will have to find a way for processors to make money.' The effect on Nigeria's cocoa industry remains questionable but the uncertainty about the ban and whether there will be sufficient demand for farmers' beans from local processors remains a powerful constraint to growth.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Cooperative Action Movement [MKN], the  MODELH-PRDH [Democratic Movement for the Liberation of  Haiti-Democratic Revolutionary Party of Haiti], and the [Bel-Air  branch of the] Movement for the Organization of the Country  [MOP] have issued a new joint statement. These three political  parties say the legislature does not have the authority to enact  laws with a view to forming a provisional government under  Article 111 of the Constitution.    [The leaders of these parties, respectively] Volvick Remy  Joseph, Francois Latortue, and Greger Jean-Louis, affirm that  logically, no government can be formed before the dismissal of  the president, in keeping with constitutional procedure.    The three leaders point out that the Senate reinstated  President Aristide as president of Haiti and that the Army  acknowledged his legitimacy by signing the Governors Island  agreement. These three party leaders explain that the text of  Article 111 as a general clause cannot replace a particular  clause.    The MODELH-PRDH's Latortue has labeled the behavior of the  international community as...[rephrases] has criticized the  behavior of this community, which has imposed economic sanctions  on Haiti.    [Begin Latortue recording, in Creole] Those sanctions affect  mostly the lower strata of society: the poor, the poorest of the  poor. Those who are in the middle class manage so their arms are  not competely broken when the ball is falling down. [sentence as  heard] Those who are at the lower level, however, can do  nothing. They are suffering. When fuel is as expensive as it is,  fares are high. The unfortunates who cannot pay the fares at all  will be obliged to walk.    When the prices of all items increase, when the prices of  milled corn and rice increase, many people cannot eat those  things because they cannot afford them.    At present, many children are dying of tuberculosis. Their  parents do not have money to buy medicine, nor even to provide  the children with food. A situation such as this must end as  quickly as possible. Meanwhile, the leaders themselves have  plenty of money. They wear nice clothes and have money in their  pockets, but the masses have nothing and are dying.    I do not know what his [not further identified] reasons are.  However, in my opinion, an end should be put to this situation.  I believe that thanks to the pressures or...[rephrases] he [not  further identified] will eventually understand that forming a  new government is an urgent necessity. Otherwise, I believe, the  international authorities will be obliged to take measures. [end  recording]</p>

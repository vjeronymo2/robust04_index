			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRAISE FOR POWAY  </P> <P> This is in answer to Mary Szterpakiewicz's letter of April 29, "Mobile Home  Rents."  </P> <P> Our government has subsidized our tobacco industry for years, helped out  Chrysler, savings &amp; loan companies, the list is endless.  </P> <P> These are all multimillion-dollar establishments. Where is it written that  government can only help the rich?  </P> <P> Isn't it nice that we in Poway have good people sitting on the council that  care about their residents and are not afraid to buck the establishment of the  money hungry. I believe everyone should make a profit, that's what business is  all about. I also believe that a senior citizen has the right to live in  dignity and not be forced to move in with their children in their golden years  which happens all too often.  </P> <P> The statement "Poway may use its power to steal another mobile-home park" is  way out of line; Mary didn't do her homework! To steal means to take another's  possession illegally without his/her knowledge.  </P> <P> The out-of-state owners have been offered a more than fair-market value for  their property. For three months, letters were written by legal counsel and  many phone calls were made. Not once did we have a response. Doesn't this show  you what the residents have to deal with? We are a community within ourselves,  399 coaches, dedicated to helping our neighbors.  </P> <P> I suggest we refresh our memories with the opening lines from the Declaration  of Independence, "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Is that asking  so much? Thanks to our City Council we all have something to look forward to.  I, too, will now be able to live here in my Golden Years.  </P> <P> PAT PALMER  </P> <P> Poway  </P></p>

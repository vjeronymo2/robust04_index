			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / OECD predicts 2 years of steady growth for UK: Low inflation and better job prospects expected Britain can expect at least two more years of steady economic growth, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. In its latest half-yearly outlook, the Paris-based body, which represents 25 leading industrial nations, adds that the present economic upturn should be healthier than previous recoveries. Inflation will remain relatively low even though unemployment will fall significantly. But the organisation urges the British government to raise interest rates again to curb any inflation. It predicts that bank base rates will rise to 7 per cent next year, and to 7.5 per cent at the start of 1996. Although this marks a significant increase, the OECD says UK interest rates should remain well below the peaks seen in previous cycles. 'The current recovery differs from previous upswings in several respects . . . controlling inflation may be possible with lower interest rate rises than in the past as monetary and fiscal policies have been tightened much earlier in the cycle,' it says. One factor that may help keep inflation down, the OECD suggests, is the relatively high level of spare capacity estimated to exist in the UK economy. In spite of mounting concern in the City that recent strong growth could be overheating the economy, the OECD says the UK has more spare capacity than any of the leading seven industrial nations. It calculates that the UK output gap, which represents the difference between potential and actual growth, is 4 per cent. In addition, the report says the structural reforms that occurred in the UK during the 1980s may help keep interest rates low. The OECD gives a cautious welcome to the deregulation of the UK labour market. The changes which have taken place in recent years mean falling unemployment may not push up inflation as fast as in the past, it says, predicting unemployment will fall below 8 per cent in the next two years. Although the report was written before the recent Budget and interest rate rise, it says the tax increases introduced earlier this year should slow the pace of recovery slightly next year. Gross domestic product is predicted to grow by 3.4 per cent next year, slowing to 3 per cent the following year. This is slightly more optimistic than the Treasury's forecast of 3.25 per cent growth next year. Inflation is forecast to remain relatively low next year, but is expected to rise to 2.6 per cent in 1996. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said the report was 'very encouraging'. In a separate report, however, market research group Gallup pointed to a worsening 'feel-bad' factor in the UK. It said yesterday that its December survey of consumer confidence showed a sharp increase in the number of households expecting their financial position to worsen next year.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and New  Zealand have decided to extend their bilateral fishery agreement  set to expire on Sept. 30 this year for four years until 1998.    A Korean fisheries administration official said on Friday  the  decision was made at a Korea-New Zealand fishery meeting held in  Wellington on May 30-31.    New Zealand agreed at the meeting to reflect lowered fishery  fees for South Korean fishing boats operating in the New Zealand  waters in the New Zealand fishery law now being revised.    The oceanic country also promised to cooperate positively in  the effort of Korea to join the southern tuna protection  convention and thereby obtain a tuna fishing quota.    Moreover, the two countries agreed to step up their  cooperation through various international working-level fishery  conferences, the official said.    The Wellington meeting was attended by a seven-member Korean  delegation headed by Pak Ki-chol, a fishery promotion official  of the fisheries administration.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Freshfields' roots - Legal Briefs Freshfields, the City of London solicitors, has been indulging in a bit of vanity publishing to trumpet its 250th anniversary. The first Freshfield, James William, did not arrive on the scene until 1801, but the firm maintains that it can trace its roots back to 1743, when one Samuel Dodd was appointed solicitor to the Bank of England. In 1808 the first partnership bearing the name Freshfield was set up. When Benjamin Disraeli joined Swain, Stevens, Maples Pearse &amp; Hunt in 1821, it was, he said, 'the most eminent solicitors' firm in the City except Freshfield's'. The list of eminent and blue-chip clients has included: Castlereagh, Sir Robert Peel, Gladstone, Bank of England, Lloyd's, London Chatham &amp; Dover Railway Co, J Henry Schroder, P&amp;O, Gulbenkian, the Kuwait government and Pearson, owners of the Financial Times.</p>

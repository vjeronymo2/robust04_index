			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> NAVY PROBING CRACKS IN NEW ATOM SUB  </P> <P> Navy officials are investigating two severe cracks in the outer steel hull of a  Los Angeles-class nuclear submarine under construction at the Electric Boat  shipyard in Groton, Conn., officials said. The company described the cracks in  the nearly completed Topeka, an SSN-688 fast-attack submarine, as "quite  severe" and said workers may have to replace a portion of the giant pressure  hull. Electric Boat said the cracks represent "a very unusual occurrence." The  company is seeking to determine the cause of the cracks. Electric Boat, a  division of General Dynamics Corp., said Armco Inc. of Parsippany, N.J.,  supplied the steel for the submarine. "It is too premature to identify any  financial liabilities," the company said.  </P></p>

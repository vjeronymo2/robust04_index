			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ARIZONA BARS CRITICIZED REFEREE  </P> <P> Veteran referee Roger Yanez, who came under criticism for his handling of a  one-sided fight here last month, will not be allowed to work any more bouts  this year, state boxing officials said.  </P> <P> Buzz Alston, commissioner of the Arizona State Boxing Commission, said the  decision was made after a review of Yanez's performance during the Alex  Garcia-Bernard Benton fight Oct. 9 at the La Mancha Athletic Club.  </P> <P> Benton, a former World Boxing Council cruiserweight champion, was pinned in a  corner and knocked unconscious by Garcia at 2:42 of the second round.  Commission officials said that Yanez was not in a proper position to make a  timely decision and that Benton was left defenseless -- taking 32 unanswered  punches before falling face down on the canvas.  </P> <P> The fight was televised live nationally on USA Cable, and La Mancha employees  said their switchboard was deluged with telephone calls in protest of Yanez's  handling of the fight.  </P></p>

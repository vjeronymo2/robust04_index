			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Engineers urge better technology teaching AN EIGHT-POINT plan to promote technology teaching in schools was put forward yesterday by the Engineering Council, Andrew Adonis writes. The plan calls for a practical technology curriculum, based on the design and manufacture of products and systems. It was written by Professor Alan Smithers and Dr Pamela Robinson of Manchester University's education department. They say technology is poorly taught in schools in spite of its inclusion as a core subject in the national curriculum. It is mainly concerned with generalised problem solving without specific knowledge or practical application. Technology in the National Curriculum.

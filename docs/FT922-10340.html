			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE REDUCED premium of the June contract on the FT-SE was the only noteable feature in an otherwise lacklustre session in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. June opened at the 2,697 level, which proved to be the high point of the day, the contract then going into reverse, with stock index futures tracking the underlying cash market lower. Two-way business was seen at midsession before the sellers once again took command, leading June lower. Wall Street was said to have had no effect. Dealers pointed to the reduced premium of the contract to the underlying cash market, which at the day's worst fell to just 22 points, having started the week at around 35. June closed at 2,680, around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover was a healthy 8,000 lots. Volume in the traded options market reached 34,340 contracts, down from 43,773 lots the previous day. The Volume in FT-SE options, which yesterday saw April expiry, was 12,752 lots. The Euro FT-SE traded 2,330 lots. British Steel was the busiest stock option with 2,249 contracts. This was followed by Hanson with 1,270.</p>

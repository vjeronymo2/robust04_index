Here are  statements by the two chiefs following the signing ceremony:    [Begin Petrov recording] This is a very specific program for  joint activity at different levels by the military  representatives of the two countries. It is fully in the spirit  of the documents signed so far on friendship and cooperation  between Bulgaria and Greece; it is fully in the spirit of the  military agreement signed by the Bulgarian and Greek defense  ministers in 1993, which is a very important document embodying  additional confidence- and security-building measures further to  the 1992 Vienna document, and fully in the spirit of the  Partnership for Peace Initiative. [end recording]    [Begin Limberis recording, in Greek with superimposed  Bulgarian translation] Today's signing of the cooperation  program confirms the excellent level of relations in the  military field between the two countries' military forces, and  at the same time opens up new ways. We now face a further  challenge to extend our cooperation with a view to serving the  interests of peace. [end recording]</p>

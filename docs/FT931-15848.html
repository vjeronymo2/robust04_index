			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Press complaints chief attacks self-regulation report LORD McGREGOR of Durris, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, yesterday fiercely attacked the author of a government report on regulation of the press, accusing him of bias and proposing censorship that threatened to emasculate British journalism. His attack follows reports that Sir David Calcutt QC, who was asked by the government to investigate how well press self-regulation has worked in the past two years, has recommended tough new controls. They are said to include substantial fines for newspapers which breach a statutory code of practice, a press complaints tribunal chaired by a judge and criminal offences of physical trespass and electronic eavesdropping. Sir David's report was delivered to Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage Secretary, on Friday. Neither Mr Brooke nor senior officials from his department would comment yesterday. Lord McGregor yesterday accused Sir David of 'failing to give a proper judicious assessment of the evidence submitted to him'. The PCC chairman said the proposals would mean using the power of government to 'censor' the press. The growing alarm of the newspaper industry at Sir David's recommendations seems to be based on a sight of a part of the report which deals with the work of the PCC, the body that replaced the Press Council. This account is critical and negative. The PCC in its evidence told Sir David it believed self-regulation of the press was working well. The reported recommendations for action are identical to those suggested by Sir David Calcutt in his 1990 report for implementation should self-regulation be seen to fail. Sir David was asked last June to carry out a six month investigation into how self-regulation was working. During that period there was criticism of alleged press intrusion into the private lives of members of the royal family and government ministers. Lord McGregor emphasised yesterday that in a long period of one party government it was particularly important that the only effective opposition  -the press - should not be emasculated. Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP whose private member's bill on the press receives its second reading on January 29, said he thought the reported proposals were excessive and would impede good investigative journalism. The government plans to publish the Calcutt report later this month. Its attitude to new press controls should become clearer during the second reading of Mr Soley's right of reply bill. Initial political reactions suggested the recommendations are seen as extreme although there is growing support for some action against the grosser forms of press intrusion. An end to bugging of private telephone calls is most likely. Showdown, Page 6</p>

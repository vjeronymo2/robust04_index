			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Supreme Court judge rejects death penalty US Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun yesterday declared his all-out opposition to the death penalty, becoming the only one of nine Supreme Court judges to consider capital punishment unconstitutional in all cases. 'From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death,' Mr Blackmun wrote in a dissent to the Supreme Court's denial of an appeal by a prisoner in Texas scheduled to die by lethal injection today. 'Rather than continue to coddle the court's delusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed,' he added. In an opinion backing the court's denial of the appeal, Justice Antonin Scalia savagely criticised Mr Blackmun's arguments. 'Convictions in opposition to the death penalty are often passionate and deeply held. That would be no excuse for reading them into a constitution that does not contain them,' Mr Scalia wrote. Mr Blackmun's conversion is unlikely to have any immediate practical consequence on the application of the death penalty in the US, since in most of the test cases that have come before the Supreme Court in recent years he had already voted against its use in many specific circumstances. Along with since-retired Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, the last members of the court to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, and Justice John Paul Stevens, Mr Blackmun voted with the minority in 1987 in McCleskey vs Kemp, in which the court said that clear evidence that the death penalty was disproportionately applied to blacks was not enough to overturn a sentence. He joined the same justices in the dissenting minority in 1989 when the court upheld the execution of a defendant convicted of a crime committed at the age of 16, a practice followed by only five other countries, including Iraq and Iran. The Supreme Court nullified all death penalty statutes in the US in 1972 on the grounds that they were arbitrary and irrational, but from 1976 onwards has progressively permitted wider use of capital punishment under redrafted laws. Since then, 228 people have been executed, 31 of them last year.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION -- THOSE WHO CRY 'WOLF'  </P> <P> Re: Malathion aerial spraying. The ongoing public hysteria over aerial spraying  is nothing more than anti-Malathion activists crying "Wolf!"  </P> <P> When I was a student at San Jose State in the 1970s, we had a fruit fly problem  in Mountain View.  </P> <P> The public were up in arms even before the first helicopter took off. Unknown  to the public, and the helicopter crew, no Malathion was released due to  clogged nozzles! The next morning, some of the public complained about the  smell, headaches and nausea!  </P> <P> I told my pesticide supplier about this and he recounted an experiment  conducted by a large pesticide manufacturer. They filled a brand new sprayer  with pure water and began spraying in a nursery next to homes, letting the  homeowners believe that pesticides were being applied. The next day, there were  complaints about headaches, ill health and poisoned pets!  </P> <P> With all this in mind, I decided to conduct my own experiment. I sprayed a  tankful of water in my nursery next to a neighbor who was always complaining  about my spraying. The next day, I received a call from the Edison Company,  whose land I lease. The homeowner had complained about headaches and  respiratory problems.  </P> <P> I've been using Malathion for years with absolutely no adverse health effects  to myself or others. The public's hysteria is misplaced. They should be  hysterical about the spread of the Medfly!  </P> <P> HENRY SAKAIDA  </P> <P> Manager, Sakaida Nursery Inc.  </P> <P> Rosemead  </P></p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / People: Fisons slims Cedric Scroggs, chief executive of Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment company, has abolished the position of managing director of the scientific equipment division. Scroggs, who headed the division for 11 years, has decided the three businesses - Curtin Matheson Scientific in the US, Fisons Scientific and Fisons Instruments - enjoy little synergy and there is little point in having an additional layer of management to deal with them. Robert Lankester, 51, managing director of the scientific equipment division, has therefore resigned from the company and the board. Lankester joined Fisons in 1982 as group financial controller, and became chairman of the horticulture division, now in the process of being sold, in 1989. He was made managing director of the scientific equipment division in April 1992. There will be a handful of redundancies at Fisons' hq and the heads of the three business units within scientific equipment will report to Scroggs.</p>

The team was formed after the Ninth Supreme People's  Assembly  held its sixth plenary meeting last December, when Kim Yong-chu,  younger brother of President Kim Il-song, was returned to the  party leadership and Kim Tal-hyon resigned as deputy premier and  chairman of the State Planning Commission.    "This has been confirmed by eastern European diplomats in  Pyongyang," said the sources, who are well informed of North  Korea's affairs.    In parallel with its move to settle the nuclear issue, North  Korea appears to be moving to prepare for dialogue with South  Korea, expected to resume as soon as the nuclear issue is  settled, they said.    Both Kims are known as moderates in their policy toward  South  Korea, and their appointment as top South Korea policymakers  gives rise to expectations that North Korea will improve its  relations with South Korea.    Kim Tal-hyon's appointment as deputy team leader signifies  that he is still a member of the party leadership, defying  rumors that he was demoted to manager of a textile factory.</p>

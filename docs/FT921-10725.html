			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Indian fund for training THE INDIAN government yesterday announced the establishment of a Rs2bn (Pounds 43.4m) national renewal fund to provide a social security net for workers made redundant by the closure of loss-making factories. The fund is intended to retrain and redeploy up to 48,000 workers affected by such closures which are mostly in the public sector. So far 58 industrial units have been identified. They have cumulative losses of Rs100bn and the government estimates it would take Rs150bn to make them profitable. Formulation of a policy which would enable loss-making public and private sector factories to be closed, however, has been delayed by trade union opposition. The unions want to be allowed to run the units as worker co-operatives and they have some support from the Finance Ministry.</p>

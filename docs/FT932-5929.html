			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / US Money and Credit: Dollar slides amid inflation jitters THE DATES June 11 and June 15 are emerging as key tests of the US credit markets, whose jitters over inflation have been exacerbated by a continued slide in the dollar over the past week. The two dates will see the release of the May producer and consumer prices indices respectively and the markets are anxiously waiting to see whether the statistics will continue the upturn in inflation which characterised the first four months of the year. There is a widespread belief on Wall Street that a really poor consumer price index report, a rise of 0.4 per cent or more, would trigger the first tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in four years, though few analysts expect the figures to be anywhere near so bad. Yet such a move would risk undermining what remains a very subdued US economic recovery, as underlined last Friday by revised first-quarter GDP figures, showing a rise of just nine tenths of 1 per cent, half the 1.8 per cent originally estimated. One television report last Thursday, based on apparent leaks from the Fed, suggested that at the May 18 meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee the bank voted nearly unanimously to bias its policy towards tightening credit conditions. There may, however, be an element of artful politics in all this. The Fed could have leaked news of its inflationary vigilance to calm the markets and thus obviate the need to actually tighten. But Wall Street's nervousness stems also from factors which are beyond the central bank's control. One is the persistent rise in the price of gold, which many regard as a harbinger of inflation. Another is the decline of the dollar, which last week sank to a new low against the Japanese yen, despite heavy Fed intervention in the money markets, amid the persistent belief among traders that the Clinton administration wants to ameliorate America's trade deficit with a cheap dollar. The government denies this, but the currency's slide has nonetheless unsettled the credit markets. This is partly because it reduces the attraction of dollar denominated investments and partly because it tends to stoke inflation. A third element of concern is the fate of the White House's tax-raising, deficit-reducing budget package, which acted as a positive force on the credit markets in the first few months of the year. But that was before the Clinton administration demonstrated difficulty in getting its programmes through even a Democratic-dominated Congress. The budget package was approved by the House of Representatives late on Thursday night, but with barely a vote to spare. It faces an even tougher ride in the Senate, where conservative Democrats object to key features of the plan, notably its energy taxes. All these factors combined to create a volatile market last week, with a substantial flattening of the yield curve. The short end of the market was worst hit, with the yield on the new two-year Treasury note jumping from 4.17 per cent at auction last Tuesday to 4.24 per cent at Friday's close. The long end of the market actually rallied on the week, partly due to technical factors, but also to the signals of Fed inflationary vigilance, with the benchmark 30-year issue ending the week with a yield of 6.98 per cent, down from 7.04 per cent seven days earlier. But for all the market's jitters, a much more positive spin can be put on current conditions. The slow growth of the economy suggests the inflationary bubble of the past few months cannot be sustained, while the Senate's passage of a compromise Clinton package could do much for market sentiment. Mr Henry Kaufman, the economic consultant whose opinions swayed the markets back in the early 1980s, even stuck his neck out last week and predicted the Fed would ease credit conditions again, possibly in July, amid sluggish growth and subsiding inflation.</p>

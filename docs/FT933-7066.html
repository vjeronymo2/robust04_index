			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat shows sharp increase to Pounds 6.75m GUINNESS PEAT Group, the UK investment vehicle of New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley which took over Brown Shipley Holdings in March, reported a sharp rise in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993. Profits came to Pounds 6.75m, compared with Pounds 3.15m for the nine month period ended June 1992, when the company changed its year end. GPG attributed the rise to a good performance from its main asset, Tyndall Australia, the life assurance and fund management company in which it has a 56 per cent stake. In addition the group cited the unwinding of its joint venture with Brierley Investments in Rossington, owner of the majority of Australian Consolidated Investment, which has oil and brewing interests. Turnover was steady at Pounds 13m, in spite of the difference in accounting periods. Interest payable fell to Pounds 322,000 (Pounds 701,000). GPG paid Pounds 5.6m for Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking business arm of the UK merchant bank. Yesterday the group said the acquisition had proved 'very complementary to GPG's UK operations.' It contributed Pounds 280,000 after-tax in the last two months of the latest period. Mr Blake Nixon, GPG director, said the purchase of Brown Shipley was 'the sort of thing we expect to do quite regularly in the UK.' The group would be looking for companies that would respond to its skills. Last November GPG regained its stock market listing after a suspension lasting nearly two years. The suspension was imposed because GPG was considered a shell company with no underlying business activity. Mr Nixon said the suspension had held the company back. 'It tied us up in huge amounts of non-productive work. Now we can focus on the basic business.' Earnings per share were 0.86p (0.71p) after payment of minority interests of Pounds 1m (Pounds 661,000). The shares closed yesterday at 28 1/2 p, up 2p on the day.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY REMEMBERED  </P> <P> As politicians and educators spoke to cameras nearby, Bertha Alicia Gonzalez  remembered the day six years ago when a crazed gunman stole the lives of 21  people, including several of her best friends. Gonzalez held her hand to her  face and cried.  </P> <P> "We pray together, cry together, go to the cemetery together and embrace in  pain together," said Gonzalez, who has lived in San Ysidro for 30 years. "The  pain is still there."  </P> <P> Gonzalez watched groundbreaking ceremonies Wednesday for a memorial at the  former site of the San Ysidro McDonald's, where James Oliver Huberty committed  the country's largest single-day mass slaying on July 18, 1984. Huberty killed  21 people before being shot and killed by police.  </P> <P> About 100 people -- relatives and friends of the victims, educators,  politicians, and the press -- showed up for the morning ceremony, the  culmination of six years of argument over what should happen to the  three-quarter-acre site wedged between Interstate 5 and West San Ysidro  Boulevard.  </P> <P> Facing the boulevard, the $50,000 monument -- 21 six-sided granite columns  arranged symmetrically -- should be completed in six months, according to  school officials.  </P> <P> The site is now owned by Chula Vista's Southwestern College, which has  constructed a building for a satellite college behind the spot where the  monument will stand.  </P> <P> The columns, which will be from 1 to 7 feet tall, represent the massacre  victims and the resilience of the San Ysidro community, said Dr. Serafin A.  Zasueta, dean and director of the satellite. The monument was designed by a  former architecture student at the college, Roberto Valdes Jr.  </P> <P> Gonzalez, for one, is still upset that the city chose to sell the land to the  college district instead of building a park.  </P> <P> "It was a political manipulation by whoever was involved," said Gonzalez, the  publisher of Ahora Now, a community newspaper. "It's such a little thing. The  people who passed away and those who are still living deserve" more.  </P> <P> Edgar Hernandez's 11-year-old brother, Omarr, was the first victim to be  identified after the massacre. At Wednesday's ceremony, Hernandez, 23, recalled  his memories of that deadly day, when he saw on TV his brother lying on the  ground.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe it," he said. "That's all they did, they just showed my  brother."  </P> <P> Francisca Lopez Aquino told reporters she's glad the site will be part of a  college.  </P> <P> "It's OK, it's only a little bit, but it's the way we will remember them," said  Aquino, whose daughter Paulina, 21, died from Huberty's shots.  </P> <P> Two months after the shooting, McDonald's Corp. major shareholder Joan Kroc had  the building razed and donated the tract to the city.  </P> <P> For several years, the only memorial on the site was a crude clapboard  structure that bore the names of the victims and eulogies -- in Spanish and  English -- beside vandals' graffiti.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there was division in the small, heavily Latino community over what  should be built, with some residents favoring a full park and  interdenominational chapel, while others wished that no reminders of the attack  remain.  </P> <P> Some local businessmen favored selling the lot, then appraised at $500,000,  parking spaces for nearby shops and using the proceeds to build a park nearby.  </P> <P> Politicians argued over the land's fate until February, 1988, when the San  Diego City Council decided by a 5-4 vote to sell it to Southwestern for  $40,000, about 10% of the original asking price. Proceeds from the sale will  improve San Ysidro parks.  </P> <P> Part of the deal was a requirement for the college to build the memorial. Half  of that money has come from private donations. The largest gift was from  Catellus Development, a $15,000 donation.  </P> <P> Maria Neves-Perman, a San Ysidro schoolteacher who lost three students in the  massacre, organized the fund raising for the memorial as president of the  college's board of trustees.  </P></p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Dollars 913m agreed bidfor Templeton, Galbraith TEMPLETON, Galbraith Hansberger, the London-listed and Bahamas-based international fund management company, is being acquired by Franklin Resources Incorporated, the California-based fund manager in an agreed deal valued at Dollars 913m (Pounds 478m). Franklin specialises in fixed-income retail products and the merger will form the largest independent fund management company in the US. The merger is widely viewed as a bellwether for the mutual fund industry which is facing increasing competition in a mature market. Selling expenses are rising and industry analysts are taking the view that further consolidation within the industry is likely. 'Fund managers will need to have more money under management in order to cover costs,' said Mr Patrick Donlea, partner at Cazenove which acted as adviser on the transaction. The deal is expected to give Templeton access to greater distribution networks in the US, said Mr Martin Flanagan, a director of TGH. Templeton recently announced changes to its pricing structure, lowering front-end fees on its mutual funds because they were substantially above the industry average and were costing the company sales. The terms call for Sir John Templeton, the 79-year old founding member of the company, his son Mr John Templeton and partner Mr John Galbraith to receive Dollars 5.69 per share. The three own about 70 per cent of the company. Sir John has said he would like gradually to reduce his involvement in the company's affairs and will change his role in the new structure to that of consultant. Public shareholders will receive Dollars 6 a share. Because of the deal, no dividends will be paid in respect of the six month period ended June 30 1992. If Templeton loses more than 20 per cent of its funds under management before the deal can be approved by shareholders then the price per share will fall. If more than 40 per cent of funds under management are withdrawn, both Templeton and Franklin have the right to terminate the agreement. Franklin said its intention was to keep the management structure and investment style of Templeton intact - a key factor in retaining Templeton's client base. To this end, it plans to offer employment contracts, which include bonuses, to certain employees, including four of the directors. Two of the four are Mr Thomas Hansberger and Mr J Mark Mobius, investment manager of the highly successful emerging markets fund. If the directors stay a further two years after the merger, they will receive another Dollars 32m in bonuses.</p>

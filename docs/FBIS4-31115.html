			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 5 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of  the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), academician Mihajlo  Markovic, said on Saturday evening [5 June] he had not taken  part in any kind of talks with the representatives of the  Albanian minority living in Serbia's southern Kosovo province  and that noone had given him such a task.    Last week the British press announced that Markovic had met  in an embassy in Belgrade with the Kosovo ethnic Albanian  representatives.    "The Kosovo Albanians are still unwilling to take part in a  dialogue. They continue nurturing hopes that the big powers,  primarily the United States, will give them their own state, but  nothing will come out of that. The prevailing stand is that  minorities cannot secede and this also refers to the ethnic  Albanians in Kosovo," Markovic told a meeting of young  socialists in Jagodina, town in central Serbia.    He said that before long they (ethnic Albanians) will have  to  sit down at the negotiating table if they want something to  change in their favour, because they have excluded themselves  from the political and economic activities of Serbia and  Yugoslavia.    A strong separatist ethnic Albanian movement has for decades  been active in Kosovo. The separatists advocate the province's  secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia and its annexation to  neighbouring Albania.    Since they refuse to accept Serbia as their mother country,  the separatist leaders over the past four years pressured the  people to boycott the parliamentary and presidential elections  in Serbia.    The talks will take place, but whether they will be held in  the form of informal and not-binding talks between  intellectuals, or at the official level, will shortly be  announced, Markovic said.</p>

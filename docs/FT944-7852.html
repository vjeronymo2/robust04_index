			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Patrician makes play for the centre stage If Sir Marcus Fox, a Yorkshire grammar school boy, has the common touch, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, his challenger for the chairmanship of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, is unmistakably patrician. A descendant of Horatio Nelson and a former captain of boats at Eton, Sir Nicholas, 51, is married to the daughter of the second Lord Killearn. He is a former member of the council of the Lloyd's of London insurance market. This year's register of MPs' interests lists more than 70 syndicates of which he is a member. Sir Nicholas's monied background does not appear to equip him for advancement in Mr John Major's classless society. But he has both the gravitas and the independence of mind required for a post in which he would play an important role in conveying backbench views to the prime minister. The MP since 1983 for Upminster - at the easternmost extreme of London's District Line - he can claim to represent the centre of the party and will hope to attract support from colleagues on the left and right in tomorrow's contest. He is distinctly 'wet' on social issues and was a founding member of Francis (now Lord) Pym's Conservative Centre Forward grouping in 1985. But as chairman of the Commons defence committee since 1992 he has waged a vocal and effective campaign against cuts in the armed forces. He is sufficiently Eurosceptic to have contributed to the government's first defeat on the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty in March 1993. He was among 22 Tories who did not vote on a Labour amendment on the European Committee of the Regions. This was one of several occasions on which he has demonstrated his independent streak. Nearly seven years ago he rebelled against a three-line whip to support an unsuccessful backbench attempt to reform the Official Secrets Act. In July 1985 he was among 48 Conservatives who voted against the authorisation of big pay rises for top civil servants, senior service officers and judges. In April 1988 he was the sole Tory to voice sympathy for Mr Ron Brown, his long-time 'pair' in Commons voting arrangements, before MPs voted to suspend the hard-left Labour MP for Edinburgh Leith for a month for failing to apologise fully for damaging the mace. Sir Nicholas entered parliament as MP for Nantwich in 1979 and is therefore one of the growing band of Conservative MPs who have never served in opposition.</p>

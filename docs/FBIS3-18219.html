They said that Austria was negotiating a new package on its  terms of entry into the Union, Finland was also considering a  new offer.    A senior Norwegian official said talks involving Norway had  been suspended until next week.    A senior official of the EU's executive European Commission  was pessimistic about the chances of an agreement on Tuesday.  "There has not been enough progress," he said.    A spokesman for the EU's Greek presidency said: "We have  problems still with all four countries."    But German and Dutch diplomats said agreement on the terms  of  entry into the EU were remote unless the applicants made big  last-minute concessions.    The year-old negotiations were supposed to have been wrapped  up at midnight Monday night after a final four-day session that  started on Friday.    The officials would not say whether solutions were within  reach on the major problems still blocking agreement, which  involve Norwegian fish and truck pollution across the Austrian  Alps.    Austria was insisting on retaining strict limits on truck  traffic across the Austrian Alps until 2004, which the EU  maintains would contravene its rules of free movement.    Norway was still refusing to allow EU fishing fleets  increased access to the fish-rich Norwegian waters as part of  Oslo's price for joining the Union.    Finland was holding out for the right to extend aid to all  its farmers, in contravention of EU agricultural policies. And  Sweden was pushing for a gradual phase-in of its contributions  to the EU budget.    The negotiators were also expected to delay a decision on  another dispute -- that the applicants could tilt the EU's  balance of power towards its richer northern members, and  increase the influence of its smaller ones.    The EU had set the Monday midnight deadline so that  membership accords could be ratified in time for the applicants  to join the EU next January 1. But officials said the deadline  could possibly be stretched to March 10.    Germany and Denmark were fighting to have the four countries  join the EU together, rather than leave Norway and possibly  Austria out of the initial enlargement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wu Jinglian (0702 2417 8834): "Accelerate </F> Coordinated Reforms of the Financial, Tax, and State-Owned  Enterprise Systems"]    [Text] Since the latter part of last year, China's economy  has shown signs of "overheating" and inflation. What is meant by  the economy "overheating," from the perspective of the materials  production system, is that certain sectors of the national  economy can no longer support the going rate of growth. From the  monetary point of view, meanwhile, an "overheated" economy  refers to the rise in the overall price level; it means  "inflation." Between July and August of 1992, there were clear  signs of the economy overheating and of inflation. They could be  seen in three areas: 1) Bottlenecks in the "tight sectors" such  as communications and transportation, especially rail transport;  energy, especially power supply; raw materials, especially  construction materials, were even more restrictive. 2)  Inflationary pressure found its way from M&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  which  had a low rate of circulation to M&lt;inf&gt; 0&lt;/inf&gt;  which had a high  rate of circulation, and the retail price index began to rise.  If we include the price of means of production, the price index  would be even higher. 3) People began to expect inflation. For  example, the sale of Phase II state treasury notes which paid 9  percent annual interest was sluggish and the resale of Phase I  and older treasury notes was at below face value; meanwhile,  there were incidents of panic buying of gold, gold jewelry, and  hard currencies (U.S. and Hong Kong dollar). These indicated  that people were expecting the inflation rate to run at above 10  percent. At the end of last year and early this year, inflation  was obvious, or in the words of a newspaper, "inflationary  pressure is being released": The overall price index of the  workers' living expenses rose to double-digits; retail price  index in the 35 large and medium-sized cities rose to around 15  percent; RMB's exchange rate plummeted. At the same time,  because there were no market rules and because of the  expansionary monetary policy, China's stock market, real estate  market, and the just-opened futures market created a "bubble  economy." The situation clearly indicated that the financial  chaos and the soaring rate of inflation were threatening our  economic stability and the normal operations of businesses and  industries. If proper measures were not taken, it could lead to  serious economic turmoil. Under the circumstances, the  government began to take steps in July to rectify financial  order and lower the rate of increase in the money supply.  Although we were a little late, we were heading in the right  direction, and decisive action was necessary.    Current measures being taken can be separated into three  levels: 1) Use of direct administrative controls, which include  tightening the control over the loan quota, sorting out  investments in basic construction projects and the development  zones, and setting a deadline for retrieving illegal short-term  loans. 2) Use of economic measures, which include raising the  interest rate on loans again and resuming the opening of  inflation-proof savings accounts. 3) Proceed with reform of the  financial system. It has been a month since the introduction of  the first measures, and judging by the current situation,  although there have been some problems and difficulties, the  overall situation is good: Price increases have slowed; foreign  exchange prices have dropped; the "bubble economy" created by  stocks and real estate has shrunk. If all goes well, the  national economy may stabilize in the near future -- say, at the  end of the year or early next year. But, whether things will  turn out as expected will depend on whether the  yet-to-be-introduced measures are correct and whether they can  be effectively implemented.    The initial success so far is due mainly to the first level  measures and some of the second level measures. Under conditions  of extreme economic chaos, it is necessary to use some "hard  measures" to quickly put the situation under control. But we  must clearly understand that these administrative measures have  limits as well as side effects. That is to say, one, after 14  years of reform, China's finances have, in part, "come alives,"  which greatly diminishes the ability of administrative plans to  control the economy. About 50 percent of the gathering and  distribution of funds no longer go through the state banks'  formal channels. Therefore, it will be a mistake to rely too  heavily on administrative measures. Two, although we must make  every effort to do what is right and avoid what is harmful, it  is impossible to avoid being indiscriminate when using  administrative measures, and so when we use administrative  measures to cool the "overheated" parts of the economy, other  parts which need even more support or are even "hotter" will  often be affected, thus preventing the increase in supply.  Furthermore, since the financial system has not undergone  radical reform, some units may not be implementing state  policies properly, and when that happens, what should be  tightened may not tightened and what should not be tightened may  be tightened. For example, some units may not take away funds  used for real estate speculation but may take away necessary  industries' and businesses' circulation funds, and this can  cause serious consequences.    The effectiveness of the second type of measures is 1)  constrained by the effectiveness of organizations and  institutions manipulating those economic measures and 2) limited  by defects in other economic mechanisms. Therefore, the success  of those economic measures is predicated on reforms in other  areas. Today, the more serious problems are: 1) Speculation in  the bubble economy is yielding a high rate of return--100  percent profit or better a year. This has resulted in large  amounts of money being channeled to the stock, real estate, and  futures markets for speculation purpose, thus exacerbating the  shortage of funds needed by industries and businesses, and it  also makes it difficult for the interest lever to function  effectively. Therefore, as we tighten the money supply, we must  increase the supply of financial goods, strengthen market order  and management, and carefully release the air in the "bubbles."  2) Foreign exchange reform is out of sequence (regular accounts  are still using dual exchange rates and under administrative  control, and meanwhile, capital circulation is very lax,) and as  a result, our own currency is grossly undervalued and the  masses' confidence in our currency is shaken, which adds to the  inflationary momentum. We can remedy the situation in two ways:  One, retract the order and change those methods that have  loosened the control over the capital accounts. Another way is  to accelerate the reform to make trade-related foreign exchange  convertible. Personally, I favor the second method.    Since the root cause of this round of inflation is the slow  pace of reform, the basic cure of course is to accelerate  reform. Just as we have pointed out many times before, the root  cause of today's accelerated inflation and widespread corruption  is the very slow pace of reform of the taxation, financial, and  state-owned enterprise systems, and so the solution is to  accelerate reforms in those areas. In other words, not only must  we speed up the restructuring of the financial system, we must  also speed up the reform of the tax system and the restructuring  of the state-owned enterprise system. Moreover, reforms in these  areas must be coordinated, because only then can we quickly set  up the basic frame work of a market economy and give play to the  market economy's overall ability to allocate resources properly.  Therefore, it is imperative that we focus on the research and  study of a coordinated reform program, and once the program is  formulated, we must immediately get organized and quickly begin  its implementation.</p>

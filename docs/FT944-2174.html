			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Institutional muscles being flexed more often: US fund managers led revolt The institutional revolt over Mr Maurice Saatchi's position and compensation is part of a trend towards greater shareholder intervention in corporate governance issues. Institutions have become increasingly prepared to oust directors they believe are performing badly, although usually the pressure has been applied behind the scenes. Three years ago institutions managed to persuade Sir Roland Smith to stand down as chairman of British Aerospace after the company's badly managed rights issue. Usually shareholders have been galvanised into action by the falling value of their investment. More recently shareholders have started to take the initiative in questions of directors' compensation. While public anger has focused on the level of salaries and pay-offs, shareholders have been more concerned to ensure that executives' rewards are linked to performance. Mr Stuart Bell, head of research at PIRC, the corporate governance consultancy, said: 'There is a sea change going on in corporate governance. There is a new attitude among institutional investors that there are things they can do which will extract more value from companies.' In terms of directors' compensation the most high profile initiative has been the campaign by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of pension fund manager PosTel, to reduce the size of pay-offs to directors who resign or are forced out. This has succeeded in persuading a large number of companies to reduce the lengths of their directors' contracts, so limiting possible future pay-offs. Much of the new impetus comes from US-based institutions, where there is a stronger tradition of shareholder activism, particularly among the big public sector pension funds. The Saatchi revolt was led by US fund managers with the UK's M&amp;G. A new ruling by the US Department of Labor, which obliges US pension funds to use their votes if it is 'cost effective' for them to do so, is expected to lead to a further increase in US shareholder interventions. Mr Bell said: 'There could be several more Saatchis on the way. There will be a number of companies nervously examining their share registers to see how much is held by US funds.' Even institutions themselves have come under fire. M&amp;G faced criticism from other institutions earlier this year when it proposed a new executive share option scheme. The scheme flouted the recommendations of the UK's two biggest shareholder groups, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British Insurers. Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the investment committee of the NAPF, believes shareholder action is likely to increase but is against any moves to force them to become more active in corporate governance. He argues against the proposal to make voting at annual meetings mandatory on pension funds. He said: 'You can force institutions to vote but you can't force them to vote sensibly.' Mr Lindey also attacked the proposal that companies be forced to seek shareholder approval for directors' salaries. He said: 'It is impractical in that a director whose package was thrown out at an AGM could sue. And it could merely result in highly paid executives refusing to go on the board. 'Shareholders employ directors to run the company, and one of their responsibilities is remuneration. The only problem arises in respect of compensation for directors themselves, which should be decided by a remuneration committee composed entirely of non-executives.'</p>

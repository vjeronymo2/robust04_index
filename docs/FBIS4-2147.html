			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Procedures for Managing the Capital Construction of Units </F> Directly Under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and  Trade (MOFERT) -- promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) on October 5, 1993"]    [Text] In light of the new situation that has emerged along  with reform in the foreign trade system and the management of  capital construction, these procedures have been formulated for  the purpose of strengthening the management of capital  construction in units directly under MOFERT and better  implementing state policies on capital construction, in  accordance with related regulations of the state and the actual  situation in MOFERT.  <H5>  I. Making and Issuing of Plans </H5>   1. All units, consonant with the development plan of their  particular business, are to draw up long-term (three- or  five-year) capital construction plans in accordance with the  requirements issued by MOFERT, and to submit them to MOFERT in a  timely manner.    2. All units, according to the needs of their business and  the fulfillment of the capital construction budget for the year,  are to complete and submit to MOFERT every August their plans  for application for investment in capital construction for the  coming year (together with the application form), along with the  necessary explanatory notes (including reasons for the  construction of major projects, equipment available, and  location of construction; in cases of production projects, a  description of raw materials and resources used and of the  economic results following completion of the projects also is  required). Should application plans of units located in Beijing  include new projects to be constructed, these units at the same  time are to complete and submit the relevant forms for building  construction in Beijing.    3. All units, in accordance with the figures for controlling  investment in capital construction for the year, as released by  MOFERT, are to compile and submit to MOFERT their draft plans  for annual investment in capital construction.    4. Following evaluation and adjustment for overall balance  by MOFERT, the annual capital construction draft investment  plans submitted by all units are to be issued as formal plans  for implementation by the units. On receiving the plans, all  units are to immediately assign construction units to study  concrete measures for carrying them out, and should lose no time  in acquiring the necessary land, doing the design work,  preparing materials, and launching construction, so as to  guarantee fulfillment of the plans.    5. National corporations with subsidiary companies are to be  responsible for examining and summarizing the long-term plans,  application plans, and draft plans of their subsidiaries, and  for submitting them to MOFERT.  <H5>  II. Compilation, Submission, and Approval of Design </H5> Documents    (I) Project Proposals and Design Reports    1. With regard to the construction of large- and  medium-sized projects and of projects with investment  limitations set by the state (cold storage warehouses having a  capacity of more than 10,000 tons or projects involving a total  investment of more than 30 million yuan) -- if they fall into  the category of production projects -- all units, when making  long-term plans, are to submit five copies of the project  proposal to MOFERT and one copy to the State Planning  Commission. After conducting a preliminary evaluation, MOFERT  is to submit the proposal to the State Planning Commission for  evaluation and approval. With regard to nonproduction projects,  prior to submitting the application plans, all units are to  forward design reports to MOFERT, which is to refer them to the  State Planning Commission for evaluation and approval. Once  project proposals or design reports have been approved by the  State Planning Commission, the projects may be included in the  annual capital construction and investment plans.    2. With regard to construction projects involving a total  investment between 10 million and 30 million yuan, design  reports are to be compiled and submitted to MOFERT -- together  with the application plans -- for evaluation and approval. Once  approved, such projects may be included in the annual plan.    3. With regard to projects involving a total investment  between five million and 10 million yuan, the design report  compiled by the units is to be approved first by the departments  concerned and then submitted to MOFERT for the record.    4. With regard to projects involving an investment of five  million yuan or less, a simple design report will suffice, and  once approved by the departments concerned, may be kept in the  files of the applicant units.    5. Project proposals and design reports should be simple and  clear, and should include the following: name of the project,  its content and scale, the basis and conditions for its  construction (location, resources, water and electricity  supplies, communications and transportation), pace of  construction, source of investment, estimated amount of  materials and equipment, construction site, land to be occupied  by the project, and economic results. If necessary, a copy of  the total layout plan of the construction site may be required.    (II) Preliminary Expansion Designs and Engineering Budget  Estimates    1. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget  estimates are to be made by design departments in accordance  with the project proposal or design report (mainly concerning  construction scale and total investment) and submitted to MOFERT  by the applicant units, either for evaluation and approval or  for the record.    2. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget  estimates of large- and medium-sized projects or projects  involving investments exceeding state-set limitations are to be  submitted to MOFERT by the applicant units for evaluation and  approval conducted by MOFERT in conjunction with the departments  concerned.    3. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget  estimates for projects involving a total investment between 10  million and 30 million yuan are to be submitted by the applicant  units for evaluation and approval by MOFERT.    4. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget  estimates for projects involving a total investment between five  mi@lion and 10 million yuan are to be examined by departments  entrusted by the applicant units, then submitted to MOFERT for  the record.    5. Preliminary expansion designs and engineering budget  estimates for projects involving a total investment under five  million yuan are to be examined by the applicant units, together  with the departments concerned, and are to be kept in the files  of the applicant units.    6. Once the preliminary expansion designs and engineering  budget estimates have been evaluated and approved, they are to  be the basis for controlling project investment and for drawing  up construction budgets and engineering blueprints.    (III) Construction Drawings and Budgets    On completion of the construction drawings and the budget  for  a construction project, the construction unit will entrust the  departments concerned with evaluating and approving them.  <H5>  III. Planned Management </H5>   1. Planned management of capital construction projects is to  be strengthened. All capital construction projects are to be  included in the plan, and no extra-plan projects are to be  allowed. For projects financed by units themselves, there must  be effectively guaranteed financing, obtained through the proper  channels, before the projects can be included in the plan.    2. Once the annual investment plan for capital construction  is finalized, no expansion of the scale or other alteration of  the project is to be allowed. When changes are necessary, an  application for approval of the changes must be submitted to the  unit that approved the project.    3. Once the project proposal, design report, and preliminary  design are approved, no changes are to be made without  authorization. If changes are necessary in total investment,  construction scale, construction site, or any single item of the  project, an application for such changes must be submitted to  the unit that approved the project.    4. Examination of the implementation of the plans must be  strengthened. Questions that arise during the implementation of  a plan must be dealt with in good time. If the plan cannot be  fulfilled, or if an increase or an adjustment to the plan is  necessary, a report must be submitted to MOFERT for examination  and approval.  <H5>  IV. Construction Management and Acceptance of Work </H5>   1. Efforts must be made to improve construction management  and increase return on investment. The policy of concentrating  resources for completing projects must be adhered to. Projects  should be listed according to conditions with regard to  materials, equipment, investment, and work forces, and  construction work carried out in different phases in line with  the degree of their importance and urgency. During  construction, attention must be paid to economic results. There  must be specific rates of consumption, standards for expenses,  and verification of cost accounting, so as to reduce  construction costs.    2. The quality of projects must be guaranteed and quality  control must be improved. On completion, a project must be  checked and accepted according to the regulations, and reports  of project completion and final accounts of expenditure must be  made. At the same time, a list of property transfers must be  compiled and should be supplemented with drawings indicating the  completion of the project and with technical archives --  including records of concealed engineering works -- for  safekeeping by construction units and for the convenience of  later maintenance and expansion.    3. Large- and medium-sized projects, as well as other  projects involving investment in excess of state-set limitations  are to be checked and accepted by MOFERT, together with the  departments concerned. Projects involving investment under 30  million yuan are to be checked and accepted by the departments  concerned at the invitation of the applicant units, and when  necessary, with the participation of MOFERT personnel. With  regard to projects involving investment over 10 million yuan,  the applicant units are to submit reports on completion of  construction and final accounts of expenditure to MOFERT for the  record.  <H5>  V. Tables of Capital Construction Statistics </H5>   1. In order to promptly make known the implementation of the  capital construction plan and existing problems, all applicant  units are to complete every month the "Monthly Table of Capital  Construction Progress" and submit it to MOFERT no later than the  10th of the following month.    2. At the end of each year, all aplicant units are to  complete the "Annual Table of Capital Construction Progress"  (similar to the Monthly Table) and submit it to MOFERT before  the end of January of the following year.    3. All monthly and annual tables of capital construction  progress should be accompanied by notes explaining the reasons  for rapid or slow progress, the existing problems, and measures  to be taken. The tables should have accurate figures and be  completed in full.    4. Controlling corporations with subsidiary companies are  responsible for evaluating and checking the monthly and annual  tables of their subsidiaries, and for submitting summary reports  to MOFERT on schedule.  <H5>  VI. Capital Construction Finances </H5>   1. All units directly under MOFERT are to compile annual  capital construction finance plans and submit them to MOFERT  within the prescribed time, in accordance with the annual  planned investment for capital construction prescribed by MOFERT  and with the requirements and tables stipulated and described in  the notice issued by MOFERT with regard to the compiling of  annual capital construction finance plans.    2. Limitations are to be set for nonoperational investment  included in the funds for invesstment. In accordance with the  progress of the construction and actual need for funding,  investment is to be allocated and made available by MOFERT to  the units using the investment through the head office of the  Construction Bank of China in accordance with the capital  construction plans approved by the State Planning Commission and  the finance plans compiled and submitted by various units, and  within the prescribed limit of phased appropriation of funds  approved by the head office of the Construction Bank of China.  All units using such investment must open accounts at the head  office of the Construction Bank of China, as required by the  regulations.    3. In the case of construction projects financed by  operational investment, construction units, on receiving capital  construction plans issued by MOFERT, are to sign loan contracts  at once with branches of the Construction Bank of China, which  will serve as evidence for obtaining and repaying the loan.    4. In the case of construction projects financed by units  themselves, construction units are to deposit at the  Construction Bank of China the funds they have raised. They  must observe the principle of "depositing the fund before  obtaining approval, and obtaining approval before making use of  the fund." The fund must be kept at the bank for no less than  six months before it can be used under the supervision of the  Construction Bank of China.    5. In the case of construction projects financed by loans  from the Construction Bank of China -- and if they are projects  with renewed loans -- construction units may go through loan  procedures immediately with the local office of the Construction  Bank of China, once the head office of the Construction Bank of  China has notified its local offices of the loan plan. If they  are new projects to be financed by bank loans, construction  units are to cooperate with local bank branches to complete  project evaluations and go through loan procedures after the  head office of the Construction Bank of China has approved and  issued the loan plans. Units using loans from other banks to  finance their construction projects are to complete the  procedures for obtaining and paying the loans in accordance with  the regulations of the banks concerned.    6. The monthly capital construction finance reports are the  main basis for appropriation by MOFERT, and all units are to  submit them to MOFERT within eight days folloing the end of the  month. (If there is not enough time to complete the paperwork,  a report may be made by telegraph or telephone.)    7. The annual final accounts of capital construction  expenditure are tables reflecting the entire economic  performances of the construction units and departments. They  are a summary of the implementation and execution of the annual  capital construction and finance plans. All units are to  compile the annual final accounts of capital construction  expenditure in a timely and accurate manner and in accordance  with the requirements and tables stipulated and prescribed by  MOFERT and are to submit them to MOFERT for evaluation and  approval.    8. Controlling corporations with subsidiary companies should  appoint people to take special charge of evaluating and checking  the financial plans, monthly financial reports, and annual final  accounts of expenditure of their subsidiaries, and should submit  summary reports to MOFERT.  <H5>  VII. Supplementary Regulations </H5>   1. Units directly under MOFERT may draw up implementation  regulations in accordance with these "Procedures."    2. These "Procedures" go into effect on 1 January 1989.    [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade    January 1, 1989</p>

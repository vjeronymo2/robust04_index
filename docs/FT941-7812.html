			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: Masterful 'Coppelia' - Ballet in Antwerp Belgium should be proud of the Royal Ballet of Flanders which I saw at the Antwerp Opera House. It is now the country's only classical troupe, an ensemble of clear, true gifts. That it is so is owed to Robert Denvers, artistic director since 1987, who is also a celebrated teacher and has given his troupe a bright cutting edge in performance. It is this sense of an eager, disciplined troupe which makes the company's latest acquisition, Coppelia, so welcome. The version has been mounted by Attilio Labis, and decorated by Roger Bernard. The effect is very different from the usual run of stagings which propose funny hats and rather too much friskiness from the peasantry. Bernard's stage picture is of a skeletal wood setting, very handsome but suggesting that we are in Old Fretworkburg, with an added thought that the whole location might be an elaborate clockwork toy from Coppelius' workshop (which is itself a madness of cogs and wheels, merrily ticking away). Equally stripped is the dance action. With no cosy inn or rustic shack, there is no cause for peasant stampings and cheerless merriment by grinning supernumeraries. The village is inhabited by dancers. Coppelius is something of a cypher. The burgomaster is got up like Humpty-Dumpty en grande toilette, and lurks. The choreography is the thing, and well done. The action is traditional, but more aerodynamically trim than is usual. Czardas and mazurka are given their full value, but Labis' text for the first two acts is largely that which he knew at the Paris Opera, where he was a celebrated etoile. The dance is light, bright; and it is brought off with engaging style by a charming Turkish ballerina, Aysem Sunal, as Swanilda, and by Eric Frederic as a buoyant Frantz. Sunal sails happily through the steps, rejoicing in their delicacy; Frederic, with a strong, sure technique, makes something attractive of Frantz, who is not the most endearing of balletic characters. The Flanders' dancers show admirably clean pairs of heels in the peasant rompings (and Roger Bernard dresses them attractively). The octet of friends who dog Swanilda's every move are delightful. Clean style, dancing that has an 'open' quality with nothing pinched or prissy, make their appearance a pleasure and Labis has treated them well. His innovations come with the final act, which he has largely re-made. Gone are many of the sacred old numbers, for Work and Prayer and Dawn - and anyone else a weak-minded producer cared to bring in. The pretty Dance of the Hours is a fantasy in which Coppelius dreams of fair women who turn into dolls (which is, after all, the ballet's theme). The introduction of an Arabian dance seems to me regrettable - we are suddenly being menaced by The Nutcracker, just when we thought that the plague had passed. But, all in all, the staging makes sense, and, given the skill of the Flanders' artists dancing, it is a happy view of a musical masterpiece that sustains a dear and not inconsiderable ballet.

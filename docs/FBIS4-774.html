			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>   [Text] The release of the R39bn [billions of rands] figure  for spending on the ANC's reconstruction and development  programme [RDP] over five years has been greeted with a cautious  welcome from economists, while politicians have rejected it as  misleading. Economists said the figure appeared moderate and  could augur well for future budget deficits, but noted it was  not yet clear what it comprised and exactly how it would be  financed. Politicians slated the figure as an understatement of  the true cost of the programme.    NP [National Party] spokesman Marthinus van Schalkwyk said  the R39bn figure was a "deliberate and spectacular  underestimate". Preliminary results of an independent study  costing the programme indicated that about R75bn would have to  be spent in the first year alone. The study, commissioned by  the NP two months ago, would be published next week. He called  on the ANC to release full details of its own costing, and how  it had been arrived at, so people could decide whether it was  convincing. "The time has finally come for a serious public  debate about how much voters will have to pay for the ANC's  promises."    The ANC plans to release a detailed study of costs and  priorities, drawn up by the National Institute for Economic  Policy, after 22 April. Institute head Max Sisulu said that was  the date scheduled for handing over the study to the  ANC/COSATU[Congress of South African Trade Unions]/SACP [South  African Communist Party] alliance leadership. The R39bn figure  quoted by ANC economics head Trevor Manuel represented new  outlays over and above existing social expenditure by the state.  It could be financed by a variety of sources, ranging from  cutting other budget items to introducing user charges.    Rand Merchant Bank economist Rudolf Gouws told a Centre for  Policy Studies seminar in Johannesburg yesterday that he  welcomed the release of the spending figure as it would help  bankers convince foreign investors that government would not  "explode the deficit to 10 percent."    ANC parliamentary candidate Alec Erwin, speaking at the same  seminar, said it would take at least another 10 years for the  vision outlined in the RDP to come to final fruition. He said  there was a misunderstanding that the state would carry out the  entire programme. He reiterated that an process of consultation  was being conducted with the private sector, and boasted that  its expertise would be harnessed through the National Economic  Forum in drawing up the Budget. He appealed to business people  to "talk hard and talk fast" if they had any problems with the  programme.    Witwatersrand University professor Charles Simkins warned  that the next government might be so preoccupied with managing a  balance of payments crisis that the aims of the RDP would get  let behind. SA would not be able to sustain the economic upswing  without further IMF loans, which meant economic policy  conditions would be imposed on the country.    SAPA reports that the DP finance spokesman Ken Andrew said  the omission from the ANC's plans of a commitment to contain the  budget deficit confirmed the DP's fears that an ANC government  would mortgage SA's future by borrowing excessively to finance  its extravagant promises.</p>

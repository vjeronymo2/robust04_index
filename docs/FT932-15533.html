			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Engineering study dents theory of job flexibility TECHNICAL innovation and accelerating international competitive pressures have not brought greater job flexibility and de-skilling to Britain's engineering industry over the past 10 years, a survey published by Lancaster University's engineering industry research group shows. This contradicts the fashionable theory of the 'flexible' company with a small core of full-time workers and an increasingly peripheral workforce doing contracted-out work. The broad-based survey of 148 engineering establishments, with half employing fewer than 100 workers, found that there had been no increase in the use of part-time employment in production. This was not even the case in cleaning and catering. The survey argues that instead of contracting more and more work, the engineering industry 'has increasingly come to be characterised by technologically sophisticated, increasingly skilled, full-time employment patterns during the last decade'. It found that there was increased training of workers to cover other jobs, more individualised forms of pay and increased shift work. Nearly three quarters of the companies covered also introduced important technological changes in their production processes. The author, Mr Roger Pen, argues that the dominant trend in British engineering has been 'an increasing reliance' on full-time workers. 'In British engineering plants during the 1980s the core workforce became more and more the entire workforce,' he says. The survey also found that 65.8 per cent of the sample had recognised unions bargaining collectively. Half the unionised plants covered white-collar as well as manual workers. About 60 per cent of engineering plants reported no changes in the level of union influence over either pay or work organisation. Just more than half the plants had introduced new forms of worker involvement during the 1980s, such as works councils, team briefings and other forms of open communication. Profit sharing was virtually non-existent, however, and quality circles were rare.

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Watchdog weighs 'green' costs for industry: Pollution Inspectorate chief David Slater talks to David Lascelles about his tricky task MR DAVID SLATER, director of the Pollution Inspectorate, has launched a study of the costs and benefits of environmental regulation. This is to bring 'more transparency', he says, to an issue which always triggers strong public emotions. He also thinks it will help Britain to avoid the excessively rigid environmental regulation he sees in some Continental countries. Events this year have shown just how strong those emotions can be. Two weeks ago his inspectorate came under attack for authorising two power stations to burn orimulsion, the 'filthy fuel' decried by environmentalists. A few weeks earlier he caused a similar storm when he approved an authorisation for Thorp, the nuclear waste processing plant in Cumbria, although on that occasion ministers decided that more consultation was needed. At the start of this year the inspectorate set emission limits for power stations which were denounced by critics as a sell-out to the electricity industry. More controversy is likely as the inspectorate nears a decision to authorise Britain's latest nuclear power station, Sizewell B, for which consultations started last week. Given the nature of the job it is hardly surprising that Mr Slater finds himself amid conflicting pressures, from business, politicians and environmental pressure groups. He has experienced pollution at close quarters. A consultant engineer by background, he has worked on a number of industrial disasters including Flixborough, Seveso in Italy, Bhopal in India and Exxon Valdez in North America. He took on the job in 1991, shortly after the enactment of the Environmental Protection Act, which he is responsible for implementing. He describes it as 'a sophisticated piece of legislation' which allows him room for manoeuvre. 'We don't have the radar gun approach of some of the Continental countries. Here people can sit down and talk about the realities rather than being told 'thou shalt . . .' ' Mr Slater also has to deal with his political masters - in this case Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. There have been suggestions that the politicians have been trying to get him to soften his approach because of the fragility of the economy, for example by easing the pressure on power stations. Yet he says they respect his independence. The fact that the environment is a less pressing political priority than it used to be might be thought to weaken his position. Mr Slater takes comfort from the fact that the environment has become one of several issues that have to be weighed, rather than the clear number one priority. He believes this is more likely to produce a balanced result. One of Mr Slater's concerns is to weigh the cost and benefits of pollution controls. The recent orimulsion case was fairly clear cut. Tests showed that the fuel was, on balance, no dirtier than coal or fuel oil, so there was no case for banning it on environmental grounds. Less clear, however, was Mr Slater's reason for allowing the stations to burn the fuel for five years without clean-up equipment. His reply is that it was 'unreasonable' to ask the generators to install this equipment immediately, but he will maintain a dialogue with the generators to ensure that the equipment is ready once the five years are up. He uses words such as 'proportionate', 'selective' and 'tractable' to describe the sort of environmental regime he wants to create. There is no point in forcing companies to spend vast sums of money to achieve marginal improvements in emission levels, he says. In any case the Environmental Protection Act requires the inspectorate to follow the principle of 'best available techniques not entailing excessive cost'. He says: 'We're not in the business of putting business out of business.' Nor does he like to wield a big stick, such as the threat of cancelling licences. 'We want to get into long-term dialogue with companies and build confidence.' Although environmentalists accuse him of being soft on polluting industries, he spends much of his time trying to persuade industry of the value of environmental regulation. 'Regulatory pressure, done the right way and with intelligence, can do good. It encourages the survival of the fittest. It can force a company to be aware of what it's doing and of its impact.' He likes to cite examples of companies that achieved large cost savings after being forced to tighten up their waste and emissions. One study project which he supported in the Aire and Calder valleys in the Yorkshire area recruited 11 companies, each of which was able to identify worthwhile savings by cleaning up its operations. One of them, Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverage, produced annual savings of Pounds 1.6m. It is a question of lining up environmental, efficiency and economic objectives so that they all aim towards the same goal. 'It's all basically about eliminating waste,' he says.</p>

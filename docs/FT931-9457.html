			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Unigate At last Unigate has done the decent thing and put Clifford Foods out of its stock market misery. In sealing a Pounds 50.4m agreed bid for the milk and juice company, Unigate has bolstered two important businesses. It has also positioned itself to compete more effectively in the shake-up that will follow the demise of the Milk Marketing Board. Clifford will add 3 percentage points to Unigate's share of the liquid milk market, taking its total to 16 per cent. This will give Unigate further scope to rationalise and help it resist, at least for a while, the encroachments of the giant supermarket chains. Unigate can easily afford the cash. The deal is likely to enhance next year's earnings. Still, yesterday's 5 per cent share price increase looks overdone. Although handy, the acquisition does little to settle the bigger strategic qualms about Unigate. Mr Ross Buckland, who became chief executive in 1990, has not yet charted a convincing new course at Unigate. Unigate may now be buying a string of milk businesses. Only four years ago it sold half its milk operations to Dairy Crest. Milk was seen as an unattractive business, prone to margin erosion. Not much has changed since then.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXING POPCORN AND FURS FOR CEDARS-SINAI;  </P> <P> GUILD HOLDS FUND-RAISER  </P> <P> Unfortunately, there are only two places a Hollywood hedonist can get away with  nibbling buttered popcorn while wearing a fur coat -- furtively at home, or  with all the pizazz of show biz at the annual Cedars-Sinai Women's Guild's  movie premiere.  </P> <P> For the past 32 years the Women's Guild premiere has been the one gala when  it's cold enough, formal enough and glitzy enough to take the mink to the  movies. "This is the night you buy the new ball gown for," said Guild President  Marcia Ziffren. "You break out the jewels and put on the fur."  </P> <P> What 1,100 guests were sumptuously gowned, jeweled and furred or black-tied for  Wednesday night was the benefit premiere of Tri-Star's "Family Business" that  began with a screening, chaired by Jackie Foster, at the Cineplex Odeon  followed by dinner in the Century Plaza.  </P> <P> This was a dinner where, in the words of premiere co-chair Nancy Zarif, "you  get popcorn as an appetizer" -- and then a main course of sirloin slices served  in a ballroom transformed into Manhattan by dozens of translucent back-lit sets  from TVI. Entertaining the guests, who included two of the film's stars, Sean  Connery and Matthew Broderick (Dustin Hoffman was performing "Merchant of  Venice" on Broadway), was a fiery 18-piece orchestra complete with three torch  singers.  </P> <P> Among those dining and dancing were Marvin Davis with wife Barbara (who had at  least one twirl around the dance floor with People mag's "sexiest man alive,"  Connery); Creative Artist's Agency's Mike Ovitz with wife Judy, who was supper  chair; Sony's dynamic duo, Jon Peters and Peter Guber; Universal's Tom Pollock  with wife Peggy; the film's producer, Larry Gordon; Leonard and Wendy Goldberg;  Kirk and Anne Douglas; Danny Glover; and directors Brian DePalma and Barry  Levinson.  </P> <P> By midnight, the plug was pulled on the band, $600,000 had been raised for  Cedars, and a flock of furs were on their way back to storage.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 13 (XINHUA) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said here tonight that it had no  knowledge of the withdrawal of the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea (DPRK) from the IAEA.    Hans Meyer, a spokesman for the IAEA, said that the DPRK  could not have withdrawn from the IAEA because the IAEA had not  received any notification of a withdrawal from the DPRK.    He added that the two nuclear inspectors from the IAEA in  the  DPRK had not reported anything abnormal and that inspection work  would continue, in accordance with the regulations of the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, even if the DPRK was to  announce its withdrawal.</p>

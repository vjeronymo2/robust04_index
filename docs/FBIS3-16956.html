			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Modris Posse: "LTF Thinks That the Opinion of </F> the People Should Be Taken Into Account"]    [Text] Riga, 9 Mar -- The Latvian Popular Front [LTF] has  decided to organize a meeting on 12 March on Doma Square with  the aim of expressing their opinion on the continued operation  of the Skrunda radar station and the troop withdrawal agreement  reached with Russia. Most probably, participants in the meeting  will be able to express their opinion by signing a petition  which will be presented to the government and the Saeima  [parliament].    As LTF Chairman Uldis Augstkalns stated at a press  conference, the government does not take into account the  opinion of either different political parties or social  organizations. Such policies, stressed Augstkalns, result in  violations of the basic condition of democracy -- respect for  the interests of citizens.    Taking into consideration the fact that the next round of  interstate negotiations will begin on 14 March, we do not want  the meeting to be interpreted as a provocation, but still, the  opinion of the people should be respected, said Talavs Jundzis,  LTF deputy chief and head of the Baltic Center for Strategic  Research.    He is of the view that concluding the compromise agreement  with Russia can result in Latvia's losing its independence or  even a new occupation. The real path to Latvian security does  not lead to neutrality, nor does it aim toward the East or the  West; it lies in a steady position on all primary political  goals, summarized T. Jundzis.</p>

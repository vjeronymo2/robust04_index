			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Minority governments outnumber coalitions - A look at this century's previous hung parliaments and the lessons learned from them THE EXIT polls last night suggested that the UK was on course for its sixth hung parliament this century. In each case the hung parliament has led to a minority government, not to a coalition. The 1910 elections left Mr Herbert Asquith dependent on the Irish Nationalists who, while the Liberals promised Home Rule, could never support the Unionist Conservatives. In 1923 and again in 1929 Labour took office with Liberal support, which later evaporated. In February 1974 Labour survived abstentions in the early months and then called an October election. That gave Labour a three-seat clear majority. But by 1977 that had disappeared through by-elections. Mr Jim Callaghan and Sir David Steel fixed up a Lib/Lab pact. The Liberals did not join the government but were consulted on every important issue for the 18 months that the pact lasted. The only successful coalitions that 20th-century Britain has known have been in wartime. The national emergency of 1931 did produce a coalition but an immediate election left one party totally dominant, and after a year the coalition partners either left or were swallowed up by the Conservatives. The 1931 episode stands out as the last time the monarch took a really positive role in sorting out a constitutional crisis. It was only the insistence of George V that led Mr Ramsay Macdonald to abandon 95 per cent of his own MPs and to switch from being Labour prime minister to being National Government prime minister However, 1974 provides a more important precedent. On the afternoon of Friday March 1, when it became plain that the Conservatives would have fewer seats than Labour, Mr Heath held a quick cabinet meeting and then went to Buckingham Palace 'to report on the situation'. He was 21 seats short of a majority - but there were 12 Liberals and 11 Ulster Unionists. Over the weekend he offered the Conservative whip to the Unionists and tried to persuade Mr Jeremy Thorpe, the Liberal leader, to take a cabinet seat. By Monday it was plain that the Liberals would have no part in keeping 'a defeated government' in office and Mr Heath gave way to Mr Wilson's minority government. The 1977-88 Lib/Lab pact is also instructive. To survive until the economy had recovered further from the International Monetary Fund crisis, Mr Callaghan was willing to submit to a Liberal veto. But the Liberals did not want to be made responsible for all the Labour government's actions; coalitions can destroy the identity of the lesser partners. The memory of 1977 is important to current Liberal Democrat thinking. Only with proportional representation can a minor party be assured that lending its support to a government will not result in its being submerged. If general elections do not produce clear-cut majorities, and if the electoral system assures continued representation to lesser parties, then the incentive to solve crises by calling a dissolution evaporates. The next parliament is likely to be much like the last. The politicians are forced to work out compromise solutions. Specific problems arise when an election produces no clear majority. When does the prime minister feel that he has to resign? There seems to be a certain magic in having most seats. The logic of putting together a majority would be the same if the Conservatives got 301 seats to Labour's 299 as it would be if Labour got 301 seats to the Tories' 299. But the pressure on Mr Major would be far greater in the second instance than in the first (even if, as with Mr Heath in 1974, the Conservatives had won more of the popular vote). With most seats the Conservatives might well soldier on and present a Queen's Speech on May 6 (as Mr Baldwin did in January 1924), even if all the other parties were plainly going to vote it down. If the situation was in doubt Mr Major might continue as a caretaker (after all we have had a caretaker government for the past three weeks, during the electoral purdah which civil servants impose on ministers). But the pressure for instant action will be great. The spectacle of the removal van in Downing Street on the Friday afternoon is engraved on our television memories of 1964, 1970 and 1979. The public - and it seems the Palace - want an election to be seen to produce an instant decision. The Queen's government must be carried on. What decisions may the Queen have to take? It is generally agreed that there are two prerogatives remaining to the sovereign which may in some circumstances involve a real exercise of choice: nomination of a prime minister and granting of a dissolution. The first presents little problem in the present situation. Mr Major is prime minister until he chooses to resign or until he is defeated in the Commons. If Mr Major decides to vacate office - or is forced to - the Queen will send for Mr Kinnock as the leader of the alternative large party. It is possible that if Labour was very far from having a majority or an expectation of support from other parties, the Queen might ask Mr Kinnock to explore whether he could form a government that would command endorsement from the Commons (as in very different circumstances in 1963 she gave Lord Home 24 hours to see if he could put together a cabinet). But Mr Kinnock would almost certainly say that he had a cabinet ready made and that he was ready to take his chance in a parliament. The most difficult scenario for the Queen concerns dissolution. If a narrowly defeated Mr Major asked for a second election at once, she would certainly refuse. But what if Mr Kinnock were given the chance to present a Queen's Speech which was then rejected? If by then it was plain that an alternative coalition had been formed, which did command a majority, would the Queen be right to give a dissolution to Mr Kinnock who had never had a parliamentary endorsement? This is dangerous ground. Politicians are guided usually by the law of anticipated reactions. You do not have to be knocked down by a car for your whole life to be conditioned by avoidance of that event. Another election will obviously be a possibility. It will not be popular with the public and parties will do their utmost to avoid being seen as the cause of another dissolution. An election will only be provoked by those who feel that they will profit by it. It is clear that messages have already gone out from the cabinet office and from Buckingham Palace to all the prime actors in the parties about what they understand to be the rules of the game. Strong pressures may be exerted to save the Queen from being put in a position where her prerogatives have to be exerted in ways that some people would interpret as partisan. The Queen will not act as her grandfather did in August 1931. In the current style of politics and with the new intrusions of media coverage that would be impossible. But public opinion may well combine with the inclinations of the Palace to knock heads together to produce a viable government to get the country through the coming year's economic difficulties.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HUNG PARLIAMENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The UK has experienced six hung parliaments this century.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Con    Lab    Lib   Other   Total    Maj  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Jan 1910       273    275     40      82     670    336 Dec 1910       272    272     42      84     670    336 Dec 1923       258    159    191       7     615    308 May 1924       260     59    288       8     615    308 Feb 1974       297     14    301      25     635    318 Nov 1974       280     13    315      27     635    318  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

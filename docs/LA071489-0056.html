			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN ON PORTER RANCH SCHOOL SITES  </P> <P> Developers of the proposed $2-billion Porter Ranch project agreed Thursday to  meet with representatives of the Los Angeles school district and City  Councilman Hal Bernson to negotiate the sale of land to the district for a new  elementary school site.  </P> <P> Project representatives said Thursday that they will consider increasing the  amount of land to be set aside for a school to serve new residents of the  Chatsworth project. The firm has agreed to set aside five acres, which the  district could buy if a new elementary school is needed.  </P> <P> "We have been willing to set aside whatever land it takes," said Paul Clarke,  Porter Ranch spokesman. But he added that it is too early to set aside specific  properties for the district.  </P> <P> At a school board subcommittee hearing Thursday, board member Julie Korenstein,  who represents the area, asked representatives of the Porter Ranch Development  Co. to consider donating or selling as much as 10 acres for a school site if  the Los Angeles City Council approves the project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Avoid Crowding  </P> <P> Korenstein said she would like a larger-than-average site for the school to  avoid crowding. Most elementary school sites in the San Fernando Valley are  about six acres, district officials said.  </P> <P> Clarke said after the hearing that the two sides probably will seek a  compromise during the meeting with Bernson and school district representatives.  </P> <P> Korenstein, who has opposed the Porter Ranch project, tabled a motion asking  the developer to designate 10 acres for a school site.  </P> <P> "We'll wait and see," Korenstein said. "We've directed our staff to come back  with a compromise."  </P> <P> Korenstein and other board members last week criticized Nathan Shapell, owner  of the Porter Ranch development firm, for pressuring the district in the 1970s  to sell its surplus school properties, including a parcel next to Porter Ranch.  As chairman of the state's Little Hoover Commission, Shapell conducted  extensive hearings statewide on surplus school properties and urged districts,  including Los Angeles, to sell those sites to raise money.  </P> <P> Shapell's firm later bought a 37-acre parcel, originally intended as a high  school site, next to the Porter Ranch development. So far, Shapell has built  and sold 124 homes on the property, which he bought in 1978 for $1.5 million.  </P> <P> Now the district is faced with buying back land in the area from Shapell at  much higher prices.  </P> <P> Korenstein said the district will consider purchasing all or part of the land  ultimately set aside by the Porter Ranch firm. Clarke said the company is  opposed to giving any land to the district because the firm is legally required  to donate as much as $15 million in fees to build schools.  </P> <P> District officials said those fees cannot be used exclusively for building an  elementary school in the Porter Ranch area but must be shared among other  school projects already under way.  </P> <P> Plans for the Porter Ranch development include 2,195 single-family homes, as  well as 6 million square feet of commercial space. The project faces a key city  hearing next month.  </P></p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Malaysia in frigate deal with GEC MALAYSIA has ordered two frigates from Yarrow Shipbuilders, part of the British GEC group, in a package worth Pounds 400m. The deal, confirmed by GEC yesterday, is considerably larger than expected and provides a crucial boost to the Yarrow yard on Clydeside. The long-awaited contract, held up since last autumn by negotiating difficulties, is the first overseas warship order Yarrow has won since it was sold by the UK government in 1985. The 105-metre helicopter-carrying frigates are larger vessels than the corvettes that were originally under discussion with Yarrow. Their armament includes BAe Vertical-Launch Sea Wolf missiles for air defence, the first export order for these weapons. The Malaysian order, which includes weapons, electronic systems, spares and training, brings to well over Pounds 1bn the volume of defence purchases under a 1988 agreement between the the UK and Malaysian governments. Other contracts include British Aerospace Hawk jets and GEC-Marconi air-defence radars. The deal follows confirmation earlier last month of a Pounds 150m deal for two smaller corvettes for Oman by another UK warship builder, Vosper Thornycroft.</p>

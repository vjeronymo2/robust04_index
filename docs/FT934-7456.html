			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tight cost control helps Grampian to 7.7% rise GRAMPIAN Television, the Aberdeen-based ITV company, lifted pre-tax profits by 7.7 per cent in the six months to August 31. Mr Calum MacLeod, chairman, said the rise reflected 'the continuing tight control of costs supported by some improvement in the advertising market'. Profits rose to Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.44m) on turnover down at Pounds 9.87m (Pounds 10.1m). With operating expenses lower at Pounds 8.16m (Pounds 8.87m), operating profits emerged at Pounds 1.71m (Pounds 1.19m). The Channel 3 licence payment/exchequer levy was Pounds 360,000. Earnings per share advanced to 7.39p (6.17p) from which a raised interim dividend of 1.5p (1.1p) is declared. The directors said they wanted to reduce the disparity between the interim and the final payments. Mr MacLeod said the advertising improvement had limited the fall in revenue from the loss of Channel 4 sales, and that Grampian had increased its share of network advertising revenue. It recently moved from TVMM, Scottish Television's joint venture with HTV, to the Time Exchange sales house. Glenburnie, the property investment and development subsidiary, lifted its profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 463,000 (Pounds 405,000) through higher rental income.</p>

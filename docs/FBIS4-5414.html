			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- The ruling coalition put  off Monday's [11 April] proposed meeting of its party heads to  discuss the choice of a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, who announced his resignation Friday, coalition  officials said.    The coalition will continue talks on the matter at the level  of secretaries general, they said.    Representatives of the coalition partners, who met for 40  minutes Monday morning, also agreed to convene a meeting of  party leaders "as the need arises," the officials said.    The accord represented a last-minute compromise to avert a  decisive split of the eight-month-old, seven-party alliance.    SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama, the head of the coalition's largest party, Sunday  proposed holding a meeting of the heads of all the coalition  parties at noon Monday to discuss who should succeed Hosokawa as  prime minister.    Murayama's proposal aims at raising the level for discussing  the succession to the premiership to that of the top leaders of  the coalition parties from the present level of secretaries  general.    DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake [Harbinger] leader  Masayoshi Takemura supported the idea but Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] and Komeito rejected the proposal.    Hosokawa, the JNP head, also responded coolly to Murayama's  proposal. He told reporters that he will not attend the  leaders' meeting.    Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida told reporters Monday that a  meeting of party heads should be convened at the final stage.    Meantime, the heads of the SDPJ, DSP, Sakigake and the  Democratic Reform Party had talks at noon Monday and agreed to  propose a meeting of leaders of all the coalition parties at 10  A.M. Tuesday, well-placed sources said.</p>

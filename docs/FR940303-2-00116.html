Prior to going to Respondent's home on March 29, 1991, the detective searched the sister's clothing and car, and provided her with $100.00, however, the sister was not searched because there were no female officers on duty.

Respondent later stated, ``its not my cocaine. I just store it for someone. He gives me cocaine for allowing him to store it in my house.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A search was then conducted of Respondent's house which revealed a safe which contained, among other things, two one-gram scales commonly used to weigh and package cocaine, a clear plastic bag containing a substance which was later confirmed to be two ounces of cocaine, as well as cocaine residue on various other items.

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE THROWING THEIR WEIGHTS AROUND;  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD: ESPERANZA'S TRIO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THREE OF THE COUNTY'S TOP  FOUR SHOTPUT MARKS THIS SEASON.  </P> <P> Asked to name a few personal highlights of the 1990 track and field season,  Esperanza High School shotputters Mike Burns, Mark Kinney and Mark Parlin  glanced at one another with bored looks and shrugged as if the question had no  relevance.  </P> <P> Despite making up the most successful shotput trio in the Southern Section, and  perhaps the entire state, Burns, Kinney and Parlin act as if they do not get  much joy from their sport. In fact, Burns and Kinney seem to treat it with a  certain degree of disgust.  </P> <P> "There are no highlights in track," Kinney said with a sneer. "We hate track."  </P> <P> Said Burns: "It's at the bottom of my list."  </P> <P> Parlin admitted he liked track, but then took a considerable ribbing from his  partners.  </P> <P> "I do (like it)," Parlin said. "It's all right."  </P> <P> Perhaps that's why Parlin, a 6-foot-1, 220-pound junior, has the superior marks  of this bunch. His best toss, 61 feet 4 inches, an Empire League record set  Thursday, ranks first in the Southern Section and second in the state.  </P> <P> Kinney, a 6-4, 235-pound senior, has a best of 57-5 1/4. Burns, a 6-2,  220-pound junior, has gone 55-9 1/2. They rank first, second and fourth in the  county, respectively, and Thursday they swept the top three places at the  Empire League finals to help Esperanza win the league title.  </P> <P> All three also compete in the discus, with Parlin leading the way at 175-3, the  second-best mark in the county this year.  </P> <P> Despite their claims of disliking the sport, Kinney, Burns and Parlin do enjoy  what they're doing, says Bill Pendleton, Esperanza's shotput coach.  </P> <P> "They just love to complain," Pendleton said. "Like Burns, he told me all year  he wasn't going to come out and the first day of practice, he was out there. No  one's forcing them."  </P> <P> Well, not technically. All three play football -- Parlin started at fullback  last fall, Kinney and Burns at linebacker -- and all three compete in track,  they say, because Pendleton, an assistant football coach, encouraged them to  come out as freshmen.  </P> <P> "I'm made to do it. That's the only reason," Burns said.  </P> <P> Pendleton, 37, who in 1987 won a national age-group title in the shotput, has  supervised Esperanza's strength program for 13 years, and has been coaching the  shotputters for the last five. He says every year he combs the freshman weight  class, picking out the 10 biggest ninth-graders in an effort to strengthen  Esperanza's ranks in the shotput and discus.  </P> <P> And Kinney, Burns and Parlin have contributed significantly. In the last two  years, Esperanza has been undefeated in all shotput relays -- events in which  three shotputters on the same team combine their best marks of the day for a  total score. At the Poway Invitational, they set records in both the shotput  and discus. At the county's oldest track meet, the Tustin Relays, their  combined score ranked second to Edison on the all-time list.  </P> <P> Saturday at San Clemente High, they led Esperanza to its third consecutive  victory at a weight-lifting competition this season.  </P> <P> Kinney squatted 550 pounds in competition Saturday and has bench-pressed 365.  On first impression he seems to fit the high school football player stereotype.  </P> <P> Kinney, who says his goal is to reach 60 feet in the shotput and place in the  state meet, also wants to try to concentrate more on his studies.  </P> <P> Burns, who along with Kinney hopes to become a police officer, has the best  speed of the three. Last year, he won the frosh/soph league title in the 100  meters, and has 4.6 speed in the 40. He wasn't pleased with his third-place  mark of 48-9 1/4 at the league meet Thursday.  </P> <P> "I've been disappointed lately," he said. "My PR (personal record) fell seven  feet. I should be able to get out of bed and throw 50 feet. . . . I have the  school record in choke."  </P> <P> Pendleton, who said he expected Burns to perform as he did Thursday because he  has yet to take an extended rest from training, called Burns "a little more  psycho than the others."  </P> <P> In short, Burns has been known to eat moths.  </P> <P> Parlin is not nearly as extreme. As the first county shotputter to throw more  than 60 feet since Kaleaph Carter of Edison in 1988, Parlin says he hopes to  win the Southern Section title at the sectional championships May 18, and is  aiming for a second place finish at the state meet in June.  </P> <P> Fallbrook senior Brent Noon, the nation's prep shotput leader this season at  73-3 1/2, isn't expected to be challenged at the state level. Of course, with  Noon graduating in June, Parlin's chances for a state title look better next  year.  </P></p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Brewers' spirits gain more froth - Some optimism is returning to the industry Like their summer ales, brewery executives have been in a lighter mood in recent months. The decline in beer sales is showing signs of slowing, and the wholesale price wars which have pulverised the industry are begining to abate. News last week that both the Treasury and a parliamentary committee are to examine the rate of excise duty - the industry's current big bug-bear - has added further froth to brewers' spirits. 'A small amount of optimism is beginning to creep into the industry,' conceded Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman of Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the London-based brewer. 'It's early days yet, but things might be on the turn.' The picture has been brightened by the hot summer weather, giving some relief to the embattled pub trade and accelerating sales at off-licences, which were also lifted by an increase during the World Cup. Although beer sales are forecast to fall again in 1994 as a whole, continuing the trend of the past 15 years, the decline is slowing. In 1983, UK beer consumption stood at 38.3m barrels. Last year, it had slipped to 35.6m, with industry forecasts for the current year down at about 35.2m. Kleinwort Benson, the stockbroker, predicts that the 1.6 per cent year-on-year fall in sales seen in the past five years will ease to 1 per cent this year. It says these will continue for several years hence as cultural and demographic changes continue to affect the industry. 'Basically, the population is getting older and drinking more wine at home,' says Mr Andrew Holland, Kleinwort's brewing analyst. The industry has been slow to adapt to the decline, and excess capacity has resulted in a vicious price war in the wholesale market. 'The major companies have nailed their colours to the mast of market share, which they've been defending whatever the cost,' said Mr David Thompson, managing director of Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries, the Midlands-based brewer. 'It's still having an adverse effect on margins.' Mr Holland is moderately more upbeat. 'Things are definitely not getting any worse. The big brewers now realise that their wholesale pricing policies are just not working and have to be changed.' This is likely to mean more brewery closures. In a recent report, SG Warburg, the merchant bank, suggested that the beer industry producing at 90 per cent capacity was still capable of producing 17 per cent more beer than it could sell. Some companies, such as Boddington Group and Greenalls Group, have quit brewing to concentrate on retailing. 'More capacity will have to come out and I suspect some will not survive the bloodbath that's been going on,' said Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux Group, the Sunderland-based brewer. 'I remain cautious over any great recovery.' Eleven big brewing plants, capable of producing 7m barrels a year have closed in the past three years. Courage, which ironically has been the most aggressive in protecting its market share at the cost of reduced margins, is now being mooted by industry sources as the most likely candidate to call a halt to pricing hostilities and reduce capacity. The combined effect of the price war and falling sales has had dire consequences in the pub trade. Some 7,000 pubs have shut in the past 10 years, and the closure rate of the remaining 65,000 is expected to accelerate to as much as 2 per cent a year, according to the Brewers &amp; Licenced Retailers Association. However, there is growing optimism in the industry that the increasingly vociferous campaign to have beer duty reduced in the November budget is at last being listened to in Whitehall. The BLRA says it is the high rate of excise tax on beer that has fuelled the dramatic rise in imports - more than 1m pints a day, it claims - from the Continent since regulations on allowances were relaxed. Mr Thompson, at Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, even suggested that without this huge rise, UK beer sales would actually be on the increase. 'Without this relentless pressure from across the Channel, we will not see the big uplift in demand the industry needs.' However, industry analysts think their chances are slim. 'The government is hardly going to cut beer duty at the same time that it is increasing VAT on fuel for pensioners,' said Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Securities. 'It would be political suicide. The best the brewers can hope for is no duty increase at all.'</p>

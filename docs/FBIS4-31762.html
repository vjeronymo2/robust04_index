			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 13 -- Deputy Prime Minister and Finance  Minister Grzegorz Kolodko's aides on Monday explained the  "Strategy for Poland" economic plan to newsmen.    The experts said the relations between Poland's unemployment  rate and an inflation rate are in great part a political and not  only an economic choice. They explained that the keeping of  high employment would not increase inflation if the number of  weekly working hours were cut and wages were decreased  accordingly.    Secretary of State at the Cabinet Office Jan Monkiewicz and  Director General at the Cabinet Office Jerzy Hausner said such  methods have been applied in Germany. They argued that it is  necessary that society and, most of all, trade unions are aware  of such solutions.    The experts agreed that the "Strategy for Poland" targets in  agriculture go beyond the period of four years the document  covers. The creation of jobs in the countryside and the changes  in financing agriculture are important in the first phase of the  plan's implementation.    Also on Monday, Chairman of the Polish Business Council Jan  Wejchert said the organisation is satisfied with the programme  and stressed that its provisions are in great degree consistent  with the council's opinions and demands. The council presented  its opinions on the government-prepared programme to Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak during its general assembly meeting  last week.    Council Deputy Chairman Zbigniew Niemczycki stated the  council is ready to work on detailed issues included in  "Strategy for Poland." The council members agree that the  success of the programme will hinge on a rapid implementation of  concrete solutions. The council argued that if implemented, the  solutions would help accelerate privatisation and development of  equity market as well as the introduction of export- and  investment-minded changes in the tax system.    The council announced again its measures aimed at  encouraging  investments and giving Polish entrepreneurs bigger say in a  rapid privatisation of the economy, including the introduction  of privatisation by instalments, a consolidated balance sheet  for holdings and the setting up of a guarantee fund for  privatisation and development.</p>

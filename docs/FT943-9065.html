			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: The returns from regionalisation - Why Hall Engineering is expanding in Asia / Tackling Asia's Tigers Singapore, as many visitors have noted, is an island state that seems to be run like a company. It is an observation that has a special relevance for Mr Richard Siew, managing director of overseas operations at Hall Engineering (Holdings). 'You can see government policy going in one direction, and you can more or less say that we will also be doing that as a company,' he says. In effect, the regionalisation which Singapore is urging the island's corporations to pursue, exploiting untapped opportunities and lower labour costs in neighbouring countries, is being mirrored at Hall. This is a new departure for Shrewsbury-based Hall, which is best known in the region for its constructional steel products. Elsewhere, it is also involved in automation pressings and production equipment and steel stockholding. 'We've been managing very successfully in Singapore on our traditional businesses,' says Mr Siew, who took over his new Singapore-based post in May. 'But although we've been established for a long time in the region, we have not accelerated in line with the explosion in growth in the region.' One of Mr Siew's key roles will be to help Hall step on the regional accelerator. Asia - principally Singapore - has been good to Hall and its shareholders, and accounts for the bulk of Hall's associated companies, which contributed Pounds 7.6m to overall pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.6m last year. The contribution will be particularly useful this year following Hall's surprise announcement in May that its results this year would be 'materially short of those for 1993' because of the postponement of part of a large European contract won by Stadco, the automotive engineering company, and margin pressure in the UK steel stockholding and steel reinforcement businesses. The news immediately depressed the share price by 71p to 169p, although it has since recovered to 179p. Historically, Hall's two investments in the region are BRC Weldmesh (SEA), which makes welded steel wire mesh used to reinforce concrete, and BHP Lysaght (SEA) which makes roll-formed roof sheeting and cladding. The two companies, which are joint ventures with BHP of Australia, have dominant market shares in Singapore - between 40 and 50 per cent for wire mesh and 80 per cent for metal roofing. The position has been built up through successful marketing and product development during the construction boom in Singapore over the past 20 years. BRC Weldmesh, for example, pioneered the production of individual welded mesh tailored to architects' designs to avoid the need for cutting mesh at cramped construction sites. Mr Siew believes it would be naive to expect quantum leaps in Singapore's economy that would enable these businesses to grow sharply in the next five years. Even so, the island state still offers opportunities. Mr Peter Hellweg, managing director of BRC Weldmesh in Singapore, hopes the company can benefit from ambitious public housing plans. After a 'huge price fight' in the early 1980s, profits are reasonable, he says, but the business needs careful managing. If profit margins became too high, it could draw new competitors into an industry where entry costs are low. To maintain profitability - and in response to Singapore's relatively high labour costs and manpower shortage - production of spacers for the welded mesh has already been moved to Vietnam (see panel). Mr Hellweg says production of more labour intensive fine mesh products may follow. The regionalisation moves which Mr Siew is now accelerating for Hall are, broadly, of three types. First, expansion is under way in its traditional constructional steel businesses. Indonesia, with its 200m population, need for improved housing and spending on its infrastructure, offers 'tremendous potential' for wiremesh and roll-formed products, he says. PT BRC Lysaght Indonesia, another partnership with BHP, has been operating in Jakarta for 20 years and has recently opened a new factory in Surabaya to service the east Indonesian market. Other regional Indonesian markets such as Sumatra are being looked at. Elsewhere, a BHP building products factory is due to open before the end of this year in Sri Lanka. It has been a classic policy of starting with exports, and building up the business until local manufacturing is viable, says Mr John Kong, general manager of BHP Lysaght (SEA). Burma and Cambodia are being investigated. The second type of expansion is in Hall's higher technology businesses such as automation, precision metal cutting and pressings. Malaysia's ambitious industrialisation strategy, and the emphasis on the automotive, petrochemical and aerospace industries make it a logical destination for this end of Hall's business. The third type of expansion involves Hall's low-tech and high-tech businesses in unison, a tempting opportunity which, uniquely, is offered by China's economic expansion. Hall has done nothing yet in China, says Mr Siew, apart from exporting some mesh from Hong Kong, but he is hoping to change that. The mesh market in China has hardly been tapped, he says, and the challenge will be to get it specified in preference to reinforcing bar (rebar), a rival method which helps provide employment on construction sites. The main difficulty will be to find a suitable local partner, says Mr Siew, to help handle the formalities. 'We are sending out feelers,' he says. At the high-tech end, Hall is following events in the automotive industry closely. Mr Siew is encouraged by recent legislative changes which show China wants to localise the supply of components to western manufacturers setting up car plants, and may also develop a national car. A joint venture between a car company and Stadco, giving it captive business, would be ideal, he says. Mr Siew has not been set financial targets by the head office in Shrewsbury, but says: 'It's quite clear that the big picture is to grow and develop this area. Look at the returns compared with elsewhere and common sense will tell you where to put your money.'

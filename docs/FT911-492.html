			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Travel News: Cheaply to France FRENCH holidays, as we reported in this column last week, are increasingly popular this summer - helped not only by Peter Mayle's idyllic view of rural French life in his books but also because France offers good value for money for recession-weary travellers. But finding the cheapest way across the Channel can be a daunting prospect, especially as ferry operators gear up for the challenge of the Channel Tunnel by offering a confusing array of special deals. With a nice sense of timing Holiday Which? magazine has this week investigated (with all the determination of a truffle-hunting pig in Provence) the best fares to the continent. Based on four adults travelling in a medium-sized car on a peak-time crossing in August, the cheapest return fare on a short crossing to France is Sally Line's Pounds 259 deal on its Ramsgate-Dunkirk route. For the longer crossing to France, Sealink has a Pounds 215 Apex return on its Newhaven-Dieppe route for which you have to book and pay at least 28 days in advance. Otherwise, the best long-route deal is with Brittany Ferries' Truckline: Pounds 329 Poole-Cherbourg return. For Benelux countries a Pounds 200 return fare with Olau Line on its Sheerness-Vlissingen route was the the cheapest. The magazine points out that the shortest crossings are not necessarily the cheapest: the Dover-Calais crossings operated by P &amp; O and Sealink may be an hour shorter than the Sally Line Sheerness-Dunkirk route, but cost up to 27 per cent more. Sally Line, Hoverspeed and Brittany Ferries to Spain have cheaper fares for cars under four metres in length. Harry Goodman, former head of the collapsed International Leisure Group, has wasted no time in getting back into the travel business - even though creditors of the company are likely to recover only a few pence in the pound when the company is finally wound up with debts of Pounds 400m or so and few assets. Goodman is acting as adviser to a new travel company, Riva Travel, being set up by some former ILG managers and is already rumoured to be talking to investment banks about forming a new airline once the recession is over. Other executives of ILG have also bounced back: former Intasun managers have started a mass-market tour operation called Sunworld, backed by the Spanish company Iberotravel, and are selling Mediterranean holidays for this summer. Club 18-30, another failed ILG company, has sprung back under the same management, but called The Club because of travel industry rules forbidding failed companies to start up again under the same name. But the speed with which Goodman and his ex-colleagues have returned to the travel scene is causing some disquiet in travel circles: the chaos caused by the ILG collapse has left a bitter taste.</p>

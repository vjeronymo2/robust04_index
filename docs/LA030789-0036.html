			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: CLUTTER: OUT OF THE CLOSET, INTO THE BEDROOM  </P> <P> Thousands of readers must feel that Erma Bombeck is looking into their living  rooms and kitchens. The other day she wrote a column that makes me feel she is  looking into our bedrooms.  </P> <P> Erma said that since complaining about an exercise bicycle at the foot of her  bed, she had received letters from readers who confessed to having not only  bicycles but fax machines, computers, microwaves and small refrigerators in  their bedrooms.  </P> <P> My computer and fax machine happily are in my work room, but our two bedrooms  have indeed taken on the corporate look described by Erma.  </P> <P> Because I sometimes have kicking and screaming nightmares, I have taken to  sleeping in our front bedroom, leaving the larger back bedroom to my wife. But  as Erma suggested, her room hardly sets a tone for "intimacy, passion and  adventure."  </P> <P> As I have complained before, my wife's bedroom shelters at least 1,000  cookbooks, which, in case of an earthquake, would undoubtedly fall over in  their 6-foot cases and crush any person who happened to be sleeping in the bed  that formerly was mine.  </P> <P> On either side of the twin electric beds are stacks of old magazines and  newspapers that she intends to read when she retires. I keep pointing out that  we can't even keep up with current periodicals, much less years of old ones.  </P> <P> Her bedroom also contains our 26-inch television set, plus a large case  containing all our videotapes. This collection includes tapes of several Super  Bowl football games, which, as Erma suggested, are more likely to induce sleep  than passion in the average housewife.  </P> <P> To the right of the TV stands her sewing machine and all the paraphernalia that  goes with it. Surely a sewing machine does not give the room a corporate look,  but it does remind her of work undone.  </P> <P> My bedroom contains not only an exercise bicycle that has not been used since  my wife bought it for me several years ago, but also a large copying machine  that sits on an 8-foot folding table acquired years ago for some purpose that  we can no longer remember.  </P> <P> On top of the table with the copying machine are numerous stacks of books, a  carton of patterns, various articles of clothing, a manuscript and a cordless  power scrubber and buffer that has never been removed from its box.  </P> <P> I am also heir to an old desk that my wife bought used and refurbished for use  in her paper work, which is enormous. Its drawers by now are stuffed with old  canceled checks, bills and income tax returns, and its top is hopelessly awash  with pamphlets, magazines, old letters and printed matter of every kind.  Through sheer glut, it is no longer functional; my wife does her accounts now  on the dining room table, which has also been rendered useless for its intended  purpose.  </P> <P> She used to clear off the dining room table on Thursday nights, before the  housecleaner's regular weekly visit, but she no longer even tries. The table  has become another in the increasing number of areas that are off-limits to the  housecleaner.  </P> <P> My workroom is also off limits. The carpet has not been swept for years. My  desks and table tops are so cluttered with letters, magazines, books, clippings  and newspaper sections that I would not dare to let the housecleaner past the  door.  </P> <P> It also contains my computer, two printers and my fax machine. From this cell I  am able to communicate with almost anyone in the outside world; but if I put a  letter down it may be lost for weeks.  </P> <P> There are two television sets in the kitchen. One is a color Sony my wife  bought for me to watch while I was riding the exercise bicycle. Because I never  rode the bicycle, she put it in the kitchen to watch while she works.  </P> <P> The kitchen also has a small black-and-white set that my wife obtained as a  premium when she invested some money in a savings and loan. So far as I know,  she has never turned it on.  </P> <P> One of Erma's correspondents said she had a microwave and a small refrigerator  in her bedroom, so she and her husband could have popcorn, pizza and soft  drinks while they were watching TV.  </P> <P> We are depraved, but I can say we have not yet sunk that far.  </P></p>

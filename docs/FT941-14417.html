			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo's Kalimantan reserves upgraded Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company which has been suffering from weak prices, yesterday announced a 13 per cent upgrade to the proved reserves of one of its biggest assets. The reserve figure for the Sanga Sanga production sharing contract in Kalimantan, Indonesia, has been increased by 59m barrels of oil equivalent. It supplies 60 per cent of the gas to the world's largest liquefied natural gas plant at Bontang. The upgrade was the result of new exploratory drilling and revised estimates by independent consultants of the amount of recoverable reserves in the field. Analysts say the revision is a positive long-term development for Lasmo, whose recent record at finding new reserves has failed to match industry averages. It could also have some beneficial effect on short-term profits, but the company's financial position will remain under strain because of the need to finance a new gas field development in Liverpool Bay. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said further reserve upgrades of Kalimantan were likely, although they might not be so large. Lasmo is one of eight oil companies which Standard and Poors, the credit rating agency, yesterday warned could suffer further because of current low oil prices. Other companies whose ratings have been placed on 'Creditwatch with negative implications' status include Arco Chemical, Atlantic Richfield, Enterprise Oil, Norsk Hydro, Oryx Energy, Petrofina and Santa Fe Energy Resources.</p>

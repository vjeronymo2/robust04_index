			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGRICULTURAL LAND IN STATE MUST BE SAVED  </P> <P> Regarding Aug. 5th's "Cash Crop or Cash Out," California's agricultural land  should be saved despite the objections of farmers and land developers.  </P> <P> It may sound radical, but the only way this may be accomplished is to have a  statewide comprehensive growth management plan, which would save agricultural  resoures, preserve open space and prevent urban sprawl with all its related  traffic congestion and environmental pollution.  </P> <P> I for one would be willing to pay extra taxes to implement such a plan. I think  that most Californians would do the same because we know this state is a  special place and we must take the initiative to keep it that way.  </P> <P> JEFF LUND  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

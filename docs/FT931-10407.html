			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Spending review to shape early budget decisions THE GOVERNMENT'S sweeping review of public spending will affect expenditure decisions to be taken as early as this year, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, announced yesterday. First results will be available by the summer - when the cabinet will have to agree spending totals for the following financial year. The public sector borrowing requirement then is forecast to be running at more than Pounds 50bn a year. Mr Portillo confirmed that the government would look initially at health, social security, education and Home Office budgets. He began talks with the relevant ministers yesterday. But he failed to impress City economists that borrowing was about to be brought under firmer control. The focus of the departments' reviews, Mr Portillo said, 'will be on the medium to longer term, though our aim is that that their provisional findings should inform the next spending round in the summer'. Mr Portillo hinted that the National Health Service's Pounds 2.5bn drugs bill, which was rising at four times the rate of inflation, could be an early target. All departments will be covered by the review during the lifetime of the Parliament. On Channel Four news last night, Mr Portillo said he wanted, over the longer term, to reduce the number of civil servants. He was looking to spending levels beyond the end of the century and signalled that tackling the increased spending burden created by an ageing population was high on his agenda. In spite of clear signs from Tory MPs of the political difficulty of a radical shift from public to private provision, Mr Portillo said no spending was sacrosanct. 'We will be seeking to identify areas where better targeting can be achieved or from which the public sector can withdraw altogether,' he told the Commons. In the City, Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'It is just another question of promises, promises, rather like the inflation ceiling of 4 per cent.' Previous reviews of public spending had come to nothing, he said. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist of Greenwell Montagu, said there was 'nothing magical' about announcing a general review of public spending. The government would have to set out a clear framework for cutting spending or raising taxes in the March Budget to convince markets it was serious about cutting public spending, Mr Bootle said. Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's Treasury spokeswoman, said the review was a 'panic response in reaction to the government's economic mismanagement and appalling and unacceptable levels of unemployment'. Conservative MPs warned Mr Portillo against hitting pensioners or ending the principle of free health care. The review has already triggered divisions within the party over the future of contributory benefits - particularly invalidity and unemployment benefit  -following signals at the weekend from Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, that 'contracting out' of pensions from the state scheme to private insurance could be extended.

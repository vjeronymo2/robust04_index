			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals prices slip from highs - Market Report Base metal market business slackened at the London Metal Exchange and prices slipped from their highs to close mixed when some speculator profit-taking emerged. Three months COPPER, which peaked at Dollars 2,770 a tonne in the morning, closed at Dollars 2,754.50, up Dollars 3.50 on balance. ZINC's three months delivery price had touched Dollars 1,200 a tonne for the first time in more than two years. But it could not erode resistance above that level and steadily backtracked to Dollars 1,189.50 at the close, Dollars down Dollars 2.75. Supported by another large drawdown from LME warehouse stocks, three months ALUMINIUM rose to Dollars 1,895 a tonne early on and threatened to test recent four-year peaks above Dollars 1,900. But it too retreated, closing Dollars 7.50 down on the day at Dollars 1,875.50 a tonne. At the London Commodity Exchange, COFFEE futures continued the recent slide. The January position touched Dollars 3,320 a tonne before closing at Dollars 3,349, down another Dollars 54. 'There is not a blind bit of interest from industry,' commented one dealer, adding that lower than expected retail demand in the last quarter had sidelined industry buyers. COCOA futures rallied from early lows to end sharply higher following New York's bullish trend, dealers said. The March position closed at Pounds 981 a tonne, up Pounds 14.

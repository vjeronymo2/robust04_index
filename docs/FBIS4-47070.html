Panov, deputy minister of transportation </F> and director of the Department of Railways of the Republic of  Kazakhstan, by T. Shirshova, time and place not given]    [Text] Last summer was a hard one for Kazakhstan  railroad workers. Crowds of passengers literally assaulted first  the cashiers offices--standing in line overnight--and then the  cars, where double booking was not unusual. And this was not  just at the two terminals in the capital, but also at the  terminals of the republic's oblast centers.    What awaits us today? This is the subject of our  reporter's conversation with Yu. Panov, deputy minister of  transportation and director of the Department of Railways of the  Republic of Kazakhstan.    [Shirshova] Yuriy Vladimirovich, won't the latest increase  in  the price of train tickets cause passengers to abandon railroad  transportation?    [Panov] Let's compare: to fly from Alma-Ata [Almaty] to  Moscow a passenger has to put out 2,000 tenge (120,000 rubles  [R]), while passage in a railroad car with compartments will  cost one-tenth as much. Motor vehicle workers are completely out  of the competition: the vehicle fleet has one foot in the grave,  as they say, and they are not receiving any replacements.  Furthermore there is the fuel problem, and the cost of motor  vehicle travel is not much different from air travel. So  railroad workers will again have to bear the main burden of  conveying passengers on both short and long trips.    Suburban trains have begun to be organized very actively  recently, especially on the Virgin Lands Railroad. Whereas  people there used to make their trips by bus, now they are  trying to get onto the train. So just like last year, railroad  workers will be forced to put in use cars which sometimes do not  even meet the requirements of esthetics--so long as safe travel  is ensured. People are asking us, "We don't care if it's a steam  engine, just get us there." The suburban, or more accurately  interoblast, trains are already running overloaded. And  passengers understand that it is difficult for the railroad  workers to ensure comfortable travel.    [Shirshova] All the same, I hope that things will not come  to  steam travel?    [Panov] There are 2,200 passenger cars in our fleet. Over  the  winter 300 cars were given factory overhauling, and 700 were  serviced at depots. That is a total of 1,000, but for the  large-scale summer passenger traffic we should have 1,500. Or  even more. So our technical capabilities are limited; they  cannot meet the demand for conveyance.    Last year Kazakhstan bought 114 railroad cars in Germany and  70 in Tver. This year we are buying another 100 cars in Germany,  but it is a question how many we will buy in Tver. Russia too  needs to update its fleet. So it is a very complex situation.  The German cars we bought will not go to organize new routes,  but rather to supply existing ones.    [Shirshova] Many people are concerned about the fate of the  trains to Moscow and St. Petersburg. Rumors are going around  that the Petersburg train will be canceled.    [Panov] Yes, there were such intentions. But we decided to  run it three times a week. The reasons were, first, that we are  short of cars and, second, we are uneasy that the trains travel  half-empty in Russian territory.    [Shirshova] People think that the Russian cashiers are  unenthusiastic about selling tickets to Kazakhstan trains so  that they can fill up their own Russian ones.    [Panov] Not exactly. Our conductors often would conceal  vacant seats, in order to take people without tickets along. And  there are indications that information on vacant seats is not  being given out from Kazakhstan trains. But I think this will be  straightened out soon. At the last conference in Voronezh  representatives of the railroad administrations of the  Commonwealth countries signed documents to introduce penalties  for carrying passengers without tickets and concealing vacant  seats. So if Russian inspectors, for example, inspecting a  Kazakhstan train in Russian territory, find 10 persons without  tickets, they will issue a penalty against the car depot that  made up the train for the cost of 10 tickets. Similar penalties  are envisioned for concealing vacant seats.    [Shirshova] Last year problems arose in Kazakhstan with  travel document forms. How are things now?    [Panov] We placed an order for production of the forms in  Russia. As you know, Kazakhstan does not have the facilities. We  have already received the forms. Incidentally, as of 10 May a  new system for preparing tickets has been introduced. The number  of kilometers that the train travels in Commonwealth territory  is now marked on the ticket stub. And income from passenger  conveyance will always go to the state on whose territory the  train was traveling.    [Shirshova] Those are problems which were solved earlier,  and  have reappeared.    [Panov] The Volga Railroad has canceled the Volgograd-Beyneu  route, which served the Chevroil petroleum-gas complex. The  pretext for the cancellation was supposedly that a danger of  crime had developed in the territory across which the train was  traveling. But they could not cite any specific examples of  excesses or attacks.    Only a very few Russian trains remain in Kazakhstan. I can  name just one, the Novosibirsk--Alma-Ata train. The rest are  organized by Kazakhstan. This fact greatly complicates the  situation with passenger conveyance. In order to get out of the  situation somehow we are restoring 40 cars that belong to the  Baikonur cosmodrome. They are in neglected condition and, of  course, need repair.    The problems with bed accessories have increased; there is a  kind of boom in disappearing bed linen these days. I am not  implicating passengers; they can hardly slip out of the car with  an armload of clean sheets. This means that we have to look for  the offenders elsewhere.    Another concern is that the bed accessories do not meet  requirements at all. Especially on the West Kazakhstan Railroad,  which makes up the Aktyubinsk--Alma-Ata train. One often wants  to detain it in the capital for their sloppy attitude toward  cleanliness. It looks like the bed linen is never washed, and  the supply runs out as soon as the train passes the exit signals  of Aktyubinsk station. K. Tazhibekov, first deputy director of  the West Kazakhstan Railroad, has received reprimands for this  irresponsible approach. He is supposed to keep his finger on the  pulse of passenger traffic, but what we hear from him is excuses  about poor work by the laundry. But I myself know that a laundry  with a capacity of 15 tonnes a days was built in Aktyubinsk the  year before last. All the linen in the city can be cleaned  there. Now they have a new argument, the shortage of detergent.  But this is no excuse either, for the Alma-Ata reserve  conductors buy detergent in Guryev, that is, in the territory of  the West Kazakhstan Railroad.    In general, the train does not have a caring owner. The door  to a car is hanging on one hinge--they make excuses about the  lack of factory repair facilities. But pardon me, you do not  have to have a factory to fix a door. A carpenter with minimal  materials can hang it in 2 hours. All the locks to the  compartment cars are broken. But the Aktyubinsk farm machinery  plant could fill an order for locks. At one time they did that.    [Shirshova] Yuriy Vladimirovich, summer is vacation time.  What do you think, will people travel to the sea on vacation?  You know, we once had a line from Alma-Ata to Adler. It was made  up on the Alma-Ata Railroad. Is there a desire to restore it?    [Panov] Because of the unstable situation in the Black Sea  region people from Kazakhstan, as far as I know, are not wanting  to go there. They prefer to spend their vacation closer to home.  We have places for vacationing, for our own people and for  guests, although we do not have a second Black Sea. In  principle, however, a train could be organized. But there would  have to be a full guarantee of the safety of the passengers and  service personnel.</p>

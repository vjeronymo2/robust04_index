			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fokker to pay first dividend in five years FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft builder, is to resume paying a dividend for the first time in five years. The company said yesterday that the long-awaited move reflected progress made during 1991 - despite the subdued world aviation market - and the favourable outlook for the longer term. Fokker also reported that it had posted net profit of Fl 87m (Dollars 47m) in 1991, compared with Fl 83m the previous year. Operating profit increased at a more buoyant rate of 55 per cent to Fl 145m, but growth in net results was held back by a sharp rise in interest charges and by a markedly lower contribution to profits from associate companies. Turnover was up by 19 per cent at Fl 3.8bn. 'Barring unforeseen circumstances, a further improvement of the company's results is expected in 1992,' Fokker said. The cash payout to shareholders from 1991 earnings has been fixed at Fl 0.75 per share. Fokker last paid a dividend out of 1986 results, when shareholders either received Fl 1.75 in cash or exercised an option to receive the payout in a mixture of cash and shares. Dividend payments were halted in 1987 after the Dutch government came to Fokker's rescue when it ran into difficulties arranging the simultaneous launch of two new aircraft, the Fokker 50 and 100. The government now holds 32 per cent of Fokker's shares. The company had originally hoped to pay a dividend on 1990 results but it postponed resumption of a payout because of the Gulf war and also the weakness of the dollar.</p>

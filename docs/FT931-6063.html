			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Leading Article: US targets and Bosnia THE US administration had two main objectives in deciding to parachute emergency aid to besieged Moslem communities in eastern Bosnia; the first was humanitarian, the second political. The difficulty that United Nations land convoys were having in delivering relief supplies to people in areas controlled by Serb militias seemed to justify a new approach. But at least equally important for Washington was the political consideration that, after all the criticism of Serb atrocities during the presidential election campaign, the new president should be seen to act in line with his principles. The real problem is that members of the administration still seem to disagree over their longer-term policy options. With painful memories of the Vietnam war still relatively fresh, direct military intervention was never a realistic proposition and proposals to arm the Moslems ran into the stiff and well-founded opposition of the US's allies with troops on the ground. Though the administration's dislike of the international mediators' plan for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces has been well-publicised, the US has not, so far, come up with a viable alternative. Indeed, it has been obliged to pay lip service to the Vance-Owen plan in the knowledge that it is fully backed by Russia, Britain and France, all permanent members of the UN Security Council, which would have to endorse a Bosnian peace settlement. In the circumstances, the air-drops must be seen as at least partly a political gesture targeted as much at domestic American opinion as on eastern Bosnia. Yet that operation must not be allowed to divert international attention from the efforts to achieve a peace settlement or from the need for the US to pull its full weight in the talks which resumed in New York on Monday. When the US announced its new 'initiative' on Bosnia last month, the administration made clear that it wanted to work in close association with Russia, in the hope that Moscow would exert pressure on its Serbian allies to make compromises. But the corollary of such a policy is that Washington, too, should try to persuade its Moslem proteges to adopt a more flexible approach. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, has lately proved to be particularly intractable and has refused to lead his delegation in the peace talks. The suffering and grievances of his people are indisputable, but he must be made to realise that a durable peace settlement is in his own people's most fundamental interests. The assurance the US has given that it will make a substantial contribution to the international force required to enforce a peace agreement should provide the kind of long-term guarantee the Moslems are looking for.</p>

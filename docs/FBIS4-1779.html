			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zheng Feifei (1728 7236 7236)] </F>   [Text] Shenyang, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Gaosheng Oilfield  has explored and found a whole set of technologies for  recovering dense oil [chou you 4464 3111] from deep wells and  enabled China's dense oil industry to reach the advanced world  level after tackling key problems during the "Sixth Five-Year  Plan," the completion of necessary accessories during the  "Seventh Five-Year Plan," and improvement and perfection during  the first three years of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan."    The Gaosheng Oilfield is under the jurisdiction of the  Liaohe  Oilfield Administration, and is located in areas of Panshan and  Taian Counties, Liaoning Province. It is a base for recovering  dense oil from medium and deep wells. The total area with oil  is 14.5 square kilometers and the total geological deposit is  100 million tonnes. Most of the deposit is irregular [yi chang  xing 8381 1603 1840] dense oil, and the oil horizon is as deep  as 1,500- 1,700 meters. It is one of the deepest dense oil  fields being tapped in the world today.    In 1977, the Petroleum Industry Ministry decided to turn the  Gaosheng Oilfield into China's first dense oil development and  experimental zone and make a plan to "gain experience, train  talented people, and yield output."    "People in Gaosheng" plunged themselves into the work of  opening up the oilfield in the spirit of "giving their lives for  science." During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, they  imported and absorbed advanced technologies from abroad. They  tested self-gushing by means of hot water circulation under the  well, self-gushing by means of lowering an electric cable under  the well [jing xia dian lan jiang zhan zi pen 0064 0007 7193  4968 7100 4724 5261 0899], self- gushing of oil with water  flooding under the well, the conventional method of extracting  heavy oil with water flooding under well, extracting oil by  lowering water [chan huo xing shui jiang zhan chou you 2296 3172  1840 3055 7100 4724 2132 3111], and other technologies. They  successfully explored the "12-character" complete technology  suitable for recovering dense oil from deep wells, namely "big  machine, long pump, thick tube, strong lever, deep under, and  tap oil [chan you 2296 3111]," which can be used as a model for  reference by other dense oilfields. They honorably received the  state's scientific and technological progress prize of the first  class for their experiment in recovering dense oil.    During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the Gaosheng  Oilfield entered a period of high production and reached the  goal of producing 1 million tonnes of petroleum steadily and  annually three years ahead of the development plan. Their oil  recovering speed exceeded the average speed of thin oil fields  in the country. Gaosheng Oilfield became the country's only  dense oilfield receiving the title of "oil field with high  efficiency." Despite their achievements, they have not  slackened their efforts to tackle scientific and technological  difficulties and achieved another major breakthrough in oil  recovery technology. In recovering dense oil, they carried out  large-scale experiments on sucking and discharging steam, and  gradually used domestically produced boilers. Their research  and manufacturing of air-filled oil wells [zhu qi jing tian 3137  3086 0064 3944], heat separation tubes, gas sealers, and other  items all reached or were close to the world advanced level.  During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the Gaosheng  Oilfield also completed a ground transportation system for  petroleum, and changed the past practice of carrying oil by  horse-drawn wagons and oil drum cars. It has also realized  fully automatic computerized management technology, and its oil  transportation technology also reached the world advanced level.    Since entering the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, the  Gaosheng Oilfield continued to raise its oil recovery rate and  engaged in difficult scientific and technological research  projects, including steam flooding technology [zheng qi gu pei  tao gong yi ji shu 5544 3086 7517 6792 1152 1562 5669 2111  2611], steam sucking and discharging technology, sand prevention  for oilfields, and other subjects. In recent years, it has been  carrying out over 10 technological innovations each year and  maintaining the oil production quantity. As of the end of last  year, the Gaosheng Oilfield produced an accumulated total of  11.81 million tonnes of oil for the state.</p>

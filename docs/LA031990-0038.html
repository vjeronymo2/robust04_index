			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: STEINLE TO LEAVE UPI TO START A MEDIA FIRM  </P> <P> Paul Steinle, who directed a major reorganization of United Press International  for the past 25 months, will resign as president of the news service on March  31 to start a media company.  </P> <P> UPI Vice Chairman Joseph Taussig will assume the additional duties of president  until a replacement is selected for Steinle, 51, Taussig said.  </P> <P> "Because of the rebuilding process in which everyone in this company has  participated during the past two years, I am confident that UPI will continue  to grow and prosper," Steinle said in a message to employees.  </P> <P> UPI reported a "modest" profit in the fourth quarter of 1989, Taussig said,  after the news agency endured millions of dollars in losses over three decades.  He declined to release financial figures.  </P> <P> Steinle said he will remain on the UPI board.  </P> <P> A Vietnam War radio correspondent and former president of Financial News  Network, Steinle took the helm at UPI in February, 1988, after New York-based  Infotechnology assumed control of the beleaguered company from Mexican media  baron Mario Vazquez Rana.  </P></p>

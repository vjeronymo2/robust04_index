			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Togo, the opposition is in the frontline. Mr.  Agboyibor's Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] has decided to  suspend its participation in the electoral campaign in protest  against the assassination of three of its members, including a  deputy who was elected in the first round of the elections. The  CAR will not rescind its decision unless the security of its  members is totally guaranteed. Olabire da Cruz, who is in Lome,  explains the issue to Africa No. 1.    [Begin Cruz recording] Confirming the decision made by his  party's steering committee following a long meeting, CAR  Chairman Yaovi Agboyibor stated that this suspension will remain  in force until security is guaranteed for all candidates.  According to him, this is not possible for two of them at  present. Already, by early yesterday evening, the CAR's  decision was rather foreseeable, especially as this party and  its ally, Edem Kojo's party, had withdrawn from the state media  program arranged by the Ad Hoc Audiovisual Communications  Commission for 14 February. The Rally of the Togolese People,  the former single ruling party, therefore participated in the  program alone. All the same, it will not be surprising to see  CAR rescind its decision very rapidly.    Meanwhile, after vehemently condemning last weekend's  assassinations, the International Committee for Monitoring the  Ouagadougou Agreement did not hide its concern and fear for the  consequences that this act may have on the democratic process.  It therefore appealed for the restoration of confidence among  the various parties and hoped that security measures will be  taken as soon as possible.    Similarly, the Togolese Armed Forces [FAT] categorically  denied any implication in last weekend's assassinations. In a  statement, the FAT headquarters said that immediately a group of  people in military uniform does anything wrong, some  ill-intentioned and unscrupulous voices are raised and attribute  this to the security forces. A strong warning was sounded to  all those who use military uniforms to commit reproachful acts  in a bid to stain the honor of the Army. [end recording]</p>

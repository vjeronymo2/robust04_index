			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Finmeccanica bought 6.02% Fokker stake a year ago FINMECCANICA, the principal industrial group of IRI, Italy's state holding company, acquired its 6.02 per cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft group, more than a year ago, Mr Franco Nobili, the head of IRI, revealed yesterday. The secret acquisition of the stake, worth Fl 71.5m (Dollars 38.1m) at Fokker's current share price, only came to light on Monday as a result of a new law last month, requiring shareholders to disclose stakes of 5 per cent or more in stock market-listed Dutch companies. Finmeccanica has so far declined to comment on the reasons behind the purchase or why it has kept quiet about the deal. However, when questioned by journalists yesterday, Mr Nobili said: '(The purchase) was not recent but something which dates back more than a year.' The disclosure comes just a few days after Fokker announced discussions with Deutsche Aerospace aimed at expanding collaboration in regional jets, including the German group's participation in the development of a smaller version of the Fokker 100.</p>

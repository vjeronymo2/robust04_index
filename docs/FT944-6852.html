			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Tokyo's Euro-hotel Business travellers tired of Japan's drab 1970s-style international hotels may find comfort in the Tokyo Westin in Yebisu Garden Place, the shopping, restaurant and office complex which opened in central Tokyo last month, reports Emiko Terazono. Done up in 'neo-classical European style', it is one of the few hotels in Tokyo with any character. Until next February, prices in the hotel start from Y19,500 per person, including breakfast. After that: from Y28,000 per person.</p>

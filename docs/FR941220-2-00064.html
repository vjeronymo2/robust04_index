			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NASD District 1 supports the proposal and offers two suggestions. First, with respect to the Regulatory Element, the commenter suggests that the sections relating to ``Requirements'' and ``Re-entry into Program'' be amended to make it clear that the time frame of the Regulatory Element is 10 years, not 15. Regarding the Firm Element, the commenter asks who the ``Specific Training'' provision would operate ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at what level of the NASD would such decisions be made).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments submitted on NTM 94&hyph;59 were reviewed by the Council and by the NASD Membership Committee. Neither the Council nor the Membership Committee agreed with those commenters who opposed instituting a continuing education program for the securities industry, believing that it is in the best interest of the investing public and the industry to proceed with the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Membership Committee made three technical changes to the rule as originally proposed in NTM 94&hyph;59. First, the language in Section (1)(a)(i) of the NASD's proposal was redrafted to state clearly that registered persons must participate in the Regulatory Element of the continuing education program on three occasions, after the occurrence of their second, fifth, and tenth registration anniversary dates. Second, Section (1)(b) of the NASD's proposal has been expanded to state that a registration that is inactive for a period of two calendar years would be terminated administratively, and that a person whose reregistration is so terminated must requalify by taking the Series 7 examination before such person's registration could be reactivated. Finally, Section (1)(c)(iii) of the NASD's proposal was amended to clarify that the Commission, a state securities regulator, or an SRO could require re-entry into the program only as a result of a sanction in a formal disciplinary action. This change is meant to address the concerns of those commenting on the due process issues that could arise were regulatory authorities able to mandate re-entry arbitrarily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD Membership Committee did not respond to other recommendations made by commenters. The Committee believes that it is unnecessary to state explicitly that inactive status under the Regulatory Element of the program is not a disciplinary action. Explanatory materials on this point would accompany the notice to members announcing the effectiveness of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters suggested that member firms be permitted to administer the Regulatory Element in-house. The Council and the SROs will continue to study this issue and will formulate a final response for the industry in the future. The program, however, initially would be implemented only in the NASD's testing centers. The Membership Committee believes this to be necessary to allow the NASD to manage the introduction of the program in a reasonable manner. The technology and administrative issues that arise with respect to the in-house administration of the Regulatory Element will require further study to be resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, some commenters questioned the use of a single computer-based training program in a Regulatory Element for all persons within the first 10 years of their initial registration. The Membership Committee and the Council recognized that there are variations in function and degree of involvement in the securities industry among the approximately 500,000 individuals registered as representatives. Both the Council and the NASD Membership Committee believe that the initial computer-based training program should deal with the most important compliance and regulatory concerns confronting the industry, and that these matters are important for all segments of the securities industry. The Council, the Membership Committee, and the other SROs would continue to review the need for more specialized computer-based training programs for different segments of the industry. In the future, these groups may recommend that such programs be introduced, but only after further assessing the experience with the initial single computer-based training program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

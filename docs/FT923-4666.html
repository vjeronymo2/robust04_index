			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Elsevier 19% ahead at midway ELSEVIER, the expansive Dutch publisher, reported a strong 19.7 per cent rise in pre-tax operating profit to Fl 315.6m (Dollars 199.7m) for the six months ended June, helped by vigorous growth in its scientific, professional and business information services. Trading profit, which excludes income derived from non-consolidated companies and interest earnings, advanced by 30 per cent to Fl 282.3m. This was largely due to the first-time inclusion of results from Pergamon, the UK-based scientific publisher acquired for Pounds 440m (Dollars 875.6m) in mid-May, 1991, from Maxwell Communications Corp. The after-tax net profit was up 16.9 per cent to Fl 226.4m. This included extraordinary income of Fl 40m, stemming from Elsevier's sale of its RTL4 television holding to VNU, its fellow Dutch publisher. Elsevier said its consumer-information business posted lower earnings as a result of the slump in advertising sales at its Dagbladunie division, and further costs reductions were planned. Group turnover rose 13 per cent to Fl 1.22bn. The war chest of liquid assets swelled from Fl 170m to Fl 515m. The Elsevier group is known to be seeking a large publisher in the US business, professional or consumer-information market. Elsevier reiterated its forecast that full-year net income will climb by 25 per cent from the Fl 384.8m achieved in 1991.</p>

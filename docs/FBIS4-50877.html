			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 21 (XINHUA) -- Former British  Foreign Secretary Geoffery Howe has said that the Sino-British  joint declaration would still play a vital role in the transfer  of power of Hong Kong in 1997.    Addressing an American Chamber of Commerce lunch here Friday  [20 May] following his recent Beijing trip, Howe also said  China's economic progress had given some assurance to the people  of Hong Kong about their future.    Meanwhile, he warned that a decision by the United States to  revoke China's most-favored nation (MFN) trading status would  hit Hong Kong much heavier. "Curtailment of MFN status would  provoke China as much as a bee-sting, and damage Hong Kong as  much as a sledgehammer," he said.</p>

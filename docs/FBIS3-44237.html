The government delegation is worried because its  proposal has so far been in agreement with the thinking of the  mediator and the troika of observers.    The numbers proposed by the government for the participation  of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] in the national police and the rapid intervention unit  are about 15 percent and 18 percent, respectively. UNITA always  distant, has on various occasions changed its proposal on  percentages to be adopted for its participation in police, but  so far, it has not been able to convince the mediator to the  point of convening a face-to-face meeting or a plenary session  to resolve the issue. The Black Cockerel's negotiators want 35  percent participation in national police and 50 percent  participation in the riot police.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Turkey Turkey's stock exchange is to extend its settlement period, and increase trading hours in a move to attract foreign investors, who already account for about 40 per cent of turnover, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. The new chairman of the Istanbul stock exchange, Mr Tuncay Artun, is due to announce the changes today Until now all trades have had to be settled by the end of the next business day, or T+1. The reforms envisage a T+2 settlement period. On trading hours, in addition to a two-hour morning session, there will now be two more hours in the afternoon. The exchange's concern has been that an extended settlement system would encourage short trading. However, brokers say that the change should diminish the number of failed sales, which result because, on foreign buy orders, the funding requirement, they explain, is often not known until after the market closes. Buenos Aires The Buenos Aires stock exchange has modified its weighted MerVal index. Three new issues have been added while four issues have been dropped. Energy stocks remain the biggest sector in the MerVal, which now comprises 22 stocks in all, representing approximately 25.9 per cent of the weighting. Two of the three companies added to the MerVal are Buenos Aires-based thermal power utilities, Central Costanera and Central Puerto. The third newcomer is Citicorp Equity Investments, which has stakes in telecom-munications, natural gas, oil, and timber products concerns. The four stocks left out of the MerVal are the petrochemicals group, Indupa, the cement maker, Corcemar, and Banco del Sud, as well as Nabisco's local food company, Terrabusi.

Tel (202) 473-9550; Fax (202) 676-9299. Israel Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, was worried this week after Tel Aviv's Mishtanim, blue chip in-dex hit a low of 148.01 on Monday. He said he was 'worried because I'm convinced that the economic situation is far better than it is given expression in the stock exchange'. Investors responded and the Mishtanim made a three-day recovery to close the week 10.6 per cent off its lows at 163.83 - still, unfortunately, 36.6 per cent off its high of 258.44 for the year.

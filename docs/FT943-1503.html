			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hoechst plans to lift margins Germany's Hoechst group plans to increase profitability in its healthcare division by reducing research spending and squeezing more synergies from its domestic businesses and its French subsidiary, Roussel Uclaf. Mr Jean-Pierre Godard, head of the pharmaceuticals division, said he planned to increase gross operating margins, currently around 10 per cent of sales, to 14 per cent within three years. The research and development budget would be trimmed by up to 4 per cent this year. Rises on the scale of last year's 16 per cent, taking the total to DM1.6bn (Dollars 1bn), were no longer affordable in the current business environment, he told a press conference. He aimed to reduce the annual total to about DM1.3bn. Research would be more sharply focused on a specific, limited range of projects to avoid overlaps and duplication, he added. The French group would in future process all work on anti-infective preparations while Hoechst would be responsible for cardiovascular agents. Discussions were not yet complete on which companies would take charge of immunology, inflammation, osteoporosis and rheumatology work. Mr Godard claimed European plant running costs could be reduced by up to 20 per cent by better co-ordination of production between Hoechst, and its Behring and Roussel Uclaf subsidiaries. The Hoechst and Roussel drugs operations are already being merged into joint ventures in the UK and Italy. Starting next year, the Belgian, Greek, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish businesses would be merged under a single management team. Including a reduction of 800 in the workforce, the rationalisation measures were expected to save the group DM200m a year, Mr Godard said. On future strategy, he said the group had to improve its position in the US, where it generated only 6 per cent of sales and had a 1 per cent market share. Mr Karl-Gerhard Seifert, the Hoechst main board director responsible for drugs, said that in spite of moves by German competitors, the group had no plans to establish a generic drugs business in the domestic market. It was first and foremost a producer of innovative pharmaceuticals, he said. However, a new stake in Copley of the US and Britain's Arthur Cox company meant the group was strtegically well-placed in the world market for out-of-patent drugs, Mr Seifert claimed.</p>

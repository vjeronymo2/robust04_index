			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / TSB aims to close up to 200 branches TSB, the banking and insur-ance group, is to close up to 200 branches next year out of a network of 1,200. The bank, which closed 100 branches this year, said the decision was in line with its strategy of offering services through larger branches, cash dispenser machines and a telephone banking service launched on Monday. The bank is to carry out next year's closures by way of mergers, which will be decided on the basis of location and potential for future business. Customers' accounts will be automatically transferred to the branch with which the old one is being merged. The bank, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 301m last year, said that there would be no redundancies among permanent clerical staff as a result of the closures, but 30 junior managers might lose their jobs. However, Mr Rob MacGregor, assistant secretary of the Bifu banking union, said: 'We view any announcement on such a radical branch closure programme resulting in 30 redundancies with some scepticism. Where are all those staff who work in those branches going to go if some are not to be made redundant? 'TSB goes through one reorganisation after another. There have been half a dozen in the last 10 years and this is going to demoralise the workforce.' There were 1,000 redundancies at TSB in the year to October 31 1993 and it is expected that the figure for this year will be similar. The bank is in dispute with staff over an imposed 2 per cent pay rise and plans for performance-related pay. Bifu has called for a 6 per cent pay increase but industrial action has been averted pending talks with management at Acas, the conciliation service, today. Last night Mr MacGregor questioned the timing of TSB's closures announcement, suggesting that it might have been timed to undermine employees' resolve for industrial action. Union members voted by a slender majority for a mandate to take selective strike action. The issue of branch closures resulted in staff going on strike in January last year. In June TSB said it would shed about 150 senior managers as part of a restructuring of its branch network because it was consolidating three regions into a single national structure.</p>

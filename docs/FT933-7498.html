			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Super-rich escape the worst of UK recession THE OFFICIAL inflation rate may be 1.4 per cent, but the UK's super wealthy appear to have been hit less hard by price increases than the rest of the recession-weary public. The Financial Times has found that for a 'basket' of luxury items, the overall increase in price has been only 1.2 per cent in the past year. But even the super-rich have been discouraged from spending by recession - the reason most commonly cited for holding prices steady was lack of demand. The basket of goods included: A 'Richmond' hamper from Fortnum and Mason, complete with non-vintage champagne, Sancerre, pates and cheeses, priced Pounds 150 this year, unchanged from 1992. A double-breasted pinstripe suit of best-quality wool yarn, from Huntsman's, the bespoke Savile Row tailor, priced Pounds 1,908 this year, also the same as last year. A pair of men's brogues - handmade by Lobb's, the gentleman's cobbler that has been in St James's Street for four generations - priced Pounds 1,095 this year, a 6 per cent increase on last year. A London-New York return by Concorde unchanged at Pounds 5,030 (with a special offer fare of Pounds 4,220 available). But more averagely wealthy families may have found their household budgets rising by more than the Retail Prices Index. Wealthier families spend a higher proportion of their income than poorer ones on leisure services, motoring, alcohol and clothing. Only the last category has not increased in price. They also tend to be hit by expenses not included in the RPI. Average term fees for Headmasters' Conference schools (the big public and independent schools) have risen 8.3 per cent to Pounds 3,425. Holy grail still proves elusive, Page 6</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- The 1994 Russian defence  budget should be at least 55,000,000,000,000 rubles instead of  the 37,000,000,000,000 approved by the State Duma, Chairman of  the Federation Council Budget and Finances Committee Petr  Shirshov told a news conference here today.    In his words, a closed meeting of the parliament upper  chamber discussed the draft federal budget approved by the State  Duma in the first reading and decided to agree with the  committee proposal on the increased defence spending and changes  in their structure.    Shirshov said that the Russian defence budget is only one  tenth of the U.S. planned military spending.</p>

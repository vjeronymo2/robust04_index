			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Smith New Court man tops economic forecasters survey BRITAIN'S most accurate economic forecaster during the recession is Mr Paul Turnbull, chief UK economist at stockbroker Smith New Court, according to a Financial Times survey published today. The Treasury only manages 19th place out of 41 forecasting groups in the detailed FT analysis which measures the accuracy of growth projections during the recession. The FT's survey coincided with the announcement last night by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that he is setting up a panel of independent forecasters to help with official Treasury projections. Invitations will go out shortly to people the Treasury would like on the panel. The Treasury said last night it would look at the FT's survey with interest. The FT's assessment, which has taken in more than 3,000 individual forecasts, is based on records of what individual economists said about the economy on a monthly basis over the past three years. It is the most comprehensive effort since the recession started to rank economists according to accuracy of their growth projections. While virtually all UK economists - including Mr Turnbull - have been over-optimistic in their predictions, the Treasury's forecasting record is significantly worse than that of other groups. Four of the top 10 forecasters are members of the 'Liverpool Six' group of monetarist economists who warned early last year that the recession would be protracted and that Britain might have to leave the European exchange rate mechanism. Organisations at the bottom of the FT's list include City University Business School, Nomura and Credit Suisse First Boston. Mr Turnbull, 39, who has worked at Smith New Court since 1986, said yesterday: 'It's no surprise I have come out top in the survey. My forecasts have been bloody good.' His latest forecast for 1992 is that the economy will contract by 1.1 per cent, followed by weak growth of 0.6 per cent next year. An outspoken monetarist, Mr Turnbull, said he was delighted Britain had left the ERM and would like to see interest rates at 6 per cent to help a recovery. He would also like the government to cut public spending and raise taxes in next year's Budget to combat the deterioration in public sector borrowing. Of the 10 forecasters who have shown the greatest accuracy on growth forecasts in the recession, five are leading monetarist economists who have attacked government policies, in particular concerning ERM membership.

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Care in a coffee cup Campaigning on third world issues has not traditionally interested the retail giants. Which makes it surprising that a small Edinburgh-based company with no full-time employees has persuaded six supermarket chains to stock a brand of coffee from which the proceeds go to improving the lot of Latin American hill farmers. Cafedirect was formed as a profit-making venture by Oxfam Trading, Equal Exchange, Traidcraft and Twin Trading, all of which use trade rather than aid to stimulate economic growth in developing countries, and are non-profit-making. Their strategy was to buy coffee direct from Latin American hill farmers, at a price that would give the farmers a more secure economic footing than in the past. Pauline Tiffen, a journalist who has become Cafedirect's Latin American liaison officer, explained: 'We wanted to pay a price that would do more than just cover their costs. 'The aim was that they should be paid enough to introduce mechanisation, to cover any unforeseen contingencies, like frost, and to have a little bit of profit left over at the end.' The going rate for the raw crop has been depressed since the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in 1969, which caused a glut of cheap coffee. Cafedirect decided to pay roughly twice the going rate. But in spite of this, Cafedirect charges Pounds 1.55 for an 8oz pack of ground coffee, only slightly more than the average supermarket price. The company is reticent about how it manages it, refusing to reveal the extent of its initial capitalisation or volume of sales. However, it will confirm that it does not employ anyone. Its four board directors have full-time jobs with the founding organisations, while all other Cafedirect workers operate on a consultancy basis, charging an hourly rate. Thus Lorna Young, Cafedirect's marketing director, works about three days a week for Equal Exchange, her employer, and two days a week for Cafedirect. She sits at the same desk in the same Edinburgh office all week, but she logs the hours spent on Cafedirect work, and submits an invoice accordingly. It was Young, a former publishing executive, who first began knocking on supermarket doors in 1992. Within six months she had persuaded Waitrose to stock Cafedirect nationwide. Safeway followed last spring, and Gateway (in 200 stores), Tesco (120), Asda (70) and Sainsbury's (60) have followed since. 'I think we've surprised a lot of people by how well we've done in how short a time,' says Young. 'I know our rivals would be very interested to know how much we're selling, and although I'm not prepared to put a figure on it, I can say that orders have tripled in the last 18 months.' The number of suppliers has also increased. Tiffen estimates that by the middle of this year, farmers growing coffee for Cafedirect will total 214,000, from 13,000 in 1992. All of them are based in Costa Rica, Mexico or Peru, most are part of some form of collective organisation, and all have to move the coffee to a port for shipment to the UK. Cafedirect has only a small share of the UK ground coffee market, which in turn accounts for only 10 per cent of the total UK coffee market (instant coffee has 90 per cent). And its advertising makes much of the fact that the collectives they buy from frequently put profits to communal use, building schools and hospitals, employing teachers and doctors. The advertisements also claim that farmers paid only the going rate for their coffee are frequently forced to abandon their land and move to the city - or move into a more sinister branch of agriculture. 'Coca grows like a weed and is altogether much less hard work than growing coffee,' says Tiffen, who has seen drug cartels exert pressure during her visits to Cafedirect growers in remote mountain and jungle regions. The implication of these claims is that Cafedirect's rivals are exploiting the farmers, a suggestion strongly resisted by Allan Allbeury, spokesman for food group Nestle, which makes Nescafe. 'We are as keen as anyone to ensure the well-being of our primary producers,' he says. 'But because we need to buy in such volume, we have no option but to buy on the open world market. 'We feel that the best interests of the largest number of farmers will be best served not by localised agreements, but by a price rise on the open market.' Lorna Young agrees: 'We would be delighted if the price of world coffee were to go up to a fair level. Although we are a profit-making company, and we are definitely a trading organisation rather than a campaigning organisation, I think we would all be very pleased if world coffee prices went up and we went out of business because there was no longer any need for us.'</p>

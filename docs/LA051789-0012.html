			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL THOMAS ON ABORTION  </P> <P> I want to express how pleased I was by the Cal Thomas column regarding Carrie  Walker's science project on abortion ("Youngsters Get Uncomfortably Close to  the Truth of Why the Baby Is in the Bottle," Op-Ed Page, May 1).  </P> <P> At the age of 19, I got involved in some irresponsible sex and became pregnant.  I was but a freshman in college with plans of studying abroad and other goals  typical of bright girls who go looking for love and acceptance in this supposed  sexual revolution -- but, wind up finding out it was mostly lust. My parents  offered the best support they could. My dad even offered to fly me to Colorado  for an abortion.  </P> <P> My son is now 20. Recently he shared with me that there had been a debate on  his college campus on the pros and cons of abortion. I shared with him that  California had not always had abortion clinics. He asked me what I thought  about abortion. Because he is aware that he doesn't live with his biological  father, I, for the first time, asked him if he was glad to be alive. To which,  he smiled broadly and replied, "Yes, of course."  </P> <P> Then I had to admit to him that I had considered, only briefly, the possibility  of aborting him.  </P> <P> I thank God I chose to respect the right of his life to have its expression.  </P> <P> Not everyone should keep their babies. There are 1 million infertile couples  who suffer in painful loneliness longing to fill their arms with a baby. I'm  concerned about teens keeping their babies -- in many instances, a carefully  planned adoption would be preferable.  </P> <P> But babies are a sign of life and hope, they are the future. I hope America  stops this blood bath in the name of liberating women. Maybe we need to start  talking about responsible sex, what's best for unplanned babies and  out-of-wedlock moms with a commitment to our future instead of abortion on  demand today.  </P> <P> To have known my son, is to have an experience in wonder. Yes, my dear child,  they kill the baby to put it in a jar.  </P> <P> CAROL JACKSON  </P> <P> Walnut  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS SEIZED IN CRIME SPREE  </P> <P> Two suspected Pomona gang members who were involved in the shooting death of a  full-term fetus last week were being held without bail Wednesday after  allegedly stealing two cars and firing at a passing driver while under the  influence of PCP.  </P> <P> Yamil Henderson, 18, and Anthony Coleman, 19, were arrested in Pomona on  Tuesday night on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, grand theft auto,  evading arrest and being under the influence of PCP, police said. They were  later booked by Los Angeles police on suspicion of attempted murder.  </P> <P> The alleged spree began Monday, when a 1981 Ford Mustang was stolen in Upland,  police said. The two men were reportedly driving the stolen car in Pacoima on  Tuesday night when they fired three shots into another driver's car, police  said.  </P> <P> The driver, whom police would not identify, was struck at least once in the  elbow, police said. The two suspects chased the man for several blocks, firing  six to seven more shots before the driver eluded them, officers said.  </P> <P> The suspects then went to a Pacoima liquor store, where they stole a Porsche at  gunpoint from Michael Moungey, 17, of Glendale, police said. Later, police in  Pomona tried to pull the Porsche over after it was seen being driven  erratically, Detective Ed McLean said.  </P> <P> The two reportedly led police on a car chase that ended when they abandoned the  vehicle and fled on foot. Henderson and Coleman were caught after they were  spotted by a police helicopter, McLean said.  </P> <P> On March 26, Coleman was arrested on suspicion of murder in the shooting of  Lillian Kelley, 16, whose full-term fetus was killed when she was shot while  visiting Coleman's apartment. According to witnesses, Henderson, who was also  visiting the apartment, had been playing with a pistol when Coleman tried to  take the weapon away from him and it discharged, police said.  </P> <P> No charges were filed after an investigation.  </P></p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Return to profit for Skanska and NCC Skanska and NCC, Sweden's top two construction and property groups, returned to profit in 1993 after severe losses in 1992. But both companies continued to be hit by the slump in the Swedish market, relying on lower write-downs and income from divestments to see them back into the black. Revenues were down for both groups, reflecting another tough year - especially in Sweden, where the property and construction sectors have been among the hardest hit by a three-year long recession. Mr Jan Sjoqvist, president of NCC, said property prices and rent levels were stabilising, although there were variations between geographical areas and market segments. Infrastructure investment was also regaining momentum. However, he warned: 'Investments in the construction sector will remain low in 1994 and 1995, but should begin to show growth again in 1996.' Skanska showed the biggest improvement in 1993, swinging to a profit after financial items of SKr1.1bn (Dollars 149m) from a loss in 1992 of SKr3.98bn. NCC reported a profit after financial items of SKr175m following a deficit in 1992 of SKr1.63bn. Skanska increased its dividend to SKr3.25 per share (SKr1.50), but NCC suspended its dividend, as it did for 1992.</p>

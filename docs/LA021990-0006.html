			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, GORBACHEV  </P> <P> In the past few days your paper has displayed dramatically the tide of history  that is engulfing the world today. On the same day that Mikhail Gorbachev  finally triumphed over Article 6 of the Soviet constitution, effectively  abolishing the most wicked system of tyranny in this century, George Bush  donned the front page defending our grossly bloated defense budget (Part A,  Feb. 7). There could hardly be a more vivid example of how one superpower  leader has risen to the challenge and is riding the crest of history, while the  other is intent on being swept away with the past.  </P> <P> J.

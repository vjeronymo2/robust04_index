One commenter recommended including in the definition a requirement to report to the national credit bureau the date of the last payment, the unpaid principal balance, amount past due and date and amount of the last payment. Some commenters recommended that the phrase ``no longer in default'' should be clarified to mean that the record is not deleted from the borrower's credit history, when in fact it is only reported as a status change. One commenter also stated that the impact of ``rehabilitated and no longer in default'' affects the future disbursement of title IV aid and that the Secretary should not force the credit bureau to use unique, special definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary understands the concerns of these commenters and agrees that the requirements of this provision are unclear. In drafting the provision the Secretary intended that institutions report to one of the national credit bureaus the change in status of the defaulted loans. The Secretary did not intend that the default be eliminated from the credit bureau records. A default on any loan is an important component of an individual's credit history and credit bureaus are required to maintain such information on an individual's account for 7 years. The Secretary is concerned that a borrower who has made such a serious attempt to take care of his or her defaulted loan have as up-to-date and accurate record at the credit bureau as possible. Therefore, the status of the loan should be accurate on the credit bureau record. In response to the suggestion that additional data be provided to the credit bureau, the Secretary does not want to increase the burden at the institution by imposing additional reporting requirements on the institution. However, it should be noted that these national credit bureaus have standards that have been established by Associated Credit Bureaus (ACB), the industry's trade group. The Department has no regulatory authority over these bureaus' standards. Some of these national credit bureaus might require more than the Department requires, such as follow-up reporting of the borrower's declining balance as it is paid down or paid off. Further, some of their procedures are specifically for credit bureau purposes and more closely in line with common U.S. business practice than with Federal regulations. For example, business practice considers a customer's account to be current up to 30 days past the due date of an invoice; whereas in the Federal Perkins Loan program, a borrower is considered to be in default when he or she fails to make an installment payment when due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The language of this provision is changed to require an institution to report to a national credit bureau that a defaulted loan has been rehabilitated, rather than that a rehabilitated loan is no longer in default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 674.6&blank;Default Reduction Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter argued that the Federal Perkins Loan program operates differently from the FFEL Program, and there is no statutory requirement that requires the Federal Perkins Loan program default reduction plan to parallel that of the FFEL Program. The commenter believed that institutions would have to install costly and burdensome tracking mechanisms in order to implement this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with the commenter that there is no statutory requirement that mandates similar default reduction plans for the Federal Perkins Loan Program and the FFEL Program. However, in the interest of minimizing increases to burden at the institution, it is the Secretary's intent to mirror similar provisions that have existed in other title IV programs for a number of years, such as the FFEL Program. The default reduction plan, as outlined in these provisions, has been in effect in the FFEL Program for many years and, thus, has been thoroughly tested. Since most institutions are already participating in the FFEL Program, the Secretary does not believe that this provision increases burden; rather, he believes it streamlines and improves the delivery of student aid. The Secretary reminds commenters that there is no requirement for a high default institution to implement this specific plan. Each institution has the option of developing its own plan, subject to approval by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

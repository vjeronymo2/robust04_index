			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda, the cease-fire is but a memory. Violent  fighting has resumed in Kigali.    [Unidentified correspondent] The cease-fire announced by the  rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] came into force on  Monday at midnight. The RPF has accused the Army of violently  bombing its positions yesterday afternoon. There was heavy  fighting in Kigali last night. The RPF bombed the airport  because the Rwandan Army has introduced large-caliber guns  there, while the RPF and the United Nations wants this airport  to become a neutral zone. The Army has promised to withdraw the  guns, and General Dallaire, the commander of UN troops, is  expected to try to negotiate a fresh cease-fire.    Fighting continued this morning, but with less intensity.  However, it seems that the Army is still slaughtering opposition  members. The International Red Cross is trying to evacuate to  Zaire those who are threatened, including 5,000 people who have  found refuge in a stadium in Cyangugu, in the southwest of  Rwanda. A team of 15 Red Cross officers is doing its utmost to  give assistance to the wounded in Kigali, but three wounded  women being helped by the Red Cross were finished off by the  Army as recently as last Sunday.</p>

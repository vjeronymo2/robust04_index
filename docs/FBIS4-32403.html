			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- "UDMR [Democratic  Union of Hungarians in Romania] sees itself compelled to  reassess the role and aim of its representation to parliament,  because UDMR does not accept to act just as a stand-in in the  country's legislative body," runs a statement made by this  party's parliamentary group leader Gyula Vida at the end of the  debates on the education act.    In the group's opinion, the "education act in its present  form is absolutely unacceptable for the Hungarian community. It  (the law) enacts an obvious and unspeakable discrimination  against the ethnic minorities in Romania, and at the same time,  a flagrant violation of the constitution."    The main objections UDMR has against the draft law is the  restriction of the constitutional right to learn in the native  tongue in all the objects of study, the abolition of the  existing structures of specialized education in minority  languages, the interdiction to train in higher education  institutions specialists in social and economic sciences, the  inacceptance to have the confessional schools reorganized and  re-established.    "The ruling (Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR) is  visibly the prisoner of extremist political forces. The  government's lack of political will to solve these problems  hampers the building of a climate of social peace, destabilizing  the Romanian society," says the UDMR lower house group statement.</p>

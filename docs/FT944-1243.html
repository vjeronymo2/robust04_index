			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Authorities look at Attwoods intervention The UK Takeover Panel has asked James Capel, the stockbrokers, for a full report on its involvement in a surprise bid earlier this month by a small Canadian company for Attwoods, the waste services operator. Capel's Canadian affiliate, BBN James Capel, acted as an adviser to Ontario-based Ikotek Waste Recycling Corporation, which appeared as a bidder for Attwoods less than five hours before an offer by Browning-Ferris Industries of Houston was due to expire. BBN James Capel, which is owned equally by its managers and James Capel, is understood to have breached the UK firm's internal procedures. The confusion and uncertainty created by Ikotek's bid severely embarrassed the UK firm, which was not immediately aware of its Toronto-based affiliate's involvement. The Canadian firm's two most senior executives, Mr John Stevens, president, and Mr David Anderson, corporate finance director, left abruptly last week. Capel has indicated that further internal repercussions are unlikely. Mr Tony Pullinger, the Panel's secretary, said yesterday that 'we're still interested in the matter, but haven't finished our deliberations.' Ikotek's motives remain unclear. One person with links to the company said yesterday that it was eager to find markets for a household waste-recycling system, for which it holds the North American licence. Both Attwoods and BFI have extensive waste-collection operations, which would be suitable outlets for the Ikotek system. The licence is held by Ikotek Europe, which is described as a group of 'engineering people and investors' with a small pilot plant in Switzerland. Ikotek is a privately owned company, which is part of a group controlled by Mr Helmut Sieber. Under Panel rules, the timetable for shareholders to decide on an offer is extended by 60 days if a competing bid appears. The Panel was unsure whether to take Ikotek's bid seriously. However, BFI won control of Attwoods within hours of Ikotek's intervention.</p>

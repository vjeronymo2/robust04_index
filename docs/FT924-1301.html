			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Westpac facing new uncertainty as MD is fired WESTPAC Banking Corp-oration, the troubled Australian bank, was yesterday facing further uncertainty after the board fired Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, after only 14 months in the job. Mr John Uhrig, who took over as chairman following an earlier board reshuffle in October, said a new managing director would be appointed from outside the bank within a month. Mr Uhrig said that Mr Conroy had resigned following agreement among directors that the bank's restructuring programme needed to be controlled by 'someone who comes fresh to the task'. This contrasts starkly with the strong support for Mr Conroy expressed by Mr Uhrig and the rest of the board when the bank's restructuring plan was announced last month. Yesterday's board meeting was the first attended by Mr Kerry Packer, the publishing entrepreneur, who acquired a 10 per cent stake in Westpac in November through Consolidated Press Holdings (ConsPress), his private company. Analysts said it was clear that Mr Conroy had refused to bow to pressure from Mr Packer and Mr Al Dunlap, ConsPress managing director, for bigger cuts in staffing and assets. Similar suggestions have been made by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, which owns 15 per cent of Westpac and also has two seats on the board. Westpac, once Australia's biggest bank, has faced growing problems over the last two years as a result of bad debts which culminated in a loss of ADollars 1.56bn (USDollars 1.07bn) for the year to the end of September. The bank was humiliated by the failure of a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue in October, which closed 72 per cent under-subscribed, leaving nearly 300m unwanted shares in the hands of sub-underwriters. Five directors resigned shortly after the rights issue debacle, including Sir Eric Neal, chairman. Mr Conroy's frank approach to the bank's problems appeared to have won the support of the markets, reflected in an improvement in the share price from a low of ADollars 2.39 in November to ADollars 3.03 on Wednesday. However, the shares rose 1 cent to ADollars 3.04 after the announcement of Mr Conroy's resignation, suggesting that investors share Mr Packer's view that restructuring could be accelerated. The programme announced by Mr Conroy included cutting costs and increasing revenue by ADollars 300m this year; cutting the expenses-to-income ratio from 70 per cent to 58 per cent over three years; and reducing corporate risk assets by ADollars 10bn by 1995. Westpac has confirmed that the cost-cutting programme could include a reduction of up to 60 per cent in head office staff. The bank is also reviewing its regional operations in the south Pacific and North America.</p>

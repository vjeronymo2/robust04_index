			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (1): Engines of growth slow down - The down-turn may be more than merely cyclical TWO of the world's youngest and healthiest industries, electronics and the aerospace and aviation sector, have reached a painful turning point. Last year there was a growing recognition that these industries have reached a moment which could change the course of their evolution and their role as engines of growth. The changes sweeping through these industries will profoundly affect the companies which make them up, the people who work within them, their customers and suppliers in the next few years. Their travails in 1992 will be set against the backdrop of slower economic growth, intensifying competition in older industries such as cars, and painful restructuring in steel and chemicals. Electronics and the aviation/aerospace industry have both enjoyed near permanent growth since their birth after World War Two. They have not suffered the cyclical swings in demand which have become common in older manufacturing industries established in the 1920s and 1930s such as chemicals, motor cars and electrical goods. In the past year, both electronics and aviation/aerospace have been hit by slower economic growth, in the wake of the Gulf War. But doubts about their health run deeper than the chill they have caught from the recession. Both industries face structural challenges which could sap their dynamism. In electronics, the doubts have been raised largely by success in generating new technology. Semi-conductor manufacturers used to a ready demand for their products are cutting production and investment because of doubts about the demand for their most sophisticated chips. The computer industry has been accustomed to growth rates of 20 per cent a year over the 30 years since its birth. In the past year it has come to a shuddering halt. The choices facing computer makers are daunting. The cost of backing a technology which proves unpopular is huge. But the costs of success - research on successive generations of hardware and software - are also huge, while margins earned on finished products are falling as computing power becomes an oversupplied commodity. Computer users who even five years ago might have been so dazzled by new technology have become more dubious about the benefits of information technology. Consumer electronics companies for years they have made money through incremental improvements to familiar products such as televisions and hi-fis. Now its growth prospects depend on technological leaps of faith into new products such as high-definition television. In aerospace and aviation the doubts are different. For the first time since World War Two, passenger traffic suffered a decline last year. Just as IBM, the heart of the old computer industry, is suffering heavily, so Pan American, the illustrious airline, disappeared last year. Just as significantly for aerospace manufacturers the end of the Cold War probably spells a permanent reduction in military funding for expensive aerospace programmes. Meanwhile, there is only one major new civil aircraft planned for this decade the Boeing 777. Around the world, engine and airframe makers are shedding labour as they adjust to this environment. More mature industries, such as cars, chemicals and steel are also beset by different degrees of difficulty. In steel, especially in the US and Europe, lower demand has exposed the fragility of the steel makers' recovery during the 1980s. The more stable chemical industry is cutting costs in a bout of restructuring which has highlighted the strength of pharmaceuticals. In the western car industry, the lumbering corporate giants such as General Motors are still reeling from mounting competition from Japan. None of the problems afflicting these industries will be eased by the economic climate in the next year. World growth in 1992 should be marginally stronger in the second half of the year. However, there are significant risks of a 'growth recession' in the OECD, with the US, UK and Australia taking longer than expected to recover just as Germany and Japan slow down. Painful structural change within vital industries combined with slower economic growth will make it more difficult to resolve some of the most pressing political issues which will set the framework for industry's development. Five political questions will be central. The Japanese economy has grown with its industries' exports largely protected by a political umbrella provided by US guardianship With tension growing over trade in US-Japanese relations, is the Japanese political class capable of ensuring the umbrella remains in place? The US presidential elections, with the economy still mired in recession, and the country increasingly troubled by its loss of competitiveness, will test the strength of protectionism. The next year may prove crucial in European economic integration, determining whether the single market programme succeeds or is overcome by mounting tensions over economic and monetary union. The health of the reunified German economy will be central to the rest of Europe. The economic disruption which will flow from the collapse of the Soviet Union could impose heavy direct costs upon east European economies as well as great uncertainty in the west. Perhaps the most important issue will be the outcome of the Gatt talks to further liberalise world trade. A liberal trading order, enforced by strengthened rules covering virtually all countries and almost all trade flows is within the world's grasp. However, the US is increasingly attracted to bilateral negotiations to manage trade. In the EC and Japan agricultural lobbies are still powerful. The significance of a failure to secure a Gatt deal would be huge. World trade has led the growth of output through each successive economy cycle since the 1960s, partly because of the gradual liberalisation of world trade. A failure at Gatt might put in doubt the role of world trade as an engine of world growth.</p>

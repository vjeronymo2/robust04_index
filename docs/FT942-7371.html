			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / MEPs 'should disclose interests' The European parliament's rules on disclosure of outside business interests by MEPs is 'totally inadequate', Ms Pauline Green, leader of Britain's Labour contingent at the Strasbourg assembly, said yesterday. Ms Green, who is campaigning for re-election in the London North seat in next month's poll, said the present system for registering MEPs' links in areas like consultancy needed to be tightened. Terming as 'extremely sparse' the information MEPs were obliged to give, she said, 'It is an inefficient system. I feel we should provide much more in-depth knowledge of members' interests.' She coupled her recommendation with a call for EU member states to intensify efforts to co-operate with the parliament. Speaking at a conference in London organised by the European Business Foundation, Ms Green said member governments were now recognising the increased importance of the parliament in the EU legislative process. 'There's a huge amount to be done in bringing that together.' Britain, in particular, had realised that working together with the parliament was essential to maximise influence over European legislation, Ms Green claimed, saying the UK government had 'suddenly become pro-active' in its relations with the assembly. Ms Green was speaking along with Sir Christopher Prout, the leader of the UK Conservatives in Strasbourg, and Sir Russell Johnston, the Liberal parliamentary spokesman on European affairs.</p>

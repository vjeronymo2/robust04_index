The  session examined and approved the work report delivered by Vice  Chairman Ye Xuanping on behalf of the Eighth National CPPCC  Committee Standing Committee, as well as the "Constitution of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  (Amendment)." It elected additional leading CPPCC National  Committee members. CPPCC members attended the Second Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress as non-voting delegates,  and heard and discussed Premier Li Peng's government work report  and other important reports. Displaying a highly responsible  spirit, they offered many excellent opinions and suggestions  regarding reform, opening up, modernization, and major issues  that affect the vital interests of the broad masses of people.  The session was democratic, realistic, united, and motivational.  <H5>  I. </H5>   During the past year, people of all nationalities throughout  the country seriously implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress; continued to advance along the course charted  by Comrade Deng Xiaoping for building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; and scored new and tremendous achievements in  reform, opening up, and modernization. During the past year,  the CPPCC accommodated the new situation, carried forward its  fine tradition, strengthened itself, and actively performed its  various functions, thereby making new progress in all fields of  work. CPPCC members earnestly studied Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; deepened their  understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; further enhanced their awareness and initiative  in fully implementing the basic line during the initial stage of  socialism; conducted special investigations and studies on major  issues regarding material and spiritual civilization; and scored  a number of significantly valuable achievements. They also made  great efforts to publicize and implement the principles of  "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems"; carried  out a great deal of useful work in promoting the great cause of  reunifying the motherland; actively fostered friendly contacts  with other countries; enhanced friendship and cooperation  between people in our country and in other parts of the world;  strengthened CPPCC organs; and enlivened the work of various  special committees under the CPPCC National Committee. Our work  commanded widespread attention in all social sectors and  generated extensive interest among people living abroad,  demonstrating the CPPCC's important status and unique  superiority in the country's political life. The work carried  out by the current term of the CPPCC got off to a good start,  laying the foundation for the work over the next four years.    This year is of vital importance to our country's reform,  opening up, and modernization. In his "government work report,"  Premier Li Peng explicitly expounded the principles and tasks  regarding this year's economic construction and the drive for  deepening reform. It should be noted that the completion of  these tasks is of paramount importance to fully implementing the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to  establishing a socialist market economic structure; to solving  deep contradictions in economic life; to maintaining sustained,  rapid, and healthy development in the national economy; to  maintaining political stability; and to promoting overall social  progress.    It should be noted that there are bound to be many problems  and difficulties in the course of accomplishing these tasks:  during the transition from an old economic structure to a new  one, new contradictions are frequently found intermingling with  old ones, and new advantages often come with new disadvantages;  the timing, intensity, and implementation of new reform measures  are often subject to various restraints; and it is usually  difficult to accurately anticipate what chain reaction  readjustment of the pattern of interest sharing will trigger.  It should also be noted that there are many favorable  conditions for the accomplishment of these tasks: Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics has been firmly established as our guidance; the  publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping has provided us a powerful ideological weapon;  thanks to reform, opening up, and the modernization drive in the  past decade or more, China's economic structure has undergone  profound changes and our overall economic strength and national  strength are growing at an unprecedented rate; a broad-based  consensus has taken shape among the people on the question of  establishing a socialist market economic system and our ability  to stand the impact of reform has improved markedly; leading  cadres at all levels have constantly intensified their  understanding of reform, development, and stability and their  experience in solving complex issues is growing by the day;  peace and development remain the two principal themes of the  present-day world and the international situation is, on the  whole, favorable to us. The overall task for the whole nation  this year is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up  wider, promote development, and maintain stability. Work in all  quarters and all sectors must be subordinated and serve this  overall task. The CPPCC must find its proper place in this  overall task, give full play to its strong points, and make even  greater contributions.  <H5>  II. </H5>   Developing socialist democracy is an important part of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is also a  common task for the CPC and various democratic parties, and  constitutes a prerequisite for stepping up China's economic  construction and restructuring. Without democracy, it would be  impossible to fully arouse people's initiative or realize  broad-based unity; and without democracy, there would be neither  socialism nor socialist modernization. It is provided in the  PRC constitution, the CPC constitution, and the constitutions of  the democratic parties that we must work hard to turn China into  a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and  modern socialist country. In his government work report,  Premier Li Peng pointed out we must build socialist democracy  and the legal system and called for making new progress in 1994  in this regard. The CPPCC represents a major organizational  form giving play to China's socialist democracy. Over the years,  it has accumulated useful experience in building democracy.  Under the new historical conditions, we must continue our  in-depth exploration, improve our work, and giving greater play  to our role.    As democracy is historical, specific and relative, it will  certainly be subject to restraints involving social, economic,  and political factors. Therefore, progress in democracy cannot  deviate from the reality or transcend historical stages.  Seeking democracy by neglecting specific conditions will not  only make it impossible to achieve the objective of developing  democracy, but also produce adverse effects on economic growth  and social stability. Democracy will certainly develop along  with the development of society. China is currently deepening  reforms and establishing a socialist market economic structure,  while the people are steadily improving their cultural standards  and enhancing their awareness of becoming involved and concepts  involving competition. Advancing socialist democracy in an  active but steady manner is not only required by the objective,  but is also realistically possible.    To study the current construction of democratic politics in  China, one must proceed from China's reality, based on the  objective reality of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and persist in being guided by the basic  principle of Marxism. There are two basic concepts in Marxist  historical materialism. One is the concept of productive  forces; another being the concept of the masses. The concept of  productive forces perceptively demonstrates that productive  forces are the ultimate and decisive factors in all social  development. The fundamental task of socialism is to liberate  and develop productive forces. Since the Third Plenary Session  of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we have, based on this  concept, conscientiously summed up historical experiences,  corrected the "left" mistake of "taking class struggle as the  key link," upheld the guiding principle of economic construction  as the central task, and taken the path of reform and opening  up, thus bringing about a fundamental change in our country's  outlook. The mass concept profoundly shows that the masses are  the creators of history, are the main bodies of practice and  cognition, and are the impetus of propelling the progress of  human society. This concept has not only decides on and  influences many tasks in contemporary China, but also has an  impact on our country's construction of democratic politics.  The Communist Party of China has made serving the people  wholeheartedly its ultimate purpose, the mass line of coming  from the people and returning among the people its fundamental  work line, and seeking interests for the masses in all  activities as its starting point and goal; herein lies the  actual operation of the mass concept in the party's activities.  The essence and contents of socialist democracy lie in helping  the masses become the masters of their country. The masses,  through diverse forms and channels, understand the country's  situation, take part in major state affairs, exercise the rights  of managing the country and social affairs, supervise ruling  party and government work personnel, and bring into play the  enthusiasm and initiative of building socialism. These are the  vivid reflections of the mass concept in the state's political  life. The mass concept is closely related to our country's  construction of democratic politics. Integrating the  construction of democratic politics with a Marxist world view,  with the ruling party's leadership method and work style, with  the government's various functions and work, and with the  masses' practical activities will endow a scientific and  theoretical basis and build a profound social foundation for our  country's construction of socialist democratic politics.  Carrying out the construction of democratic politics under the  guidance of the mass concept and embodying the mass concept in  the construction of democratic politics are not only the marked  characteristics and traditional advantages of our country's  democratic politics, but also the inevitable route and basic  method for developing our country's democratic politics.    To positively and steadfastly promote the construction of  socialist democratic politics, it is necessary to always persist  in doing everything for the masses and relying on the masses for  everything. We should try our best to detect the mood of the  masses; understand the wishes of the masses in a timely manner;  tirelessly do concrete work for the masses; be skillful at  pooling the masses' wisdom; fully respect the innovative spirit  of the masses; voluntarily accept the masses' supervision; and  in the course of forging close ties with the masses, foster a  democratic work style, enhance democratic consciousness, and  create and accumulate experiences for the construction of  democratic politics. It is necessary to integrate democratic  building with the building of a legal system; to confirm in a  systematic and legal manner the methods and experiences that are  socially accepted, that are of universal significance, and that  will help the masses become the masters of their country, so  that their rule will become the norm for social and political  life; to gradually establish a sound and relatively perfect  legal system, to realize the systematization and legalization of  democracy, so that this kind of system and law will not change  with the replacement of leaders, and will not change with the  change in leaders' views and focus; to help maintain the  sanctity and authority of the law and the legal system; to  enhance the awareness of the masses to protect their own rights  and interests according to the law; to put to an end acts that  infringe on the democratic rights of the masses; and to provide  the masses with a reliable guarantee so that they will enjoy  various democratic rights. The system of the people's congress,  the system of multiparty cooperation, and the system of  political consultation under the leadership of the Communist  Party are the major forms of our country's socialist democracy  which need to be further upheld in future practice, so that they  will be perfected and become more concrete and effective. At  the same time, we need to constantly establish and improve  various forms of democracy at grassroots levels along with the  development of the situation, so as to enable the masses to  better play their roles as the masters of their country in  social and political life at grassroots level. All in all, we  need to take the actual situation of our country into  consideration, absorb and borrow the results of the civilization  of human society, strive to build a kind of socialist democracy  with Chinese characteristics that inherits an excellent  tradition, that is enriched with the characteristics of the  times, that reflects the basic system of socialism, and that is  adapted to a socialist market economy.   <H5>    III. </H5>   The just-adopted CPPCC constitutional amendment bill has  included political participation and discussion as major  functions of the CPPCC. It is the general summing up of the  CPPCC work and the major achievement of the current session.    Political participation and discussion are in line with  political consultation and democratic supervision. The major  contents and basic characteristics of the CPPCC's political  participation and discussion are political consultation and  democratic supervision. Political participation and discussion,  however, should not be simply equated with political  consultation and democratic supervision, for they are the  expansion and extension of political consultation and democratic  supervision. Generally speaking, political consultation and  democratic supervision treat the state's and region's major  policies, principles, and issues as major topics; make various  levels of leading organs their specific objects of  consideration; and adopt the holding of meetings as a major  concern. Political consultation and democratic supervision  proceed in accordance with certain procedures and rules. As for  political participation and discussion, they are not completely  restricted by the aforementioned conditions; they are more  extensive as far as objects are concerned, are richer in  content, more diverse in form, and more flexible in their  methods. Incorporating political participation and discussion  into the CPPCC's major functions will increase and widen the  channels and spheres of CPPCC work, provide more opportunities  for CPPCC members to come into contact with people from various  circles and to give play to their special skills, and create  excellent conditions for all levels of CPPCC organs to  effectively organize political consultation and democratic  supervision, to select topics for discussion, to collect of  information, to accumulate materials, and to organize personnel.    All levels of CPPCC organizations and CPPCC members are  urged  to rally closely around the central task of economic  construction, and in the course of establishing a socialist  market economic system and integrating their respective  realities, carry out the work of political participation and  discussion in a vivid and effective manner. It is necessary to  establish and improve various systems of concrete work in line  with relevant stipulations of CPPCC constitution, so as to make  CPPCC's meeting system, inspection system, motion system,  special committee activities system, and contacts committee  better able to adapt to the demands of political participation  and discussion. To enable political participation and  discussion activities to proceed in an organized manner, topics  which are of concern to the masses, which receive party and  government departments' attention, and which CPPCC organizations  are able to handle should be selected and plans should be worked  out for discussion. Improvements should be made in existing  forms of political participation and discussion, and new forms  of political participation and discussion should be created so  that political participation and discussion activities will  become more flexible and diverse, and so that the enthusiasm of  CPPCC members will be given better play. The formation of  special committees should be strengthened. Closer contacts with  relevant departments, democratic parties, and social groups  should be promoted so as to further give play to their basic  roles in political participation and discussion. It is necessary  to fully bring into play the CPPCC's advantage in possessing a  vast pool of talent; and to make good use of the CPPCC's  advantageous conditions of both maintaining close ties with  various social circles and with the CPC Central Committee to  reflect the mood and will of the masses and to advance opinions  and suggestions. Work styles and work efficiency at organs must  be improved and raised so as to better serve CPPCC members and  to foster political participation and discussion. It is my  belief that with successful experience in CPPCC work in the  past, with the common efforts of all members, and with great  support from various social circles, we should and we can raise  the work of the CPPCC's political participation and discussion  to a new level.    Members and comrades:    A stable and harmonious social situation is the common goal  of all people of all nationalities, and is also an important  reason for seeking benefits for the people and the necessary  conditions for doing a good job in all spheres of work. The  CPPCC is the most extensive of all the patriotic united front  organizations, which should and can give play to its unique role  of consolidating and developing a stable and harmonious  situation.    The great spirit of unity and struggle is one of the  excellent traditions of the Chinese people, which is a powerful  impetus for the Chinese nation to score glorious achievements  after having gone through all kinds of hardships and  difficulties, and is our basic guarantee to accomplish the  historical mission of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The CPPCC is the symbol of great unity, which  should and can make outstanding contributions to maintaining and  carrying forward the spirit of unity and struggle.    Let us rally around the leadership of the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core and raise high  the banner of great unity. Let us be united and work in a  down-to-earth manner. Let us be united to overcome difficulties.  Let us be united to win new and greater victories!    I hereby declare: The Second Session of the Eighth National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference closes in victory!</p>

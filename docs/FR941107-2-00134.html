			<p><!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Objectives.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> NRC is seeking to expand its knowledge of the medical specialty of radiation oncology. Specifically, the therapeutic uses of radioisotopes in brachytherapy patient procedures. Recently, significant misadministrations have occurred involving errors in the delivery of the prescribed radiation dose to the patient during either manual or remote afterloading brachytherapy procedures. As a result of evaluating the circumstances surrounding these events, NRC has identified the need to re-evaluate certain aspects of its regulatory program to determine whether modifications are indicated. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRC intends to keep abreast of this technology and future developments in the therapeutic uses of radioisotopes and believes that such a Fellow, with expertise in these uses, can assist NRC staff in meeting this goal. The program is open to physicians interested in seeking an appointment for individual sabbatical pursuits. Other radiation specialists on sabbatical, or those who wish to engage in post-doctoral research, will also be considered. Individuals participating as Fellows would join NRC for approximately one year, to undertake activities consistent with the interests and needs of NRC and with the individual's training and experience; and that will result in a clearly defined assignment useful to NRC's regulatory program. Ideally, each Fellow would be available to NRC on a full-time basis; however, NRC will consider nominees who are available only on a part-time basis. Additionally, the number of appointments made will depend on the range of skills embodied in the nominations, individuals' interests and needs of NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to a specific assignment, or research project, it is anticipated that the Fellow would attend meetings of NRC's Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes (ACMUI); Federal, State, and local agencies; professional organizations; and groups, to participate in discussions on issues related to medical affairs and the use of radiation in medicine. The selectee may also participate in public meetings and seminars sponsored by NRC for exchanging information and discussing issues, of mutual interest, that will benefit the regulation of medical practice. A collateral goal is to create a cadre of individuals with experience in the regulation of medical use of isotopes; therefore, it is likely that former Fellows may be asked to participate, from time to time, in NRC-sponsored meetings and seminars after their appointment ends, to provide advice and consultation about the regulated program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, NRC is primarily soliciting nominations of physicians involved with the medical use of radioisotopes, but will be pleased to receive nominations of other radiation health professionals and medical radiation specialists to serve as Fellows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Appointment Method.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appointments will be made by means of Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignment, reimbursable detail, or professional term appointment, depending on the selectee's situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Term of Appointment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term of appointment will be approximately one year.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the Socialist Workers' Party of </F> Luxembourg: "LSAP/CFGP Meeting -- Toward an Efficient Civil  Service"]    [Text] A delegation of the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party  of Luxembourg] (comprising Deputy Prime Minister J.F. Poos,  Party Chairman B. Fayot, Group Chairman J. Asselborn,  Representative M. Zanussi, R. Hencks, and Group Secretary O.  Mores) met with representatives of the CGFP [General  Confederation of the Civil Service, the national association of  government-employed people] (namely, First Deputy President P.  Trausch, General Secretary J. Daleiden, and Financial  Administrator F. Haas) on 25 May.    The main topics discussed, with a view to the LSAP election  platform and the ideas of the CGFP program, were the role of the  civil service in a modern state, the possible introduction of  hospital insurance, the future orientation of pension systems,  the 1991 tax reform, the latest tripartite measures, and the  process of European integration.    The LSAP and the CGFP are convinced there is no alternative  to the existing system of civil servants. In the future, on the  basis of a transparent recruitment and pay policy, these civil  servants should strive to achieve the highest level of  competence, efficiency, and effectiveness. In this context, the  LSAP expressly called for the preservation of civil servant  status.    In addition, the two delegations discussed the recently  adopted tripartite measures aimed at fighting unemployment and  inflation. The LSAP and CGFP regard the Luxembourg indexation  system as a tried and tested instrument for conserving  purchasing power and an important contribution toward  guaranteeing social peace. The instrument in question must  therefore be fully safeguarded.    As regards European policy, both delegations emphasized the  need for a democratic and social Europe. Moreover, they said  that European integration would have to be improved, in  compliance with Luxembourg's interests and national  peculiarities; that enlargement of the European Union would have  to proceed in a well-thought-out manner; and that preparations  for the intergovernmental conference scheduled for 1996 should  include all the relevant forces involved.</p>

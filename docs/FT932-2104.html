			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Nigerian poll disarray grows THE democratic process in Nigeria slid further into confusion during a weekend of indecision by the military government, which has allowed a legal technicality to suppress the results of presidential elections held on June 12. With 10 years of military rule due to end on August 27, Nigeria's transition to democracy is in disarray. More than a week after one of Nigeria's fairest general elections, the country has a self-proclaimed winner, an unconfirmed loser, a commission put in charge by the president which seems to have no power, and high court judges in three states passing conflicting rulings on a process outside their jurisdiction. According to state radio at the weekend, President Ibrahim Babangida told Mr Iyorchia Ayu, head of the senate, that he still wanted the elections concluded, if the process was within the rule of law. Most voters are unconvinced by this statement and there were signs yesterday that the government lacked the support of most of the military hierarchy and senior civilian politicians for its faltering stance on these elections. A presidential decree in April gave the National Electoral Commission (NEC) a free hand to conduct the elections and publish the results by yesterday at the latest, and to consider any malpractice claims. With no direct public statement from the president since before the elections, and no word from the head of the NEC, Professor Humphrey Nwosu, since the middle of last week, it is not clear how the government intends to resolve the crisis. A prominent lawyer, Mr Gani Fawehinmi, said last week the 'military government is leading Nigeria into an immeasurable political crisis which can only be averted if the results are declared by June 20', failing which the results become invalid. Mr Wole Soyinka, winner of a Nobel prize for literature, said a 'tiny but powerful cabal is toying with the future of our nation. Any further delay in making the people's verdict official is a deliberate cultivation of chaos'. Mr Moshood Abiola, candidate of the Social Democratic Party, has declared himself the winner, after an unofficial announcement of the results by a leading democracy campaigner, Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, on Friday. The opposing candidate, Mr Bashir Othman Tofa, has stayed quiet and not challenged the outcome. The British government on Friday issued a statement 'regretting that a court order was restraining the release of the official results. 'This has inevitably raised questions about whether the transition to civilian rule by August 27 will proceed. All the reports we have received from observers on the ground suggest that the elections were peaceful, orderly and gave Nigerians a full opportunity to express their views.'</p>

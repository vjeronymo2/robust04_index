			<p>BFN     [Text] Toshiyuki Takano, councilor with the North American  Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], called  on Okinawa Prefectural Governor Ota on 4 April. During the  meeting, Mr. Takano promised that the Foreign Ministry will do  its best to resolve problems arising from the U.S. military  bases on Okinawa.    The Foreign Ministry official is in Okinawa to tour U.S.  military bases, and an F-15 Eagle fighter crashed during his  stay in the island. It is said that during his meeting with  Donald R. Gardner, commander of U.S. Forces Okinawa, at Camp  Courtney, he asked the commander to conduct a "thorough  investigation into the cause of the crash and take thorough  measures to prevent a recurrence of such a crash." In response,  the commander said, "I understand."    During the meeting with Mr. Takano, Okinawa Prefectural  Governor Ota said: "The Okinawans are increasingly reacting  against intensifying live-fire exercises and flight training by  U.S. Forces on Okinawa. The presence of Naha Military Port  stands in the way of developing the free trade zone. Under this  situation, the crash occurred and I have difficulty dealing with  problems, including the crash accident, arising from the U.S.  military bases in Okinawa."    In response, Mr. Takano said, "The Foreign Ministry will do  its best to smoothly resolve problems arising from the U.S.  military bases on Okinawa."</p>

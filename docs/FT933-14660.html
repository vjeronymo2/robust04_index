			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Mensucat Santral suspended MENSUCAT Santral, one of Turkey's leading textile companies, and its listed affiliates, have been suspended from trading on the Istanbul exchange, after the parent company applied to the courts for protection from its creditors which are owed an estimated TL2,200bn (Dollars 213m). The company is controlled by the Bezmen family. Last week the group sought a court-arranged agreement with its creditors, to allow it to restructure its debts with some 23 banks, which are owed about TL1,500bn. The creditors list includes the foreign banks, UBS, Standard Chartered, Bankers' Trust and West Deutsche Landes Bank. However, the banks most exposed are those of the local Cukurova industrial conglomerate - Interbank, Pamukbank and Yapi Kredi which are owed TL600bn. The court has to make a decision within 10 days. If banks refuse to agree a restructuring, the company will be forced into bankruptcy. Bankers say a final settlement may take up to six months. The company has to show it has a positive net worth and that its assets are greater than its liabilities. Furthermore, two thirds of the creditors have to agree the planned restructuring. Yesterday, Mr Halil Bezmen, chairman and controlling shareholder, was referring all enquiries to his lawyers. Mensucat is one of the leading producers of textiles, Turkey's largest export item, earning more than Dollars 4bn a year. Mr Bezmen, was described yesterday by a foreign consultant as one of the best textile magnates in the Mediterranean. However, the group is undercapitalised and over the past two years has become over extended with a Dollars 120m investment programme coupled with moves to diversify into copper and chemicals businesses. Rabak, the copper business, has been particularly badly hit by the world slump in copper prices. Mensucat Santral, the cotton textile arm, made a loss of TL38bn in 1992 on turnover of about TL1,000bn. Rabak reported a TL25bn loss over the same period. Last week, the exchange suspended shares of Santral Holding, Mensucat Santral, Rabak and the chemicals operation Koruma while awaiting further clarification from the company. The market was earlier alerted to problems after the company had failed to present year-end figures for 1992.</p>

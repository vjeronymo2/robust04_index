			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: Schemes for job creation are ready GOVERNOR Bill Clinton has plans ready to meet members of the new Congress as early as possible, in order to present a job-creation package soon after his presidential inauguration on January 20, writes Nancy Dunne. The jobs plan would send 'a strong signal' to the financial markets of Mr Clinton's commitment to reduce the huge US budget deficit, according to Mr Gene Sperling, his campaign economic policy director. Speaking in Little Rock, he said Mr Clinton would seek immediate congressional passage of the two components of his economic plans which he believed would be most effective in creating jobs: a Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.2bn) infrastructure programme and an investment tax credit for business. This would be aimed at giving a quick lift to employment in public and private sectors. 'He will probably draw criticism because he does not want to rely on deficit spending,' Mr Sperling said. 'He feels he has to draw a balance between getting the economy going and the need to send a strong signal that he is committed to reducing the deficit.' The governor would be focusing on a shift from consumption to investment spending, Mr Sperling said. The idea was to halt the depletion of tax revenues created by the recession, as the government collects less in taxes and pays out more for social programmes. Mr Clinton's promised tax cut for the middle class was not an immediate priority. It was a 'fairness issue' to compensate the middle class for the higher taxes it had begun to pay in the 1980s, according to the Clinton camp. Mr Sperling said it was possible the Clinton economic team would be able to devise a plan to implement the tax cuts 'to provide some stimulation, but mostly we want an investment-led recovery'. A Clinton administration would move on its economic programme swiftly, he said. 'Every week, every month, counts when people are out of work,' declared Mr Sperling. 'George Bush never acted like there was a domestic crisis. People saw his energy for only one month during the Gulf war. The rest of the time they never had a feeling that he thought that their health care, their jobs, the economy, the education of their children were really that important.' He said President Bush had given the impression the US had been caught up in a global recession, when it had really gone into recession earlier. Talks under way in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were 'a high priority' for Mr Clinton'.</p>

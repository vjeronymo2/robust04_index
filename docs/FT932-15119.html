			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: New tax break for lump-sum payments - Company Cars A NEW tax deduction is to be introduced for employees who make 'lump-sum' payments to the initial expenditure on their company cars, the government announced yesterday. The government is also prepared to consider suggestions for other detailed changes to the proposed company car tax reforms announced in the Budget, the Inland Revenue said yesterday. Any further changes must be aimed at achieving the objective of 'a fair and efficient tax charge on company cars'. The present system of company car taxation is to be significantly overhauled with the introduction of a new scheme from April 1994. The chancellor said in the Budget that the new system was intended to make the tax charged on company cars a more fair measure of the benefit people received. The new system should eliminate distortions in the new car market and encourage the use of more fuel-efficient cars. The present broad scale of charges will be replaced by a new measure of the benefit of a car for private use, based on a charge equivalent to 35 per cent of the list price of the car. There will be a discount of a third if the employee drives more than 2,500 business miles in a year, or two thirds if the employee drives 18,000 or more business miles. The most significant further change announced yesterday in the Finance Bill makes provision for employees who contribute capital sums to the initial expenditure on their company cars - for example in order to have particular accessories added to their cars. The bill defines the the list price of a car as 'the price for the car published by the manufacturer, distributor or importer of the car, when the car was first registered, including VAT and any other relevant tax and any delivery charge; plus the price for any optional accessories provided with the car when it was first made available to the employee'.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Management: When patience is the best policy - Mental illness costs British business billions each year. Robert Milburn offers advice for employers Sane, the mental health charity, estimates that one in 10 people in Britain will suffer from mental illness at some time in their life. The cost of treating them - Pounds 3.15bn in 1991 - falls largely on the National Health Service. But the financial consequences for employers cannot be ignored. According to the Independent Healthcare Association, mental illness costs British businesses Pounds 3.76bn each year in lost working days. Employers - many of whom offer counselling - are already aware that stress can adversely affect productivity. The Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital in London has set up Work Stress for those suffering psychological problems. Employers pay for staff to use the service which also provides confidential interviews with accredited clinical psychologists. Few companies, however, have a strategy for dealing with mentally ill employees. The problem is that mental illness, particularly in the early stages, is often hard to identify. Many of the early symptoms of mental problems may be similar to those of stress, such as an inability to concentrate or make decisions. But whereas stress can often be alleviated by relaxation techniques or better organisation, mental problems tend to be more acute and take longer to overcome. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane, emphasises the need to look out for the danger signs. 'Lots of studies show that if you catch someone early enough, before they deteriorate, they stabilise and don't become seriously ill, saving the community a lot of money.' Often, employers are aware that there is something wrong, but provided the employee's work is satisfactory, prefer not to pry. After all, there may be a perfectly understandable reason, such as marital problems. However, should the sufferer break down and become unable to work, companies are forced to take action. This often takes the form of long-term sick leave or dismissal, particularly if an employee is acting bizarrely or admits to feeling suicidal. It is vital, however, that managers remain calm. When told by a sales representative that he felt suicidal, one manager expressed her fear that he might kill himself while visiting a client. She then warned him that she had informed the directors about his state of mind, and that they were questioning his fitness to do the job. What this man needed was reassurance of the company's support, not a verbal warning. Managers should liaise with the employee's family and doctors to devise a strategy for coping in the short-term. For instance, the doctor might advise that sick leave would be counter-productive. There might be a need for an initial absence from work, but forcing a distressed person to spend a prolonged period at home with nothing to do could make them more depressed. Sane has begun a campaign in London which will eventually go to the rest of the country, recruiting Helpline volunteers from big companies. They will then be able to help colleagues at work. The Saneline number has been advertised in BT, Unilever and National Power's staff publications. Sane has also been campaigning to change misconceptions about mental illness. 'Employers need to accept that mental illness is containable and treatable,' Wallace says. Ultimately, she wants employers to accept mental illnesses as they do other physical illnesses or disabilities. A Sane representative said that in the past two years he had only come across one example of a company being supportive to staff suffering from mental illness. 'It is easy to see the employers' point of view. If they are laying off healthy employees because of the recession, why should they give preferential treatment to someone who may be a liability?' The potential for damage to a company's image and revenues from a mentally-ill employee in a responsible position is obvious. However, from a business viewpoint, sacking a mentally ill employee can be counter-productive. Take the example of the manager who had a good track record, but then suffered a breakdown and began acting oddly at work. His employer's patience rapidly wore out. The company used the excuse of a decline in sales to make him redundant, and then sold the product range he was responsible for to a competitor. However, any quick profits it had hoped to make evaporated because the other firm changed its mind. The manager's dismissal led to a loss of customer confidence and goodwill, and it took 18 months to find another buyer at a reduced price. Mental illness can have many causes, but environmental factors play an important role. For instance, conflict with other employees, unreasonable targets or aggressive superiors can put vulnerable employees under stress. If these problems are not remedied, other employees can also become ill. Many mental illnesses have a natural course and eventually disappear. Even schizophrenia may not necessarily be a life sentence. If companies see the wisdom of allowing people with physical conditions such as cancer or broken limbs time off to recuperate, why should they be prejudiced against the mentally ill?

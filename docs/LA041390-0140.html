			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEACH CITY POLICE SEE EASY EASTER;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY: SPRING BREAK HEADS FOR ITS WEEKEND FINALE, WITH SUNSHINE FORECAST. BUT  AUTHORITIES EXPECT TO BE MORE BUSY WITH CROWDS THAN WITH YOUTH ROWDINESS.  </P> <P> It's not as hectic as Thanksgiving, and it's nowhere near as rowdy as the  Fourth of July or Labor Day weekends.  </P> <P> But with teen-agers running loose on spring break and tens of thousands of sun  worshipers expected to descend on area beaches, Easter weekend still figures to  be busy enough to provide some headaches for Orange County law enforcement  agencies.  </P> <P> Some beach cities are gearing for the crowds: Police in Newport Beach tonight  plan to continue manning barricades against nighttime cruising on the Balboa  Peninsula; police in Huntington Beach today are scheduled to start the city's  first-ever mounted patrols.  </P> <P> Some inland areas will be no less active on Easter Sunday, with about 20,000  people expected to crowd into all-day services at the Crystal Cathedral in  Garden Grove and summer-like crowds predicted at both Disneyland and Knott's  Berry Farm.  </P> <P> Smaller crowds are expected at parks throughout the area for annual Easter egg  hunts, some of which are so popular that they are already booked up. Judging  from brisk candy sales this week, scores of children will also be opening  Easter baskets and unwrapping chocolate bunnies.  </P> <P> "I can't even talk to you right now because I'm so swamped," Pat Pardoen, owner  of the Chocolate Florist in Irvine, said Thursday as 20 people waited in her  shop for assistance.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials said they are not anticipating the kinds of serious  traffic problems that typically occur during longer three- and four-day holiday  weekends.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol, consequently, is planning no extra staffing and  no special patrols, California Highway Patrol spokesman Ken Daily said in San  Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> The only possible congestion problem, Daily added, might come Sunday night,  with motorists returning from the beaches.  </P> <P> Traffic tie-ups are also likely at John Wayne Airport because of construction  planned at the Michelson Drive main entrance today and Saturday. Christine  Edwards, airport director of operations, said that while air traffic is  generally higher than normal during Easter weekend, it is not enough to justify  delaying construction.  </P> <P> Traffic could also be troublesome in the immediate vicinity of such places as  the Crystal Cathedral, where a church spokeswoman said more than 3,000 people  are expected to crowd into each of the six services planned Easter Sunday. The  Rev. Robert H. Schuller, senior pastor of the cathedral, will be preaching at  the first five services.  </P> <P> Another 10,000 people are expected to attend "Easter in the Meadows," a concert  and Easter program Sunday morning at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Irvine.  A heavy traffic backup is anticipated on Lake Forest Avenue leading to the  amphitheater.  </P> <P> The biggest crowds, though, will most likely be at the beaches. The National  Weather Service forecast calls for highs in the 80s inland and 60s along the  coast through Sunday.  </P> <P> H high temperatures Thursday were 63 in Newport Beach, 79 in El Toro, 78 in  Santa Ana and 76 in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> "This is a big weekend," said Cheryl Ryan, managing director of the Laguna  Beach Chamber of Commerce. "There will definitely be more people, and the  beaches will be packed and the volleyball courts filled."  </P> <P> On Thursday, as spring break week neared an end, thousands of students,  families and tourists gathered their towels, tanning lotions and bathing suits  and flocked to county shores.  </P> <P> Despite overcast skies along much of the county coast, large crowds were  reported at many local beaches.  </P> <P> Traffic into Laguna Beach was backed up on Coast Highway past Emerald Bay.  Lifeguards in Newport Beach reported about 60,000 people. Another 10,000 people  flocked to Huntington State Beach. Crowds are expected to grow as the holiday  nears, lifeguards said.  </P> <P> In Newport Beach, lifeguard Pete Bryan said the beaches have not been as busy  as in the last few spring breaks.  </P> <P> "Normally, Easter break is real crowded," Bryan said from his tower overlooking  the shore. "This year it's not as crowded. The weather is cold, the water is  also cold. The stepped-up police in the area are keeping better control. That,  in addition to the water temperature and the weather, is keeping a lot of  people away."  </P> <P> Brick Ashcraft and Jill Daucher, both 18, said they left their homes in Brea to  stay with friends in Newport Beach for the week. To enjoy their spring break,  the two have been on the beach all week to relax and work on their tans.  </P> <P> Ashcraft, a student at Fullerton College, said he has enjoyed the crowd: "It's  been pretty good. At night it's fun. A lot more people come down, and there are  more parties."  </P> <P> Four teen-age girls from Costa Mesa -- Carrie Neuber, Griselda Sandoval and  sisters Heather and Lisa Arensdorf -- said they have been going to the beach  every day during their days off from school this week. Asked why, they answered  in unison: "Because of the guys."  </P> <P> "We met seven on Tuesday night and stayed until 11:30," said Carrie, 13.  </P> <P> "I got grounded for coming home past 10 p.m. but that's about it," added Lisa,  13. "It's worth it."  </P> <P> Newport Beach resident Blake Steelgrave, whose home fronts on the beach, said  he does not mind the extra traffic Easter week. For him it means a better  economy for the city -- and new friends.  </P> <P> "You meet new girls," Steelgrave said as he played with his Doberman pinscher,  Augie.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: SHEARSON'S LANE QUITS FOLLOWING REALIGNMENT  </P> <P> Jeffrey B. Lane, recently removed as president and chief operating officer of  Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., has resigned from the securities firm.  </P> <P> Lane said he left because he was no longer effective as a result of a  realignment of the firm's senior management.  </P> <P> "If you're not happy and not enthusiastic, you can't be effective," Lane said,  explaining why he left Shearson after 20 years with the brokerage.  </P> <P> Before the shake-up in November, Lane had been the No. 2 executive after  Chairman Peter Cohen. Cohen could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Lane's resignation from Shearson -- which was effective Friday but revealed  only after the holiday weekend -- was surprising only in its timing, industry  observers said.  </P> <P> "The only surprise to me was that he left as quickly as he did," said Perrin  Long of Lipper Analytical Services.  </P></p>

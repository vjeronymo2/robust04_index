			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Return to profit seen by Saab Automobile Saab Automobile expects to make its first profit for six years in 1994 after cutting losses sharply in the first quarter. The company, which is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, yesterday said it made a net loss of SKr74m (Dollars 9.3m) for the period, down 55 per cent on last year's SKr166m deficit. The improvement has been driven by improving markets, cost-cutting, and the success of the company's new Saab 900 model. However, debt-servicing costs are one of the factors keeping the company in the red. Saab sold 21,800 cars during the quarter, up 24 per cent on the same period in 1993 when 17,600 cars were sold. This year's figure included 11,900 new Saab 900 cars, although it is still only available in a five-door version. The new 900 together with rising demand in the company's main Swedish, US and UK markets has helped the group to reverse a falling sales trend. It has recently upgraded its sales target for 1994 to more than 90,000 cars, compared with sales of 73,600 last year. Break-even is estimated at 83,000 cars. In spite of the improved sales trend, revenues for the quarter were static at SKr3.99bn. The company said this reflected the change in model and specification mix since last year. The group is expecting to make strong headway during the rest of the year when the 900 coupe model is introduced in the Asian Pacific and Australian markets and the cabriolet version is launched worldwide. However, it declined to say if it would return to profit in the second quarter. The company has swallowed more than SKr8bn in new capital from its owners and accumulated losses of more than SKr11bn since General Motors bought into the group in 1989. Last year losses were halved to SKr1.37bn.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sindall in red after provisions For the third year in succession William Sindall, the builder, civil engineer and property developer, had to provide for exceptional charges. That forced it into a loss of Pounds 4.19m for 1991, from a profit of Pounds 1.69m. The final dividend is omitted, leaving the total at 1.5p, against 6p. Mr John Mott, chairman, said the exceptional charges reflected 'the continuing ravages' of the prolonged recession on asset values and work prospects. This time they amounted to Pounds 5m (Pounds 1.25m) and comprised redundancy and closure costs totalling Pounds 517,000, and a write-down of the carrying value of housing and developments to Pounds 4.67m. Turnover fell to Pounds 64m (Pounds 85.5m) and operating profit to Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 4.48m). Rental income held up better than forecast, at Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 1.38m). Losses per share were 64.5p (earnings 14.37p).</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> ITSALLGREEKTOME MAKES ECLIPSE BID  </P> <P> Nine months ago, it would have been almost impossible to imagine  Itsallgreektome and Eclipse Award in the same sentence.  </P> <P> The son of Sovereign Dancer was fourth in his first three starts of the year,  running his career record to four defeats in five outings. Shortly thereafter,  the gray horse was gelded, found turf to his liking and proceeded to make quite  a name for himself.  </P> <P> Never worse than third in eight races on grass, Itsallgreektome will become a  strong Eclipse contender as the nation's top turf performer if he wins the  $500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup Sunday at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> In a division without a star, trainer Wallace Dollase's 3-year-old has to be  admired for his consistency. He came within a neck of beating Royal Academy in  the Breeders' Cup Mile at 37-1.  </P> <P> Although Itsallgreektome has done most of his winning at Hollywood Park, he has  performed well elsewhere, and a victory Sunday would push his 1990 earnings to  $898,925.  </P> <P> Should he come up with a happy ending in the 1 1/2-mile Turf Cup, Dollase won't  be holding his breath waiting for an Eclipse. He calls With Approval, the  Breeders' Cup Turf and Arlington Million runner-up, the front-runner, citing  his hefty turf bankroll and the fact he is based in the East.  </P> <P> If the Eclipse indeed goes elsewhere, there won't be any bitterness on  Dollase's part. He's had plenty of enjoyment watching Itsallgreektome win,  place or show in eight straight stakes.  </P> <P> Whether the gelding can make it nine in a row remains to be seen, but there's  no denying his love for Hollywood Park's turf. He has won the Spotlight, Will  Rogers and Hollywood Derby locally, and in his only other appearance was third,  beaten by a length in the Cinema Handicap.  </P> <P> The Turf Cup will mark his first try at 1 1/2 miles, and with his  come-from-behind style, he will need some luck to work his way through the huge  field. Fifteen horses were entered Friday morning, with 14 being allowed to  start.  </P> <P> "Everything's a go," Dollase said. "He's real good. He's the same as he always  is. He loves this course and he's very relaxed over it.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure about the 1 1/2 miles, but he trains like he'll be able to handle  it. (The distance) is the question mark, and there's so much luck involved in a  field of this size."  </P> <P> Another concern for Dollase is the distinct possibility of a very slow pace.  "He does have a bad habit of slowing up as soon as he gets to the lead," the  trainer said. "You have to time his move just right.  </P> <P> "In the Ascot Handicap (on Sept. 22 at Bay Meadows), they went a half-mile in  48 (seconds), and he wanted to gallop over the top of them. Fly Till Dawn is  going to try and go as slow as he can."  </P> <P> Like Itsallgreektome, Fly Till Dawn had only one victory entering 1990, but if  he succeeds Sunday, an Eclipse case could also be made for him. The Turf Cup  would be his third Grade I victory this year, following upsets in the Eddie  Read Handicap at Del Mar and the Budweiser International on Oct. 21 at Laurel.  </P> <P> However, the field the 4-year-old Swing Till Dawn colt beat in the  International was suspect -- the race occurred six days before the Breeders'  Cup.  </P> <P> Fly Till Dawn also has never tried 1 1/2 miles but has run well at Hollywood  Park. He has only won once in four tries, but two of his defeats were by a neck  and a head.  </P> <P> Rial is proven at the distance, having won the Oak Tree Invitational on Oct. 6,  and trainer Pico Perdomo said his disastrous effort in the Dec. 1 Native Diver  Handicap can be dismissed. The 5-year-old Family Crest horse finished last in  the main-track race.  </P> <P> "We ran in the Native Diver for two reasons," Perdomo said -- to find out if  Rial really likes the dirt and to give him a race to get ready for the Turf  Cup. He worked well (1:01 flat Tuesday), and Jose (Santos) said he feels the  horse will be much better this time."  </P> <P> The other prime contenders in the race include Silver Ending, who was fifth in  the Hollywood Derby; Eradicate, the runner-up in the Oak Tree Invitational who  worked a mile on the turf in 1:36 3/5 last Sunday; Live the Dream, and Silver  Medallion. The rest of the field is Hodges Bay, Vaguely Hidden, Double Wedge,  Nediym, Mashkour, Athenia Green, Missionary Ridge and also-eligible Big  Warning.  </P> <P> Defending champion Summer Sale is one of 11 horses entered in today's $84,950  Hollywood Turf Express Handicap.  </P> <P> After holding off Ofanto and Oraibi in last year's Express, Summer Sale was  winless until he beat One Drink by a nose in the Rich Cream Handicap on Nov.  12. He has a series of fast workouts at Golden Gate Fields since the race and  will again be ridden by Alex Solis.  </P> <P> Although able to get to the lead without any pressure in the Rich Cream, Summer  Sale won't have such a luxury today because of the presence of Valiant Pete.  Upset winner of the California Cup Sprint, Valiant Pete ran 43 1/5 seconds for  the half-mile that day, then held on to beat Sensational Star by a half-length.  A 4-year-old son of The Irish Lord, he has a victory and a third place in three  starts on the turf.  </P> <P> Also set to go the six furlongs are Answer Do, Yes I'm Blue, Earn Your Stripes,  Waterscape, All of Me, One Drink, Roman Avie, Sam Who and Despatch.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> One of the most-improved horses around is Blaze O'Brien. The 3-year-old Interco  gelding won his third straight race Friday, outfinishing River Warden under  Gary Stevens in a swift 1:39 4/5 for the 1 1/16 miles on the turf. He is  trained by Julio Canani and owned by Barry and Susan Isaacs, who campaigned  Irish O'Brien, Blaze O'Brien's dam.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT GOES UP CAN'T COME DOWN IN MONTREAL  </P> <P> We arrived here without reservations, a spur-of-the-moment side trip during a  vacation in Maine.  </P> <P> Picking out Rue St. Denis on a city map as central to some of our explorations,  we turned north from Rue Sherbrooke into a world of students and sidewalk  cafes.  </P> <P> But no motels.  </P> <P> Restaurants and shops gave way to three-story residences, snuggled close a la  San Francisco.  </P> <P> It was getting late and we parked to study the map again. No sooner had we done  so but a man walking toward us on the sidewalk paused and asked, "Are you  lost?"  </P> <P> We responded instinctively to this friendly native, but a black cat he was  carrying got restless and he said, "Wait, I'll put her in the house."  </P> <P> Heading for a nearby building, the man began to climb an outside stairway that  rose steeply from the sidewalk to a balcony on the second floor, where he  disappeared.  </P> <P> We noticed that the wrought-iron railings of stairways and balconies were  echoed in a balcony on the third floor that seemed isolated without any  continuing stairs.  </P> <P> Then we realized that, up and down the street, the stairways were repeated in a  variety of styles but at the same precarious angle and with the same detached  balconies.  </P> <P> When our new-found friend returned, he insisted on spreading out our map on the  sidewalk, and we squatted with him to locate nearby motels.  </P> <P> In the ensuing days, Kest Morgan took the time to guide us to some of his  favorite haunts in a city he can't resist, although he is an American who has  lived in various parts of the States.  </P> <P> "It's the joie de vivre here," he said, his bilingual proclivities giving way  to some ambivalence when it came to the Gallic stairways. "These people are so  careful with their money, they built them outside to economize. You ought to  try climbing them when they're covered with ice and snow, or try shoveling off  the snow and chipping away the ice, step by step."  </P> <P> Quebec historians acknowledge that the stairways were built to save on building  costs and increase useful space. They have been outlawed in new construction  since the 1970s, partly because of the slipping hazard during Montreal's long  and rigorous winters.  </P> <P> Another, more controversial reason why they might have been banned concerns  their role in emergencies.  </P> <P> Jean Bouffard of Quebec's Ministry of Tourism said, "On the fire-hazard aspect  of the discussion, opinions are split. Building technicians and urbanists  pretend that the outside stairs are frail structures easily destroyed by  flames.  </P> <P> "Firemen argue that these constitute open and direct access with the ground and  a firm landing for them to force access when needed in burning structures."  </P> <P> Perhaps because of the debate, but also because the stairways are a distinctive  facet of Montreal's history, repairs and reconstruction are permitted on  existing stairways.  </P> <P> Some residential streets lined with these structures are a veritable bouquet of  wrought-iron styles and colors, integrated with trees in the narrow front yards  and plants on the balconies.  </P> <P> Some stairways reach straight for the second floor, some curve gracefully  upward. The hues range from black and white to bronze, blue and yellow.  </P> <P> In his book, "Montreal in Evolution," Jean-Claude Marsan notes: "In the 19th  Century every country, and perhaps even every large city, produced its own type  of housing suited to the economic, social and cultural conditions of the  majority of its population."  </P> <P> He writes that industrialization at the turn of the century and a large influx  of workers to Montreal led to the need for a quantity of housing close to  transportation and job sites.  </P> <P> Three-story houses took shape with small setbacks from the sidewalk, "leaving  vacant but unused space," he said, that "provided an opportunity to build the  staircase leading to the upper floors on the outside of the house. The space  thus saved inside the apartment was then put to good use. For houses with three  floors, the staircase from the balcony of the second floor to the flat on the  third floor usually remained inside."  </P> <P> But there may be some cultural ingredients in this building brew. The style  that evolved was designed for newcomers from the country, accustomed to porches  or verandas.  </P> <P> "Front balconies," Marsan said, "may also have been an attempt, whether  conscious or not, to imitate the houses of the rich where the main entrance was  often protected by a porch whose roof was used as a balcony for one of the  rooms on the second floor."  </P> <P> For a tourist encountering this architecture after a promenade through the  sidewalk cafes of lower St. Denis, however, another explanation comes to mind:  the Gallic predilection for savoring the passing scene.  </P> <P> Kest Morgan would buy that one: "Some of my neighbors sit on the balconies by  the hour; they know my every move."  </P></p>

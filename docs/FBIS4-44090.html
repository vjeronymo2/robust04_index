			<p>BFN     [Text] In London, Britain and Israel have signed a joint  research agreement. Representing Israel, Minister Shulamit  Aloni welcomed the agreement, adding that it opens the way for  Israeli scientists to participate in European research groups.  Jerry Lewis reports:    [Begin recording] [Lewis] Initially for three years, about  300,000 pounds per annum will be made available to route joint  research projects to encourage the exchange of British and  Israeli scientists. Mr. Waldegrave:    [Waldegrave] Well, it's the first time Britain has ever had  an agreement exactly like this with any country, where we put  the money from the government side in Britain together with the  money from the Israeli Government side, plus a generous matching  of that from some philanthropic sources -- the Rothschild  Foundation and others -- to provide a fund for the development  of scientific contacts between the two countries.    [Lewis] He added: It will begin to focus on collaborative  research [word indistinct] technology, with an emphasis on  fields relevant to medicine, electro-optics, lasers, [word  indistinct] biology, and high-performance materials. He  welcomed the cooperation, noting Israel had very good  scientists, and predicted such cooperation would extend shortly  to other fields in what he termed a wide-shared agenda that was  a clear product of the peace dividend.    Shulamit Aloni emphasized the value to Israeli scientists:    [Aloni] For us it's important because it's an open way to  the EC research group as well, and it's important because no  country nowadays can go to the future without partners from  other countries.    [Lewis] Facing the 21st century, she added, Israel did not  have the resources other than minds, and it was important for  Israel to develop joint projects, such as this in science and  technology, with a hope for benefits and contacts in Europe as  well.

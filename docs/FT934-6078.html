			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Motorways need more service stations Sir, After so many tragedies recently on the roads, I feel I must voice my opinion about the severe lack of service stations on the motorways. There are none on the M40. I am a student in Birmingham and living permanently in Sussex I often drive home. The 180-mile journey is entirely devoid of services. The Department of Transport has brought it to our attention that 'tiredness can kill' and that we should 'take a break'. The question as far as the M40 is concerned is: 'Where?' Recently, a mother travelling with her children in the back of the car was fined for stopping on the hard shoulder for fear of falling asleep at the wheel. Her crime was that she had not broken down and was therefore illegally parked. Ironically, the idiot who changed his wheel in the outside lane was let off with a caution. Surely it has got to a stage where the government must react positively to these frequent incidents. Many a time have I driven past a lorry that is weaving between the hard shoulder and the inside lane, the driver obviously dropping off. These HGV drivers are under a great deal of pressure to deliver on time, but there is only so much one can do to stay awake. Service stations could and should be included at the road planning stage. There is so much that needs to be done to lift the safety standard of roads but providing more service stations would be a step in the right direction. I know my mother is not the only parent who worries more and more about the safety of her children on the roads. Miss Pip Pirie, 8 Dale Road, Selly Oak, Birmingham B29 6AG</p>

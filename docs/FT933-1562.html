			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Observer: Rods for his back John Major may have been tucked away in Kuala Lumpur when Russia descended into turmoil - but he still managed to trump other western leaders as the first to back President Boris Yeltsin with a statesmanlike, even eloquent, response. Back in London, the Foreign Office is crowing with delight - and not backward in claiming much of the credit. For it appears that Major's statements were the product of labours into the wee hours by Whitehall's two top Russia experts - the 'two Rods' - who were on the PM's Asian trip. Foreign policy adviser Sir Rodric Braithwaite returned to London only last year after four years as ambassador to Russia, while Roderic Lyne, one of Major's private secretaries, was head of what was then the Soviet department of the FCO between 1990 and 1992. The PM, who has recklessly promised to dispense with speech-writers for the party conference, might at least ponder the value of shrewd advice.</p>

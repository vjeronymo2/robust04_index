			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Russia warned on economic errors RUSSIA'S reform programme is too severely market orientated and will cause a social explosion if it continues to ignore the social and political dimensions, a group of western scholars has told the Russian government. The five-strong group said yesterday they had advised Russian leaders 'that the transformation of Russia cannot be reduced to a transition to the market economy'. It is a dramatic sign of the times that foreign experts - including two American professors - should come to Moscow to admonish Russian leaders for being too right-wing. Led by Professor Manuel Castells, professor of sociology at the University of Madrid, the group had two advisory sessions with Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr Alexander Shokhin, the two deputy prime ministers, and Mr Genady Burbulis, the first deputy prime minister (and former instructor in Marxism-Leninism). The fact that the group secured so much time indicates that the Russian government is now concerned by the effects of their own policies, and the lack of governmental power. Prof Alain Touraine, the distinguished French sociologist, said that 'we told the Russian government: you were right to break with the existing system and to create a market economy. But it would be wrong to concentrate only on economic issues and to destroy the state'. He warned of the dangers in the distancing of the people from the authorities. The group's concerns chime with the private views of some official foreign advisers working in Moscow, including those with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They are concerned that the strict application of monetary and fiscal disipline is not accompanied by adequate structural changes. In addition, insufficient preparation is being made for the social protection of those people hit by soaring prices. Prof Stephen Cohen, who holds the chair of planning at the University of California at Berkeley (not a popular discipline in contemporary Russia), told a group of mainly Russian journalists yesterday that 'sometimes in this great country you people take things too seriously for your own good. You took the 1917 revolution too seriously and now you're taking the market too seriously.' Prof Castells said flatly: 'All entrepreneurial classes were created with the assistance of the state.' 'The most rapidly growing part of the world, in South Asia - Korea, Japan, Singapore - would not have experienced their economic miracles without the state. Under present circumstances, a purely liberal policy would not lead to a market but to a new monopoly formed by the members of the old nomenklatura.' All agreed that the bias of foreign advice - strongly orientated towards rapid market change - was 'distorted'.</p>

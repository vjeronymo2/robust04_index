			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Company in newownership loses tax carry back - Advance Corporation Tax This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. THE carry-back of advance corporation tax is to stop with immediate effect when ownership of a company changes and there is a fundamental change in the nature or conduct of its business. Inland Revenue said the intention was to prevent the loss of corporation tax which can occur when a company changes hands. In some cases the company which is sold may have as its only significant asset the capacity to off-set ACT against corporation tax it has previously paid. Following the change of ownership, surplus ACT may be created in the company, and then carried back to generate a repayment of the corporation tax previously paid. In a statement, Inland Revenue said: 'Under existing law, where, in any three-year period, there is both a change in the ownership of a company, and a major change in the nature or conduct of its trade or business, ACT paid by the company in respect of distributions made before the change of ownership may not be set against liability to corporation tax arising after the change. 'Another restriction prevents ACT paid by a company in respect of distributions made before a change of ownership from being carried forward when the trade or business has become small or negligible before the change of ownership, and is subsequently significantly revived following the change. 'The new proposal will apply in a similar way to prevent ACT paid in respect of distributions made after a change of ownership from being set against liability to corporation tax arising before the change if there is also a major change in the nature or conduct of the business. 'The proposed clause which will be included in the 1993 Finance Bill is: In section 245 of the Taxes Act 1988 (calculation etc of ACT on change of ownership of company) after subsection (3) there shall be inserted the following subsections:- '(3A) No advance corporation tax paid by the company in respect of distributions made in an accounting period ending after the change of ownership shall be treated under section 239(3) as paid by it in respect of distributions made in an accounting period beginning before the change of ownership; this. . . shall apply to an accounting period in which the change of ownership occurs as if the part ending with the change of ownership, and the part after, were two separate accounting periods. (3B) Subsection (3A) above applies in relation to changes in ownership occurring on or after 16 March 1993.' The proposal will yield about Pounds 150m in a full year to the Exchequer.</p>

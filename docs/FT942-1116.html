			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Rap for building societies Building societies were told this week to improve their practices in relation to mortgage protection policies and to make clearer their written explanations of the terms for fixed-rate mortgages. The annual report of the building societies ombudsman scheme described some documentation relating to fixed rate mortgages as 'sloppy'. On mortgage protection, it urged societies at least to comply with the code of practice issued by the Association of British Insurers. Overall, however, Edell said that the number of complaints the scheme dealt with fell by just over one-third last year to 901, reflecting a trend of more grievances being settled by agreement. He added also that although the number of complaints about mortgages was rising, there had been a sharp drop in complaints about investments, as societies had improved their practices in telling customers about the interest rates in obsolete accounts or in simply moving them out of obsolete accounts altogether. From 1 July, the ombudsman will have greater powers, as his remit will extend to complaints about a society's conduct before a mortgage or investment is completed, if the transaction then goes through.</p>

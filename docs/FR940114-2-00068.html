The Panel's first meeting will be held February 2&hyph;3, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the 2nd, and 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on the 3rd. The meeting will be held at the Bethesda Marriott Hotel, 5151 Pooks Hill Road, Bethesda, Maryland. Dates of subsequent Panel meetings will be determined at the first meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until June 1993, Federal regulations governing research on human subjects (45 CFR part 46) required research involving in vitro fertilization (IVF) to be reviewed by an Ethics Advisory Board (EAB). Because of the absence of an EAB since 1980, Federal funding of IVF protocols was not possible. With the enactment of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;43), the regulatory provision requiring EAB review of IVF proposals was nullified. As a result, IVF proposals, as well as research involving human embryos that result from IVF or other sources, may now be considered for Federal funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH has received a number of applications for support in this area and in the related field of parthenogenesis. However, before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding, the NIH must address the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryos in research and develop guidelines to govern the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. Panel members will be asked to consider various areas of research involving the human embryo and provide advice as to those areas they view to be acceptable for Federal funding, areas that warrant additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research considered acceptable for Federal funding, the Panel will be asked to recommend specific guidelines for the review and conduct of this research. Ethical issues related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's purview. The Panel's final report will be presented to the ACD for review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH invites public input into this process. Those who wish to share their views about Federal funding of human embryo research may address the Panel during public comment periods that will be scheduled during each meeting. The public comment period during the first meeting is scheduled to take place February 2 from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Those who wish to address the Panel at this or subsequent meetings are asked to contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor, by telephoning 301&hyph;496&hyph;1454 or by sending a facsimile message to 301&hyph;402&hyph;0280 or 301&hyph;402&hyph;1759. Oral statements must not exceed five minutes in length, and opportunities to present statements will be determined by the order in which requests are received. Those who wish to present oral statements should forward a one-page summary of their remarks in advance of the scheduled presentation date. Individuals and organizations may also submit written comments of any length to the Panel. These should be forwarded to the NIH in care of Ms. Schnoor at 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 1, room 218, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. Individuals are, however, asked to notify the NIH of their interest in attending by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed above. Individuals who require special accommodations are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number. General questions about the Panel or the first meeting should also be directed to Ms. Schnoor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Future meetings of the Panel will be announced in this publication. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Harold Varmus, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Director, NIH. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1017 Filed 1&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4140&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

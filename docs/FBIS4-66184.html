			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chiang Hsueh-ying (1203 7185 1758): "Are the </F> People of Taiwan Happy?"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In order to know the domestic  public's state of mind in a changing era, reflect the current  domestic social mood, and provide a reference for deliberation,  TIENHSIA Magazine conducted a telephone public opinion polling  project on "views on the value of success," especially directed  at the mass of the people throughout the entire Taiwan area.    "Quite happy, but success is not essential" is the general  feeling ... of Taiwanese about their lives.    The survey results showed that among all interviewees, fewer  than 5 percent of the people thought that they were "unhappy"  with their current lives, while nearly 5 out of 10 people (49.9  percent) felt they were happy.    Comparatively, to the question "Do you feel you are  successful?", 22.7 percent of those interviewed responded  "unsuccessful," while fewer than 2 in 10 (18.6 percent) said yes.    After all, what is "success" in the minds of Taiwanese  today?    The survey result showed, that among the eight elements of  "success," the importance of "happy and conjugal family life"  was ranked number one (60.5 percent), far higher than other  items, while physical and mental health (43.6 percent), the  ability to do what one wants (36.5 percent) and smooth  work/successful career (36.2 percent) were also among the most  favored items. At least in the priority ranking reflected by  the public, the "sense of utility" of Taiwan society seems to be  not as serious many people had imagined.    In addition, since Taiwan has gradually moved into a  prosperous society, the importance of "personal financial  prosperity" has dropped significantly (10.1 percent), and is no  longer an important target by which most people judge "success."  "Social status and fame" has become the least important factor  in judging success (3.0 percent). One interviewee laughingly  said, "I'm not campaigning for the legislature, why do I need  fame and status?"    What is a matter for rejoicing is that the key elements for  success stressed by the respondents are just what people feel  are the most satisfactory parts--nearly seven out of 10 people  feel satisfied with their family life, while over half expressed  satisfaction with their personal physical and mental health  situation, and were happy with the things they want to do.  Besides this, there were more than 4 out of 10 who believe they  are making contributions to the society and are helpful to other  people.    By comparison, "social status and fame," "self development  and making the most of one's ability," and "smooth work/a  successful career" are items which respondents ranked as low in  satisfaction. However, looking at the positive side, strong  self-development and career ambition only reflect the fact that  Taiwan is still a youthful, motivated society.    TIENHSIA's survey results also showed that the higher the  self-expectation, the greater the possibility of  disappointment--among interviewees, there were fewer than four  out 10 people who thought their current achievements matched  their expectations.    What deserves deeper thought is that, according to cross  analysis based on formal schooling, people with higher education  have a lower rate of attaining their self-expectations. The only  exception is at the levels higher than the institute. As a  person at the highest educational level self-mockingly put it,  "The fact that one can receive an education in an institute is  in itself a sort of achievement in China society, which strives  for scholarship, industry, agriculture, and commerce."    In Taiwan, where education is popularized and opportunities  are quite equal, most people (35.6 percent) found fault in  themselves, blaming themselves for not working hard enough,  followed by the "working environment does not provide the  opportunity for making the most of myself" (2.5 percent), and  too rapid changes in the times and society (22.0 percent).    One point of interest is that differences in age have the  greatest effect on responses to this question. Younger people  think it is due to themselves "not working hard enough," while  their elders think it is due to "too rapid changes in the times  and in society." The biggest yoke for the young and for people  in the prime years of 31 to 40 is "family"; young people  complain the most that the "working environment does not provide  the opportunity for making the most of myself," while people in  the 51 to 60 age group, facing the final sprint, complain about  their own "lack of ability."    Besides the obvious results showed by the entire survey,  further study to analyze the connections among each item and the  backgrounds of interviewees can uncover much of significance  that is hidden.    "Success" does not equate to "happiness"; this result is  worthy of further study.    The percentage of interviewees who thought of themselves as  "happy" was much higher than the percentage of people who  thought of themselves as "successful." This may conceal the  traditional concept of Chinese as generous in expressing joy but  reluctant to brag of success. "Success" does not necessarily  bring "happiness," while "happy" people do not necessarily  consider themselves "successful."    The most obvious example is: Interviewees with super high  income (annual income over two million) consider themselves  successful at a higher rate than ordinary people do (28  percent); but the percentage who consider themselves "happy" is  much lower than that for ordinary people (36 percent).  Contrarily, although homemakers think of themselves as "happy"  at a higher rate than others (56 percent), this comes with a  lower rate of considering themselves "successful" than others do  (16.9 percent).    Although a "happy family," "physical and mental health" and  "being able to do what one wants to do" are not only the most  important goals for "success" in people's minds, they also are  the things people consider most satisfying about their lives,  and analytical results showed that these three items have a much  greater effect on "happiness" than on "success."    Relatively, "success" has the most obvious connection with  "work/career," "making the most of one's abilities" and  "personal financial prosperity," and traditional concepts of  value. In other words, although a happy family, physical and  mental health and being able to do what one wants can make  people happy, these are often considered necessary conditions  for "success," while smooth work experience, successful career,  maximizing one's abilities and personal financial prosperity can  make people feel genuine "success."    But if we look at the interviewees' backgrounds, in a Taiwan  which still holds to traditional concepts of value, it is not  surprising that males over 50 years of age with high education  records who are professors or chief managers and have high  incomes (yearly income over one million) would have a higher  rate of regarding themselves as "successful."    Another interesting survey finding is that women put greater  stress on "happiness," while men put more emphasis on "success."  According to cross-analysis by gender, female interviewees  (especially homemakers) think of themselves as "happy" at a  higher rate than men do. While male interviewees have a more  extreme response to success, their rates of thinking themselves  successful or not are both higher than for women. This is  another example of how "success" does not equate to "happiness."    Generally speaking, what kind of people are happy? What kind  of people are not happy?    Cross-analysis showed that a sizable proportion of the  people  who consider themselves "happy" are women aged between 31 to 50,  with a history of higher education (college graduate at  minimum), professionals (doctors, lawyers...), homemakers,  having high income but not "super high" (yearly income between  one to two million).    Among "unhappy" people, a high percentage of them were  concentrated in the 51 to 64 age group, low educational level  (elementary school and below), homemakers (also in the high  happiness group, but also an extreme reaction), self-employed,  low income (less than 200,000) or super high income (yearly  income over two million).    Another key to determining whether one is happy or unhappy  are the differing "ideas of value."    Happy people pay much greater attention to life objectives  such as family, health, and "ability to do what you want," than  do unhappy people. Unhappy people pay much greater attention to  "personal financial prosperity" and "making a contribution to  society" than happy people do.    To analyze the difference further, the things pursued by a  happy person are usually things one can obtain by  self-adjustment, accomplished by an individual alone, usually  not involving comparison or competition with others. But those  things pursued by unhappy people, that is, financial prosperity  and making contributions to society, are things very easily  affected by the external environment, opportunities, and  comparisons with other people. Since there are many factors  which can be controlled by external conditions, it is more  difficult to obtain happiness.    As for age level, the most complicated group are those aged  between 51 to 64. Although this group thought of themselves as  "successful" at a high rate (21.5 percent), their rate of  "happiness" was lowest (37.9 percent) of all age levels.    Also, of all age levels, these are the people with the  lowest  rate of satisfaction concerning their current situation. This is  true regardless of whether one is talking about a happy family,  ability to do what one wants, making the most of one's  abilities, health, or financial situation. They are the least  satisfied in each. This is the group which believes they work  the hardest, with a much higher rate (45.1 percent) believing  they have reached their goals than do the younger people.  However the percentage of them who think they are better off  than they were five years ago (35.3 percent, with the average  being 52 percent) and the percentage of them who felt they were  happy (34 percent, with the average rate being 44.5 percent) are  far lower than for other age levels. In addition to the  emotional indication that "the setting sun is wonderful, but  dusk is approaching," the abrupt changes in Taiwan's politics,  economy and society and changing concepts of values may shock  and pressure them.    The group with the most extreme range of views concerning  happiness or unhappiness, success or failure, are seniors over  65, differing more than any other age level. Among their views,  the greatest differences lay in their children's attitudes and  ways to support them. [passage omitted]    How is "success" defined? There was no unanimous response.  But each person's answer was enough to affect their own  happiness.    "In recent years, what things in your life have increased in  importance?" The answers: a happy family, physical and mental  healthy, being able to do what one wants to do. These were  followed by work, career, contributions to society and financial  prosperity.    Having passed through an era of economic boom and  experienced  a complete reorganization of the political, economic, and social  order, most Taiwanese no longer worry about "the problem of  getting enough to eat and clothes to wear." Looking back at  family and self, being average seems to have become the common  expectation of most people.    On the whole, pursuing "happiness" instead of "success" will  be the "new life attitude" for Taiwanese in the future.    This survey was conducted between 16 and 18 January by means  of systematic sampling and telephone interviews throughout the  whole of Taiwan. There was an effective sample of 1,282, with a  confidence level of 9.5 out of 10, and an error rate of plus or  minus 2.68 percent.</p>

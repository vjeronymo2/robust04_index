			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSY HIGHWAY TO N.Y. SHUT BY FIRE DAMAGE  </P> <P> A garbage dump caught fire beneath Interstate 78 Monday, buckling the elevated  roadway and causing a shutdown of the thoroughfare at one of the nation's  busiest highway interchanges.  </P> <P> "This is the most serious traffic emergency in my memory," said Gov. Thomas H.  Kean, who flew over the site. "It could not have occurred in a worse place."  </P> <P> Further problems linking the busy New York area with parts of Pennsylvania  could occur if the blaze spreads south to rubbish beneath U.S. 22, which  parallels Interstate 78 about half a mile away.  </P> <P> "If it goes underneath Route 22, then east-west traffic could be a total loss  from eastern Pennsylvania to New York City," state Assistant Transportation  Commissioner Charles Edson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mountain of Debris  </P> <P> The fire, fueled by a 25-foot-high, 400-yard-long mountain of construction  debris, started about 1:30 a.m. in the heavily industrialized area not far from  Newark International Airport. It burned all day and buckled the steel beams  underpinning a 1,000-square-foot elevated section of the highway, officials  said. No injuries were reported.  </P> <P> "Unless we can get a bulldozer under there to pull that stuff out, it's going  to have to burn itself out," said Larry Krieger, a spokesman for the Newark  Fire Department. "It could burn until Wednesday, at least."  </P> <P> Smoke poured through cracks measuring from 5 to 8 inches wide in the highway  during the day.  </P> <P> Officials said commuters knew about the fire at Hub Recycling Co. 2 miles from  downtown Newark early enough to find alternative means of getting to and from  work, and serious traffic problems did not develop.  </P> <P> Some businesses chose to move workers out of buildings in direct line of the  smoke.  </P> <P> Interstate 78 links points west to the busy New Jersey Turnpike, which leads  into New York City and handles Interstate 95 traffic.  </P> <P> Kean said he was not sure how long it would take to repair the highway.  </P></p>

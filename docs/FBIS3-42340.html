An explosion shook the La Paz district attorney's office at  noon today. The explosion occurred in a restricted area very  close to Prosecutor Javier Dibs's office. The damage was small  and no one was injured. [passage omitted]    The bomb was placed in a corridor through which Dibs enters  and leaves his office. [passage omitted]    Two weeks ago the Ministry of Government withdrew the police  who were guarding the office. It is expected that the new order  assigning officers to different posts will resolve the problem.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This reporter has made inquiries with the relevant  authorities in Beijing and learned that MING PAO reporter Xi  Yang was simply not engaged in normal reporting, nor did he  "mistakenly enter the forbidden zone." What he was involved in  was criminal activity of spying and stealing state secrets. The  Beijing Intermediate People's Court has handed down the  second-instance judgment according to law and given Xi Yang a  sentence of 12 years, with deprivation of political rights for  two years. Because Xi Yang had admitted his guilt and showed  repentance, the court handed down a light sentence according to  the law when considering the penalty.    The relevant authorities noted: During the period June and  July 1993, Xi Yang repeatedly spied and stole state financial  and economic secrets through bank clerk Tian Ye, the other  defendant in the case; and passed all this secret material and  information to MING PAO in Hong Kong for publication, causing  serious economic losses to the state. The court was convinced  that Xi Yang had committed the crime of spying and stealing  state secrets, and his case was extremely serious.    According to the "Supplementary Stipulations Concerning  Punishment of the Crime of Disclosing State Secrets" as well as  Clause 1, Article 51 of the "Criminal Law of the PRC," criminals  like Xi Yang who steal state secrets can be given a jail term of  10 years or more, life imprisonment, or even the death penalty,  with deprivation of political rights. In consideration of the  fact that Xi Yang had already admitted his guilt and showed  repentance, the court gave him a light sentence of 12 years with  deprivation of political rights for two years. According to  relevant stipulations, if he refuses to accept the court's  judgment, a defendant can appeal within 10 days after receiving  the court's verdict. It is learned that Xi Yang has appealed.  According to the "Law on Criminal Cases," cases involving state  secrets will not be open to the public. Since the Xi Yang case  involves state secrets, there will not be a public trial.    The relevant authorities in Beijing rejected suggestions  that  Xi Yang "mistakenly entered the forbidden zone," for Xi Yang was  simply not engaged in normal news-gathering. The fact that Xi  Yang is the only one to get into trouble among thousands of Hong  Kong reporters who have been to Mainland China on reporting  assignments since last year demonstrates that the line between  normal reporting and criminal activities of spying and stealing  state secrets is clearly drawn. Hong Kong reporters' normal  reporting activities are fully protected.</p>

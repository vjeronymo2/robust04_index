			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS REFORM  </P> <P> Common Cause wishes to extend its sincere thanks and appreciation to state  Assembly members Lucy Killea and Robert Frazee who, together with five of their  colleagues, played a leadership role in the drafting of a comprehensive package  of ethics-reform proposals designed to restore public confidence in state  government.  </P> <P> As members of the bipartisan Assembly Select Committee on Ethics, Killea and  Frazee had to make unpopular decisions affecting the activities of other  legislators. Through an extraordinarily open and deliberative process, the  committee recommended to the full Assembly an exhaustive, thoughtful list of  reforms: Eliminate honoraria, strictly limit gifts, prohibit the personal use  of campaign funds -- and much more. Common Cause gives the committee report a  grade of B for substance. However, the committee's effort deserves nothing less  than an A+.  </P> <P> Unfortunately the committee's recommendations were not fully implemented in  either house of the Legislature. This should not lessen our praise for each  committee member who, faced with tough decisions, made tough choices. Killea  and Frazee, along with other committee appointees, have served their  constituents and the state of California well. They have provided for some  restoration of confidence in the institution they serve and have opened the  door to a more responsive and effective state Legislature.  </P> <P> STANLEY F. ZUBEL  </P> <P> San Diego Area Representative  </P> <P> Common Cause  </P></p>

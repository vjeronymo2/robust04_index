			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTEL PLANS TO CUT 600 JOBS IN BID TO SLASH OVERHEAD  </P> <P> Intel Corp., one of the nation's top computer chip makers, said Wednesday that  it will eliminate up to 600 jobs, or 3% of its work force, in an effort to  boost competitiveness.  </P> <P> The company is launching a major drive to cut costs throughout the corporation  and is looking at ways to reduce overhead and factory positions.  </P> <P> "We operate in an aggressive, unforgiving marketplace. While our financial  position is solid and demand for our products is strong, our objective is to  make sure we stay in good shape as we enter the 1990s," Chief Executive Andrew  Grove said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> "This requires that we work steadily at reducing our costs and shifting  resources from low to high areas of return," Grove said.  </P> <P> The jobs will be eliminated this year, Intel said. The company has created a  placement program to move as many affected employees as possible into new  positions, but a small number are expected to be laid off. Intel now employs  about 20,000 people.  </P> <P> Intel did not say exactly where the cuts would apply.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MINUS SEGOTA, SOCKERS OPEN AGAINST BLAST  </P> <P> If there is a bright side, it is only that Branko Segota probably got a little  extra sleep while his Socker teammates boarded their early-bird flight to  Baltimore Sunday morning at 6:45.  </P> <P> Segota, the heart of the offense with a team-leading 13 playoff points, will be  in San Diego tonight when the Sockers open the best-of-seven Major Indoor  Soccer League championship series against Baltimore in the Baltimore Arena at  4:35.  </P> <P> Segota aggravated his hamstring injury Saturday while running start-and-stop  sprint drills. He will undergo rehabilitation this week and hopes to be ready  for Game 3 in San Diego Friday.  </P> <P> "I just didn't feel I could contribute to the team right now," Segota said. "I  didn't want to go there and just mope around and get the other guys down."  </P> <P> Past games against Baltimore indicate expectations shouldn't plunge in Segota's  absence. The Sockers had their best outing against the Blast in a game Segota  missed, winning, 7-1, at Baltimore in the second-to-last meeting of the regular  season. Interestingly, starters Brian Quinn and Zoran Karic also were out that  game. All three were injured.  </P> <P> Though Segota's presence usually causes some worry to opponents, who mark him  with two defenders when he is within scoring range, the Sockers have never  worried much about what to do without him. In simpler terms, they won't make  excuses.  </P> <P> Before the playoffs started, Quinn said: "In the end, they're not going to say  it was won by Baltimore but San Diego didn't have Branko Segota. After all the  dust is settled, they don't write that in the record books."  </P> <P> Anyway, six-time indoor champions can't expect sympathy. Particularly from a  Baltimore team with eight players who, at one time or another, have faced the  Sockers and lost in a championship series. So the Sockers are planning to  adapt.  </P> <P> "We just have to pick up the slack," midfielder Waad Hirmez said. "Having  (Segota) on the field frightens the other team. We'll have to depend more on  teamwork."  </P> <P> And consistency. Intensity was up and down during the Dallas series and, as a  result, the Sockers barely escaped, clinching in Game 7 with a 1-0 victory.  </P> <P> Quinn's observation during the semifinal series was that not enough of the  Sockers were entering the locker room tired after games.  </P> <P> "That's true," defender Kevin Crow said. "Everybody should be walking in that  locker room drained. That's the sort of attitude you need."  </P> <P> The Blast, which defeated the Sockers in six of eight regular-season games,  might not let them survive intensity lapses. Baltimore was well prepared from  the start this season, taking players from several defunct MISL franchises last  summer and building a team strong enough to jump to an 8-1 start, best in  franchise history.  </P> <P> Never deposed from first place, the Blast went on to defeat Wichita in six  games in its semifinal series to earn its shot at the defending-champion  Sockers. Home-field advantage should help Baltimore, which is 11-2 against the  Sockers in regular-season games at home.  </P> <P> Known for its balanced attack, the Blast blends offensive strength from forward  David Byrne and midfielder Carl Valentine with defense led by goalie Scott  Manning. Manning, in particular, has been tough on the Sockers this season,  holding them to 11 goals in the first five games.  </P></p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: UK governance The focus of the Cadbury committee's proposals was enhancing management accountability to shareholders. This has led to tangible improvements in corporate governance in the UK, for example a new and welcome emphasis on the role of non-executive directors. But it is time for the new Cadbury committee - due to be constituted early in 1995 - to investigate the responsibilities of shareholders as companies' owners. Directors are entitled to feel aggrieved about a vast increase in their responsibilities - most recently requiring them to pass judgment on the efficacy of internal financial controls - when there has been no corresponding increase in shareholders' commitment to companies. Even if they complain in private about issues such as executive pay, UK institutional investors are reluctant to vote at annual and extraordinary general meetings. The implication is that they prefer to respond to problems at a company by selling their shares. This is easier and less time-consuming than involving themselves directly in a company's affairs by voting. The reluctance to vote on contentious issues also reflects a conflict of interest. Institutions are afraid of offending executive directors who, as trustees, award the mandates which are a fund managers' life-blood. The solution would be to take a page out of US legislation, and require pension fund managers to exercise their votes. The current Pensions Bill would present an excellent opportunity for the necessary legislative change. As a quid pro quo, investors should lobby the government to change the Companies Act so as to require companies to disclose fuller information on directors' compensation packages.</p>

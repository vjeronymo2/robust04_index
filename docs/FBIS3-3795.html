He told a press conference here that the "American side  should not forget the historical experience of the 1950s Korean  war."    He was reacting to Washington's announcement that it was  sending Patriot anti-missile missiles to South Korea as a  defensive measure and resuming its Team Spirit military  exercises with South Korea.    Those moves would "only accelerate the speed toward war. If  they don't give up all these attempts, nothing can happen but  war," said Chu.    He also said that if international sanctions were imposed on  North Korea by the United Nations Pyongyang would "make the  necessary response."    The International Atomic Energy Agency has accused North  Korea of not fully cooperating with inspections of its nuclear  programme and has referred the issue to the United Nations for  possible Security Council action to obtain full compliance.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (5): Now the 'electronic purse' - Payment systems For a range of transactions other than those involving relatively small amounts of money, electronic payment is now the norm. Consumers take it for granted that they can pay for goods with plastic cards, while retailers know they in turn will get their money through electronic funds transfer at the point of sale (Eftpos), when customers' cards are swiped through authorisation terminals. But developments are now taking place also at the lower end of the scale, which will make it possible for a new type of plastic cards to be used to pay for small-ticket items such as parking, newspapers and soft drinks. This area is known as the electronic purse. 'Plastic is accepted by consumers and retailers,' says Ken Hansen, managing director of Verifone (UK), a leading supplier of the terminals used to authorise credit and debit card transactions. 'Even the newer plastic debit cards, which take money directly out of a customer's account have taken off. In the UK, debit card transactions have just surpassed credit card transactions.' Individuals carry much less cash than they used to, but banks would like them to carry even less, because it is expensive to handle. It has to be counted and hole-in-the-wall automatic teller machines (ATMs) have to be kept stocked up. More importantly, cash does not earn interest when it is in the consumer's wallet. The latest cards, which a number of organisations are experimenting with, contain electronic money or units of value. These work rather like phone cards and can be of two kinds. They can either be throw-away cards (such as phone cards) or they can be smart cards, which can be reloaded with units when they run out. Smart cards look like credit cards but have a computer chip built-in. This enables them to store more information than a simple magnetic-stripe card. Many banks favour smart-card technology because the cards have more memory and intelligence and can be given a multi-purpose function. They are also more secure because it is harder to duplicate the information on a smart-card chip than a relatively simple magnetic stripe. Examples of electronic purse initiatives include the Danish DanMont card, which can be used to buy low-cost items; while in Singapore a combined credit, debit, loyalty and electronic purse card has been jointly produced by a bank and a retailer. Shell's loyalty scheme is similar to a electronic purse. Customers who buy petrol from Shell service stations get points added to a plastic card and these can be exchanged later for goods. In the UK, Mondex - a NatWest Bank cashless card, the British rights to which are shared with BT and the Midland Bank - is to be tested in shops in Swindon next year. NatWest wants Mondex to be used globally and has franchised it to the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for use in several Asian countries. As yet, there are no standards for the cards, for electronic-purse authorisation terminals, or for machines to reload them with units. However, a number of credit-card organisations around the world, such as Visa, Mastercard, and Europay are working with other companies to set standards for worldwide electronic-purse identification numbers (the kind of system that enables Visa cards to be recognised abroad), the location of the computer chips on each card and other important details. One of the companies involved in standard-setting is VeriGem, a company set up jointly by US-based Verifone and French smart-card supplier, GemPlus. Mr Hansen says: 'A year ago we saw the way things were going with rising interest in electronic purse cards and falling prices of Eftpos terminals and telecoms links. The 'electronic purse' could be the biggest part of the payment market because all the low-value cash transactions added together are worth more than the large transactions.' He says many banks are experimenting with chip cards - and some have products which will be very close to the likely eventual standard. He expects a full standard to be agreed next year. Jack Large, of UK-based payment-card consultancy J&amp;W Associates, believes electronic purse technology will start to pay off when it is brought together with account-based debit cards such as the UK's Switch and Visa Delta - 'from one card you will get cash withdrawal, payment at the point-of-sale, and an electronic purse.' There are, however, a number of commercial issues to be resolved. Lars Mieritz, an analyst at the Gartner Group Europe, says: 'We won't achieve a 'moneyless' society until financial institutions provide an incentive to consumers to replace cash.' With electronic purse cards, one advantage to the consumer might be convenience - 'going to the ATM is a grudge transaction,' says Mr Hansen. Yet, electronic money will only be more convenient for the customer if refilling an electronic purse is easier than going to the cash machine. Retailers are starting to make far more use of the data they gain about customer purchases from electronic payment systems. They are taking advantage of powerful computers (based on massively parallel processing) to analyse customers' spending and look for new patterns.

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Treasury's 'wise men' call for neutral budget The UK Treasury's six-man panel of independent economic forecasters yesterday advised Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, against an immediate rise in interest rates and called for a 'neutral' Budget on November 29. In the last report of their two-year contract period, the six 'wise men' said the public spending totals set for 1995-96 by Mr Clarke last year should be cut to offset the effects of lower inflation. The panel said that lower than expected inflation had increased the level of real public spending implied by the cash plans in last year's Budget. The chancellor should aim to reduce the cash plans in line with the lower price level. 'We would not regard this as a tightening of fiscal policy,' the advisers said. Although the forecasters produced differing recommendations on fiscal policy, they said these were 'within a relatively narrow band around a 'neutral' Budget'. This would be one in which the pre-announced tax increases for the coming financial year starting in April should take place as planned, other taxes should be indexed in line with prices, and where spending was kept as planned in real terms. Among the panellists, Prof David Currie of the London Business School, Prof Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research and Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge University argued for no change in fiscal policy. Mr Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs International favoured some further tightening to prevent excessive demand growth. Mr Andrew Britton of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and Prof Patrick Minford of Liverpool University spoke in favour of a small easing of fiscal policy, respectively by cutting National Insurance contributions and reducing marginal tax rates. All favoured policy changes to reduce the cost of employing people on low wages and put forward proposals for a negative income tax and possible changes to the National Insurance system to make it more attractive to hire the unskilled. But such measures, if announced this year, would have to be in the context of a neutral Budget, they said. The report said none of the six would argue for an immediate change in interest rates. They wanted to see how the economy responded to September's rise in bank base rates to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent and the chancellor's Budget decisions. Looking ahead, Messrs Britton, Currie and Davies thought further rate increases would be necessary to restrain inflation, with Mr Davies saying an increase should be relatively soon if there was no further fiscal tightening in the Budget. Profs Minford and Godley, by contrast, were strongly opposed to higher rates in the near future. The report said most panellists favoured tightening fiscal rather than monetary policy to deal with excessive demand growth. The Treasury yesterday welcomed the report. But the panel's future is unclear. Details, Page 8</p>

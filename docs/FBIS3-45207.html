Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee,  delivered an important speech at the meeting. The speech was  entitled: "Accelerate Reform and Development and Strive To  Create a New Situation of Shanghai's Work Under the Guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Theory of Building Socialism With  Chinese Characteristics." Huang Ju, deputy secretary of the  municipal party committee and mayor of Shanghai, made a report  on Shanghai's arrangements for implementing the guidelines of  the national conference on economic work.    The main themes of the discussion at the meeting were to  further study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping and the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee; to emancipate the mind and unify  the understanding under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to  sum up this year's work and put forward ideas for next year's  work; to mobilize all party members and the people in Shanghai  to seize the opportunity to speed up reform and development; to  strive to make a breakthrough in taking the lead in building the  operating mechanisms of a socialist market economy; and to make  efforts to maintain the favorable momentum of sustained, rapid,  and healthy development of our national economy.    The plenary session maintained: In the current year, a new  situation has been created in the various aspects of Shanghai's  work under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee  and the State Council, and through the common efforts of the  broad masses of cadres and people throughout the municipality.  The national economy continues to follow a favorable trend of  development on the foundation of last year's rapid growth. Our  economic restructuring has been further deepened, and the basic  role of the market in the allocation of resources has been  further enhanced; new progress has been made in our efforts to  attract foreign capital and develop Pudong; fruitful results  have been accomplished in infrastructural construction, and new  achievements have been made in various undertakings. The  changeover of leading groups at various levels in the party and  the government has been smoothly completed, and party building  has been further strengthened. Presently, the overall situation  in Shanghai is good, being characterized by political and social  stability, and economic development. The confidence of the  people in realizing a glorious tomorrow has been boosted.    The plenary session held that Shanghai's new achievements  this year in the building of the material and spiritual  civilizations have been made with the concern and support of the  CPC Central Committee and the State Council, as well as that of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionaries of the older  generation; that they are also the fruits of arduous struggle  and hard work of the broad masses of people; and that they could  not have been made without the efforts of the municipal party  committees and governments over the years in laying a solid  foundation, as well as without the staunch support shown by the  various ministries and commissions under the central government,  without the support given by various brotherly provinces and  municipalities, and without the participation and support of the  broad masses of commanders and fighters from the troops  stationed in Shanghai.    The plenary session stressed: The economic work for next  year  will be launched on the basis of the sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic growth over the past two years, and it must  have a higher starting point. We should maintain the favorable  momentum of Shanghai's economic development under the premise of  combining the market, product quality, and economic benefits.  We should continue to increase the proportion of the tertiary  industry in our gross national product. We must give priority  to road and power construction, speed up urban infrastructural  construction, and strive to complete a number of major  engineering projects. We should accelerate Pudong's pace of  development and opening up to the outside world, and keep up the  forceful momentum of economic development in the new area. We  should, on the basis of our economic development, further raise  the actual living standards of urban and rural people. Economic  development calls for new ideas, and it is necessary to firmly  grasp the key links that have a bearing on the overall situation  of Shanghai, and to earnestly study the new situation and new  problems that have emerged in the course of our economic work so  as to really direct our economic construction onto the track of  improving our economic results. We must further heighten our  consciousness toward market competition, actively develop  domestic and foreign markets, strengthen our business  management, and enhance our enterprises' quality and competitive  edge. We must, under the guidance of macro-control, raise funds  through multichannels and make good use of the funds to increase  our economic returns. We should further expand our scale of  bringing in foreign capital, broaden the scope for utilizing  foreign funds, and strive to integrate our utilization of  foreign funds with readjustment of industrial structure, product  structure, and development of new economic growth, as well as  give full play to Shanghai's superiority in technology and  qualified personnel to develop new and high-technology  industries along with a new generation of pillar industry, and  establish a number of major groups and large companies with an  international competitive edge. We must practically consolidate  the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national  economy, strive to develop agriculture that produces high-yield,  high quality products with high economic efficiency, develop  village and town enterprises as well as the tertiary industry,  and push forward the urbanization construction in the rural  areas.    The plenary session pointed out: In the past few years  Shanghai's economy has been able to maintain a favorable  momentum of development mainly because it has benefited from  reform and opening up to the outside world. We must consolidate  our reform achievements, and we must uphold and strive to  constantly improve what has proven effective. In accordance  with the requirements of the "decision" of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we should make the  deepening of reform and the active exploration for a modern  enterprise system the emphasis of accelerating the reform next  year. We must give play to the basic role of the market in the  allocation of resources under macroeconomic control, further  cultivate and develop markets for production factors, strengthen  the standardized administration of the market, and actively  carry out reform of prices in a steady way. In line with the  unified plan of the central authorities, we should actively  accelerate reform of the taxation, financial, investment, and  planning systems. While promoting the development of the state-  owned and collectively owned sectors of the economy, we should  encourage the development of individual undertakings and  privately owned and foreign-owned enterprises. In the new year,  leading cadres at all levels should keep in mind the overall  situation, straighten out the overall structure and relationship  of interests among different sectors, do a good job in  ideological work, show concern for the vital interests of the  masses, and ensure the smooth implementation of all reform  measures.    The plenary session held: Strengthening the building of a  socialist spiritual civilization and sticking to the principle  that both material civilization and spiritual civilization  should be promoted in real earnest and neither aspect should be  neglected constitute the important content of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics; the requirements for Shanghai's  work set by the party Central Committee, the State Council, and  Comrade Deng Xiaoping; and the wish of the Shanghai people. In  the course of developing a socialist market economy, we should  strengthen education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism;  strengthen the building of professional ethics, social morality,  and family moral principles; and actively carry forward the  64-character pioneering spirit initiated by Comrade Jiang Zemin.  We should carry out our propaganda work and education in  conjunction with the education on cherishing Shanghai and on  realizing the goal of creating major changes in three years and  with the efforts to improve Shanghai's appearance and  environment, to provide civilized good-quality services, to  flourish our cultural undertakings, and to mobilize all trades  and professions to achieve outstanding results and present them  as a gift to the 45th anniversary of the founding of New China.  We should further strengthen our comprehensive effort to improve  social security, crack down on criminal activities according to  law, resolutely check all ugly phenomena in society, persist in  launching the anticorruption struggle, and create a favorable  social environment for reforms, opening up to the outside world,  and economic construction.    The plenary session issued the following requirements: Party  organizations at all levels must take the study of Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the  "decisions" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee as their priority tasks for 1994, unify their  thinking, and unify their action. Party and government leading  cadres should take the lead in studying the works. They should  read the original works seriously, trying to understand and  master them. They should carry forward the Marxist study style  of integrating theory with practice, consciously integrate the  guidelines of the Central Committee with work in their  localities and departments, and improve their work style and  leading ability. In studying the works, they must stick to the  quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from  fact; seize "the last opportunity" for Shanghai's development in  the 1990's; enhance their sense of responsibility and urgency;  be modest and prudent; continue to advance; consciously adhere  to the principle of "conducive to three causes" -- conducive to  developing the productive forces of our socialist society,  increasing the overall strength of our socialist country,  improving the people's living standards; be fearless in  practice; be brave in pushing forward reform and construction;  and creatively do their tasks well.    The plenary session issued the following calls: All  communist party members and people in Shanghai, under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the  party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core,  conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, work with one heart  and one mind, unite in struggle, and make new contributions to  fulfilling Shanghai's grand goal of reform and construction.    The plenary session decided to promote Bao Qifan, alternate  member of the municipal party committee, to its member.    Attending the session were 51 members and alternate members  of the municipal party committee. More than 150 party and  government responsible cadres from various departments,  commissions, offices, districts, counties, and bureaus attended  the session as observers.</p>

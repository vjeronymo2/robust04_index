			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Generali profits climb to L422bn at halfway Parent company profits at Generali, the Italian insurer which is the country's biggest quoted company, rose to L422.3bn (Dollars 271m) before tax in the first half of 1994, compared with L410.2bn in the equivalent period last year. The company said ordinary operations had performed well, but like all financial companies, Generali's investment portfolio has been punished by difficult markets and rising interest rates. On June 30, the end of the first half, the group's unrealised gains on its share portfolio stood at L7,050bn, but since then some L350bn has been wiped off the value of its holdings. By mid-September, the company said its unrealised gains stood at L6,700bn. At the halfway stage, Generali does not give full consolidated group figures, but it said aggregate group premiums had increased by 15.3 per cent to L15,696bn in the first half, of which L11,183bn came from outside Italy. Gross parent company premiums in the first half increased to L4,891bn, a rise of 4.2 per cent if exchange rate differences are evened out. Life premiums rose to L2,028bn and non-life to L2,863bn. Generali's investments in the first half increased by 5 per cent to L32,123bn, but the increase in income was comparatively sluggish. Net of financial charges, the income rose 3 per cent to L1,251bn. 'Activities in Italy have shown a satisfactory development in the life operations,' the company said in a statement yesterday. 'However, the progress of the non-life operations has been modest, although a recovery is expected in the second half.' Insurance companies are expected to be among the main beneficiaries of the Italian government's efforts to reform the Italian pensions sector, which should lead to more private pension schemes. Generali's shares closed before the release of the half-year results at L39,519, against an opening price of L39,976.</p>

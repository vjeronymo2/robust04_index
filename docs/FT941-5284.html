			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Brittan opens race to succeed Delors: An undeclared campaign to become the next president of the European Commission The official word in Brussels is that Sir Leon Brittan is not running a campaign to become the next president of the European Commission. This may surprise those watching the EU chief trade negotiator's tour des capitales in 1994, a combination of private hints about presidential ambitions with a torrent of speeches on the future of Europe. Since the New Year, Sir Leon has visited Athens, Dublin, The Hague, London, Madrid, and Rome. Copenhagen and Lisbon follow soon. Paris and Bonn are being held back until nearer the European summit in Corfu in June, when the successor to Mr Jacques Delors will be chosen. A book setting out Sir Leon's vision of Europe just happens to be coming out at the end of the month. Convention dictates that people do not campaign for the top executive post in Brussels, a job which is within the gift of the heads of governments of the 12, not the people. Mr Delors himself was a dark horse in 1984, winning the race only after Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then UK prime minister, reportedly vetoed the first French choice, Mr Claude Cheysson. The Brittan campaign has broken diplomatic precedent, but it has opened up the contest. A year ago, Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister, looked certain to succeed Mr Delors on the grounds of 12 years experience and small-state credentials. This last asset is perhaps the most important. The Commission presidency usually alternates between the large and small member states. Mr Delors succeeded Mr Gaston Thorn (a former Luxembourg prime minister) who succeeded Mr Roy Jenkins, (a former British minister). Sir Leon has managed to halt the 'Lubbers bandwagon'. He has capitalised on the Dutchman's sphinx-like silence on his own candidacy by setting out his own stall, starting with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks last December in which he played a star role. 'The Gatt deal showed that Leon could deliver politically,' says a close aide. So how many votes can Sir Leon count on? Possibly one, the British government; and that is by no means an advantage because the single most important challenge for the senior British commissioner in Brussels is to convince the heads of government that he is not a stalking horse for the UK government and its minimalist vision of European integration. However, the British might be happy with a free-trading Dutchman at the helm with Sir Leon as trade negotiator. To overcome the handicap of nationality, Sir Leon has put distance between himself and the government of Mr John Major. He supports the idea of a common European foreign and security policy. He has taken to chastising the US in public for not living up to its free trade rhetoric. He has warned the UK on several occasions to take seriously the prospect of a 'hard-core' of members states moving to European monetary union. Most striking is his campaign to cultivate the French. For although there are plenty of people in Paris ready to demonise Sir Leon as an Anglo-Saxon free marketeer, there are others who are drawn by his charm, intelligence and panache. Despite clashes with the French government in the Gatt talks, Sir Leon left enough 'wiggle room' to secure a better deal on agriculture from the US, and to avoid opening up the Europe film market to Hollywood. He was also smart enough to let the government of French prime minister Edouard Balladur take the credit. But Mr Balladur himself has refused to be drawn on a successor to Mr Delors. Diplomats in Brussels suggest Paris would like to cut the Commission down to size, a recognition that Mr Delors, after almost 10 years in power, was becoming too big for his boots. By contrast, Sir Leon is preaching the message of Commission restraint. The crucial vote probably lies with Germany. There are persistent rumours that Chancellor Helmut Kohl is not as keen on Mr Lubbers as first thought, despite his fellow Christian Democrat credentials and his long presence on the European stage. Last year, Sir Leon raised his candidacy privately with the German Chancellor; he was rebuffed. Also, the Brittan camp suggests that Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, favours Sir Leon's candidacy. Mr Kinkel is said to have appreciated Sir Leon's success in balancing his independence as the EU's trade negotiator with the need to prevent Franco-German differences over trade from splitting the EU. Sir Leon is also paying attention to the southern states, knowing that their preferred candidate - Spain's prime minister Felipe Gonzalez - appears to have ruled himself out. His strongest card is that none of the 'Club Med' members are likely to be enthusiastic about a northern liberal like Mr Lubbers. Whatever the outcome - and the odds still look to favour Mr Lubbers - Sir Leon's secondary agenda may be simply to convert his new political capital into a big international job other than the presidency of the Commission. At the least, he has avoided the mistake of his last bid for more power in Brussels, an attempt to become one of two vice presidents under Mr Delors. Two commissioners say he never bothered to ask for their vote, and subsequently did not even make the run-off.</p>

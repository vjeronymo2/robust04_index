			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Women who drink beverages with caffeine may take longer to become pregnant, say  scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in  Research Triangle Park, N.C. The study was published in December in The Lancet,  a British medical journal. A group of 104 women planning to become pregnant  provided data on the amount of caffeinated beverages they consumed during the  time they tried to conceive, the study said. Women who drank more than one cup  of caffeinated coffee a day, or the equivalent in tea and colas, took  significantly longer to become pregnant than women who drank less. "Our data  suggests that it is the women's current caffeine consumption, not her past  habits, that affects her fertility," said Dr. Allen J. Wilcox, principal  investigator.  </P></p>

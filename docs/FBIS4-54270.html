			<p>BFN     [Text] Negotiations on insurance and automobiles and auto  parts, two priority sectors in the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks, will resume on 1 and 2 June, respectively.    With regard to automobiles, the government plans to propose  using the actual number of imports of finished cars as one  "objective criterion," and that this criterion shall be  monitored twice a year. It will also work for an agreement on  steps to improve the standards and certification systems within  1994 by calling for a meeting of experts to determine points of  compromise. However, the United States is also expected to  demand an increase in the voluntary plan for purchasing  U.S.-made auto parts compiled recently by Japanese carmakers.  Rough sailing is anticipated in the negotiations.    Division-chief class working level meetings on insurance are  scheduled to reopen in Tokyo on 1 June, and similar meetings on  automobiles and auto parts will start in Washington on 2 June.  Subsequently, U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten and  Deputy Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry  Sozaburo Okamatsu will also hold vice-ministerial level meetings  in Tokyo on 6 June to finalize the automobiles negotiations.    The Japanese Government will make concrete proposals on  objective criteria in the negotiations on automobiles and auto  parts. It will suggest using the following as basis: number of  finished car imports, volume of auto parts purchase, number of  right-hand drive U.S. cars entering the Japanese market, and  others; and progress in these categories will be checked by both  countries twice a year.    Concerning the issue of standards and certification, the  United States has presented a list of 16 demands, including  partial easing of standards for exhaust gas tests. The  government will call for a joint meeting of Japanese and U.S.  experts to discuss this problem. It takes the position that  after listening to the details of the U.S. demands, "we will  draw a conclusion on whether these demands are acceptable within  1994."    At the regular meeting between the Transport Ministry and  the  American Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan to be held on  27 May, before the resumption of the framework talks, the  government will listen again to the U.S. Big Three carmakers'  demands on the issue of standards and certification. It will  also consider setting up a regular venue for dialogue between  the Transport Ministry and the U.S. automobile industry.    In response to U.S. demands, five major Japanese carmakers  led by Toyota Motors compiled their voluntary targets for  additional purchases of U.S.-made auto parts after fiscal 1994.  However, the United States remains unsatisfied, claiming  "compared to the growth of Japanese cars produced in the United  States, purchase of U.S.- made parts is too little."  Furthermore, the United States also demands Japanese Government  "guarantee" for these targets. Since the Japanese side is  opposed to the latter demand, and a point of compromise has not  been found, difficulties are expected in the upcoming  negotiations.    On the other hand, with regard to insurance, Japan has taken  the initiative to implement steps to clarify standards for  issuing licenses and product certification, which is one of the  U.S. demands. Therefore, the negotiations will concentrate on  the focal issue of delaying the liberalization of the third  sector insurance. Japanese life and non-life insurers are  expected to be allowed to participate in this sector two years  later. The United States is actually asking for a postponement  of this measure. The Finance Ministry indicates that an  agreement is near at hand, affirming "the negotiations have come  to the stage of coordinating details of the final agreement."  Final adjustments seem to be under way on how to incorporate  the postponement of liberalization in the agreement.</p>

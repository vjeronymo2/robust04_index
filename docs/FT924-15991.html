			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Bipartisan US drive for reform SENATORS Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici yesterday made a bipartisan appeal for a long-term programme of reforms to strengthen the US economy and reduce the budget deficit. At a news conference, they urged a radical re-shaping of the tax system, involving the replacement of personal income taxes by consumption taxes, as part of a strategy to increase national savings and balance the federal budget by 2002. They also urged deep cuts in planned federal spending so as to help pay for more investment in education, training and commercially relevant research and development. Mr Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, and Mr Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, were releasing the first report of the Strengthening of America Commission, a bipartisan group of 60 prominent Americans assembled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank.</p>

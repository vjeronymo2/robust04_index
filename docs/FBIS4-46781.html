			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Vasylovych Pavlychko, a Ukrainian </F> poet and politician, by Petro Ovchar: "No More Docility"]    [Text] "Pavlychko didn't lose the election, Ukraine  did!" ..."We are spiritually impoverished by Pavlychko's absence  from the parliament" ..."Someone finds it convenient to bring  Ukraine to her knees before Russia with a parliament packed with  Marchenkos, Morozes and their like. Its a tragedy that Pavlychko  is not among the deputies that defend Ukrainian independence...."    I heard many similar comments on April 22 by the parliament  building, and decided to meet with Dmytro Vasylovych Pavlychko,  a well-known Ukrainian poet and politician, for a frank  interview and discussion.    [Ovchar] Why didn't you run for parliament in the Western  oblast where a victory was a sure thing, but instead in Chyhyryn?    [Pavlychko] It was not my intention to win for the sake of  winning. I knew that in Eastern Ukraine it would be difficult to  win, but I felt that from a moral point of view it would be more  honest to lose in the East than be elected in the West. Of  course I wanted to be in the new parliament and had every right  to be. Ukraine has made significant progress in international  politics and it was in this area that I had the most experience.  Nevertheless, elections are an important aspect in developing a  new consciousness in our nation, and I decided to run in a  region where national consciousness had been most severely  oppressed for hundreds of years. The Chyhyryn region is the  nucleus of our statehood, a fact well understood by our enemies.  For that reason even the mildest display of national pride  evoked much more severe repressions than in Galicia. I am  referring to the savage executions carried out by the Cheka and  NKVD after the fall of the Kholodnyy Yar republic. On March 9 of  this year we commemorated Shevchenko at my initiative, the first  such celebration after many decades. Someone had to go to  Chyhyryn, if only to renew the tradition of celebrating  Shevchenko.    Having gone to Chyhyryn I also avoided running against  people  with similar beliefs from Rukh and other democratic parties.  This was quite important to me, since I cannot conceive of  anything more degrading than a squabble among friends and mutual  recriminations. This move avoided confrontation with some of the  more hard-headed `fighters for Ukraine'. It made it possible for  me to take up a fight for a new way of thinking, for a new way  of perceiving Ukrainian history and Ukraine's current situation,  and for a new world outlook. This is a struggle that will take a  lot of time.    True, I lost, but I got a sixth of the votes. The people who  supported me are the strongest proponents of reforms, democracy  and statehood for Ukraine in the Chyhyryn and Kamyanskyy rayons  in the Cherkasy Oblast.    Think how much support we--democrats--would have in Eastern  Ukraine if we did not spend all our time in the cities and  villages of Galicia but went to the Dnieper region, Donbas, and  Southern Ukraine. Even if we failed to wins seats in the  parliament we would raise the consciousness of hundreds of  thousands or even millions of our countrymen!    [Ovchar] Recently the press reported that deputy Serhiy  Holovatyy hinted that those who found National Rukh have lost  their ideals, sold their souls to satan, and now seek cushy  government jobs. Referring to you he said "...the Draches and  Pavlychkos turned power over to the communists and then joined  their camp." Comments?    [Pavlychko] Four years ago I was one of Holovatyy's trusted  colleagues when the parliament was being formed. I liked that  young lawyer very much and it pains me to talk about him now. He  acts like a narcissistic, conceited child. His baseless and  vulgar attacks on the Ukrainian president are a reflection of  his crudeness, and he has accused me, Drach and other deputies  of collaborating with satan. This was in connection with the  establishment of the Kievan patriarchate, a great achievement in  our history. At least we have one independent Christian church.  The fact that he is attempting to undermine this very  institution suggest that something more is involved, but it is  beneath my dignity to devote any more time to him and his base  behavior.    [Ovchar] Still, why did you select Chyhyryn and not, for  example, an electoral district in the Kherson region?    [Pavlychko] The first poem I learned by heart was  Shevchenko's The Desecrated Grave (Rozryta Mohyla). Shevchenko's  Chyhyryn and Subotiv lie at the heart of my being. I had a  teacher from Chyhyryn, Anastasiya Leontiyivna Korsunivska. When  battles were being fought in Kosmach between the UPA [Ukranian  Insurgent Army] and NKVD [People's Commissariat of Internal  Affairs] batallions, and in Yabloniv you could hear the  explosion of grenades and other munitions, she was teaching us  history in the eight grade. She taught us names of the cossack  hetmans, colonels and haydamaks with the full knowledge that at  that very instance the followers of Bandera were dying for our  freedom while serving in units named in honor of the  Doroshenkos, Hamaliyas, Charnots, Zaliznyaks. In the summer of  1952, after graduating from the university, I lived for several  weeks in Borovytsya with my friend O. Shchyrytsya. My stay in  that village--the home of otaman Pavlyuk--has been etched into  my memory forever. I covered the Chyhyryn region on foot and  still have friends in the villages dating back from that time.  Then and later I visited Subotiv, Medvedivka, Stetsivka and  other villages in that sacred land. I chose Chyhyryn because I  feel close to it and know it quite well. Because I love this old  cossack capital I founded the "Fund for the Restoration of  Hetman B. Khmelnytskyy's Residence in Chyhyryn" long before I  even thought of running for a deputy.    [Ovchar] What will happen to this fund now?    [Pavlychko] I will continue to serve as president of this  benevolent organization. The fund has its articles of  organization and a bank account at the Ukrinbank in Kiev. I will  do what I can to see to it that it continues to grow. Chyhyryn  and the worldwide Ukrainian community will celebrate the 400th  anniversary of birthday of Hetman Khmelnytskyy in December,  1995. B. Khmelnytskyy was the founder of the Ukrainian state in  cossack times. Without his accomplishment it would be hard to  imagine a drive to independence and a sense of national dignity  in our people. His oath to the tsar was as much a diplomatic  maneuver as was his oath to the Polish crown before the final  liberation of Ukraine from Polish nobility. Much too late I.  Mazepa attempted to carry out Khmelnytskyy's plans. As a symbol  of Ukrainian independence Chyhyryn will attract more and more  people, and I see a great and happy future for it. But for now  it is a destitute and unhappy city. The nuclear power station  remains unfinished and thousands are unemployed. What can be  done to save the qualified workers capable of providing Ukraine  with the energy it needs but who don't have the opportunity to  exercise their skills and expertise? I have gotten in touch with  Western investors about the frozen Chyhyryn nuclear power plant  and will continue with these efforts.    [Ovchar] What was the main reason for your defeat?    [Pavlychko] The primary voter here is a villager, a  collective farm worker. I met with them, but not in mass  meetings or clubs, but largely with working brigades. In other  words, with small numbers. The major political force here is the  head of a collective farm. These types agitated against me for  their candidate, I. Vasyura, the head of the Khoduliyiv  Collective Farm. They are the feudal lords whom the farm workers  fear to offend because they are completely dependent on them  economically. It is a hard life. The majority of the farm  workers are older people and retirees and they fear the collapse  of the collective farms. Who is going to take care of them then?  Who is going to supple them with the necessities of life? A  private farmer? They don't trust him. And they're right!    I think a different approach to farm reforms would be more  suitable than the one advocated by the parliament. I had to make  peace between collective farm workers and private farmers in  Lubyanky in the Ternopil region. Transferring large measures of  land to private hands will mean social conflict in the village.  Everyone in a collective farm realizes that they will not get as  much land in the future as is now being granted because there  simply won't be enough land. The collective farm worker will  regard the private farmer as an enemy until all the land is  privatized and the amount of land in one's possession is  determined by market forces and individual abilities.    But my realistic--in fact, pro-collective farm--program was  not heard, and I was presented as an enemy of the collective  farm. All those who were bad off in the collective farms and  whose condition had deteriorated even more voted against me. In  addition, all those philistines for whom the collective farm is  now a paradise because there is no higher authority to order  them around or punish them also voted against me to preserve  their status quo.    [Ovchar] You said the villages are made up of old people.  But  aren't younger people returning because life there is now easier  than in the cities?    [Pavlychko] Very few are coming back, and the villages are  dying out. In Stetsivka fifty people died and two were born in  1994. If the young people who left the villages don't come back  our chornozem will soon be covered with weeds. Consequently,  farm reforms are an absolute must to save our people since the  collective village is dying out. The Moscow-type of `developed'  socialism created such disparities between the village and the  city that we now have no choice but favor villages over cities  to attract young people there to enjoy a more comfortable  lifestyle that is closer to nature. This will require new laws  and reorientation of national goals.    [Ovchar] How do you feel about the elections in general and  what do you think the new parliament will be like?    [Pavlychko] I have no tragic prognoses. The elections were  held in the midst of nostalgia for times when bread was cheap  and human dignity had no value. The state took care of its  slaves and provided food while trampling on human, national and  civil rights. These elections, particularly in Eastern Ukraine,  are reminiscent of the rebellion that Moses encountered while  leading the Israelites out of Egypt to the Promised Land of  Canaan. This too will pass and there is no going back. The  majority of the new deputies are not party members and are not  disposed to turn Ukraine back into a colony of an imperial  system headed by Zhirinovskiy or Zyuganov.    I have confidence in the new deputies and hope that  political  ambitions and differences between the parties will be set aside  so that we can proceed with economic reforms. We need a new  government that will increase our exports and income, reverse  the outflow of dollars earned by our people, balance the budget  and introduce the hryvnya.    I am against presidential elections since they are  unconstitutional. Kravchuk agreed to limit his term to four  years rather than five, which means that presidential elections  can be held in December of next year. Until we decide who is to  hold executive power--the president or the prime minister--and  until the parliament is at full strength and all the local  elections and other problems that have troubled us are settled,  a presidential election would lead to economic instability and  discord.    [Ovchar] I would be remiss if I did not inquire about any  new  literary endeavours in your life?    [Pavlychko] Chyhyryn means a lot to me and in my free time I  have written a cycle of poems entitled "Chyhyryn" which I would  like to offer to the readers of LITERATURNA UKRAYINA. (The poems  are published below--Eds.)    [Ovchar] Do you have any comments on the article by Yu.  Badzo  "Let's Not Commit Suicide for Nothing," recently published in  LITERATURNA UKRAYINA?    [Pavlychko] That was a new democratic manifesto not limited  to the democratically oriented parties. We have no `government  party' and Ukrainian communists are not a new creation. However,  many of the old members of the CPU were secretly for  independence. The democratic forces must cooperate with the  individuals who have no party affiliation, i.e, the mythical  `government party', since our main objective is the preservation  of our statehood. Only an independent Ukraine can guarantee  social justice, and independence requires consolidation of all  of our citizens.    [Ovchar] What will you do now that you are 'free'?    [Pavlychko] Be involved in literature and politics, same as  before. You can work at statehood without being a deputy. As a  member of the Democratic Party of Ukraine I will strive to unite  the various small democratic parties into a single, solid  political organization, otherwise we will fall prey to  individual ambitions and lose our statehood, as has happened  before in our history.    [Ovchar] What do you mean by a single political  organization?    [Pavlychko] A political party. At the Khust conference I had  advocated transforming Rukh into a political party. My proposal  was not supported and Rukh fell apart into a number of parties.  There were other reasons for that too--leaders that could not  find common ground. The tragedy lies in the fact that our  divisions were not along political lines but as followers of  different leaders. I think the time has come for these leaders  to step down since their activities are placing our national  independence at risk. We could then unite the democratic  organizations with Rukh into a powerful political entity that  could promote Ukrainian statehood. The present leaders must be  made to realize that their time is up.    [Ovchar] The elections also revealed flaws in the election  laws because of all the irregularities. What are your views on  this?    [Pavlychko] To put it gently, the election law is not very  democratic. Anyone can run as long as he and his wife and  children can get 300 signatures on a petition. In addition, a  candidate that lost in one district cannot run in another even  if drafted. Another major mistake is that elections were not  carried out as they were in Russia, where half of the deputies  were elected from political parties according to a proportional  system. In that case individual candidates are elected as well  as representatives of certain political viewpoints. However, our  parliament passed a law to preserve itself at any cost. We had  to vote for 450 deputies although we don't need such a large  number of parliamentarians, and do so under a majority system.    [Ovchar] Thank you for the interview and the discussion and,  despite all the setbacks and problems, I wish you much success  in your future literary and political activities.</p>

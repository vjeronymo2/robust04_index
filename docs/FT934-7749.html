			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (2): Power people in waiting - Patti Waldmeir identifies who's who in the new South Africa AFTER nearly four years in the news, everyone knows Messrs Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk, who are likely to remain the two most important men in South African politics. Their relationship will change: Mr Mandela is overwhelmingly likely to take over as president, while Mr de Klerk will be relegated to the status of second deputy president, behind another deputy from the ANC who will act as de facto prime minister to Mr Mandela. But their strengths and weaknesses will remain the same, however their titles may change: to the outside world, they are largely a known quantity. But the new government will be influenced by a host of politicians whom outsiders know either less well, or not at all. Some have emerged from the trade union movement, some from the ranks of the African National Congress in exile, some from its guerrilla wing and others from the enlightened wing of the National Party. Others still come from Inkatha, or the corporate world. Predicting who will be who in the new South Africa is inevitably an inexact science: partly, it will depend on the scramble, only now beginning, to reach the top of each party's electoral list (voters will not choose individual members of parliament, but will vote a straight party list). Lists will be chosen by parties themselves: in the case of the ANC, after strong input from the membership. But some individuals seem almost certain to rise to the top of the pile, whether electorally, or by exercising influence outside parliament. They are: Thabo Mbeki: recently promoted to the post of ANC national chairman, Mr Mbeki could well fill the post of first deputy president under Mr Mandela. (This post might naturally have gone to Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, but he insists he does not want it). Mr Mbeki, for many years the head of the ANC's department of international affairs, is urbane, moderate, articulate and the darling of the business community. Son of one of the ANC's most famous elder statesmen - radical Govan Mbeki, 83, who is now retired - Mr Mbeki was born in 1942 and took an MA in economics from Sussex University. During nearly 30 years in exile, he developed the kind of middle-class tastes which reassure whites, and cheer the hearts of foreign investors: nattily dressed and puffing on the ubiquitous pipe, Mr Mbeki speaks the language of the monied classes while mysteriously retaining grassroots support at the same time. Cyril Ramaphosa: No less charming than Mr Mbeki - and becoming a rapid convert to South Africa's unrivalled version of the 'good life' - Mr Ramaphosa insists he will not enter parliament, but will stay to build the ANC for the crucial, post-liberation elections in 1999. Mr Ramaphosa had a solid popular base in the National Union of Mineworkers which he left to become ANC secretary-general in 1991 but has spent almost all his time since locked in negotiations with the government and other parties. His image has suffered as talks have dragged on, and he risks being blamed for concessions made; but the truth is that this witty 41-year-old, a consummate negotiator, has outmanoeuvred the government on many crucial issues, and delivered a deal which favours the ANC. His economic views lean toward the socialist - though he keeps them hidden - and he is likely to prove effective in building the ANC's constituency. Derek Keys: Mr Mandela can send no more powerful signal to foriegn investors than to keep Mr Keys on as finance minister in the new Government. As National Party minister of finance, Mr Keys, 62, has trodden carefully with the anti-apartheid opposition, bringing them along with him every step of the way to a new debt rescheduling deal, a joint pitch on foreign investment, and a commitment on fiscal discipline to the International Monetary Fund. After 30 years as one of South Africa's top businessmen, Mr Keys is a technocrat rather than a politician, and may well survive into the new era. Likewise, his respected counterpart at the South African Reserve Bank (central bank), Chris Stals, who has done much to tame inflation and restore international financial credibility. Roelf Meyer: chief government negotiator, Mr Meyer, 46, hails from the ranks of the enlightened nationalists. He and colleagues Leon Wessels, Dawie de Villiers and Sam de Beer see a bright multiracial future where whites will continue to exercise influence by virtue of their strength in the civil service, the economy and the security forces. Joe Slovo, chairman of the South African Communist Party, has arguably done more to deliver a moderate constitutional deal than anyone apart from Mr Mandela himself. Despite his socialist economic views, he is likely to be a force for pragmatism for some time to come. Jacob Zuma, one of the few leading Zulus in the ANC, is almost guaranteed a top position. Sober and reasonable, he has handled delicate negotiations with Inkatha well. Tokyo Sekwale, voted the sexiest man in Johannesburg in a recent radio poll, is a charismatic populist of far more radical views; he is likely to try to push ANC economic policies in a radical direction. Sam Shilowa, recently elected general secretary of the largest union federation, Cosatu, will fight for union independence under the new government, and will not be shy to use his power if government forgets its commitments to the masses. Moses Mayekiso, head of the South African National Civic Organisation, will also prove a radical focus. Last and most difficult to assess, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, will play a principal role from within or without the new government. With his irritable and unpredictable personality, he is likely to prove difficult to manage, whether he accepts or rejects the deal. Only time will tell which he will choose.</p>

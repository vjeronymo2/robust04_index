			<p>BFN     [Text] Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard  Baltin in an interview with INTERFAX denied reports that the  Fleet's ships left for sea on Thursday to block the Slavutich  ship of the Ukrainian Naval Board.    Slavutich was in Odessa where it took part in the  celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the city's liberation  from the Nazis, and is currently moving toward Sevastopol.    According to Baltin, a marine ship of the Black Sea Fleet  left for Odessa on 14 April to take on board military servicemen  of a Black Sea Fleet division and their families. However,  since the Ukrainian defense minister ordered the ports of  Odessa, Nikolayev, Ochakov, Ismail and Kherson not to let Black  Sea Fleet ships in, the ship had to return to Sevastopol.    In the meantime, Head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's  press service Aleksandr Kluban told INTERFAX-Ukraine, the  Ukrainian Defense Ministry granted all of its resources -- ships  and air transport -- to take out those military servicemen. In  particular, there was a proposal to transport people on board  the Slavutich.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Pakistan and France sign power deal FRANCE and Pakistan have signed two financial protocols, to a total value of FFr1bn (Pounds 103.2m) for French companies to build two conventional power stations in Pakistan. But a French offer to supply Pakistan with a 900MW nuclear power station has been put on hold, because France now insists all civil nuclear exports must be subject to inspection under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The protocols were agreed during the visit to Paris of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister. The two sides also agreed the sale of three French minesweepers to Pakistan, to a value of FFr1.3bn. The French offer to supply a nuclear power station was first made by President Francois Mitterrand just under two years ago. France has continued to assert its readiness to co-operate with Pakistan in the civil nuclear field, but only in conformity with the controls required by France's adherence to the NPT. France is also reported to have agreed to pay Pakistan FFr600m to settle a long-standing dispute about the decision in 1978, by President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, to cancel an agreement to supply Pakistan with a nuclear reprocessing plant.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Wheeler deals in Formula One: Honda pulls out as teams and drivers jostle for position THE multi-million-pound Formula One soap was in something of a spin yesterday as it gathered for this weekend's Italian grand prix at Monza. Yesterday's announcement by the Japanese carmaker Honda that it will withdraw from grand prix motor racing - which it has dominated with McLaren cars for most of a decade - at the close of the current racing season in November, was only part of a plot even Dallas audiences might have found hard to swallow. Such is the brouhaha over the future of top drivers and teams that tomorrow's gruelling 250-mile race could be relegated to a sideshow. Behind the curtains of their giant American motor homes in the Monza paddock, executives of such big corporate sponsors as Benetton, the Italian clothing group, and the tobacco giant RJ Reynolds, which annually sink hundreds of millions of pounds into grand prix racing, were gleefully contemplating such publicity-rich cliffhangers as: Will ace British driver Nigel Mansell stay with the Williams-Renault grand prix team for next season despite having just become 1992 world champion? Will Ayrton Senna, the brilliant but disillusioned Brazilian driver and winner of last year's championship leave McLaren and drive for Williams for nothing? Will Williams offer Senna Mansell's slot if the British champion leaves them and will Frenchman and former three-times world champion Alain Prost, whose contract with Williams excludes Senna as a possible team-mate, blow a gasket if that happens? Last night McLaren was understood to be preparing a statement disclosing the identity of a new engine supplier and Mansell, after dominating practice yesterday, hinted that his negotiations with Williams would probably be resolved over the weekend. The size of his retainer - a mere Dollars 10m last year - appears to have been the main stumbling block as well as a precise condition for working with Prost. But an even more potent player is waiting in the wings. American Michael Andretti, son of 1978 world champion, Mario Andretti, has been signed to drive for McLaren next year, having just been crowned Indy/Cart champion, North America's equivalent of grand prix racing. The signing of Andretti is likely to spark a major resurgence of interest, with the prospect of big new injections of US sponsorship cash and potentially lucrative broadcasting contracts. For Honda, struggling in the face of flagging sales and image fortunes in North America, that would be deeply ironic. The company's decision to withdraw is a sign of changing times for Japanese carmakers, which have been battered by falling sales and plunging profits. Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, denied the decision was aimed at saving money, but said the 100 engineers working full-time on the racing effort were needed elsewhere in the company, in part to bolster research and development efforts relating to the environment. Mr Kawamoto showed not a trace of emotion - or irony - as he announced a decision similar to one that almost drove him from the company 25 years ago. Mr Kawamoto, as a young engineer, was in the midst of designing an F1 engine in 1968 when Honda decided to withdraw from racing. He was so disgusted he stopped coming to work for several months and nearly resigned.</p>

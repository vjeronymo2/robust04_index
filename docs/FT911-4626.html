			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Vote on Italian government put off Italy's chamber of deputies has put off until tomorrow a vote of confidence on Mr Giulio Andreotti's new government, in order to allow more time for debate, writes Haig Simonian in Rome. The decision, which came just before Mr Andreotti began presenting yesterday the government's programme for the remaining year of the current legislature, followed a request by the Republican party, which has decided no longer to participate in the five-party coalition.</p>

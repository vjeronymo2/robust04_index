			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (1): Radical changes in the global marketplace - With rapid advances in technology and intense competition among the world's telecommunication service suppliers, customers in many countries are beginning to enjoy the benefits of lower prices and improved standards of service - but there is still a long way to go THE world telecommunications industry is in the midst of a radical restructuring, driven by the need to survive in a newly dynamic and competitive global marketplace - and to exploit fast-changing technologies which can give customers a competitive edge. Already many of the old boundaries and regulations in the Dollars 300bn-a-year worldwide telecommunications service sector have crumbled, and others are under attack. Historically, the highly protected national post and telecommunications organisations (PTOs) which controlled domestic and international telecommunications had little incentive to improve efficiency, introduce new services or cut charges. Generally they they faced little, if any, competition and were able to develop their business at a leisurely pace, often with little apparent regard for customer needs. Because their foreign counterparts also enjoyed monopoly status, there was little opportunity to expand overseas. But beginning in the early 1980s this cosy relationship began to be rocked by three powerful and inter-related forces - privatisation, liberalisation and globalisation. In the wake of the court-appointed break-up of the Bell system in the US other countries, led by the UK in Europe and Japan in the Far East, began adopting policies designed to foster competition. Since then, the PTOs in many nations have been split into separate post and telecommunications administrations, with the telecommunications business sold to the private sector. This process continues to gather pace: according to Booz-Allen Hamilton, the management consultants, between 1991 and 1993, telecom companies in a further 26 countries, responsible for 95m lines, are expected to be privatised. In Europe, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, Germany's state-owned telecommunications group, plans to raise DM20bn from a privatisation sale on international markets. However, Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive, said last month that the flotation would not be possible before 1996 at the earliest and less than 50 per cent of the company would be sold. With their monopoly rights abolished, or at least curtailed, many of these newly-privatised telecommunications groups have began to follow their multinational business customers and expand globally through acquisition, strategic alliances, or as stake-holders in consortia bidding for new operating licences. British Telecom is among those with ambitious international plans. The UK carrier is planning to invest about Pounds 500m over the next 10 years to build an overseas network infrastructure to support its ambition to become the world's leading telecommunications group. The investment project, code-named Cyclone, will start with the installation next year of four large computerised exchanges in New York, Frankfurt, London and Sydney, followed by a further 28 switching centres in main business centres worldwide. In addition, BT has set up Syncordia, a US-based subsidiary designed to provide sophisticated telecommunications services to multinationals. Syncordia, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was originally intended be a strategic partnership between BT and its German and Japanese counterparts, Deutsche Telekom and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. But the effort to expand Syncordia's membership did not work out as intended and while there is continuing speculation about possible new partners, Deutsche Telekom has broken away and formed a rival enterprise called Eunetcom with France Telecom. NEVERTHELESS, these and other moves underline the revolution in the structure of the industry that is taking place against the backdrop of a market that continues to expand at 10-15 per cent a year. International telephone traffic grew by 13 per cent last year to about 35bn minutes and has increased six-fold over the past decade, according to the London-based International Institute of Communications. Across the range of international telecommunications services, the traditional order is being challenged by a new generation of telecommunications service providers - including some that own no physical hardware at all. Mr Gregory Staple, a Washington-based communications lawyer and editor of the International Institute of Communications's recently published study of the global communications market,* argues that the business of providing international telecom services is going through a 'paradigm shift.' Most international telecommunications services are still provided by national carriers which inter-connect their 'half-circuits' to provide end-to-end communications channels. These facility-based or 'heavy carriers' jointly own the international cable and satellite systems which make up the backbone of the global network. Over the past decade, technology and competition have begun to challenge this model - advances in micro-electronics, fibre optics and network software on the one hand, and progressive market liberalisation on the other, 'have brought forward a new paradigm for end-to-end global service,' says Mr Staple. The new model is being pioneered by a novel type of 'light carrier' which provides international service by re-selling, re-routing, re-packaging or re-programming the offerings of the heavy carriers. 'Primarily software-based, the 'light carrier' is a telephone company in name only. It is driven by services and applications not facilities, and it may not own a single transmission cable or satellite circuit,' he says. The largest of this new generation of 'light carriers' are companies like Electronic Data Systems (EDS), Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and General Electric Information Services company (GEIS) which already manage the cross-border private line and data-processing requirements of leading multinationals and have annual revenues of several billion dollars. Liberalisation is one of the main factors fostering the growth of these services and lower international call prices. For example, last month the UK government joined a handful of others in sanctioning a new form of competition called 'simple re-sale' on routes from the UK to Australia, Canada and Sweden. Simple re-sale will allow operators to lease international circuits in bulk from British Telecommunications and Mercury Communications and resell services. Customers will be able to access the resellers services via the public telephone network - which has Turn to back page of survey A changing marketplace Continued from page one: not been permitted under the more restricted form of resale allowed since last year. Government motives behind moves towards privatisation and liberalisation have been mixed. In the UK, the driving force was the political conviction that private ownership would be more efficient than public ownership. But elsewhere other factors have been more important. In some developing nations, including those in eastern Europe, the prime motive has been a recognition that central government lacked the funds to modernise and extend the inadequate networks. However, privatisation and liberalisation have almost always gone hand-in-glove because although many governments were prepared to tolerate state-run monopolies, they have been much less willing to sanction private sector monopolies. Even those governments, such as Germany and France which have retained a large element of state ownership in the telecommunications sector, have also found it desirable to liberalise the market and introduce competition, for example in the provision of cellular mobile services. But liberalisation has not necessarily meant de-regulation. Indeed, to ensure fair play for new entrants in liberalised markets many governments have actually established tougher regulatory regimes. Most governments have also stopped short of totally abolishing monopoly rights and have not necessarily moved in step with each other. In Europe, the European Commission has so far only required competition in terminal equipment and data services and not in basic voice telephony, although some governments - like the UK - have moved considerably further down the liberalisation path. After much discussion and delay, the Commission has still to unveil the next stage of its programme to open up the Dollars 110bn European telecommunications sector to full and harmonised competition. While the aim is to create a market with lower prices, a wider variety of services and more intensive use of telecommunications, the French government in particular continues to oppose further rapid liberalisation in Europe. Nevertheless, the Commission can claim credit for pushing ahead with the Groupe Special Mobile (GSM) communications digital standard which, according to Dr Peter Radley, director of Alcatel's mobile communications division, 'has been a great European marketing success,' and, despite its complexity, has helped give European equipment manufactures a key advantage over their international competitors. Indeed, European equipment manufacturers have emerged well-placed from the wave of consolidation which has already swept through the telecommunications equipment sector to produce just a handful of really big players. According to Dataquest figures, the league table is now led by Alcatel of France with Dollars 15.53bn of revenues in 1991; followed by Siemens of Germany, including its UK-based GPT 40:60 joint venture with Britain's GEC; AT&amp;T of the US; Canada's Northern Telecom; NEC from Japan; Sweden's Ericsson; and Motorola of the US. 'The ranking clearly shows the continued concentration of the telecoms equipment industry in the hands of a declining number of suppliers,' says Dataquest. 'Global companies continue to grow by acquisition and alliances as they are forced to expand internationally . . national companies are finding it increasingly difficult to fund the R&amp;D necessary to survive alone.' This international R&amp;D effort has already delivered technologies such as fibre optics which are changing the face of telecommunications. Other new, and often software-driven, technologies like digital cellular mobile telephony, low earth orbit satellite systems and desktop video conferencing are now emerging from the research laboratories. And although integrated services digital network (ISDN) services have been slower to take-off than many predicted, there is little doubt that in the longer term voice and data communications and data processing systems are converging. Advances in technology are enabling the network operators to assemble more flexible, customised and value-added communications services like electronic mail, enhanced fax and on-line computer services often aimed directly at business users. For example, one of the latest acronyms to emerge from an industry which generates more buzzwords than most is the 'VPN' or virtual private network which enables business customers to use the public network as if it were a private network, with all the advantages of cost savings, maintenance and support. In developing countries, including eastern Europe, cellular mobile systems are helping provide an alternative to unreliable and over-stretched fixed wire systems while in the West new lightweight low-cost digital Personal Communications Network services could finally provide a real mass market alternative to the hard-wired telephone. The main beneficiaries from this new era of liberalised telecommunications services are likely to be the industry's customers who have been demanding more application-specific system solutions to gain or maintain a competitive edge in their own industrial sectors. These customers stand to gain from access to a much wider range of more competitively-priced and higher quality products and services delivered by the survivors of the current maelstrom. Already, customers in many countries are beginning to enjoy the benefits of lower prices and better standards of service, for mobile as well as fixed services. But there is still a long way to go. Mr Staple estimates that at least 60 per cent of the world's 580m telephone subscribers still pay relatively high prices for making international calls simply because of where they happen to live. * TeleGeography, 1992; published by the International Institute of Communications.</p>

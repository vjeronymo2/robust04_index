			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / M-way service sites to increase as controls are eased MANY MORE motorway service areas will be built under new arrangements announced by the government yesterday. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the private sector, instead of the government, would now decide where to build the service areas. The minimum distance between them would be cut from 30 miles to 15 miles. Strict rules will prevent service areas expanding into other activities such as shopping and entertainment, however, because the department does not wish them to become destinations in their own right. There were fears such a development would generate extra traffic and that existing facilities in nearby communities might be jeopardised. At present, sites for motorway service areas are identified by the transport department. It seeks planning permission for the areas and acquires the necessary land. The department lets the sites to private companies which build and operate the service areas under long leases in return for premium payments and peppercorn rents. The new system will leave it to the private sector to decide where to build service areas. Companies will seek planning permission from local authorities and acquire the land. Some curbs will still apply. Free parking, toilets and picnic areas will have to be provided, all facilities will have to be be available to the disabled, fuel will have to be on sale 24 hours a day and alcohol sales will be banned. Mr MacGregor said the new arrangements would give private operators more scope to respond to the needs of motorists without jeopardising welcome aspects of the existing system. 'The old regime for motorway services did not always succeed in providing drivers with the facilities they required at the right intervals,' he said. 'Although there are schemes in the pipeline, you can still drive from Folkestone to Birmingham on the M20, M25 and M40, for example, without meeting a single service area.' The Council for the Protection of Rural England yesterday gave a cautious reaction to the proposals. 'There is a real risk that developers will be looking at these new opportunities to obtain a toehold for development in previously unavailable countryside locations,' it said. But they were welcomed by the Automobile Association and the Freight Transport Association. Editorial Comment, Page 12</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Concita De Gregorio: "Democratic Party of the </F> Left Divided Between D'Alema and Veltroni"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- The duelists, i.e., the main characters  on the scene: [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Deputy  Secretary] Massimo D'Alema and [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni.  The "great old men," the forefathers capable of spreading a  safety net under the free-falling party: [former Chamber of  Deputies speaker] Giorgio Napolitano and [outgoing Italian  General Confederation of Labor Secretary General] Bruno Trentin.  The young mayors, ready to stand in for any of the main actors  who may suffer an accident: Antonio Bassolino (Naples), and  Walter Vitali (Bologna). The competent and telegenic  "outsiders" who are natural candidates for the anti-Berlusconi  hero's role: [Venice Mayor] Massimo Cacciari and [Rome Mayor]  Francesco Rutelli, neither of whom is a PDS member but who, as  it is commonly said, belong to the "same area." They are all  under 50, apart from the sages who are about 70. In many cases,  their relations are difficult, except for the "old men," who  keep quiet. One of these men will be the PDS's next secretary.  The selection process had been going on for some time now, but,  officially, the campaigning starts today.    For a single (and, moreover, uncomfortable) post, this may  seem a long list, but after all, there are only six candidates  plus two alternates, and the real match is only between two of  them. Indeed, Botteghe Oscure's [PDS headquarters] spin doctors  are saying: "There is no confrontation, there will be no  confrontation." The PDS has never witnessed an open tug of war  between two candidates, the party follows a "tradition" of full  consensus, of unanimous agreement on a single name. If there is  a struggle, it takes place before, behind the scenes.  Officially, there will be no war: Everybody will want D'Alema  or everybody will want Veltroni. However, since 39-year old  Walter Veltroni, L'UNITA's chief editor, is telling anyone who  wants to listen that he is happy with his paper, which is so  successful, that he has no wish to become PDS secretary, and  that, in any case, he is not prepared to run as a candidate for  one side (in this case, Occhetto's side), it is difficult to see  where the problem or the uncertainty really lie. It would seem  that only Alema, 45, is actually in the contest. D'Alema has a  majority in the party and among the regional secretaries. If a  ballot were held now -- they assured us at Botteghe Oscure's  press office -- he would most certainly become the PDS's next  leader.  <H5>  Cacciari Is Not a Member </H5>   Where, then, does the problem lie? In the fact that Occhetto  did not leave peacefully and resignedly on the eve of the  congress, handing over power to his official successor, as  D'Alema -- on the evening of the European elections -- had  suggested he should do. Occhetto left in a huff and at once,  cursing his enemies, first and foremost his internal enemies,  particularly Cacciari and D'Alema. "`I am leaving, but you  will also have to leave,' is written in that letter," said one  of Occhetto's "colonels" who was among the first to leave  Botteghe Oscure yesterday afternoon. [passage omitted]  <H5>  An Invention by the Papers </H5>   What if Cacciari were indeed the name that the PDS is  looking  for? "Look, Cacciari is an invention by the papers, he is  completely extraneous to the party, and is altogether unpopular.  He is not even a member, he has no chance at all," one of the  leaders closest to Occhetto says sharply. Achille [Occhetto]  hates him, since he was the man who first posed the problem of  succession. However, whether Occhetto likes it or not, Cacciari  has all the requisites which by now the PDS acknowledges in a  potential anti-Berlusconi leader: He is telegenic and cultured,  he is fascinating, witty, fairly young, and women like him. In  addition, he is a philosopher, not just some sort of bureaucrat.  "Let us keep things separate. One thing is the leader of the  progressives, and another the PDS' secretary," Umberto Ranieri  suggests. Two different things: a secretary, who must be found  immediately, and a leader for the coalition, who can wait until  later. Given the abovementioned requisites, apart from Cacciari  himself, Francesco Rutelli would also make a good progressive  leader. The same applies to Veltroni, assuming that an  agreement is reached along the lines suggested by some: D'Alema  would immediately become the secretary, whereas Veltroni -- who  is Kennedyesque, charismatic, and appeals to young people --  would become the Left's leader shortly afterwards. Late in the  day, the corridors were buzzing with this question: If the Left  and the PDS choose the same man, who will have the courage to  tell Veltroni?</p>

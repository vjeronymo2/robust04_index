			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIRD WORLD NATIONS COMPLAIN THAT TRADE TALKS EXCLUDE THEM  </P> <P> The world's poor countries, which were drawn into international trade talks  four years ago by promises that they would gain new export markets, are  complaining now that the talks have degenerated in their final scheduled week  into a U.S.-European food fight.  </P> <P> "We have been shut out completely," Mokammel Hague, the Bangladeshi commerce  secretary, said Wednesday. "We are feeling like schoolchildren waiting for the  results to come out of the headmaster's room."  </P> <P> The "headmaster's room" is where U.S. and Western European negotiators are  trying to find common ground on the divisive issue of government payments to  farmers. The United States wants subsidies slashed by 75% and more, but Europe,  intent on preserving its family farmers, has offered no more than 30%.  </P> <P> Ministers of about half the countries participating in the talks met until  shortly after midnight this morning in yet another effort to reconcile their  differences over agriculture and other issues, but the closed session broke up  amid emotional recriminations.  </P> <P> The chairman of the negotiations gave the 12-nation European Community until  noon today to soften its resistance, according to his spokesman.  </P> <P> But the chairman, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Hector Gros-Espiell, did not spell  out the consequences of missing his deadline. A spokesman, David Woods, said,  "You'll just have to wait and see."  </P> <P> Some Third World delegates threatened to keep their signatures off an agreement  prepared without their involvement by the industrial countries.  </P> <P> Brazilian trade ambassador Rubens Ricupero, saying he was speaking for more  than 70 developing countries, said they had made a "firm decision to resist any  attempt to impose a ready-made package put together by a few participants and  presented at the last minute on a take-it-or-leave-it basis."  </P> <P> Ricupero said Third World countries were fed up with a "lack of adequate  attention to the areas of their special interests."  </P> <P> Third World countries have substantial stakes in agriculture and many of the 14  trade arenas under negotiation. Third World textile producers are seeking to  bring down barriers to their goods in the developing countries, and sugar cane  producers want Europe to reduce its subsidies for sugar beets.  </P> <P> Many Third World delegates among the 107 nations at the negotiations are afraid  that the United States and other rich countries want to open Third World  markets to services and to foreign investment without giving much in return.  </P> <P> One Indian delegate said U.S. negotiators were asking the Europeans to open  their borders to farm products and asking Third World countries to allow in  foreign banks and other service providers. "What is the United States willing  to give up?" he wondered.  </P> <P> Madagascar's trade minister, Solofoson Georges, representing African countries  at the talks, warned that any final agreement seemed "almost certain to involve  losses which exceed any possible gains."  </P> <P> "African countries insist on being fully involved in the final stages of the  negotiating process and would not wish to be presented with a fait accompli in  the form of a document decided upon by other participants."  </P> <P> Delegates from the United States and other industrial countries insist that  they take the Third World's needs seriously.  </P> <P> "I think we've been sensitive to that concern," said Deputy U.S. Trade  Representative Rufus Yerxa.  </P> <P> Even the name of the talks symbolizes their importance to the Third World. They  are called the Uruguay Round because they were launched four years ago in that  South American country's resort town of Punta del Este.  </P> <P> Wilfried Thalwitz, senior vice president of the World Bank, told the delegates  that many poor countries had begun discarding their "inward-looking trade  policy" in favor of greater trade with other countries. Their participation in  the current trade talks, he said, demonstrated their new commitment to  international commerce.  </P> <P> Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called  trade the surest way for developing countries to lift themselves out of  poverty.  </P> <P> Researcher Isabelle Maelcamp of The Times' Brussels bureau contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

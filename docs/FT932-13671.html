			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / GPA Group seeks to restructure Dollars 5.5bn debt GPA GROUP, the aircraft leasing company, has given up its attempt to raise new equity before restructuring its Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn) of debts. It now plans to ask its lenders to restructure the debt first, then seek new equity. The change of tack follows problems in raising Dollars 200m through a convertible preference share issue. None of GPA's shareholders have so far been willing to subscribe to the new shares at Dollars 1 compared with the Dollars 30 price at which some of the company's unlisted shares changed hands early last year. GPA has therefore decided to abandon its so-called 'inter-dependence' approach to lenders and aircraft manufacturers, under which each group would have to agree to the refinancing together. Instead it will try to reach an agreement with its lenders first. It then plans to go back to its shareholders and potential new investors in a final attempt to raise new equity. The aircraft manufacturers have already agreed in principle to cancel or change contracts, reducing firm orders for new aircraft from nearly Dollars 11bn to between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn. All but six of GPA's 138 banks have also agreed in principle to to defer Dollars 1bn of debt repayments until 1996. The two banks with the biggest exposure to GPA which have not agreed to the refinancing are ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, and the Arab Banking Corporation. One of the group's core bankers said all the banks would have to sign up to the restructuring by May 7, by which time GPA's directors plan to sign off the year-end accounts. Around Dollars 200m of bonds mature in May and June and bankers do not want to make those payments without an agreement. GPA has hired Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York brokerage house, to help it complete its restructuring. It has already taken on the US investment banking firm James D Wolfensohn to find new investors. DLJ's participation in the restructuring has prompted speculation in the US that the group may be contemplating negotiating with the unsecured debt holders. However, GPA's UK advisers denied such a move was planned. Nomura International, the Japanese investment house working on the convertible, has told shareholders that without their participation the banks will have to take effective control.</p>

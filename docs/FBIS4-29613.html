			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 18 KYODO -- A growing number of rice  retailers have decided to give up their business in the wake of  the rice panic this spring, industry sources said Saturday [18  June].    In the panic, sparked by the shortage of domestic rice on  shelves, many rice sellers were harassed by angry consumers and  robbed of motivation to continue selling rice, the sources said.    Of about 8,000 rice retailers in Tokyo, 78 failed to renew  their licenses for rice sales in June, a procedure required  every three years, according to the Tokyo metropolitan  government.    The number was up 34 percent from three years ago, when 58  sellers abandoned the business.    But the sources said some rice retailers who did extend  their  licenses have handed them over to others and virtually quit.    According to an association of rice retailers in Tokyo, many  of its members were discouraged by commotion during the panicky  rice hoarding earlier this year, which resulted from a scarcity  of domestically grown rice on the market after last year's  devastating harvests.    When stocks were low and grains that were on the shelves  were  priced double and even triple normal costs, many consumers  flooded rice retailers and demanded they sell rice they were  hiding in stock, the association reported.</p>

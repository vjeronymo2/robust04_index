			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: One-off factors help ABF to Pounds 338m ALTHOUGH profits from Associated British Foods, the Kingsmill bread, Ryvita and Burton biscuits, and Silver Spoon sugar group, were significantly above market expectations, much of the 26.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 338m was due to one-off factors and higher investment income. The period covered 53 weeks, with the extra week adding about Pounds 5m to pre-tax profits. Translation effects added Pounds 9m to profits. Operating profits were only 1.5 per cent higher at Pounds 273m. Within that, trading profits from the British Sugar beet business rose from Pounds 139m to Pounds 162m thanks to a record harvest in 1992-93, the revaluation of the green pound and greater efficiencies. This year's harvest was lower but still good, Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said. Total manufacturing operating profits from the UK and Europe, including British Sugar, were Pounds 200m, up from Pounds 191m. Retail profits, mainly the Irish supermarket business, were down from Pounds 45m to Pounds 34m, but this included a Pounds 10m fall to Pounds 13m in the first half. Mr Weston said price cutting in the first half had eased in the second and ABF had recovered market share. Profits from Australia and New Zealand were up 16.1 per cent to Pounds 36m mainly through translation gains. North America, largely Twinings tea, contributed Pounds 3m, a Pounds 1m rise. Pre-tax profits also included investment income of Pounds 83m (Pounds 67m) less interest of Pounds 34m (Pounds 41m). The group's net cash holdings rose from Pounds 409m in the 1992 balance sheet to over Pounds 500m. There was a Pounds 4m (Pounds 2m) profit on property sales. ABF recorded a Pounds 12m rise in the value of its 18.8 per cent stake in Berisford International, after losing Pounds 22m on the shares in 1992 and Pounds 100m in 1991. Earnings rose 37 per cent to 50.7p. A second interim dividend of 6.5p (5.5p) makes a 15p (14p) total.</p>

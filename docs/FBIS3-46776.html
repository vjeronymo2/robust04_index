They are seeking compensation of 300 million U.S. dollars  for  illnesses caused by the herbicide agent orange, and were offered  30 million dollars in August last year by the U.S. chemical  companies, which include Dow Chemical Co. and Monsanto company.    Spokesman Pae Nam-su, 50, said he filed the suit against the  seven manufacturers of the dioxin-based herbicide, widely used  as a defoliant in the Vietnam war, in May 1993 on behalf of 204  Korean victims in the State Court of Texas and expects the first  hearing this April.    The veterans association sent a list of 100 names, including  Pae's, who have been recognized with agent orange sequelae by  the Patriots and Veterans Affairs Ministry, and documentary  evidence of their service in Vietnam to American lawyers in  March last year and sent documents on 104 additional victims in  August.    The Rev. Yi Su-man, chairman of the association, said the  chemical companies offered 30 million dollars for the estimated  3,000 agent orange victims in Korea on line with the  compensation paid to American victims in 1980 through the  association's lawyer in August.    "But I concluded that the sum is too small considering the  cost of treatment over the years and us being a minority race,  and so I have refused the offer," Yi said. "Even if it takes us  two or three years, we are determined to get every penny of the  amount we demand," he said.    Six lawyers will defend the victims in the United States and  two lawyers are offering legal advice in Seoul.    The Korean Veterans Association plans to file a separate  suit  against two American chemical companies on behalf of Korean  agent orange victims.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: BellSouth to spend Dollars 9bn on updating network BELLSOUTH, the largest of the Baby Bell regional telephone companies that was spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984, has unveiled plans to spend up to Dollars 9bn during the next three years updating its telecommunications network. The Atlanta-based company said Dollars 5.7bn would be spent to keep up with the business' growth and to replace outdated equipment, and another Dollars 3bn would be invested in newer technology for the network infrastructure. Some of the money will go towards the installation of more fibre optic cable and the continued replacement of analog central offices with digital equipment. So far, BellSouth has installed 900,000 miles of fibre optic cable in its US network and plans to install fibre-to-the-curb systems for 130,000 residential and business customers over the next three years. The incorporation of self-healing capabilities into the network to enhance reliability will also continue under the capital investment programme. In a separate development, BellSouth has signed preliminary agreements with Intel, RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson Telephone to develop new products and services for the mobile computing market. The four companies said they planned to expand the availability and increase the usage of standard Intel processor-based mobile computers able to perform two-way wireless communications via the nationwide dedicated public mobile data networks run by RAM. BellSouth and Intel also said they would be exploring new mobile computing products and services that can be used on a variety of communications networks.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Plateau spurns Kingstream offer KINGSTREAM Resources, the small Australian exploration company which has made a hostile bid for Plateau Mining, the former UK natural resources company that is now a shell, virtually doubled the terms of its all-share offer to Pounds 2.37m yesterday but was met with immediate rejection. Mr Donald Driver, Plateau's chairman, said the bid continued to be 'without merit'. He added: 'Plateau shareholders are concerned about the quality, not the quantity, of Kingstream's shares.' He pointed out that Kingstream's latest accounts were heavily qualified by its auditors on the grounds of a deficiency of working capital. 'This was in spite of Kingstream borrowing money from its shareholders and pledging certain of its major assets as security. I can see no merit in anybody accepting shares of this doubtful value.' Mr Driver said Kingstream's shares had dropped by more than 15 per cent since the first offer on April 13. Kingstream said it was increasing its offer to three of its ordinary shares for every 10 Plateau ordinary to take account of the increased value of the UK company following the agreement for Plateau to sell its interest in the Mhondoro joint venture in Zimbabwe to Delta Gold for shares worth more than Pounds 1.5m. Kingstream said the new offer valued each Plateau share at about 5.18p against a suspension price of 3p.</p>

Ciller visited the children's hostel of the Child Protection  Association in Istanbul's Kasimpasa quarter this afternoon. She  exchanged holiday greetings and distributed gifts. In reply to  a question, Ciller said: The terrorists cannot be our equals.  We cannot consider them our equals. We, therefore, cannot sit  at the negotiating table with them. The important issue is to  ensure the security of life and property of our citizens in that  region. We are able to celebrate the holidays in security  throughout Turkey today. We will hold the elections in a  similar atmosphere. Had these terrorists not existed we would  have reached this point much earlier. The important issue now  is for them to give up. The state is powerful. The Turkish  state is very powerful. We are very determined.</p>

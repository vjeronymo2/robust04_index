			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Owen fails to win over Serb leader LORD OWEN, the European Community mediator, yesterday failed in his eleventh-hour effort to persuade Serbian president Mr Slobodan Milosevic to swing his weight behind the international peace plan for Bosnia. During a one-day visit to Belgrade, Lord Owen made what many observers see as a final attempt to persuade Mr Milosevic to bring Bosnian Serb leaders to heel and support the plan, brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and himself, to divide Bosnia into 10 provinces, roughly along ethnic lines. After a 2 1/2 -hour session behind closed doors, Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the mediators, admitted little hope remained that Serb leaders would drop their opposition to the plan. He said: 'I don't want to say last chance, but there's a particular pressure now on everybody to see if something can't be pulled out at the last minute.' Lord Owen also held two rounds of talks with President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Yugoslavia. State-run Serbian media attacked Lord Owen for his calls for foreign air strikes against Serbian targets. But yesterday he did not publicly repeat his threats of military action. Mr Eckhard, admitting the failure to overcome fierce Serb objections to the plan, said: 'If the Serbs say 'no' as they have done today, they have no option really but to turn it over to the Security Council.' The Vance-Owen plan demands considerable concessions from Bosnian Serbs. They currently control 70 per cent of the territory of Bosnia-Hercegovina, but have been allocated 43 per cent of its land surface under the mediators' proposed peace settlement, which has already been signed by the Bosnian Croats and Moslems. Serb leaders remained defiant even on the eve of additional punitive measures from the international community. More economic sanctions are due to come into effect on Monday which would virtually isolate Serbia and Montenegro from the outside world, if Bosnian Serbs fail to endorse the plan. Lord Owen also had a secret meeting with Mr Radovan Karadzic, but the result of their talks has not been disclosed. Mr Karadzic was quoted by Tanjug news agency as telling reporters in the Bosnian town of Zvornik that the Bosnian Serb parliament would meet on Friday and Saturday to discuss whether to accept or reject the Vance-Owen plan. Asked whether the assembly would quit the peace talks, Mr Karadzic said: 'I am convinced that our parliament will decide in that direction because it is really not our duty to co-operate with those who are punishing us.' Lord Owen yesterday also met Croat military leaders in an attempt to arrange a ceasefire between Croat and Moslems forces in central Bosnia. Sanctions hit Belgrade, Page 3</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Birgitte Stampe, head of the Danish Police </F> Intelligence Service, by Ib Konrad Jensen and Jens P. Skaarup in  Copenhagen; date not given: "Birgitte Stampe Is Head of a  Public Institution That Prefers Privacy"]    [Text] It is not every day that Danish journalists  interview someone who arrives carrying a briefcase with a  built-in safe. But Chief Constable Birgitte Stampe, 48, prefers  to take such precautions. For who knows whether or not someone  is waiting round the next corner intending to mug the head of  the Danish Security Police. He may get her, but he will not get  her secret papers.    It is fundamental to the organizational ethos of the Police  Intelligence Service, PET, that the utmost efforts are made to  ensure that nothing -- NOTHING -- on the secret service's work  falls into the wrong hands.    As few papers as possible -- the greatest possible  protection  of them as possible. And no question of tape recorders on the  table when the head of the PET speaks to the public. Written  notes on a notepad are OK, but not a tape with the chief's own  voice. Just think how it might be used.    It is all so discreet that the head of the PET is not even  prepared to receive POLITIKEN journalists in her own  surroundings in the intelligence headquarters out at Bellahoej.  For the first interview of any length given by a head of the  PET in a generation, she has chosen to borrow an empty executive  office in the huge police commissioner's building in central  Copenhagen.    [POLITIKEN] Why is that, exactly?    [Stampe] It is in line with our general philosophy. We work  best under cover. So, as few visitors as possible.    [POLITIKEN] How many people are registered today in the  PET's  files -- not counting those who are there because their job in  the public sector requires security clearance?    [Stampe] I do not wish to give exact figures. But the  numbers have remained more or less constant in recent years.    [POLITIKEN] The figure of 12,000 has been mentioned.    [Stampe] Yes, but it is probably slightly less now.    [POLITIKEN] Why are they there?    [Stampe] Because there is information on them that is  thought  to be significant in intelligence terms.    [POLITIKEN] What does that mean?    [Stampe] I do not wish to answer that.    [POLITIKEN] Since 1968, the PET has not been allowed to  register Danish citizens "solely on the grounds of lawful  political activity." How does the PET distinguish between  lawful and unlawful political activity?    [Stampe] Belonging to an established political party is  obviously lawful political activity.    [POLITIKEN] If one chooses instead to be active in  extraparliamentary opposition politics, or take part in new  political movements, does one run the risk of becoming the  object of PET interest?    [Stampe] One runs the risk of becoming an object of our  interest if one behaves in a way that falls under or that may  fall under articles of criminal legislation that concern us.  That is, the legislation on striking at state security. It is  quite certain that one has crossed the threshold of lawful  political activity if one uses nonpeaceful or indeed violent  means.    [POLITIKEN] Why do the almost 12,000 people have to remain  on  file as being suspected of antistate activities or attempts at  such, when there is so little prospect of their ever being  indicted and punished?    [Stampe] The people in question are registered because the  information we have on them is of interest in intelligence  terms. It is true that not many charges are brought. In fact,  extremely few. But that is because our main task, according to  the instructions regulating our work, (instructions dating back  to 1953, the "hottest" period in the Cold War -- editor's note)  is first and foremost to monitor, prevent, and counteract  crimes. The very low charge rate means that not many crimes are  committed. The PET has to measure its success in terms of the  lack of criminal cases.    [POLITIKEN] Do the files contain a broad cross-section of  the  community?    [Stampe] I cannot answer that question. I am not that  familiar with the personal circumstances of those on the  register.    [POLITIKEN] We understand that a broad cross-section of the  population supplies the PET with information on other Danish  citizens, working as PET informers.    [Stampe] It would probably be fair to say that. But it is  not just informers that we make use of, i.e., information from  individuals. We also obtain information from other authorities,  from firms, and from open sources such as newspapers and  periodicals. And I should like to stress that we are of course  careful in assessing the reliability of each individual source  before going further. We do not charge out into the street and  arrest a man because somebody or other passes on a hint of  something ugly. We must never use information from an  unreliable source.    [POLITIKEN] Is the PET ready to pay for information?    [Stampe] No comment.    [POLITIKEN] Why does the PET not tell those registered that  they are registered? Then they would know that the PET is  keeping an eye on them, and that would perhaps prevent them from  committing criminal actions?    [Stampe] We do indeed sometimes hold what we call preventive  conversations with people. But I would say generally that an  intelligence service carries out a special type of job that is  best done away from the public gaze and without too many  people's knowledge. If we always told the people concerned when  they were registered, they might just waste no time in removing  both the proof and maybe themselves too.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   Since 1964, the various justice ministers have had a  four-member committee acting on their behalf to approve the  PET's registration of inividuals and communication of  information from the files to other authorities. This is the  so-called Wamberg Committee, with Chief Administrative Officer  Bodil Panild, Soroe, Senior Archivist Hans Christian Bjerg, The  State Archives, Publishing House Director Kurt Fromberg,  Gyldendal, and Solicitor Niels Fisch-Thomsen, Copenhagen.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   [POLITIKEN] But the Wamberg Committee has no opportunity of  testing PET's information and assessments -- that is, the  justification for the registrations. Of what use, then, is the  control?    [Stampe] I think it is going too far to imply that the  control is worthless. No, I would put it differently: You can  rest assured that what we submit to the committee is the  absolute truth. The people working for the PET are honorable.  I myself attach enormous importance to the lawful conduct of  our work.    [POLITIKEN] We are not talking about the PET's honorable or  dishonorable nature. We are speaking about control, and what  value a control function has when it is limited to a choice  between trusting PET material or not trusting it. After all,  the State Audit Department would never be content, when asking a  public institution whether it has used its funds as prescribed  and receiving the expected reply "yes," to simply answer:  "Fine, we will go away again then." How often does the Wamberg  Committee turn down a request for registration?    [Stampe] I can only say that it is very rare. That is due to  our great care in sifting the cases, so that the only ones we  present for registration are those that are strong enough. It  would be completely wrong to claim that the Wamberg Committee is  in the pocket of the PET.    [POLITIKEN] How is the nature of the PET's work changing in  line with changes in society? For example, what effect has it  had that the left wing is far less aggressively vocal than it  was just a few years back, while the extreme right is becoming  very active?    [Stampe] When society changes, we naturally respond by  shifting resources so that we concentrate our strength on the  relevant tasks of the day. One could say that we constantly  adjust in the light of the threat assessment picture.    [POLITIKEN] It goes without saying that the PET must be left  in peace during the investigation of a case, but why can nothing  be said about it later?    [Stampe] It can and is when the case ends up in the courts.  But when we end up shelving the case, we generally say nothing  at all. If we did, it would reveal our methods of investigation.    [POLITIKEN] Can they not stand the light of day?    [Stampe] Yes, certainly, but we may damage our opportunities  of investigation in the future if we talk about them. In the  same way as we must protect our sources and our cooperation with  foreign intelligence services. I fear it would do a great deal  of damage if we were to suddenly throw all the doors open. Our  credibility as a working partner would be lost. But having said  that, I agree that there is a need for greater openness  surrounding the work of the PET. That is the realization I have  come to after hearing so many different comments about us. Some  think that we do virtually nothing at all, while others believe  that we are standing on every street corner and that we see  everything. But openness must be limited to the general  situation -- such as I am discussing now.    [POLITIKEN] Why can the PET not do as, for example, the  German police intelligence service does, and send out quarterly  reports on its work -- on where the current threats to society  are coming from and which groups are now being watched?    [Stampe] I do not think that would be advisable at the  moment. We are after all a small country, where we all know one  another, and where we cannot mention specific groups without in  fact also naming names.    [POLITIKEN] But what right does the PET have to expect the  public to trust the PET's information, when you are so  incredibly secretive?    [Stampe] I can well understand that people have difficulty  in  seeing the reasonableness of something about which they know  very little. But I do not see that that need has anything to do  with our credibility. Anyone will tell you that an intelligence  service must be allowed to work discreetly, and as a result,  there is nothing immediately suspicious in an intelligence  service not stepping forward and talking a great deal about  itself. But when we do say something, it must be the truth.    [POLITIKEN] The PET has around 350 personnel -- 150 criminal  investigation police, 100 uniformed police, and 100 office  staff. How large is the budget? How large is the annual budget?    [Stampe] I do not know. But it is confidential, and anyway,  we do not spend a lot.    [POLITIKEN] Why is the size of the budget kept a secret when  the numbers employed appear from the Commissioner's annual  report?    [Stampe] It is not appropriate to reveal anything about the  size of the budget. People with a particular interest in our  work must not be able to deduce the extent of our capabilities.    [POLITIKEN] But that can be virtually worked out by looking  up the Commissioner's report and seeing how large the staff is.  Is it not paradoxical to release these figures but not the  budget?    [Stampe] I have no further comment to make on that question.    [POLITIKEN] Hand on heart, is it not very convenient to be  the head of an institution which is not accountable to the  public as regards what the public actually gets for its money?  Just think how the other branches of the police force or, for  example, an educational establishment are often forced to  justify every 1,000-kroner note they spend.    [Stampe] The special circumstances surrounding the PET in  this regard have no effect on the day-to-day work. There is no  more to be said on that issue.    [POLITIKEN] Out of consideration for state security, the PET  on occasion has to turn a blind eye to less serious crime, in  the hope of uncovering something larger. One example: The PET  does not arrest someone for an ordinary burglary if, by letting  him go free, it has a chance to uncover his links with a KGB  agent.    [Stampe] I have absolutely nothing to say on that subject.    [POLITIKEN] Where does the threshold lie for necessary  intervention, irrespective of the overriding aim of surveillance?    [Stampe] No comment.    [POLITIKEN] How, in general terms, does the PET tackle the  following dilemma: If the PET arrests someone for a minor  criminal act, the larger case is spoiled. If it does not, the  PET is ignoring the police's obligation to intervene in all  cases where the law is broken.    [Stampe] I do not wish to say anything on that subject.    [POLITIKEN] Last: Have you, prior to this interview,  consulted with others on what you should say and especially what  you should not say on the PET?    [Stampe] No.    [POLITIKEN] And finally: What does a head of the PET do when  she is not monitoring her fellow citizens or citizens of foreign  nationality?    [Stampe] Now that is of absolutely no interest to the  public.</p>

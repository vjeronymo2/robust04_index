(A  co-worker at Hearst in 1918 was Walter Lantz, who subsequently created Woody  Woodpecker and other cartoon classics. Lantz handed Geronimi his Annie Award  when the Italian-born Geronimi was honored by the Hollywood chapter of the  International Animation Society in 1977.)  </P> <P> Geronimi joined Disney in 1931 and helped animate more than 50 of the studio's  early cartoons. He became a director in 1938, and won his first Oscar in 1939  for "The Ugly Duckling," a short. His second Academy Award came in 1942 for  "Lend a Paw," another short.  </P> <P> As a sequence, or segment, director, Geronimi's credits for Disney included  "Three Caballeros," "The Adventures of Ichabod &amp; Mr. Toad," "Cinderella,"  "Peter Pan," "Sleeping Beauty," for which he was supervising director, and "101  Dalmations."  </P> <P> He also directed several specials for Disney on television.  </P> <P> He is survived by two sons, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.  </P></p>

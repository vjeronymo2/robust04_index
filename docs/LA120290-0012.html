			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KUDOS TO DUO OF DEVOTED SOCIAL WORKERS  </P> <P> The article about Kwasi Geiggar ("The Last Hope," Nov. 16) was uplifting.  </P> <P> Few people would make such an effort for the education of ghetto children.  Geiggar is no faceless bureaucrat of a social worker. He is a dedicated  professional working under trying and discouraging conditions.  </P> <P> Other social workers devote themselves to trying but worthy causes, too. Why  was Geiggar identified in the headline as a counselor? Why were we not told  until the bottom of column 14 -- in a 15-column article -- that he is a social  worker? Geiggar deserves to have his occupation identified in the headline.  </P> <P> JOHN KROTCHER  </P> <P> ANNE M.

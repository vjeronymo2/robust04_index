			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Fresh wave of job cuts in Germany A RENEWED wave of job cuts is gaining momentum in west German industry, with automotive companies once again bearing the brunt. Volkswagen workers heard yesterday that further job losses were unavoidable in addition to the 12,500 already planned for this year and next in the German parent company. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, group deputy chairman, told a factory meeting in Wolfsburg that deliveries in Germany to the end of May were 22 per cent lower than in the same period last year. Global deliveries were down 12 per cent, he added. He gave no clues as to the number of jobs to go, but the stresses within the group were highlighted on Wednesday when Audi, its luxury car division, announced a 25 per cent production cut next month, and complained specifically about a drop in orders from Japan. Some 25,000 employees are to be sent home for five days in July, following eight days' short-time this month. Meanwhile, Audi is continuing with plans announced early this year to shed 4,000 workers by the end of December. Iveco Magirus, the bus and truck business belonging to Italy's Fiat group, yesterday announced 'limited' further payroll reductions after a 2 per cent cut last year. Production had fallen 27 per cent in the first five months of 1993, Mr Wolfgang Keller, the chairman, told the annual meeting. Phoenix, a leading manufacturer of plastic and rubber vehicles components, forecast a 23 per cent drop in sales this year. After cutting 15 per cent of its workforce in the past 12 months, it was now looking for further economies, Mr Ludwig Horatz, its chairman, said in Hamburg. In another development, Philips Kommunikations Industrie, a subsidiary of the Dutch group incorporating the Grundig electronics business, said 1,500 jobs were to go by the end of the year. On Wednesday, the steel division of Thyssen said 9,000 jobs would have to go by the end of next year, instead of the 6,000 previously announced. Even though economists suggest that the economy should start to recover next year after reaching the bottom of the cycle this summer, unemployment is expected to continue increasing. From 3.25m at the last count, total German unemployment is expected to climb to between 4m and 5m next year, according to senior Bonn officials. At 2.15m, the unadjusted jobless total in the west last month was 26 per cent higher than a year earlier.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICES REBOUND, KINDLE INFLATION FEARS;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: RETAIL SALES ALSO POST A ROBUST INCREASE, AND THE TWO INDEXES TOGETHER  MAY SIGNAL A HEATING-UP OF CONSUMPTION.  </P> <P> After three consecutive monthly declines, wholesale prices rebounded by a steep  0.9% in September, pushing the producer price index back toward its May peak  and rekindling fears of inflation, the Labor Department reported Friday.  </P> <P> The index had fallen 0.1% in June and 0.4% in July and August. For the first  nine months of 1989, wholesale prices have risen at an annual rate of 5.1%.  </P> <P> A long-expected jump in energy prices, reversing a summer-long decline, was  responsible for about half of September's increase. An unusual distortion in  the seasonal adjustment for car prices converted a small decline in auto prices  into a huge markup that accounted for another 0.2 points of the increase.  </P> <P> "It's a big number and it's going to scare some people," observed David Wyss of  Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. But Wyss, who, like most analysts, took  the news in stride, saw only gradually higher inflation in the months ahead.  </P> <P> But in financial markets, the wholesale inflation report coincided with a flood  of sell orders provoked, in part, apparently, by news of the apparent breakdown  in the $6.75-billion UAL Corp. buyout, and the Dow Jones industrial average  plummeted nearly 200 points.  </P> <P> That negative reaction may have been amplified by another economic report  Friday. The Commerce Department said that retail sales increased by a  surprisingly robust 0.5% in September, after increases of 0.5% in July and 0.7%  in August.  </P> <P> The latest retail sales increase combined with the producer price report to  revive fears of an economy driven by strong consumption and flirting with the  dangers of higher inflation.  </P> <P> That is a recipe for high interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve,  which only a week ago had been expected to let interest rates decline somewhat.  </P> <P> A big factor in September's retail sales spurt was a 0.8% increase in auto  sales, which in turn contributed to a 0.6% increase in sales of durable goods  -- big-ticket items that last three years or more.  </P> <P> The strong retail sales volume for cars was caused in part by widespread dealer  rebates to move unsold 1989 models from sales lots to make way for 1990 models.  But it was rebates at the wholesale level, ironically, that accounted in part  for the apparent acceleration in inflation for finished goods.  </P> <P> This year, manufacturers began their rebate campaign in August, a month earlier  than in the recent past. Thus, an actual decline of 0.5% in wholesale auto  prices from August to September was converted to a 3.8% increase by Labor  Department statisticians as they compensated for the fact that expected  discounts did not occur.  </P> <P> "The auto prices were a statistical fluke, and it's all because of the timing  of rebates, not because of any underlying inflationary surge," explained Donald  Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State  University.  </P> <P> Energy, the other big culprit in the September inflation story, jumped 6.5%  after declines of 7.3% in August, 3% in July and 2.8% in June.  </P> <P> "We knew energy was going to rebound after a soft summer, and the only question  was, which month," Wyss said.  </P> <P> Ratajczak noted that the jump in the wholesale price of finished energy goods  is very unlikely to show up at the retail level for the time being because  "dealers are getting squeezed and they're not passing all these energy price  increases along."  </P> <P> Food prices, the other big variable in monthly price moves, declined 0.6%,  continuing a leveling off after large increases last winter caused by the 1988  drought.  </P> <P> Without food and energy prices, the "core" rate of inflation at the producer  level was logged at 0.7%, the highest since last May. But almost all of that  was caused by the seasonal fluke in autos. Without any seasonal adjustment,  producer prices excluding food and energy declined 0.1% in September.  </P> <P> "We're back at a rate of inflation increases about the same as we saw at the  end of last year," said Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch, the New York  investment house. "We can probably live with that for now but it's not  sustainable for the long run and it is something the Fed has to concern itself  with. What we saw in September is not as bad as it appears, but it does mean  that inflation is persistent."  </P> <P> Before seasonal adjustment, producer prices increased 0.2%, reflecting a  0.2-point increase in the producer price index to 113.5 on a scale in which the  1982 level was 100.  </P></p>

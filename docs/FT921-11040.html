			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Yeltsin returns to confront rising Russian discontent: Mounting economic problems and tensions with the other republics PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin returned to Moscow from a triumphant international tour yesterday to confront once again the dangerous struggle over domestic issues. He now embarks on the second month of radical economic reform following the highly unpopular liberalisation of prices of January 2. At the same time he faces the challenge of mounting social hardship, tensions with other former Soviet republics and impatience within the armed forces. An increasingly visible focus for discontent is provided by his own vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, a former air force colonel, who says Mr Yeltsin's government may fall in a very short time unless it 'corrects' its policies. The vice-president, who on Friday equated queues at the McDonald's restaurant in Moscow with Russia's spiritual decline, has no economic programme of his own, but he has attracted support with calls for more social protection, a strong-arm approach to law and order and war cries over Russia's territorial integrity. Unless the government reforms show results soon, such rhetoric is likely to attract ever growing support from a still patient if bewildered population. Mr Rutskoi favours not just a military crackdown on autonomous areas seeking independence within Russia, but the reversal of a 1954 Kremlin decision ceding the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. Aware that this would result in protracted bloodletting, Mr Yeltsin is seeking to avoid confrontation through backroom diplomacy and tough talking in public. But Russian feelings about the Crimea may be just the start of the troubles. The Russian parliament has set itself a deadline of Thursday to voice its opinion on the legitimacy of the peninsula's transfer to Ukraine, which in turn refuses to discuss the issue. A negative statement by the parliament would not only plunge relations with Ukraine to a new low, but complicate a summit of commonwealth leaders on February 14. Although Mr Yeltsin failed to secure any significant pledges of western economic help, Moscow is busily trying to establish a clearly defined rouble zone within the commonwealth to make requests for a western stabilisation fund more convincing. Last week for instance, it gave other republics a choice of issuing their own currencies or joining central bank consultations in which Russia would cut off financial transfers and cash supplies to republics which exceeded given credit limits. Ukraine for one is determined to press ahead with its own currency. But in the telling sign of the key role of economics despite political tensions, officials from Russia, Ukraine and other republics are due to meet European Commission officials in Brussels next week to discuss proposals for a payments union. Mr Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Russian parliament foreign affairs committee is due to be appointed Russia's ambassador to the US. Canada signed a five-year, 25m tonne grain deal with Russia on Saturday, the highlight of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's brief visit to cement the growing friendship between the two countries, Reuter reports from Ottawa. Mr Yeltsin told a news conference that he was heartened by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's warm reception and concrete gestures to help Russia through difficult times. Canada also extended a CDollars 100m (Pounds 47.8m) credit line for capital goods.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Sara Lee in talks with BP over food group SARA LEE, the US textiles, food and consumer products company, is in advanced negotiations to buy British Petroleum's consumer food group, which produces and sells packaged meats in several European countries. The value of the planned deal has not been disclosed but is thought to be between Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) and Dollars 120m. The two companies said yesterday that they expected to reach final agreement by the end of the year. The consumer products group, which had sales last year of about Pounds 190m and employs 2,300 people, is part of BP Nutrition. BP indicated in February it would entertain offers for Nutrition to help pay down its Dollars 16bn of debt. The pace of disposals was accelerated and the dividend cut this summer after Mr David Simon took over as chief executive. His predecessor, Mr Robert Horton, was ousted as chairman and chief executive in a boardroom coup. BP is on target for raising Dollars 1.5bn from disposals this year and is confident of generating Dollars 2bn next year, it said earlier this month when it published better than expected third-quarter results. The Sara Lee deal would be the first disposal of part of BP Nutrition, which has annual sales of about Pounds 3bn. These also include the supply of animal feed, seafood and household products. Sara Lee, which was selected from several rival bidders, is a leader in the US packaged meats business, where it owns national brands including Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park. The company has been seeking to enter the business in Europe, where it already markets brands including Playtex bras, Dim and L'Eggs tights, Kiwi shoe polishes and Douwe Egberts coffee. BP's consumer food group sells cooked sausage, salami, ham and other processed meats mainly in Spain, Portugal, the Benelux countries and Britain. The group is headquartered in the Netherlands.</p>

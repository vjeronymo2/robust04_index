			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Picking stocks by the sector - Neil Moore wonders if this is the best way for private investors THERE IS a perennial debate among investment practitioners on the relative importance of strategic decisions, and whether it is better to adopt a 'top-down' or 'bottom-up' approach. The former involves taking the major decisions first: choosing the strongest economies, currencies and markets, then looking at the various industrial sectors, and finally selecting the most promising shares within those sectors and geographical areas. The latter, on the other hand, gives priority to share selection. The 'top-down' approach has much to commend it logically but does present some practical problems, not least that the big decisions are the most difficult - and the most dangerous. If you take a view on a currency or market and it proves wrong, it can cause serious damage to your results, your client base - and, perhaps, your job prospects. I have some sympathy with the 'bottom-up' school, concentrating on the grass-roots decisions which should be more straightforward and remain crucial. But the approaches are not mutually exclusive. For the private investor, the question is whether the higher-level decisions can help inform the lower-level ones - meaning, in the context of the UK equity market, whether looking initially at sectors enables one to make better stock-picking decisions. The most convenient definition of sector is by industry. The problem here is that although some sectors are quite homogeneous, allowing generalised observations and fairly reliable comparisons of individual companies within the sector (such as clearing banks, supermarket chains, major oil companies), others (like engineering) are very diverse. Moreover, even for well-defined sectors, past performance vis-a-vis the overall market does not suggest the type of cyclical pattern that would enable one confidently to identify areas of likely relative advantage. For example, the building materials sector should be a fairly obvious cyclical performer; but you could have bought the sector a year ago, at the lowest point relative to the market for a decade, and then experienced further significant relative decline. At the other extreme, the health and household sector, mainly pharmaceutical companies, has outperformed the market over the past decade, although with intervals of underperformance as has occurred recently; of itself, this tells us nothing of future performance. While categorisation by industrial sector enables use to be made of economic data and does help to identify short-term shifts in market sentiment, it does not seem to be a particularly helpful basis for longer-term stock selection. Of course, there are other ways of defining sectors and other headings under which stocks can be grouped. Companies can, say, be defined as interest rate-sensitive, early cycle, late cycle, established growth, emerging growth, recovery candidates and so on. Some of these headings are more useful than others. Some define ends rather than suggest means. Some raise further questions. Take a company, the profitability of which is sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations, either for industrial reasons or because of its own financial characteristics. It should benefit from falling interest rates - but only if it has not been weakened fatally by the previous period of high interest rates. There are, though, two ways of defining stocks which have, in the past, given some pointers to the chances of superior performance - dividend yield and size of company. Even these, however, have proved unreliable in the face of the length and depth of the recession. Traditionally, higher-yielding portfolios have tended to perform better than lower-yielding ones, despite being rated more lowly and, therefore, considered more staid and slower-growing. This presumably is because more highly-rated shares carry greater potential for disappointment while those rated more lowly have a greater chance of pleasant surprises. It is really a form of value investing, buying assets and earnings more cheaply in less-favoured stocks. For most of 1991 and 1992, however, the average UK equity income unit trust underperformed the average UK growth trust. Moreover, despite recent recovery, the Kleinwort Benson Topsi index of higher-yielding shares has underperformed the FTSE-100 index substantially since the beginning of 1991. Companies particularly sensitive to the economic climate (such as building and engineering) tend to be well represented in the higher-yielding groups. The old maxim, 'the higher the yield, the higher the risk,' applies to shares as well as deposit accounts. So what about size? The smaller the company, the greater its room for growth. The Dimson-Marsh research (commissioned by Hoare Govett) shows that, between 1955 and 1988, the average smaller company (as defined by the HG Smaller Companies index) outperformed the market average (All-Share index) by 6 per cent a year, displaying superior performance in four years out of five. Since then, though, there has been an unprecedented four successive years of underperformance. Even so, the long-term record of the smaller companies sector should comfortably remain superior. Recently, there have been signs of a return to favour of medium-sized and smaller companies. If this is not another false dawn - and there have been several as the recession has dragged on - then a prudently-constructed smaller companies portfolio could produce above-average returns for investors whose nerves have not been shredded by the depredations of the recent years.</p>

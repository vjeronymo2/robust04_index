			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["What Is S. Korean Puppets' 'Nuclear' Clamour For?" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  throws light on what the South Korean puppets are really seeking  in raising a hue and cry over "the nuclear issue" of the North,  following outside forces.    The analyst says:    Clear is the purpose of the South Korean puppets in getting  frantic in their "nuclear" clamour, tailing behind foreign  forces. They seek to isolate the North in the international  arena, find a pretext for another war against the North, stifle  it with the help of outside forces and gratify their design to  "unify the country by invading the North."    They also seek to divert the attention of the people  elsewhere and dull the people's discontent with them by the  "nuclear" clamor, thus saving the ever-worsening crisis of their  rule.    Their "nuclear" clamour is, in the final analysis, an  intolerable criminal act to prop up the power by leaving the  nation to the mercy of big powers. Their "nuclear" clamour is  designed to facilitate their nuclear arms development and impede  the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    The nuclear armament of the South Korean puppet clique,  along  with Japan's, has entered a grave stage, creating quite a stir  in the world. It is nobody's secret that South Korea is  developing nuclear weapons.    Reporting about the development of nuclear weapons by South  Korea, newspapers of the United States, Britain and other  countries said plutonium stockpiled by South Korea amounted to  ten tons and it would reach about 24 tons around the year 2000.    The Kim Yong-sam group, however, has balked the DPRK- U.S.  talks, fooling world public opinion over the "nuclear issue" of  the North, which reminds us of a thief crying "stop thief!" This  is aimed at obstructing a solution to the nuclear issue at the  DPRK- U.S. talks to keep South Korea under the U.S. "nuclear  umbrella" and accelerate the nuclear arms development under it.    But, the South Korean puppets have nothing to get in the  "nuclear" clamour.    They must clearly understand that their treacherous acts in  playing the role of a shock brigade in the "nuclear" clamour of  the imperialist reactionaries and fooling the nation will bring  themselves to destruction.</p>

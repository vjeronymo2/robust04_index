			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Structural change answer to US deficit Sir, Professor Maynard's letter on US foreign indebtedness (July 22) is admirably short, consisting of just two sentences. Unfortunately, the first sentence, although true, is trivial; and the second does not follow from the first. He states that 'the US's trade problem (if there is one) lies in the country's low propensity to save, not in an overvalued exchange rate'. Every first year student of economics knows that from the national accounts the balance of payments deficit on current account is necessarily and identically equal to the excess of domestic investment over saving, but by their second year they ought to know that it is a logical fallacy to infer causation from an accounting identity. If Professor Maynard wishes the trade balance to be tackled by raising saving (and/or reducing investment) has he thought what that might do to output and employment domestically? He does not seem to envisage the possibility that the simultaneous use of two types of measure might be required. As the late Professor Tinbergen taught us many years ago, if there are two objectives - internal as well as external balance - then two policy instruments are required from their achievement. There is a case for dollar depreciation, as Professor Wynne Godley and Mr William Milberg originally argued (Personal View, July 6). On the other hand, one should not expect too much. In our view, the US deficit, like the UK deficit, has deep structural roots which will only be rectified in the long run by structural change and stronger non-price competition against the more aggressive trading nations of south-east Asia, particularly, of course, Japan.

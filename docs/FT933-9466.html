			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Newham launches campaign to attract international passenger station for Channel tunnel rail link NEWHAM Borough Council yesterday launched a campaign to attract an international passenger station for the Channel tunnel rail link to Stratford in east London, Vanessa Houlder writes. Its proposal is supported by a group of public-sector and private-sector bodies including Land Securities, the University of East London and the London Docklands Development Corporation. Purfleet, Rainham and Dartford are also possible sites for the international passenger station between Ashford, Kent, and St Pancras in London which is intended to ease congestion in central London. The government is expected to make a decision on the site by the end of the year. Stratford has based its case on recent improvements to its transport links, and the role the station would play in the regeneration of east London including the likely boost to 100 hectares of surrounding land which is vacant and ready for development.</p>

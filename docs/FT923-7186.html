			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Tokyo acts to restore confidence in financial institutions THE JAPANESE government moved to restore confidence in the country's banking system and securities markets yesterday after share prices in Tokyo plunged by 4.2 per cent to their lowest level in six years. In a hastily called press conference, Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, announced a series of measures aimed at discouraging financial institutions from selling shares during the next six weeks. Many banks were expected to try to realise capital gains on share holdings during this period to boost reported profits in the first half of the financial year, which ends next month. The finance ministry feared that such sales would further depress share prices and undermine bank balance sheets. Banks face a huge burden of bad debt, potentially as high as Y56,000bn (Pounds 231bn). Mr Hata said Japan's financial system was facing its most difficult period since the second world war, giving rise to questions about its stability and capacity to supply capital. 'The fall in the stock market is pushing up valuation losses on stock holdings, and the malfunctioning of the real estate market has triggered concerns over the health of the financial system.' Mr Hata's statements are the frankest admission yet by the government that the plunge in share and property prices, combined with the sharp economic slowdown, may have placed Japan's financial system in jeopardy. Continued instability in the financial system could derail any potential recovery. Mr Hata denied that his announcement of the measures was timed to follow yesterday's steep fall in share prices, which saw the Nikkei average lose 620.14 to 14,309.41. Prices were moving lower again this morning after an initial rally. The Nikkei was down some 100 points by mid-morning, having been 200 points higher at one stage. The measures will allow financial institutions to postpone the reporting of unrealised losses on share holdings until the end of the financial year in March. This will reduce short-term pressure on banks to realise capital gains by selling other shares to compensate for losses. In addition, the finance ministry has temporarily suspended an administrative guidance to institutions under which the dividend payout ratio could not exceed 40 per cent of profits. This will allow banks to maintain dividend payments without having to raise money by selling shares. Mr Tsueno Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations, welcomed the measures and hoped they would ease doubts about the stability of the banking system. He nonetheless called for further measures to cope with the banks' huge volume of non-performing loans. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the leading business federation, called for government cash to be used to buy land which banks are holding as collateral for bad loans. Yesterday's moves are to be followed later this month by a package of fiscal measures that could pump between Y6,000bn and Y8,000bn into the economy, through public works spending. Prospects for economic recovery have grown increasingly bleak. The Industrial Bank of Japan said that currently excessive inventories of unsold goods were unlikely to reach normal levels until the second quarter of 1993. After that capital spending would recover, but only slowly. A survey published yesterday by the Nihon Keizei Shimbun, the economic daily, found Japanese companies were continuing to reduce capital spending plans.

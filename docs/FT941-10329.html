			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Tory attacks red-tape bill A former Conservative defence minister yesterday added his voice to criticism of the government's plans to give itself greater powers to repeal legislation. Speaking in the Commons a day after the de-regulation bill gained its second reading, Sir Michael Neubert, MP for Romford, delivered a strong warning about the possible consequences of allowing ministers to take too much power in their drive to cut red tape. Sir Michael asked MPs: 'Isn't it less than satisfactory that the only safeguard against ministerial misjudgment in the exercise of delegated powers of de-regulation is the consideration of 90 minutes for statutory instruments which are unamendable by this House?' He also expressed concern that representations made during the period of consultation promised before changes were made might be ignored. Replying for the government, Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said that the public would benefit from the removal of 'antique, medieval restrictions which have no place in the modern age'. The bill - which was passed with a government majority of 37 - would allow ministers to repeal primary legislation by statutory order. A number of Tories said they were likely to vote against the government when the bill reached committee stage.</p>

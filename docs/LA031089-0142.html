			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> VETERANS GROUP SUES TO STOP REPARATIONS  </P> <P> A U.S. government plan to publicly apologize and pay $20,000 to  Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II is unconstitutional,  the Anaheim-based American War Veterans Relief Assn. Inc. claimed in a lawsuit  filed Thursday.  </P> <P> The plan violates constitutional guarantees by "denying payment to or even  acknowledging the existence of the German- and Italian-Americans placed in  relocation and internment centers alongside the Japanese," said John P. Coale,  attorney for the organization.  </P> <P> Rita Takahashi, representing the Japanese-American Citizens League, called the  suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, "groundless" and  said she expects it to "fizzle."  </P> <P> The Anaheim organization provides financial assistance to veterans across the  country and refers them to hospitals through a toll-free number, according to  Albert Lyon, 65, a World War II veteran and a part-time employee with the  organization.  </P> <P> Lyon said the organization, which claims 30,000 members, is a two-man operation  consisting of himself and John Kirby, who founded it in 1980.  </P></p>

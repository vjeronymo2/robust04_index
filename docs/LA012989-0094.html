			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR WORD-HERDER LARRY MCMURTRY, A NOVEL IS A TRAIL DRIVE  </P> <P> For a writer whose novels are often set under big Western skies and populated  with ranchers and gunslingers, Larry McMurtry is strikingly bookish. Here's a  man who, any day, would rather be nosing through dusty volumes than kicking sod  on the prairie.  </P> <P> Though he himself is the son of a West Texas rancher, McMurtry, whose Pulitzer  Prize-winning epic "Lonesome Dove" will be serialized in four parts on CBS-TV  starting Feb. 5, confessed the other night that he never quite got the hang of  cowpoking. Early on, he acquired an antipathy to cattle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tremendously Indifferent'  </P> <P> "As a child, I was tremendously indifferent to the comings and goings of these  animals," McMurtry told a standing-room-only audience Wednesday in the Donald  R. Wright Auditorium of the Pasadena Public Library. "As I got older, this was  a puzzlement to my father, who could pick any of our cattle out of a herd, day  or night. If I was ever sent out to fetch a steer, I'd return with the wrong  animal."  </P> <P> He also acquired, early on, the book-reading habit. When he was 6 years old, he  said, a cousin, bound for World War II, dropped him off a box of boys'  literature. "I read those 19 books over and over again," said McMurtry, 52.  "Essentially, they were my library for the next 10 years."  </P> <P> McMurtry, a big man whose eyes, behind dark-rimmed glasses, sometimes glint  with flashes of irascibility, talked in a practiced, low-key style with just a  hint of the Panhandle in his voice. He spoke of the colossal differences  between novel writing and movie making: "One is private and cheap, and one is  collaborative and expensive."  </P> <P> He described his current project, a novel about fathers and daughters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finite Resources  </P> <P> "It's about a woman who doesn't meet her father until she's 22 years old," said  McMurtry. "By then, she has two children, each by a different criminal."  </P> <P> And he worried openly about his finite resources as a writer.  </P> <P> With 12 novels and two books of essays under his belt, McMurtry has clearly  established himself as one of America's most popular and compelling  contemporary authors. His novels include "Horseman, Pass By" (adapted for the  screen as "Hud"), "Terms of Endearment," "The Last Picture Show," "Texasville"  and, most recently, "Anything for Billy," based loosely on the last days of  Billy the Kid.  </P> <P> His stories are often mordant, full of violence, plot switchbacks and an  uncompromising realism, debunking traditionally overwrought descriptions of the  Old West.  </P> <P> For example, the narrator in "Anything for Billy," a writer of pulp Westerns,  sums up a particularly bloody Wild West shoot-out as "just a long hot boring  day, with a certain amount of fear mixed in. . . ."  </P> <P> McMurtry's books are also full of eccentrically original characters. Three of  his women characters have provided Academy Award-winning roles for the  actresses who portrayed them on film: Ruth Popper in "The Last Picture Show,"  played by Cloris Leachman; Alma in "Hud," played by Patricia Neal, and Aurora  Greenway in "Terms of Endearment," played by Shirley MacLaine.  </P> <P> McMurtry, who said he will open a rare-books store in Orange County in February  or March, joked that he had decided recently that he wasn't a total failure as  a trail-driving herdsman, as his father once thought. "In a sense, I herd words  into little sentences and sentences into paragraphs. Eventually, I herd them  all into books."  </P> <P> "Lonesome Dove," probably McMurtry's most widely praised novel, is the story of  a 19th-Century trail drive from the Mexican border to Canada. The television  version will star Robert Duvall, Anjelica Huston, Tommy Lee Jones, Danny Glover  and Ricky Schroder.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reading and Writing  </P> <P> The author's comments about the role of books in his life were not just idle  autobiographical detail. Reading, more than anything else, leads to writing,  McMurtry contended.  </P> <P> "During the '30s, '40s and '50s," he said, "the dust jackets of novels always  gave a long list of the professions that the author had practiced --  lumberjack, cowboy, merchant seaman, railroad brakeman, etc., etc. The idea was  that a wide experience could somehow translate into novels."  </P> <P> On the other hand, fellow novelist Walker Percy ("one of my heroes," said  McMurtry) spent 15 years just reading while he recovered from tuberculosis.  "All those years, while his contemporaries were having their experiences,  Walker Percy read and read," he said. "And out came 'The Moviegoer' (Percy's  highly acclaimed first novel)."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Advice to Read  </P> <P> McMurtry's advice to would-be novelists: "If you want to be a writer, you  read."  </P> <P> The author also made these points:  </P> <P> Writing fiction is "truly making up stories," not recording real-life gossip or  scandals. "There's a kind of Puritan suspicion against fiction," he said. "Many  people like to believe that writers (of novels) are, in a sense, journalists."  </P> <P> "It's not the life you've lived that excites the fiction writer, it's the life  you haven't lived." McMurtry said he finds "attempting to project yourself into  the feelings of a 50-year-old woman" more challenging than writing about  himself.  </P> <P> "I write very early in the morning. I lead a very Spartan life. My typewriter  is about three steps from my bed."  </P> <P> "Lonesome Dove" is full of historical omissions. "I forgot the railroad, for  one thing. I even wrote in the margin to put it in -- to have the cattle  crossing the railroad. But I ignored my own note."  </P> <P> McMurtry rarely gives interviews. "Offer readers a choice between a page of  opinions in a newspaper and an 852-page novel like 'Lonesome Dove,' and a great  many of them may be satisfied with the newspaper interview."  </P> <P> On the current ascendancy of Texans in the White House: "George Bush isn't a  Texan, he's a Yankee. . . . (Secretary of State) James Baker, he's a Texas  Princetonian, a strange species. . . . At a time when Washington is most loaded  up with professional Texans, I'm glad to be elsewhere."  </P> <P> When he talked about writing, McMurtry showed a fretful, vulnerable side.  There's no guarantee that you can't "lose it" in a flash, he said with a  self-deprecating smile.  </P> <P> McMurtry admitted thinking, after he completed "Terms of Endearment" in 1975,  that this had happened to him. He inexplicably lost his conviction as a writer.  </P> <P> Partly, he suggested, it was because of the death in that novel of the  cancer-stricken Emma Horton, a character who had appeared in his last three  novels. "I was just as involved with her as I could be with a living person."  </P> <P> Inexorably, he said, his writer's edge began to fuzz over. "My writing began to  seem leaden. It's like, 'Have I seen this sentence before?' Characters that  appear in your new book seem strangely similar to characters in your old books.  . . . I didn't get it back for nine years."  </P> <P> The breakthrough came while he wrote the novel "The Desert Rose," based on a  Las Vegas showgirl he met while researching a screenplay. "It was a little  book," said McMurtry. Though his usual way of writing is plodding and  "metronomic," he said, "I wrote it in three weeks."  </P> <P> Without that rush of pent-up creativity, McMurtry said, "Lonesome Dove," with  which he had struggled since 1971, "might have remained just a half-written  manuscript in a drawer."  </P> <P> The experience rebuilt his confidence, but it also chastened him. "You can't  count on being there forever," he said. "You have to keep struggling with it."  </P></p>

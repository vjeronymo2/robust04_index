			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Arts: Chernikov's vision that defied Stalin - Architecture Iakov Chernikhov (1889-1951) was known as the Soviet Piranesi because of his visionary skills as an artist and draughtsman. His work was, until recently, relatively unknown despite the fact that he is clearly an important influence on contemporary architecture and design. He was one of the leaders of the Russian avant-garde - an architect, engineer, theorist and artist, who was forced by the mad dictates of Stalinism to lead an unfulfilled life. The grandson of this great pioneer, Andrei Chernikhov, has established a foundation to promote interest in his grandfather's work and to encourage architectural experiments among the young. It is this foundation, with the International Academy of Architecture, that has organised the remarkable exhibition that has been seen in the US and is now showing in London until July 20 at The Architecture Foundation in Bury Street, London, SW1. (in The Economist Buildiing). This is one of the best architectural exhibitions to be seen anywhere at the moment. It shows the intense vision of one man at one period of time - the 1920s and 1930s. Since the collapse of communism, it has become clear that there is endless work for architectural historians to do in eastern Europe - reassessing the roots of modernism is merely one task that has to be done. But the Chernikhov exhibition can be appreciated on its own terms as the work of an intensely talented and technically skilled architect who was a major part of that group in Russia that really were the advance guard of modernism. The exhibition is called 'Architecture of Fantasy.' The title is in some ways misleading. Although Chernikhov, along with many other talented architects and artists was unable to practice during the Stalinist regime, he cannot have seen his work as merely fantasy. His drawings are philosophical statements about structure, geometry and machines that could have been built. He was born in 1889 in Pavlovgrad in the Ukraine, and initially he studied painting at the Odessa College of Art and later the Academy of Arts in Leningrad. There are some highly respectable 'old Master' drawings from that period of his life in the exhibition. He moved on to the study of architecture in 1916 and, because he had to earn his living while studying (not to mention the disruptive effects of the Russian Revolution), he did not graduate until 1925. His early professional life was devoted to teaching and writing. He founded the Research and Experimental Laboratory of Architectural Forms and Methods and Graphic Art in Leningrad in 1928 where he was to teach both drawing from nature and abstract composition. His 'fantasies' were a part of his system of teaching, showing the infinite possibilities of geometry and the skilled use of drawing instruments. He also developed, as we can see from the exhibition, a marvellous colour sense. The exhibition includes photographs of the classes at the school with rows of pupils drawing away under the manic gaze of Chernikhov. His work exemplifies the innovative approach to architecture of the Constructivists of the 1920s, but because Chernikhov was so well versed in engineering and perspective his architecture is more expressive than the work of his contemporaries. It is not possible in the London show to compare his work to Melnikov and Leonidov - as it was in the Paris/Moscow exhibition that I recall at the PompidouCentre in 1979. They were both more original form makers, and had more variety in their work. What is fascinating to witness is the sense of power behind these drawings. They do represent a movement and in Soviet Russia in the 1920's the new architecture was powerful enough to convince serious classical architects to join the experiment and produce work that bridged the frontiers between classicism and modernism. It would be interesting to see an exhibition of the work of architects like Zholtovsky and Fomin who were geniuses at bringing all the forces of history to their work. There is one particularly moving exhibit that architects here might read with profit - especially those members of the RIBA who complain of government interference in the profession. In 1935 Chernikhov's books were banned from state libraries and his teaching was curtailed. He wrote a moving letter to Joseph Stalin begging for an end to his intellectual exile. Needless to say Chernikhov never received an answer. He attempted in some of his work to adjust to the megalomania of Stalin's architectural taste. His extremely monumental designs inspired by the official desire for memorials to the Second World War are literally amazing. Even more disturbing are his drawings for the 'Palaces of Communism' series that portray with uncanny prescience the giant prisons of Stalin's long tyranny. These are poignant and powerful works that show the intensity of his visual imagination. What is shown at the Architecture Foundation is only a fragment of his output. He left behind some 780 drawings and 50 books, and he clearly deserves a thorough biography and scholarly analysis of his important work. This display is an important glimpse into a world of architectural creation that most of us had almost forgotten.</p>

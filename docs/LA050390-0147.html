			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CONGREGATION IN SHOCK;  </P> <P> VENICE: MEMBERS OF PACIFIC JEWISH CENTER LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER, AND LIVE IN  RELATIVE PEACE. THE BRUTAL SLAYING OF A CONGREGANT HAS SHATTERED THAT PEACE.  </P> <P> On the second to last night of her life, after a festive Sabbath dinner,  Stephanie Bernstein was escorted on the mile walk back to her Venice apartment  by a fellow member of the Pacific Jewish Center congregation.  </P> <P> Such escorts are a way of life in the close-knit community, because of its  members' observance of the Jewish tradition of walking everywhere during the  Sabbath, and because of the danger in the sometimes-seedy area of the Venice  Beach boardwalk where the congregation lives and worships.  </P> <P> For 13 years, hundreds of center congregants have lived a laid-back yet  traditionally observant Jewish life among the eclectic characters of the  boardwalk. The mostly younger couples and singles who belong to the center  watch out for one another and have lived in relative peace.  </P> <P> But last week that peace was shattered. The somewhat insular and religious  community came face-to-face with the sometimes violent world around them on  April 23 when Bernstein was brutally slain in her apartment, allegedly by a  recently paroled rapist.  </P> <P> "We have been pretty lucky up until now," said Meyer Denn, executive director  of the center. "But now we have been touched by it too."  </P> <P> The 41-year-old writer and editor was stabbed and beaten to death, and may have  been raped, by an intruder in her 3rd Avenue apartment just off Rose Avenue.  </P> <P> Police say they caught Kermis Taffy Thompson Jr., 29, of Venice at Bernstein's  apartment. He has been charged with murder, rape, robbery and burglary.  Thompson, convicted in 1980 of raping and robbing a Los Angeles woman in her  apartment, was released from prison just 10 weeks ago. He could face the death  penalty, police said.  </P> <P> The attack has shocked and outraged the 500 or so members of the congregation  and has scared many into taking extra precautions.  </P> <P> "We have been devastated," Denn said. "We are like a big family and to have  someone wrenched out from among us, and the way it was done, makes it very  difficult for us to understand."  </P> <P> Some of the community's single women have moved in with friends and family,  including Allison Gordon, a close friend of Bernstein who lives close by.  </P> <P> "Otherwise," Gordon said, "I wouldn't be able to sleep. When something like  this happens, as a woman, it focuses you on how vulnerable you are."  </P> <P> Amid the soul-searching by members of the center, there has been a  strengthening of their resolve.  </P> <P> Nearly all the congregation members moved to the area around Rose Avenue so  they could be within walking distance of other community members and the  center's synagogue, formerly the Bay Cities Synagogue on Ocean Front Walk  overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> They were drawn to the center's philosophy of nurturing a communal lifestyle  steeped in the traditions of Judaism, a lifestyle described by congregants as a  tranquil oasis amid the chaos of urban life.  </P> <P> Those attractions were not changed by Bernstein's death.  </P> <P> "I can say this very emphatically for everyone living here; we are not going  anywhere," said writer Michael Medved, the center's president. "This is not  going to deflect us from our purpose of building a very dynamic center of  Jewish life in this corner of California."  </P> <P> Added Rabbi Daniel Lapin, who founded the center with Medved 13 years ago:  "People here assist each other at all levels, based on the desire to create an  oasis of communal tranquility. . . . We have been outraged. But you can't run  from this sort of thing. There is a determination not to yield."  </P> <P> Center leaders and congregants describe the community as a very special place,  a return to the Old World notion of a community in which they do more than  worship together.  </P> <P> Everyone knows and helps one another. Meals, particularly the Friday and  Saturday Sabbath meals, are festive occasions in which a dozen or so members  spend a few hours chatting about the week's events. Married members look to fix  up singles with mates. Members pitch in to make newcomers feel welcome.  </P> <P> When a woman gives birth, others cook the meals for her family for two weeks.  Members pitch in financially when others need help. The center itself sponsors  seminars and teaches classes on a number of issues pertaining to history and  religion.  </P> <P> Medved said it was that spirit of community, along with its emphasis on Jewish  traditions and values, that brought Bernstein and her former husband to the  community. Medved invited them for a holiday meal four years ago and they moved  to a house near the synagogue four months later, he said.  </P> <P> "Stephanie isn't somebody who just happened to find herself in Venice," Medved  said. "She, like virtually everybody else . . . moved here to be a part of this  experiment in living Judaism."  </P> <P> At a memorial ceremony last Thursday night, Bernstein was eulogized as a  caring, loving person, "without a mean bone in her body," who would often stop  to give a homeless person a blanket or money. Her contributions to the center  were noted, including her anonymous donations to help needy congregants, and  the hours she spent volunteering at the center's school.  </P> <P> "Stephanie was drawn to this neighborhood and our organization because she  exemplified it that much," Medved said. "In the best, most open tradition  spirit of the Jewish tradition, she found valuable and beautiful things in  every corner of society."  </P> <P> A funeral service was held Sunday for Bernstein in her parent's hometown of  Scarsdale, N.Y.  </P> <P> Bernstein, who dropped her married name of Corey after her divorce, had not  been all that religious until several years ago. But since moving into the  community, she kept kosher, walked everywhere during the Sabbath and began  learning more about Judaism.  </P> <P> She recently had become concerned with reports of violence in the area, and the  occasional eruptions of gunfire, according to Paula Bernstein, an in-law and  friend, and had thought about moving from the area since her divorce a year  ago. The two had even discussed the subject on the day Bernstein died.  </P> <P> But she wanted to stay within walking distance of the synagogue and the school,  said her friend.  </P> <P> "She felt that she didn't want to leave the community. The support was very  important to her," said Bernstein.  </P> <P> Medved and Lapin founded the center after finding that the once-thriving Jewish  community by the beach had been reduced almost to a handful of old men, and  that many younger Jews were new to the area and without a community to call  home, they said.  </P> <P> They set out to build a community, family by family, in the hopes of creating a  haven that would encourage Jews to return to their roots, or to find the  religious roots many of them had never known.  </P> <P> In the years since, more than 125 families have moved in to the community, and  there have been about 85 weddings and 160 children born, Denn said. Along the  way, the center has built a school that mixes American history and Judaism with  lessons in Hebrew, English and Spanish.  </P> <P> The school, with its whitewashed buildings and playgrounds surrounded by a  heavy security fence, plans to expand each year until it incorporates children  from kindergarten to 12th grade.  </P> <P> Because Bernstein spent a lot of time at the school and with the children, a  trust fund in her name has been established there to provide books at the  school and to encourage the youngsters to engage in creative writing.  </P> <P> Congregants are quick to explain that the community is neither overly insular  or religious. Rather, it is a place to study Judaism away from cloistered and  rigid confines.  </P> <P> "Many people have the tendency to view religiously committed people as  exclusive, isolated and withdrawn from the world," Medved said. "But PJC has  always stood for the opposite; that the more religious you are the more  involved you should be with the world around you, and the more connected."  </P> <P> Center officials say the area around the center is no more dangerous than any  other urban area and see Bernstein's brutal murder as an isolated incident.  Congregation members and Los Angeles Police Department officials said Thompson  should have been in custody at the time of the attack.  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 200-pound ex-convict, who has pleaded innocent to the current  charges, had been detained by police nearly a month ago in a gang raid at a  Culver City motel. Police arrested Thompson and others on suspicion of  conspiracy to commit murder, but he was released when the district attorney's  office declined to prosecute, Sgt. Alan Thatcher said.  </P> <P> Thatcher said members of LAPD's anti-gang unit thought Thompson's association  with the gang members was a violation of his parole.  </P> <P> "We think (Thompson) screwed up, and that there were grounds to revoke his  parole," Thatcher said. State parole officials, however, said Thompson had not  violated conditions of his parole.  </P> <P> Police had questioned Thompson just 20 minutes before Bernstein's slaying, as  he and another man stood on a street corner, but determined that he was doing  nothing illegal. The same officer who questioned Thompson arrested him less  than half an hour later, as Thompson came out of Bernstein's bedroom covered  with blood and brandishing an iron bar, according to Lt. Ross Moen, commanding  officer of detectives in LAPD's Pacific Division.  </P></p>

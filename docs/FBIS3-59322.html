			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Haocheng (0060 3185 2052): "On Legal </F> Safeguards for Human Rights (Part III)"]    [Text] After realistically examining the situation in China  and using the experience of other countries for reference, we  cannot but point out that there is plenty of room for  improvement in protecting human rights.    Regarding the situation of China's human rights,  particularly that in citizens' political rights and the legal  protection for human rights, the white paper "Human Rights in  China" published by the Information Office of the State Council  in October 1991 has already described these quite well. However,  after realistically examining the situation in China and using  the experience of other countries for reference, we cannot but  point out that there are many problems that we need to solve and  plenty of rooms for improvement in protecting human rights. One  of the problems is that the constitution has no provision to  guarantee citizens' rights to enjoy freedoms that they should  enjoy, while the other problem is that some of the rights have  been incorporated into the constitution, but there are no laws  enacted to guarantee such rights. Therefore, there is no firm  guarantee. In addition, a situation prevails where "laws are not  observed and their enforcement is not strict," so that some  legal rights are only in name. We would like to analyze the  existing problems in the protection of human rights as follows:  <H5>  Freedom of Person Is Deprived and Restricted </H5>   1. On Freedom of Person. China's current  constitution stipulates that the freedom of person of citizens  is inviolable and that unlawful deprivation or restriction of  citizens' freedom of person by detention or other means is  prohibited. Article 2 of the "Regulations of the People's  Republic of China Governing Arrest and Detention" stipulates  that no citizens "may be arrested except by the decision of a  people's court or with the sanction of a people's  procuratorate." However, public security organs actually often  arrest citizens in disguised form by using the "shelter and  investigation" provisions. Legally, China has never promulgated  any provision on "shelter and investigation." Re-education  through labor is regarded as an administrative penalty. In  essence it deprives and restricts personal freedom of those who  receive such re-education.    The provision for "living at home under surveillance" is  a coercive measure specified in the "Criminal Procedure Law of  the People's Republic of China." It stipulates that  "surveillance of one's home is to be carried out by the local  public security station or by the people's commune or the  defendant's unit entrusted with the task." This kind of coercive  measure serves to limit the sphere of activities of the  defendant and place him or her under surveillance, but it does  not completely restrict his freedom of person. Nevertheless, the  defendant is often brought to another location by the public  security organ and detained in a disguised form, and his  personal freedom is completely deprived and restricted. In  addition, Article 92 of the "Criminal Procedure Law" of China  stipulates: "The period for holding a defendant in custody  during investigation may not exceed two months. Where the  circumstances of a case are complex and the case cannot be  concluded before the expiration of the period, the period may be  extended by one month with the approval of the people's  procuratorate at the next level up." However, this period  actually often exceeds the period prescribed by the law.  Sometimes, it even lasts as long as several years. In addition,  China has for many years implemented the policy of "seeking  employment at the place of reform", which has actually prevented  prisoners from becoming completely free after finishing their  term of reform through labor. All this runs counter to the laws  which guarantee citizens' freedom of person.  <H5>  "Freedom of Thought" No Longer Available </H5>   2. On Freedom of Thought. The "Common Program  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,"  which had played the role of the interim constitution when the  People's Republic of China was first founded, also had a  provision on freedom of thought. Article 5 of the program said:  "People of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedoms of  thought, speech, the press, assembly, association,  correspondence, person, residence, change of residence,  religious belief, procession and demonstration." However, after  the 1954 Constitution, freedom of thought is no longer  available. There is only freedom of belief. This means religious  belief, not any belief in any discipline or thought.    The 1982 Constitution, the current one, follows this  practice. It has similar wording in its Preamble. Also, it adds  that "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and  the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the  Chinese people of all nationalities will continue to adhere to  the people's democratic dictatorship and follow the socialist  road... and turn China into a socialist country with a high  level of culture and democracy." Some of China's jurists have  stated with certainty that "the four cardinal principles have  been incorporated into the Constitution." "The Preamble of the  Constitution is legally binding," they added. Whether or not  this kind of practice of compelling people to legally accept the  ideology runs counter to the principle of freedom of thought is  something that we have to give thought to.    3. On Freedoms of Speech, of the Press, and of  Participation in Fine Arts and Literary and Art Activities.  All the versions of China's Constitution stipulate that citizens  enjoy the freedom of speech. However, Article 51 of the current  Constitution stipulates that "The exercise by citizens of the  People's Republic of China of their freedoms and rights may not  infringe upon the interests of the state, of society and of the  collective, or upon the lawful freedoms and rights of other  citizens." Due to the fact that as of now, there is no law of  the press or law of publication which explicitly describes the  scope of speech that is prohibited, and that Article 102 of the  Criminal Law on crimes of carrying out counter-revolutionary  propaganda and incitement is quite vague, citizens' words can be  considered as "those infringing upon the interests of the state,  of society and of the collective," and their freedoms of speech  and of the press can be restricted or deprived at any time. Mass  media such as newspapers and magazines have always been regarded  as the "party's mouthpiece," and the ban on newspapers and  magazines run by people has not been lifted. It is difficult for  political thought and speeches that differ from those of the  ruling party and the government to get published, while writers  of literary or academic works under criticism often have no  chance to defend themselves. All the information in newspapers,  journals, and radio and television materials are carefully  scrutinized. Books and journals from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan  and overseas are strictly checked or sealed off when they go  through the import procedure. Citizens' rights to know things  (also called the right to understanding things) is restricted to  a great extent. People often have to rely on the study of news  reports which "are exported for domestic circulation" to  understand the true situation in China.  <H5>  No Law of Association Even At Present </H5>   4. On Freedom of Association. All versions of  China's Constitution have stipulated that citizens enjoy freedom  of association. However, there is no law of association even at  present. The State Council had only promulgated the "Regulations  for the Registration and Control of Mass Organizations."  "Association" in the Constitution means mass organizations,  excluding any political party or any organization of a political  nature. There is no "Law of Political Parties" in China. Laws  have never stipulated whether or not it is legal to form other  new political parties. Actually the formation of any new  political party is prohibited. The "Regulations for the  Registration and Control of Mass Organizations" stipulate that  in forming a mass organization, citizens must register it with  the department of civil affairs with approval. This provision  places nearly all mass organizations under the control of the  government. Leading members of such mass organizations are  usually party or government officials or are appointed by the  party or government leadership. Such mass organizations  invariably become "official" or "semi-official." Let us take the  All-China Writers' Association as an example. Although many  members of the association are displeased with the leadership of  the association, they have no rights to form another  association. Workers' activities to form a liberal trade union  are also strictly forbidden in view of the lesson drawn from the  Poland Solidarity Trade Union.    5. On Freedoms of Residence and Change of  Residence. China's first "1954" Constitution had a  provision in this connection, but such provision was deleted in  the next three versions of the Constitution. China imposes  strict restriction on shifting rural population to the urban  areas. Rural residents are treated quite differently as compared  with their counterparts in the urban areas. Freedom to leave and  enter the country should be citizens' inherent rights, but such  freedom is severely restricted in China.    6. On Freedom of Strike. The 1954  Constitution had no provision on freedom of strike, but the 1975  and 1978 versions of the Constitution had a provision in this  connection. In his "Report on the Revision of the Constitution"  made in January 1975, Zhang Chunqiao said that "in accordance  with Chairman Mao's proposal," the specification that citizens  enjoy freedom to strike has been added to the Constitution.  However, such freedom was once again deleted in the 1982  Constitution. A legalist who participated in drafting the  Constitution at that time reasoned that "Workers are masters of  the nation, and workers' interests are in accord with those of  the state. A strike would only infringe upon the interests of  the workers and the state and undermine the national economy. In  addition, a strike often affects social order and make things  difficult for the people to work and live." This is another  example of asking the people to sacrifice their due rights for  the interests of the state, of society and of the collective.  However, tremendous changes had already taken place in the  country at that time. The number of private and foreign-funded  enterprises already accounted for a considerably larger  percentage of the total number of enterprises. Even if the  aforementioned statement was reasonable at that time, it does  not make sense now.  <H5>  Need To "Presume That the Defendant Is Innocent" </H5>   7. On the Principle That "the Defendant Is  Presumed Innocent." Prior to 1959, many jurists in China  advocated the principle that the defendant should be presumed  innocent. However, during the anti-rightist struggle such  principle was branded as a bourgeois theory which "is conducive  to the defendant." Many people received criticisms were thus  classified as "rightists." The official view is that in  investigating and trying cases, China's judicial organs adhere  to the principle of "taking facts as the basis and law as the  criterion." "They presume that criminal suspects are neither  guilty nor innocent, and judgement should be passed on the basis  of objective facts and in accordance with the law." As a matter  of fact, the principle of seeking truth from facts cannot  replace the presumption that the defendant is innocent, because  the crux of the problem is that what kind of legal status the  defendant has before the facts are ascertained and a sentence is  passed by the court. Here is a good example. On 31 March 1993,  the FAZHI RIBAO carried an article: "Work in Handling the  Aftermath of a Senior Middle School Girl Student's Suicide Case  in Zhuozhou City Is Still in Deadlock After Five Months," and  sponsored a discussion forum on this incident. What happened was  that a 15 year old girl student, under a situation of having no  concrete evidence against her, was subject to coercive  interrogations several times a night. She was instructed to  rummage through her bookcases and boxes and to expose the  contents. Afterwards, she committed suicide. However, the school  administration drew the conclusion that "There is no evidence to  prove her larceny. Nor can we deny her larceny." This incident  completely substantiates the correctness and the necessity of  the principle of presuming the defendant as innocent in  protecting human rights.  <H5>  No One Supervises Enforcement of the Constitution </H5>   8. On Supervising the Enforcement of the  Constitution. The current constitution in China stipulates  that the National People's Congress and its standing committee  are responsible for overseeing the enforcement of the  Constitution. No particular organization is assigned to perform  the job of enforcement. In essence, no one is supervising the  enforcement of the Constitution, because one of the important  supervisory tasks is to determine whether or not all laws and  regulations are in accord with the Constitution. Apparently, the  National People's Congress and its standing committee cannot  carry out the work of examining all the laws that they have  passed. Due to the lack of a particular organization assigned to  oversee the enforcement of the Constitution, citizens are unable  to take legal proceedings against state organs and their  leadership for violations of the Constitution. Are China's laws  and regulations for the protection of citizens' rights as well  as rules for the implementation of such laws and regulations in  complete accord with the guidelines and the provisions of the  Constitution? People are gravely concerned over this question.  Therefore, it is necessary to set up an authoritative  organization to insure that laws and regulations are in accord  with the Constitution.    In short, on the one hand, China has scored remarkable  achievements in strengthening socialist democracy and the legal  system, and in protecting citizens' freedoms, and rights and  interests, since the convocation of the 3d Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee, while on the other hand, there  are inadequacies, even serious inadequacies. In order to make  improvements in this respect, we must continue to reform our  political structure, further develop socialist democracy, and  improve the socialist legal system. To work hard to improve  China's situation in human rights is not only indispensable in  building a democratic, civilized and prosperous modern nation,  but also essential in making valuable contributions to promoting  progress for the whole mankind.

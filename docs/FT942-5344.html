			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Collecting: Dealers face the month of truth - Is the antiques revival under way? Antony Thorncroft looks at the Grosvenor House and Olympia fairs This is it: the month that will decide for many of the nation's 8,000 professional antique dealers if the long-awaited, and oft-predicted, revival in demand is actually there - or whether they will have to struggle on, persuading their bank managers they are worth supporting for another year. In June, London once again becomes - although briefly - the centre of the international art market. Rich collectors and dealers arrive for the grand Grosvenor House Fair which, for 10 days from Thursday, celebrates its 60th anniversary. They take in, too, the important exhibitions staged simultaneously by the top West End galleries, plus the major auctions. And they will surely pop along as well to Olympia where, for the next nine days, more than 400 dealers, mainly British but with an increasing number of foreign exhibitors, display the largest accumulation of vetted antiques seen annually in London. Around 40,000 people are expected at Olympia, a popular bun-fight where the largest London dealer in Old Masters, Richard Green, lines up alongside provincial furniture dealers on their annual selling trip to London. Some will expect to notch up 40 per cent of their annual turnover there from the choice items they have salted away for the occasion. Opening day on Thursday got off to a starry start - Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Rowan Atkinson were all touting their cheque books. Of course Olympia is too large - although Imagebase, a visual database which locates the stands offering the antiques in which you might have particular interest, should ease aching feet. Dealers love Olympia. One reason is that, at around Pounds 15,000 a stand, it is half the price of Grosvenor House. But it really does have an aura of excitement despite the chaos. In good years, Grosvenor House dealers used to raid Olympia each day for fresh stock. It could just happen again in 1994, for there is a feeling that the revival in business must come soon. To help with transport, there is a bus service between the two fairs. Grosvenor House has a very different atmosphere. The organisers have digested the fact that its glitzy array, and sometimes exorbitant prices, have deterred both middle range collectors and informed browsers. They know also that the more international Maastricht fair in March has had the edge in recent years. So, for its diamond jubilee, Grosvenor House has been given a new look The biggest change is quite revolutionary: it has abolished datelines. For the first time, the great works of art of the 20th century - Picasso paintings, Matisse prints, art deco ceramics, abstract expressionism even - can now be displayed. Indeed, it is possible that the Dover Street Gallery will offer a painting by the still-shocking Allen Jones, creator of sexist furniture. There will certainly be 1920s' furniture on the Yves Mikaeloff stand; a 1930s' bronze at Agnews (along with a fresh-on-the-market Lawrence portrait); an Ivon Hitchen at Spink; Matisse lithographs at William Weston; and designs by Omar Ramsden and CR Ashbee at Nicholas Harris. It will take time for the change in stock to filter through: despite the arrival of a few foreign dealers, Grosvenor House remains the annual showcase for the cream of the British antiques trade and, especially, brown furniture dealers. But, over the next few years, younger and trendier collectors of the modern will have reason to add this fair to their itinerary. A more immediate impact comes from a transformation in the fair's appearance. Designer George Carter has created a classical environment, with colonnades of Tuscan pilasters creating a unified look. The height of the stands has been raised considerably so that more substantial antiques, like chandeliers and tapestries, can be displayed attractively. Dealers also are attempting to offer a wider range of stock. There will be fewer seven-figure masterpieces and more four-figure collectables. Among the affordable items are early English needlework at Witney Antiques; a Danish wine barrel at Jeremy Ltd; St Louis goblets at Mallett; and a pair of Regency painted children's chairs at Halcyon Days. In total contrast is Newark, in Nottinghamshire, the biggest antique and collectors' fair in the world with up to 4,000 stalls stretching over 86 acres. It opens on Tuesday; and, although it might be only one step ahead of a superior boot sale, there is enough good furniture on display for it to be a magnet for continental dealers. Yes, there are too many fairs. But with dealers being forced by higher costs and lower revenues to close down their retail premises - Lapada, the Association of Art and Antique Dealers, reckons that up to 10 per cent of its members have shut up shop in the past two years - fairs, both specialist and general, have become a lifeline for dealers now trading from home. At fairs, they can acquire new stock, meet existing and new customers - and perhaps sell some antiques. As well as the big mixed fairs, this month also sees two successful specialist gatherings in London: the Antiquarian Book Fair, at Grosvenor House for the first time, from June 30; and the International Ceramics Fair, at the Park Lane Hotel from June 10. While there has been a slight improvement in demand in the antiques trade over the past year, the recovery remains as elusive as that in house prices and the economy generally. If overall confidence improves, so will antique buying. Dealers hope there is considerable pent-up demand; certainly, there is a shortage of good items appearing on the market. The travails at Lloyd's have released relatively few art works to date although, sadly, they have eliminated one major source of buyers. Salerooms are showing dealers the way by looking overseas for new business. Of course, with vastly greater financial resources, it is easier for them to do so. This year, both Christie's South Kensington and Bonhams - which concentrate on the middle and lower ranges of the market - report an increase in turnover of more than 20 per cent. This comes partly from their success in marketing themselves to foreign buyers - in Bonhams' case, by forming a marketing relationship with auction houses in New York, Los Angeles and Vienna. Demand also has been stimulated by the salerooms trading in new markets. Christie's South Kensington has had great success with cameras  - and corkscrews. Bonhams is offering Victorian Gothic on June 20 to coincide with the big Pugin show at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum this month. In areas such as furniture and, to a lesser extent, pictures, there is no doubt that buyers now have the confidence to bid at auction rather than rely on the advice of dealers. This is a long-term problem for the trade, which fairs go only some way to countering. But stories about the demise of London as an international art centre seem premature. Leslie Waddington, one leading modern art dealer, might be threatening to close one of his galleries in Cork Street, London - but that would leave him with a couple of brace still trading happily. Indeed, three important international dealers have just shown their faith in the future by opening up in London for the first time. Finarte, from Italy, is mounting a major show of the work of the surrealist artist de Chirico in new premises in Mason's Yard; Johnnie Eskenazi, cousin of Giuseppe, is settling in Old Bond Street to trade in rugs, textiles and Oriental art; and Danny Katz gives London its first major specialist sculpture gallery, in the old Heim premises in Jermyn Street.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Jobless total set to slide further THE GOVERNMENT is today expected to announce the sixth consecutive monthly fall in unemployment, with City analysts predicting a fall of about 5,000. This would take the decline since February close to 90,000, with total unemployment at just over 2.9m. Government economists are increasingly optimistic that the economy is now generating a net increase in employment. In the first quarter of this year, which included two months of falling unemployment, the number of people in employment fell by 61,000. Unemployment was therefore falling in the first quarter of the year not because of a net increase in job creation but because fewer people were coming on to the job market, as a result of factors such as more people staying on in full-time education. More recent figures for manufacturing employment show that it fell by 15,000 between April and May. The second-quarter employment figure for the whole economy will not be known until next month, but one government economist said yesterday it would be 'disappointing' if it did not show a reasonable increase in view of stronger-than-expected output. Officials and the government are increasingly confident that the unemployment trend will continue downwards. While there is still no clear view about why unemployment has fallen so much earlier than most people expected, the shake-out of more than 400,000 jobs in the last quarter of 1992 is put forward as the main explanation. The Trades Union Congress is calling for a 'reassessment' of the convergence criteria for European economic and monetary union, and for the inclusion of targets on economic growth and unemployment. The TUC, in its reply to the European Commission white paper on employment, growth and competitiveness, also stresses that the free-market policies adopted by Britain and the US in the 1980s have failed to produce lasting competitiveness. The TUC says in its submission, published yesterday, that both the EC through the Social Chapter and the Clinton administration in the US have rejected the 'diabolical trade-off' between a good record on job creation and a good record on employment standards. Mr David Lea, TUC assistant general secretary, said: 'Our analysis shows that American and British performance on growth and competitiveness was relatively poor during the 1980s and early 1990s. It shows that the recipe of freeing markets, privatisation and cutting employment rights has failed.' It stresses that it is vital for the EC not to move towards a British or US model of labour market deregulation. Although the US has had a better record on private-sector job creation than the EC, unit-labour costs in Europe have fallen faster than in the US between 1980 and 1993.</p>

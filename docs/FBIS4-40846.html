			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Monetary Fund has extended $30  million to the Kazakh oil and gas amalgamation Mangistaumunaigaz  to be used for the reconstruction of the oil-production system  in Uzen (western Kazakhstan).    Experts told the Oil Information Agency that the IMF credit  would be invested in the construction of a facility for  collecting oil leakage and oil-industry wastes, and for  processing them into quality gasoline.    Kazakhstan's Department for Environmental Protection and  Biological Resources reports that more than 16,000 square meters  of fertile soil has been polluted in Uzen. The oil pools are  polluting the air with hydrogen sulphide, whose content exceeds  the admissible level.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Curbs set for third radio network The Radio Authority has ordered that the rock or classical music output of the UK's third independent national radio network should be no more than 10 per cent of total airtime, Raymond Snoddy writes. The restrictions will be spelt out tomorrow when the authority advertises the third INR licence. Under broadcasting legislation at least one of the three new national services has to be predominantly speech-based. The first two to be launched, Classic FM and Virgin 1215, are both music services. So the authority is insisting that 51 per cent of airtime in any three-hour period should be speech. Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, said: 'INR3 could be anything from an all-speech news/talk station or one with a sports emphasis to a mix of, say, studio conversations, phone-ins and appropriate music.' Bids have to be submitted by March 15 and the licence will be awarded in June or July. This means that INR3 could be on air using the old BBC Radio 1 medium wave frequencies by the end of next year.</p>

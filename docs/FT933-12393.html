			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Workers' threat to Booker Prize MUSHROOM pickers dismissed from their jobs at Middlebrook Mushrooms, a Booker subsidiary, are threatening to stage a protest at the company's annual literary prize-giving. The women are holding a rally today in Selby, North Yorkshire, at which their union, the TGWU general union, will warn of a campaign intended to embarrass Booker back to the negotiating table. The 89 pickers were dismissed last November after imposing an overtime ban after company moves to change working patterns to ensure reliability of weekend production and reduce overtime costs. Booker says the changes were needed because of revisions to delivery schedules caused by Sunday trading by the supermarkets that Middlebrook Mushrooms supplies. On Monday, at a hearing in Leeds, the women will test whether they can take their case to an industrial tribunal. Booker said yesterday that the company considered the dispute finished, and any demonstration at the October prize-giving at London's Guildhall was unlikely in the light of the enhanced security measures in the City.</p>

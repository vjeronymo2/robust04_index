			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> THE HORMONES BEHIND OUR GUT FEELINGS;  </P> <P> RESEARCH: SCIENTISTS ARE LEARNING HOW THE STOMACH AND BRAIN COMMUNICATE. THE  LESSONS HOLD GREAT PROMISE FOR SUFFERERS OF MANY GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> In the early 19th Century, a young Canadian named Alex St. Martin suffered a  gunshot wound that left a permanent opening in his stomach. This allowed his  physician to make a striking observation -- the man's angry feelings slowed the  passage of food through his stomach and hampered secretion of various stomach  juices which aid digestion.  </P> <P> More than 150 years after the case was detailed in a book by the physician, Dr.  William Beaumont, "Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice and the  Physiology of Digestion," researchers are making headway into understanding the  chemical ties between the brain and the gut. These ties help explain how stress  and emotional upsets can prompt a repertoire of common gastrointestinal  complaints including ulcers, diarrhea and constipation. The research suggests  new treatment avenues for gastrointestinal disorders, including drugs that work  on the brain rather than the gut to relieve "gut feelings."  </P> <P> "We've made great strides in understanding how the brain and gut 'talk' to each  other," said pharmacologist Cynthia Williams of the University of Texas in  Houston. "There's really been an explosion of findings."  </P> <P> That explosion was brought about by the discovery, over the last 20 years, of  more than 50 different compounds generated by the brain. About a dozen of these  have a dramatic effect on the gut. "It's been a rumor for a long time that many  GI (gastrointestinal) tract disorders are caused by stress or other emotions,"  said Williams, "but until we had these compounds to play around with, we had no  way of systematically evaluating it."  </P> <P> One of the newer brain compounds to be discovered, corticotropin-releasing  factor (CRF), plays a key role in wreaking the effects of stress on the colon,  Williams' research suggests. Called a "master transmitter," CRF is released by  the brain in response to stress and triggers a number of reactions in the body,  including the boosting of heart rate and blood pressure and the suppression of  food consumption and sexual activity.  </P> <P> Williams has shown that in rats, CRF propels food quickly through the colon,  prompting excretion and, in high doses, diarrhea. The compound also slows the  passage of food through the small intestine. The animals generated large  amounts of CRF when they were stressed by being in a restraining harness. Other  researchers have confirmed Williams' findings and shown that CRF also slows the  emptying of stomach contents into the small intestine.  </P> <P> Eliminating food from the colon frees some of the body's blood supply so it can  be used to enable a fast escape or a valiant fight. Slowing the passage of food  through the small intestine and stomach makes an animal feel full so it will  not have an urge to munch when faced with danger.  </P> <P> The type of stress these animals experienced in Williams' studies is not  exactly akin to the stress a person experiences during rush-hour traffic or at  work. Other studies have shown, however, that mental stress, such as that  generated when undergoing a rigorous personal interview, prompts the same  changes in the human colon that Williams saw in rats.  </P> <P> The cascade of hormones released in the human "fight or flight" response to  stress appears to be universal among mammals. "When you're faced with a tiger  in the woods," Williams explains, "you don't need your gastrointestinal  functions. What you need, instead, is your heart pounding, sending a lot of  blood to your muscles so you can quickly respond." Particularly promising is  Williams' finding that when the rats were given a shot of a compound that  partially blocks CRF's actions, it completely countered the effects of stress  on the gut.  </P> <P> Williams and colleague Thomas Burks of the University of Arizona in Tucson  currently have a patent pending for the use of this CRF blocker to treat  patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The hallmarks of this syndrome are  chronic diarrhea or constipation with abdominal pain. The disorder afflicts 15%  to 20% of the population, according to epidemiologist James Everhart of the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda,  Md.  </P> <P> No physical abnormalities explain the syndrome, although a number of studies  link its occurrence to heightened stress. There currently is no effective  treatment for the condition, which one gastroenterologist poetically called a  manifestation of a "weeping colon."  </P> <P> Burks has recently shown that CRF boosts the number of contractions in the  junction between the large and small intestines. This could explain the  incapacitating pain experienced by irritable bowel syndrome patients, he said,  as well as their constipation and diarrhea.  </P> <P> In other work, Yvette Tache of the UCLA Center for Ulcer Research and Education  and her colleagues have uncovered two brain compounds that strongly influence  whether animals develop stomach ulcers. Extremely small amounts of just one of  these powerful chemicals, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), have been shown  to trigger a host of reactions in the gut, all of which foster ulcers. In four  species of animals, for example, Tache and others have found that TRH boosts  contractions and secretion of acid in the stomach, stems the stomach's  production of bicarbonate, which neutralizes acid, and affects blood flow in  the stomach, making it more susceptible to ulcers. When TRH is given to rats,  they develop stomach ulcers within just two hours.  </P> <P> Although the links have not been proven conclusively, there is evidence to  suggest that TRH is released in response to stress and can make animals more  alert and responsive. It counteracts the depressant effects of certain drugs.  </P> <P> Fortunately for the stomach, brain cells also generate a compound called  gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), which has an opposite effect on the gut from  TRH and protects animals from developing ulcers. Tache speculates that  compounds such as GRP may be generated by the brain after a stressful situation  to counteract the compounds induced by stress and bring the gut back to normal  in most people.  </P> <P> A French company is currently pursuing GRP as an anti-ulcer drug.  </P> <P> "The beauty of our findings," said Tache, "is that from one small molecule  working on just one site, you counter the gamut of response involved in ulcer  formation. You could never get that kind of response by targeting a drug, as  most current ulcer drugs do, to one aspect of ulcer formation. The cells that  generate acid in the stomach, for example, don't also affect bicarbonate  production."  </P> <P> "Manipulating the system from the top down," she said, "can be much more  effective because it gives you the overall body response you want."  </P> <P> Researchers have discovered several chemicals generated by the brain that have  dramatic effects on the digestive system. Stress triggers the brain to produce  some of these chemicals, creating a variety of gastrointestinal disorders,  including diarrhea, constipation and ulcers. The research suggests that these  digestive problems can be treated with other chemicals that work from the brain  rather than on a specific area of the gut.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'FIGHT OR FLIGHT' RESPONSE  </P> <P> 1. Brain releases CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor) in response to stress,  stimulating changes throughout the body  </P> <P> 2. The heart rate and blood pressure increase, enabling muscles to respong  quickly  </P> <P> 3. CRF slows passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine, reducing  appetite  </P> <P> 4. Food is eliminated from the colon, freeing the body's blood supply  </P> <P> </P> <P> STOMACH ULCERS  </P> <P> TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) triggers a host of reactions in the  stomach, causing ulcers. The hormone, triggered by stress, boosts contractions  and secretion of acid in the stomach, stems production of bicarbonate, affects  blood flow to stomach, making it more susceptible to ulcers.  </P> <P> GRP (gastrin-releasing peptide) has an opposite effect on the gut as TRH and  prevents the development of ulcers. Researchers suspect that GRP may be  released after a stressful situation to counter the effects of TRH and bring  the gut back to normal.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COURT-MARTIAL FOR KINKAID'S SKIPPER BEGINS  </P> <P> The commanding officer of a Navy destroyer involved in a collision at the  Strait of Malacca did not know the true location of his vessel and had  inadequately trained his watch crew, a Navy prosecutor charged Sunday during  the opening day of the first such court-martial in more than a decade.  </P> <P> Cmdr. John M. Cochrane, the 44-year-old captain of the Kinkaid, which collided  with a merchant ship in November -- killing the Kinkaid's navigator and  injuring five sailors -- stands accused of endangering the ship and its crew by  failing to carry out a safe plan for crossing one of the world's most heavily  traveled channels.  </P> <P> If convicted, Cochrane -- who enlisted almost 21 years ago -- faces a maximum  penalty of two years in the brig, forfeiture of all future pay including his  pension, and dismissal from the Navy. The case will explore the extent of a  captain's responsibilities for his crew and ship. The captain has traditionally  been viewed as accountable for his vessel -- a longtime cornerstone of Navy  philosophy.  </P> <P> Navy prosecutor Lt. Cmdr. Leroy Dickens charged that Cochrane not only failed  to pick up a navigational error and was misinformed about the ship's location,  but that he also understaffed the ship's bridge and watches. Some crew members  performing watch duties during the night of the collision were doing those  tasks either for the first or second time -- and a total of eight sailors had  not qualified by Navy regulations for the tasks to which they were assigned,  Dickens said.  </P> <P> "This collision should never have happened. . . . The commanding officer set  the stage for a disaster," Dickens said during proceedings at the 32nd Street  Naval Station. "The commanding officer of a ship should always know where his  ship is. When he goes to bed, he should know where his ship is. He must always  know."  </P> <P> On the eve of the collision, Cochrane requested a wake-up call of 6 a.m., and  the ship arrived at the strait, between the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, almost  an hour earlier. When the collision occurred about 5 a.m., the captain,  navigator and assistant navigator were not on the bridge, witnesses testified.  </P> <P> Lt. Sean McPhee, the 24-year-old navigator who had held his position for about  four months, was killed as he slept in his bunk. McPhee, of Santa Rosa, Calif.,  had told the captain and the executive officer that the Kinkaid would not reach  the strait until later in the morning. McPhee had asked to hold a navigational  briefing the following morning, said Lt. Cmdr. David T. Cunningham, the ship's  executive officer, who has been in the Navy 15 years.  </P> <P> But the Kinkaid was apparently ahead of its schedule and arrived at the busy  crossing with a smaller number of men in the Combat Information Center than was  required by Navy regulations, testified Lt. (j.g.) Douglas Walter McCurdy, the  CIC watch officer. McCurdy assumed the CIC watch at 4:25 a.m. -- a duty he had  performed for the first time the day before. Realizing the Kinkaid's location  and believing the ship was undermanned, he twice requested that the vessel's  contingency plan be started and more men summoned.  </P> <P> "I was told people were standing by if I ordered it. I was told there was a  plan," McCurdy testified, looking at Cochrane several times. "I discovered  that, whatever plan there was, it was not effective, because no one came."  </P> <P> The 563-foot Kinkaid, en route to Hong Kong on Nov. 11 for a routine port call,  collided with the Kota Petanie, a 493-foot Panamanian freighter. Fires broke  out aboard the Kinkaid and the collision ripped a 15-by-56-foot hole in its  starboard side. Injuries aboard the Kota Petanie were minor.  </P> <P> Two sailors and two officers -- including McCurdy -- received letters of  reprimand in connection with the collision. The duty officer, Lt. (j.g.) Steven  M. Williams, 25, was dismissed from the Navy in a court-martial after receiving  a letter of reprimand in February. Williams, the officer of the deck, was found  guilty of dereliction of duty and negligently hazarding a vessel.  </P> <P> Cochrane, who declined to discuss his case during Sunday's proceedings, was  relieved of duty in November.  </P> <P> "It's a terrible thing to happen after such a wonderful career," said his wife,  Suzanne, of San Diego. The accident "was just a moment in time where everything  went wrong. My husband isn't bitter, but I stand nothing to lose by saying that  I am extremely bitter and I don't love the Navy."  </P> <P> Cochrane's case will explore the extent to which a captain is responsible for  his ship. The last time a similar case occurred was in 1975, when the guided  missile cruiser Belknap collided with the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy  during operations in the Mediterranean. Eight sailors were killed and 48 were  injured.  </P> <P> In a controversial decision, the Belknap's captain, Walter R. Shafer, was  acquitted of negligence charges by a military judge in 1976.  </P> <P> The decision was so controversial that Adm. James Holloway, then chief of naval  operations, released a statement saying it did not undercut the long-held Navy  policy that has always declared a commanding officer responsible for his vessel  and crew.  </P> <P> "There are obviously deviations, and the Belknap was one. A number of us  weren't too damn pleased about it," retired Vice Adm. Joseph Metcalf III, a  former deputy chief of naval operations, said in an interview.  </P> <P> "Basically, a captain is in charge and he is held responsible for what happens.  Ships can't be run by committee," Metcalf said.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Dickens painted a picture of a crew strained by its own inexperience  and further hampered by understaffing at a critical moment. Dickens alleges  that Cochrane did not:  </P> <P> * Supply functioning binoculars or a stopwatch, used as a measurement tool.  </P> <P> * Review directions or brief the crew about sailing the Strait of Malacca.  </P> <P> * Ensure that qualified personnel were assigned to stand watch.  </P></p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Balance of payments of the main industrial countries FOR makers of international economic policy, one of the worries of the second half of the 1980s was current account 'imbalances'. If these were, indeed, a problem, a solution is on the way. As the chart shows, current account deficits and surpluses are dwindling away as a share of the gross national or domestic products of the four main countries that have experienced the largest divergences from balance. But it is too soon to be sure how far this change is structural and how far only cyclical. This adjustment is also clear from the table, the second in our new series of world economic indicators. It presents balance of payments data, denominated in Ecu, for each of the six largest industrialised countries, though Germany's balance of payments refers only to the west in the period before economic and monetary union. Annual data are presented for the period 1984 to 1990, and both quarterly and monthly for 1990 and early 1991. The quarterly and monthly data have been adjusted to remove seasonal fluctuations, except where indicated in the notes. This table will appear approximately every month, with the latest available monthly, quarterly and annual data. The most striking feature of the table is the conversion by means of the Ecu, the European currency unit. The customary numeraire for currency conversion has long been the US dollar, but it is the currency of only one country, however large, and has been notoriously unstable against other major currencies. Changes in dollar amounts over time can be a highly misleading indicator of real developments. It is desirable to use a more internationally representative unit of account. There are two competitors, the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Right and the Ecu. The former is the more global, but it is merely a unit of account, while the Ecu is becoming a genuine currency. In addition, since sterling joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, four of the six countries shown above - Germany, France, Italy and the UK - should have fairly stable exchange rates against the Ecu. For those unfamiliar with the Ecu, the exchange rate for each country, expressed as units of the national currency per Ecu, is also included in the table. This allows the series to be converted back to national currencies. The table presents the value of visible exports, the trade balance and the current account for each country. The trade balance is equal to the value of visible exports minus the value of visible imports. Imports can be calculated by subtracting the value of exports from the trade balance. The current account balance is equal to sum of the visible and invisible trade balances. There are three main categories of invisible imports and exports: services, such as banking; interest, profits and dividends; and transfers, such as payments by the UK government to the EC or in overseas aid. Statistics for invisible trade are notoriously difficult to collect. For example the UK estimates the invisible trade balance in compiling its monthly data but records the actual data only every quarter. Monthly current account data should, therefore, be treated with caution. The US does not publish monthly data for invisible trade therefore current account data is only available quarterly. The effective exchange rate is a weighted average of the value of a currency against a 'basket' of other currencies, expressed in index form. The weights are designed to capture the relative importance of each of the other countries as a competitor to the manufacturing sector of that country. These series serve as an indicator of international competitiveness, correcting for some of the volatility of daily exchange rate movements. The sharp fall in the US effective exchange rate after 1985 reflects the depreciation of the US dollar since that date. Important differences between countries in the way they collect and report trade statistics mean that cross-country comparisons must be made with caution. With the exception of the UK, the value of exports, imports and thus the trade balance are shown on a customs clearance basis, reflecting the value of goods as they pass through customs. UK data, by contrast, are expressed on a balance of payments basis after a number of adjustments have been made to the customs cleared data. These adjustments deduct freight costs and insurance premiums from the import figures; and exclude certain types of imports, for example UK-owned ships returning to the UK after repair abroad. Import data from the US, Japan and France are published on a 'free on board' (FOB) basis after deducting freight costs and insurance premiums. Imports into Germany and Italy are published on a 'carriage, insurance and freight' (CIF) basis. According to the IMF this causes imports to be 2-3 per cent higher for Germany, and some 7 per cent higher for Italy. A further cross-country discrepancy arises from the unusual way in which the US current account is recorded. The US Commerce department includes capital gains on US owned assets held abroad arising from changes in the value of the dollar as an invisible item in the current account. Regardless of all these complications, the message is clear: it is one of balance of payments adjustment among these six countries.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade figures are given in billions of European Currency Units (ECU).

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bankers Trust advances to Dollars 137m in final quarter BANKERS TRUST, the New York banking group, continued to out-perform most of its competitors in the north-east in the fourth quarter of 1991, with an 11 per cent rise in net profits to Dollars 137m. Mr Charles Sanford, chairman, said earnings reached a record in 1991 despite the US recession. He stressed that total bank revenues were 4.5 per cent higher year-on-year, staff numbers were reduced by 9 per cent and non-interest expenses were up by only 3.6 per cent. The bank, which recently announced the departure of Mr Ralph MacDonald, one of the co-heads of its global corporate finance division, said its return on equity in the fourth quarter was 18 per cent. Net earnings of Dollars 667m for the whole of 1991 were only Dollars 2m higher than in 1990, while the bank's return on equity last year was 23 per cent. Although net interest revenues after bad-debt provisions were Dollars 100m lower in 1991 at Dollars 499m, Bankers Trust made up for this with non-interest revenues Dollars 195m higher at Dollars 2.5bn. Foreign exchange trading revenues fell from Dollars 425m to Dollars 272m in 1991, but this was offset by a Dollars 356m rise in the bank's trading account, to Dollars 957m. Bad-debt provisions were up only slightly in the fourth quarter, from Dollars 73m to Dollars 75m. For the whole of 1991 bad-debt provisions rose to Dollars 238m, from Dollars 194m in 1990. On Wall Street, the Bankers Trust share price was marked  5/8 higher, to Dollars 64 1/2 . Mr Robert Diamond, a senior executive in London for Morgan Stanley, has joined rival US investment bank CS First Boston as chief executive of its Far Eastern activities, writes Martin Dickson in New York. Mr Allen Wheat, 43, who has headed the Pacific operations for the past two years, as well as running the firm's derivatives products business, Credit Suisse Financial Products, will now concentrate on the latter and take responsibility for the bank's worldwide foreign exchange business.</p>

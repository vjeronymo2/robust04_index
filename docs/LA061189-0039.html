			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FURY OVER THE FOCUS  </P> <P> Re "Fountainhead of a New Fury": Why was there so little mention of Ayn Rand's  philosophical work? Why was there no mention of the Ayn Rand Society, a branch  of the American Philosophical Assn. (an organization of university  philosophers, with similar branches for Plato, Aristotle, David Hume and  others)? Or of the Ayn Rand Institute, right here in Marina del Rey, which  conducts a yearly essay contest on "The Fountainhead" for high school juniors  and seniors, and which sponsors academic work in philosophy?  </P> <P> I was glad to see her described as a "consistent (and) passionate champion of  individual rights," but there is a lot more to Ayn Rand than politics. Ayn Rand  provided new and important insights into the nature of reason and its role in  human life, into morality and the important questions traditionally answered by  religion. Especially with more and more people turning to fundamentalism,  Shirley MacLaine, "crystal power," and drug cults for meaning in life, Ayn  Rand's rational, benevolent message deserves better than to be carelessly  dismissed as adolescent foolishness.  </P> <P> BEN KOVITZ  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

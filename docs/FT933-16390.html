			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions HUNTLEIGH Technology has been one of the few recent stars of the health and household sector. Montague Samuels, a non-executive director, has sold 100,000 shares at 410p while a colleague, Dr SJ Cook, has disposed of his remaining 11,000 at the same price. Mini-conglomerate Suter has seen considerable director activity. Chairman David Abell sold around 110,000 shares but he, Robert Morris and Anthony Owen bought substantial amounts of Suter warrants.

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Italians hold off Nigeria for extra-time victory Roberto Baggio and the Azzurri were about two minutes away from a date with lions in the Coliseum of Rome in Foxboro, Massachusetts, yesterday, Jurek Martin writes. But the Italian superstar rescued his team with an 88th-minute equaliser and then, in the 10th minute of extra time, converted the penalty that his own lovely lobbed pass had helped create, giving Italy a 2-1 victory over Nigeria in the World Cup second round. If ever a game had two parts it was this. Nigeria took the lead in the 25th minute in virtually their first attack. A corner from the right rebounded off Maldini across the area to Amunike, who placed a sidefoot volley past Marchegiani. Whereupon Nigeria sat on their lead and Italy attacked in waves. But so stout was the Nigerian defence and so poor the Italian offence that Rufai in goal had no serious save to make until Baggio beat him. The goal followed a run from the right by Mussi, playing only his third international, who gave Baggio a clear shot from a dozen yards inside Rufai's right post. The winner came after Baggio lofted a dead ball to set Benarrivo through in the area, where he was clattered down by Eguavoen. The penalty went in off the right-hand post. That a penalty was called at all was the fitting climax of an eccentric refereeing day by Arturo Brizio of Mexico. He issued nine yellow cards, tying a World Cup record, five to Italians, though the match was never vicious. His worst error occurred in the 75th minute when he sent off Zola, a second-half substitute, for what seemed the mildest of tackles. But two minutes later he decided not to send off Maldini, who had brought down Yekini with the sort of arm toss of which a sumo wrestler would have been proud. So Italy, as against Norway, won with 10 men. Even so, as the Nigerians cranked up their attack, they left openings which both Baggios nearly exploited. At the other end, Dino Baggio saved the day in extra time by hooking a Yekini poke off the line. Later, Yekini launched a bitter attack on Nigeria coach Clemens Westerhof, saying the defeat was due to his tactical folly. He also criticised his team-mates for not passing to him enough. It was a match which salvaged Roberto Baggio's pre-tournament reputation - though only just. After a bright beginning, he faded from the scene and looked tense and unsmiling. The goal unleashed a talent that seemed withered under pressure. Next come Spain on Saturday and their defence is far more uncompromising than Nigeria's.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Alcatel buys into mobile telephone operation Alcatel Alsthom, the French engineering and communications group, yesterday announced it is to buy a 20 per cent stake in the mobile telephone operations of Generale des Eaux, the utilities and construction company. It will buy the stake from Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making state-owned bank which is implementing a programme of asset sales as part of a rescue package. The price paid for the stake was not disclosed. The decision by Alcatel to take the stake in Generale des Eaux's Cofira followed its failure in October to win the licence for France's third mobile telephone network. Conclusion of the deal was delayed, however, by the need for approval from France's telecoms authorities, which yesterday granted permission for Alcatel to take a stake of up to 25 per cent in Cofira. According to Alcatel, the investment in Cofira will be held by General Occidental, its media and communications subsidiary. The company said this would allow 'an absolute separation' between its activities as an equipment supplier and its new participation in a service provider. Alcatel is one of the world's biggest telecoms equipment manufacturers, a factor which contributed to its failed bid for the mobile licence. The fiercely-contested licence was awarded instead to Bouygues, the construction and communications group. Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel chairman, has long sought to enter the market for telecoms services. The company said yesterday the participation in Cofira, which operates one of the two existing mobile networks, confirmed its strategy of developing in this sector. Industry observers forecast rapid growth in the French mobile telecoms market, which has trailed other European countries. At the end of August, France had 730,000 subscribers, compared with 2.2m in Germany.</p>

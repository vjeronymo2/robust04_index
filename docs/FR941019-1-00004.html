			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has identified possible regulatory actions to address these problems and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subjected them to a regulatory analysis which also addresses the requirements for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> backfit analysis under 10 CFR 50.109. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  These actions have been evaluated within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> framework of the Commission's Safety Goal Policy, (51 FR 30028; August 21, 1986) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether or not they would result in a substantial increase in the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection of the public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulatory analysis only addresses the LCO and SR option for controls for specific equipment relied upon during shutdown and low-power operations, whereas the proposed rule allows for incorporation of controls included in technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). The staff plans to revise the regulatory analysis to incorporate consideration of other alternatives as appropriate for equipment controls during shutdown and low-power operations. In addition, the staff will consider the following in the revised regulatory analysis: (1) insights gained from the recent NRC PRAs for shutdown and low-power operations at Surry and Grand Gulf; (2) industry improvements made in outages; (3) comments received from ACRS, CRGR and the Commission; (4) specific industry comments on the draft regulatory analysis documented in a letter from NUMARC dated January 11, 1994, in a letter from NEI dated March 28, 1994 and in a letter from GEOG dated April 8, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has observed that many shutdown operations may take place with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment partially open. Therefore, cost-effective regulatory actions are appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure substantial reduction in core-damage probability, and an improvement in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood of containment isolation, when necessary. These actions would substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the overall protection of public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Operating Experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff reviewed operating experience at nuclear power plants to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that its evaluation encompassed the range of events encountered during shutdown and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-power operations including: licensee event reports (LERs), studies performed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data (AEOD), and various inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports to determine the types of events that take place during refueling, cold and hot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shutdown, and low-power operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff also reviewed events that occurred at foreign nuclear power plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using information found in the foreign events file maintained for AEOD at the Oak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The AEOD compilation included the types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events that applied to U.S. nuclear plants and those not found in a review of U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In performing this review, the NRC staff found that the more significant events  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) were the loss of residual heat removal, potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurization, and boron dilution events. The more important events for boiling-water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactors (BWRs) were the loss of coolant, the loss of cooling, and potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurization. Generally, the majority of important events involved human error and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedural errors. The NRC staff documented this review in NUREG&hyph;1449. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the NRC staff selected 10 events from the AEOD review for further assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as precursors to potential severe core-damage accidents. This assessment is fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented in NUREG&hyph;1449.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

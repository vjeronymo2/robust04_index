			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Mosaic shares fall on profit warning SHARES OF Mosaic Invest-ments, the engineer and character merchandiser, fell sharply from 206p to 120p yesterday following a warning about current year profits, writes John Murrell. The directors said that 1991-1992 profits were likey to be materially affected by a significant downturn in the marketing services division. A trading statement from the directors said the results of the division in January and February had fallen materially below expectations. As a consequence, they expected full year operating profits from marketing services to be 'significantly less' than the Pounds 3.07m reported for 1990-91. Over the first six months of the current year the division's operating profits fell from Pounds 1.52m to Pounds 839,000. Last full year profit was Pounds 7.56m</p>

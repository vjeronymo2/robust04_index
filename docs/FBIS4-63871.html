			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Albert Maloveryan]    [Text] Tallinn, 25 May -- The withdrawal of troops from  Estonia must be carried out on the basis of a treaty, as is  being done in Latvia and Lithuania. Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev stated this today at a news conference on the  results of a ministerial session of the Council of Baltic Sea  States [CBSS].    Russia, he continued, did not send troops to Estonia, but it  cannot leave them to their fate. The situation in former  Yugoslavia shows what could have been the result of such an  action. The responsibility for the troop contingent in the  Baltic countries, which Russia has taken upon herself, also  includes social guarantees for servicemen. "We discussed these  questions with President Lennart Meri and Foreign Minister Juri  Luik," Kozyrev said, "and soon we will have a legal basis for  troop withdrawal." The head of the Russian foreign affairs  department stressed the necessity of settling the problem of  military pensioners. He reminded everyone that on the previous  day he gave Juri Luik a letter from one of the groups of former  servicemen. "We cannot ignore the situation these people are  in," the minister noted.    Juri Luik stated in turn that the Estonian side now has more  ground for hope that the troop issue will be settled. The  withdrawal of the troop contingent and the issue of the military  pensioners are two parallel problems which should not be linked  to each other, but they must be settled, he said.    A question was also put to the Russian minister concerning  the "sharp tone" of the memorandum on the situation of the  Russophone population in Estonia. " We are looking for friendly,  goodneighborly relations with Estonia, and this implies the  settling of issues mentioned in the memorandum," he answered.  Further, touching upon the problem of border disputes, Kozyrev  stated that this subject was not discussed within the framework  of the present CBSS session. He added that if it had, it would  have been like opening "Pandora's box," and once again pointed  to the Yugoslav situation.    The Estonian side, on the other hand, is in favor of  discussing the border issue. Juri Luik said at the news  conference that Tallinn intends to raise this question at the  forthcoming Paris conference on the stability in Europe pact.    Andrey Kozyrev, summing up the whole CBSS ministerial  session, repudiated the claims of those politicians who think  that all problems can be settled immediately. "We are acting on  a stage-by- stage basis and are moving toward our goal," the  Russian minister said. He said that setting up the post of  commissar for human rights and ethnic minorities was one of the  most important decisions of the meeting. In particular, his job  will include seeing that the rights of the Russophone population  in the Baltic countries are observed.</p>

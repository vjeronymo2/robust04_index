			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / East struggles to escape depression HUGE amounts of aid have still not delivered a self-sustaining economic recovery in east Germany, a government report said yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin. 'The economy has still not come out of its depression,' said a study by the DIW and Kiel research institutes, a quarterly review commissioned by the government. The study follows a critical report issued on Wednesday by the Bundesbank which said Germany may have to raise taxes to pay for the spiralling costs of unification. The latest report said it was wrong to rely purely on west German aid and western investment to rescue the east, but noted east German companies could not build up their own investments because of high wage rises. Estimated investments this year of DM12,000 (Pounds 4,195) per job in east Germany were only one third of the amount pledged in west Germany. Nearly 3 1/2 m jobs have been lost in the east since unification in 1990. But the report said that east German industry, suffering from high wages, outmoded products, overmanning and decrepit machinery, was still a long way from becoming competitive.</p>

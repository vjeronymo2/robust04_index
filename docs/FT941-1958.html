			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Observer: Compounding the gloom He couldn't even muster an auf Wiedersehen. Wolfgang Hilger, dour chairman of the Hoechst chemicals group, yesterday growled his way through his last annual press conference in traditionally lugubrious style, only to break with custom at the close. While retiring German bosses are supposed to lighten up, bury the hatchet with the hacks, and even crack the odd joke about having had tough but fair treat-ment, Hilger was not in the mood. Since early last year, when his lofty, technocratic response to his company's plants' alarming tendency to leak, burn and even explode earned Hilger a roasting, the chemistry between him and the media has been severely awry. A formal farewell from the floor, typically offered up on these occasions by a venerable journalist whose career has run in - distant - parallel with the retiring boss, also failed to materialise. If Hilger noticed that the pack restricted itself to a single question about yet another explosion, last Friday, which wrecked a refrigerant plant, and once again obliged the police to tour the streets warning local residents to close their windows and stay indoors, he did not show it. Anyone interested could pick up a press release on the way out, but otherwise he had nothing to add, he said.</p>

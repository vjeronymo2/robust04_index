			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Russians pin hopes on their 'good tsar' AS HE LAUNCHES his fight to win a referendum just two weeks away, President Boris Yeltsin symbolises Russia's tragic dependence throughout the centuries on a 'good tsar' to bring well-being to the people. Three hundred years ago Peter the Great first launched the westernising reforms Mr Yeltsin is trying to carry forward. In post-communist Russia, Mr Yeltsin is widely seen as the guarantor of what little stability there is, as well as the basis for a strong executive needed to push through market reforms. But the 62-year-old leader's performance at the height of the crisis at the last Congress of People's Deputies session, when he appeared dishevelled and mixed up his words, was a reminder of the dangers of the country relying so heavily on one individual, as it has done so often in its history. Ministers watched in embarrassed disbelief, deputies laughed, his arch-rival, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the parliament, smirked, and even impartial foreign observers wondered whether he was ill or inebriated. In the campaign for the referendum that will ask Russians whether they trust him, Mr Yeltsin is telling the people that he is the only available defence against restoration of communist dictatorship. Mr Khasbulatov claimed yesterday that, on the contrary, Mr Yeltsin was trying to build a dictatorship because he had exhausted the legal basis for radical reforms. Launching his own referendum campaign, Mr Khasbulatov called on local councils - the lower levels of legislative power in Russia - to mobilise support against an executive he described as a 'collective Rasputin'. The reference is to Grigory Rasputin, the monk whose influence on Tsar Nicholas II is cited as one of the reasons for the collapse of the monarchy and the 70 years of bolshevism which followed. But despite siding with Mr Yeltsin, many supporters of radical reforms are upset by his confrontational style, saying he has driven the country into a needless all-or-nothing gamble. 'He is supposed to guarantee this (reform) process. I don't want him to put everything on the brink like this,' says Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent economist who has already announced his intention to run for president when Mr Yeltsin steps down. But Mr Yavlinsky, who argues that Mr Yeltsin could have mounted a less dangerous defence against parliament's attempts to cut his powers, draws some comfort from the fact that reformers like himself are preparing for the succession, as it were. 'I want to unite positive forces so that communists and nationalists do not take over.' Another presidential hopeful is said to be Mr Yuri Shafranik, fuel and energy minister and former governor of the oil-producing Tyumen region. For the moment, however, all eyes are focused on Mr Yeltsin, with reformers saying he is their best hope for keeping the country together and pursuing further reforms. Economic reform, meanwhile, has taken a back seat to populist promises to win votes in the referendum. Mr Yeltsin last week decreed a doubling of wages for state employees, and yesterday reversed a doubling of petrol prices which has infuriated motorists.</p>

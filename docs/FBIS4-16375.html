			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Nikolay Geronin and </F> Anatoliy Krasnov]    [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "We cannot allow any state  to violate the nuclear non-proliferation regime," Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said on Thursday.    Speaking about the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsular at  a press briefing after his talks with his visiting South Korean  counterpart Han Sung-chu, Kozyrev said that the demilitarisation  of the peninsular is an uncompromising question for Russia.    He said Russia is seeking to normalise the situation,  promote  security and ensure trust in the region located in proximity to  the Russian borders.    "We have agreed with the foreign minister of South Korea to  maintain contacts on the entire spectrum of problems. No one  rejects Russia's proposal to hold an international conference on  security and nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsular," he  said.    Kozyrev noted that, like in case with NATO air strikes in  Bosnia, the Russian side is not pleased when it is asked to save  the situation or vote for some sanctions or decisions adopted at  some talks without its participation.    Asked about prospects for imposing sanctions on North Korea  over the nuclear problem, the Russian minister stressed "We will  not consider measures which do not follow from our direct and  substantial participation in all stages of the discussion of  respective problems."</p>

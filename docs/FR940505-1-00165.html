			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is still considering the proper standard for remanufactured engines built before the implementation date of the national rule. EPA is considering standards as low as 6.9 g/bhp-hr, approximately the national standard that has been proposed for new nonroad engines above 37 kw. The railroads have requested that EPA also consider a cap on the potential costs of remanufacture to meet lower emissions levels. While EPA is taking their recommendation under advisement, we do not currently intend to promulgate such a requirement. Cost cap provisions create definitional difficulties, and are potentially abused.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is concerned that emission rates, expressed as grams of emissions per brake horsepower hour (g/bhp-hr), of pre-1973 engines may be significantly higher than corresponding rates from newer locomotives. Achieving significant emission reductions from these engines is expected, however, to be challenging and potentially costly. These engines, by the year 2000, will be almost exclusively used by Class 2 and 3 railroads <FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>  or for switching. They will therefore have relatively low usage and emissions rates when expressed as grams per year. Since the benefits from emission control could be low, expressed as an annual mass of emissions, and the costs of control high, the application of controls to these locomotives may prove to be inappropriate. EPA is continuing, however to evaluate the practicality of requiring these locomotives to be remanufactured or possibly requiring that these locomotives be repowered to achieve emission reductions. <FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>  Another solution may be to move these older locomotives out of non-attainment areas. However, there are concerns that any requirement may impose economic burdens on Class 2 and 3 railroads that tend to operate older engines, and which may not be able to absorb the economic burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 82 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Railroads are designated class 1, 2 or 3 railroads based upon their annual revenue. In 1992, the requirement for designation as a class 1 railroad was annual revenue of 251.4 million dollars, the requirement for a class 2 designation was annual revenue from 20.1 to 251.3 million dollars, and railroads with annual revenue of 20.0 million or less were designated as class 3 railroads. These numbers are annually adjusted for inflation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 83 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Repowering is the complete replacement of an existing engine and generator, including the engine block, with a new engine and generator compatible with the new engine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Option I would be applicable nationwide, with emission reduction benefits realized across the nation. EPA would be proposing this option under its Section 213 authority. The requirement would preempt states from regulating both freshly manufactured and remanufactured locomotives or locomotive engines. States could however still regulate operational practices such as idling and speed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Option II: California Only Requirements. The second remanufacturing option would include the same requirements as the first option but would limit the requirements to locomotives operating in California. There would be no remanufacturing requirements for pre-2000 locomotives or post-2000 locomotives after their initial useful life for the rest of the nation. This option would produce approximately the same percent emission reductions for California as would be provided for the entire nation under option I. An enforcement mechanism would be required to ensure that only locomotives remanufactured since the effective date of the program, to the California standards would be permitted in California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing this option by taking the narrowest reading of its authority under Section 213(a)(5). Under this reading, EPA may only regulate brand new engines and the states have authority to regulate in use engines. Therefore, California would have the authority to replace this program with a program it believes is more appropriate. Additionally, other states could choose to develop their own requirements or to adopt requirements designed for California. Each state could promulgate different standards for remanufactured locomotive engines. As described above, the result of such a scenario could be a disruption of interstate commerce and a corresponding shift to trucks and/or increase in transportation costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

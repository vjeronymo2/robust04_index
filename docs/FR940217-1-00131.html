Procedures to handle situations where it is not possible to identify the specific tank from which leakage is occurring must also be provided. Procedures for dealing with suspected hull fractures must be included. These procedures must take into account the effect of corrective actions on hull stress and stability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spills resulting from casualties:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each of the casualties listed in this paragraph must be treated in the plan as a separate section comprised of various checklists or other means which will ensure that the master considers all appropriate factors when addressing the specific casualty.

The plan must contain information on procedures to be followed for ship-to-ship transfer of cargo. Reference may be made in the plan to existing company guides.

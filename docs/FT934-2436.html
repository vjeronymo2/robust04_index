			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: A tribune of the people in HM Treasury for a day Sir, It is a little depressing, even if inevitable, that all those whom you have appointed Minister for a Day have sought to increase the budget and the power of their ministries. Perhaps you should balance each future appointment by offering a column to the day's chief secretary to the treasury. He could set out the case that people should be free to lead their own lives without the interference and tax demands of the ministry. Andrew Currie, 3 Beardsley Way, London W3 7YQ</p>

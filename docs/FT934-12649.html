			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Regulator will oversee running of gas auctions THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday confirmed that it had given Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, responsibility for overseeing the auctions of gas from British Gas stockpiles. The changeover comes after complaints that increasing numbers of speculators were attracted to the auctions, which were intended to stimulate early competition in the market by making British Gas supplies available to the new independent gas companies. The supply of such 'release gas' was intended to be a temporary solution, which would allow the new companies to attract customers while they developed their own offshore gas sources or negotiated long-term contracts from North Sea producers. Ofgas has told the industry that it will introduce checks to ensure that speculators are excluded in future. Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director of Alliance Gas, the joint venture between BP, Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, and Norsk Hydro, yesterday welcomed the change. 'In the last auction more than 100 companies were allocated release gas,' he said, 'but only 30 or so actually made transportation agreements with British Gas.' The importance of the auctions is likely to diminish in future as more gas becomes available to the independents. In addition, a secondary market is emerging and Mr Maroe said it was 'now possible to sell or acquire spot gas'. British Gas said yesterday that it had been expecting the transfer of regulatory responsibilities. The company will meet Ofgas shortly to make arrangements for future sales.</p>

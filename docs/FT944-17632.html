			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Doctors ready to combat local pay Doctors' leaders yesterday started preparing plans for action if the government imposes local pay bargaining on National Health Service hospitals. In a move that takes the medical profession a step closer to all-out confrontation with the government, the British Medical Association decided to convene its sanctions working party to consider action to be taken if ministers introduce the proposed pay changes without agreement. The government intends to start replacing the NHS's centralised pay structure with local performance-related arrangements next year. It faces opposition from unions and professional organisations. Hospital doctors are particularly concerned that they might come under local management pressure to follow financial rather than clinical priorities. Mr James Johnson, a Liverpool surgeon who became chairman of the BMA's central consultants and specialists committee yesterday, said his priority would be to 'carry on the fight against the government's ill-conceived proposals'. The Department of Health has been trying to negotiate BMA agreement on an enabling clause which would open the way to the shift from centralised to local pay bargaining. The BMA is refusing to accept the clause, but ministers have powers to impose it. Mr Johnson said that, if the government decided to do so, it would give rise to a dispute. The decision to convene the sanctions working party was in response to calls for action from consultants who felt 'beleaguered under the government's continuing onslaught on their professional values'. The ultimate sanction available to consultants would be mass withdrawal from the NHS. Some doctors favour setting up consultants' chambers on similar lines to barristers, enabling them to set the terms on which they would provide their services to the NHS. Other consultants fear such a course of action could precipitate the very thing the BMA is most worried about - the break-up of a health service with national standards and conditions. More traditional sanctions would include a decision by consultants to undertake only medical duties, withdrawing from management tasks and other work not directly related to patient care.</p>

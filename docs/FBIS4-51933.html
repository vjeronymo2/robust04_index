			<p>BFN     [Text] The Japanese Government has begun studying a plan  to provide full-fledged official development assistance (ODA) to  the Republic of South Africa now that the first general election  has been held in the country with people of all races  participating. The government will begin concrete consultations  following the inauguration of the new administration.    Because the South African Government used to practice a  policy of apartheid, Japan's ODA has been limited to small  amounts of aid provided in grants to private organizations which  were engaged in activities in South Africa's black society.  However, the new administration will be established following  the general election in which people of all races participated.  In response, the government has decided to positively promote  ODA to South Africa. According to a senior Foreign Ministry  official, the government has concluded that Japan "needs to  highly evaluate the process for democratization in that country  and support their efforts."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City -- Presidential candidates, legislators  from the various political parties, and political leaders  yesterday expressed annoyance over what they considered U.S.  meddling in Mexico's problems. This is because democratization  and respect for human rights in Mexico appear to comprise a  primary concern in the 1995 U.S. defense budget.    Labor Party presidential candidate Cecilia Soto said  yesterday that the Pentagon's explicit concern for Mexico's  democratization and respect for human rights, as outlined in its  1995 budget, represents an erroneous position.    She said: "It is a completely erroneous position. If any  country has shown the world it has violated human rights, it is  the United States. Rodney King's case and frequent abuses  incurred by Mexican illegal aliens are clear examples of this."  She also stressed that human rights violations in Mexico do not  pose a security threat to the United States.    Mexican Green Party candidate Jorge Gonzalez Torres said the  Pentagon's budget blueprint could be a prelude or a  justification for military intervention. He said: "The fact  that they are discussing Mexico's lack of democracy might  indicate that they are preparing a military intervention."    Gonzalez Torres also said the document serves as a means of  softening public opinion for possible intervention in the event  that Mexico becomes increasingly unstable. He added, however,  that the Pentagon cannot legitimately give an opinion on these  issues because the Pentagon is strictly a military organization  that has a history of interventionism.    Gonzalez Torres described the fact that Mexican soldiers are  training in the United States as "suspicious," because a corps  could be trained for a possible "coup d'etat." He said, "They  could be preparing an Army corps for a possible coup d'etat -- a  corps that could seize control." He added that the U.S.  position fails to take into account the Mexican people's needs  and the abject poverty being experienced in the countryside.    Popular Socialist Party presidential candidate Marcela  Lombardo Otero said yesterday that the Pentagon's training of  Mexican troops is a threat to the country's sovereignty and  harms the Mexican Army's patriotic, nationalistic, and popular  ideology.    Lombardo Otero contended the Pentagon is giving military  advice because the U.S. Government wants to meddle in Mexico's  internal affairs through any means possible. Moreover, she  said, this kind of interaction distorts the perception that the  Army is serving as a patriotic and nationalistic entity that  traditionally has maintained a great sense of obligation to the  community.    "This presents tremendous danger to Mexico, particularly  because this nationalistic and popular Army that we have is in  charge of national security," she said.    Meanwhile, Hector Delgado, speaking on behalf of the  Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, said it is  all right for the Mexican Army to be trained by the Pentagon,  provided that this training does not undermine the country's  sovereignty.    "It is good that Army troops train in other places to  acquire  greater skills and learn different things," he said. "There are  Mexicans who are in training programs sponsored by the  Inter-American Development Bank and GATT, and, therefore, it is  not bad for people to train," Delgado said.    He said that despite the benefits of having the Army train  in  the United States, precise limits and restrictions should be  established on this kind of training to prevent Mexican  soldiers' integrity or national sovereignty from being  undermined.    PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], PAN [National  Action  Party], and PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] deputies  all have described the Pentagon's position as meddlesome.</p>

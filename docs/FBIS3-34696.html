			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan has not been officially informed of  the Yemeni mediation committee's decision to sign the  reconciliation agreement between former South and North Yemen in  Amman of Feb. 20, official sources said Saturday [12 February].    But Minister of Information Jawad al-'Anani said Jordan  would  welcome a decision to sign the accord in Amman "if our brothers  in Yemen have decided so."    The sources said, however, that Jordan would not sponsor the  signing of the reconciliation accord unless it is clear that the  agreement would succeed in ending the conflict between Yemeni  President 'Ali Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid.    News agencies Friday quoted the spokesman of the Yemeni  dialogue committee, Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, as saying that the  committee had agreed "with our Jordanian brethren" to have the  accord signed in Amman on Feb. 20.    Agence France-Presse quoted a Yemeni official it did not  name  as saying that leaders of the three parties in the governing  coalition would attend the signing ceremony to which Palestinian  leader Yasir 'Arafat would be invited.    An official source did not specifically say whether Mr.  'Arafat would attend the signing ceremony if it takes place in  Amman. But this source said that Sultan Qabus of Oman, who  mediated between the Yemeni parties, would be invited.    Diplomatic sources in Amman said that Yemeni parties are  divided on which Arab leaders should be invited to the signing  ceremony, adding that some prefer that only Yemeni officials  attend it.    The sources refused to give any details about arrangements  for signing the accord, which was reached on Jan. 18.    Sources said that some Arab parties are not happy with plans  for having the reconciliation agreement signed in Jordan, which  played a major role in mediation efforts between Mr. Salih and  Mr. al-Bid. "This could be one major reason why the plans are  not materialising as soon as we would like," one source said.    His Majesty King Husayn said last week that Jordan was very  concerned with the situation in Yemen and "would do everything  possible" to help solve the conflict, which threatended the  merger of the formerly socialist South and conservative North.    The agreement was supposed to be signed in Amman early this  month but the date was scuttled after new differences emerged  between Mr. Salih and Mr. al-Bid.    The Yemeni crisis developed when Mr. al-Bid left the Yemeni  capital Sanaa for South Yemen's capital Aden on Aug 19 where he  remains until now. The crisis resulted from differences of  opinion on the pace of the union as well as economic and social  reform.    In elections held last April, Mr. Salih's General People's  Congress (GPC) and Mr. al-Bid's Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP)  emerged as the two dominant parties and agreed to form a  coalition government headed by Mr. Salih as president and Mr.  al-Bid as vice- president. The Islamic al-Islah [Islamic  Reform] party was later invited to the coalition.    But political differences emerged thereafter, with Mr.  al-Bid  accusing Mr. Salih and his GPC of trying to dominate the country  and running an elimination campaign against southern leaders.    The reconciliation accord drawn up last week envisages  political and economic reforms demanded by Mr. al-Bid and  accepted by Mr. Salih.</p>

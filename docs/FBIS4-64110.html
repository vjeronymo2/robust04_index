			<p>BFN     [Text] Thursday morning a group of Russian officers led by  the Deputy Commander of Russia's ground troops, Lt.-General  Aleksandr Sokolov, flew to Abkhazia to define the points where  peacekeeping forces will be deployed. INTERFAX learned this  from military sources in Moscow.    Sokolov is in charge of deploying disengagement forces in  the  Abkhaz conflict area. Abkhazia's Defence Minister, Sultan  Sosnaliev, who had taken part in the talks on a mechanism and  localities of deploying peacekeepers along with his Georgian  counterpart, Varden Nadibaidze, in Moscow, was on the same plane.    As INTERFAX learned earlier from a participant in the talks,  the CIS peace-keeping forces, predominantly Russian, are to be  stationed in the Abkhaz conflict area between the 10th and the  15th of June. Under agreements reached on May 14th they'll be  stationed in the "safety area" to be established on the River  Inguri when the Georgian and Abkhaz troops are withdrawn 12  kilometers away from the river. The disengagement forces are to  number 2500 to 3000 men.</p>

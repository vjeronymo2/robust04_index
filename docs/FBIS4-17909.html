			<p>BFN     [Text] During his talks with the leadership of Kazakhstan  the Premier of the Chinese State Council Li Peng thanked  President Nursultan Nazarbayev for a balanced and realistic  approach to all aspects of bilateral relations. This was  disclosed at a Tuesday briefing in Alma-Ata [Almaty] by a  spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.    He said Nazarbayev is not letting Eastern Turkestan, an  organization of separatists from several Central Asian countries  claiming territories in North China, to engage in subversive  activities against China from Kazakhstan. The Kazakh leader  also views Taiwan as an inseparable part of China.    The spokesman said that the calls made at a Tuesday rally in  Alma-Ata organized by the Nevada-Semipalatinsk movement and  Eastern Turkestan to stop nuclear tests at Lobnor test ground  are senseless because no nuclear tests are conducted there.    The official said Li Peng invited Nazarbayev to visit China  at a time suitable for him for the final settlement of remaining  border problems.</p>

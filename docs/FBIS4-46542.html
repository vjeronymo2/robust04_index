			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA corresondent Ivan Ivanyuk: </F> "Military Posts Are Going `Into Retirment.' Do They Really Face  Destruction or Neglect?"]    [Text] "Live at home, and your  home will not collapse." These words of the poet about something  simple and vital painfully affecting everyone who has seen the  senseless destruction are, unfortunately, valid not just for  wars and conflicts. When the Russian Army went into action and  began abandoning the familiar garrisons abroad, and all of us  sighed as we calculated the property losses, it could not have  occurred to anyone that we would squander far more in our own  fatherland. And when, with the reduction of the Armed Forces in  Russia, military posts began to be vacated, it turned out that  there was actually no one in charge of them....    "A military unit was deployed in Krasnoglinskiy Rayon in the  city of Samara," V. Ageychenko, chairman of the rayon committee  of the Alliance for the Social Protection of Pensioners, wrote  to the editors. "It occupied two 100-apartment buildings, a  messhall and other premises. The unit left in the spring of  1993, however. The buildings stand there without windows, floors  or doors and continue to deteriorate. We went everywhere: to the  police, the procurator's office, the city administration....  There is no one to be found to look after the post. No one is  doing anything; everyone is blaming everyone else....    Unfortunately, such letters are not isolated entities in our  mail. Even though alarm signals are coming in from various areas  of the nation, from the Transbaykal to the Moscow region, they  do not provide a complete picture of the scale of what is  happening. The list of military posts vacated in 1993-1994  within the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense is extremely  vast. It was compiled by Russia's State Committee for Property  and the Central Directorate of Material Resources of the Russian  Federation's Ministry of Defense in October of last year and  includes 312 posts. This means hundreds of apartment buildings,  clubs, barracks, messhalls, storage facilities, garages, parking  lots and filling stations--property with a value of billions of  rubles. And the number of posts whose fate has been decided can  be counted on the fingers of one hand.    Why has this happened? Is there actually no one who would  like to acquire all of this property? Or is the possibility of  rectifying the financial affairs of the Ministry of Defense,  which, quite frankly, did not receive very much in the  privatization process, not obvious? There are more than enough  good intentions, but the hitch lies in the fact that all of the  ukases, decrees and directives issued up to this point have not  provided a precisely defined system for utilizing or selling the  military's real property. The military posts are federal  property, and the Ministry of Defense must coordinate their sale  with the State Committee for Property. According to Russia's  Land Code, however, the land on which they are located belongs  to local government agencies. And the latter say that if you  want to sell your buildings, dismantle them and take them  wherever you see fit.    While such debate is going on, "popular privatization" is  underway on the sly. The people are starting to remove  everything they can. They ask why the property should go to  waste, all the more since there is no one to guard it. This is a  slight exaggeration, but the fact remains that missiles have  been dismantled and local aficionados have gradually not just  removed refrigeration and other equipment of any value but have  used tolite to blow up things which could not be dismantled....    A more detailed inventory of vacated military posts was  recently conducted in the Ministry of Defense. They were all  broken down into groups, to each of which a special approach  will be taken. The most "prestigious" are the posts which it is  planned to auction off. Those which cannot be sold will be  transferred to the pool of local authorities or written off  entirely as an expense.    Instructions for selling the posts and some initial  experience already exist. There is just no confidence that the  Ministry of Defense will earn a great deal. Even the state in  general has not become any richer from this area of revenue.  Furthermore, anyone attracted to the military property must  provide firm guarantees, and these are presently stuck in a  vicious circle of the State Committee for Property, the Ministry  of Defense and local authorities.    Many specialists agree that the only rational route, given  the present legal regulation of the land issue, is to lease out  the military posts. And it would be the fair thing to give  priority as lessees to reserve officers, whose privatization  interests have not yet been taken fully into account.    The military posts could be turned into enterprises where  reserve officers and their wives could work. Their retraining  could be organized directly for the kind of production engaged  in by the enterprise. The leased facilities and land would  remain within the Ministry of Defense and provide profits for  solving the social problems of military personnel.    One specific project for deciding the future of the military  posts in this way has been worked out by the Independent Trade  Union of Military Personnel and submitted to the government. It  calls for setting up an auction association, one of whose  founders would be the Ministry of Defense. The plan is meeting  with support from commercial structures. Specifically,  Tveruniversalbank is prepared to finance it. The Russian  Business Center for Reserve Servicemen set up under the  Independent Trade Union of Military Personnel is already working  out the technical feasibility for building motor-vehicle service  centers out of two large garrisons on the Moscow-St. Petersburg  and Moscow-Smolensk routes. It is planned to locate a Moscow  area center near Golitsyno-2, one of the main basing sites for  military space personnel, which already has some experience in  the retraining and job placement of reserve officers.    There are other options as well: for example, selling the  posts together with the land. In any case drastic steps must be  taken so that the inheritance of the armed forces, created by  the labor of more than just a single generation, is not thrown  to the wind or sold for next to nothing to those who are totally  unconcerned about the military problems or the fate of the  former servicemen.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Photo processing restrains LIG LONDON INTERNATIONAL Group, the condoms, health and beauty products and photo-processing group, reported a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 15.5m for its half year to September 30. However, the previous year's figure was depressed by an exceptional charge of Pounds 13.4m, restated from an extraordinary debit. gained 1p to 235p. Profits were depressed by a sharp fall in the photo-processing side, though Mr Alan Woltz, chairman, said: 'I am pleased with the performance on our health and personal products divisions, which continue to demonstrate the fundamental strength of our brands in a recession.' He added that LIG saw no sign of an end to the recession and was planning accordingly. He also announced that Mr David Harbut, finance director, would retire at the financial year end of March 31 1993. A search for a successor was under way. Group turnover rose from Pounds 190m to Pounds 194.8m. Operating profits were down 11 per cent to Pounds 22.4m. Net interest charges of Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 4.6m) reflected higher borrowings. Net debt was Pounds 134.1m at September 30, up from Pounds 94.8m a year earlier and Pounds 107m at March 31. The group aims to reduce debt to the March level again by the year end although exchange rate movements were adverse. Earnings per share came out at 6.37p, against 8.27p before exceptionals or 2.64p afterwards. The interim dividend is unchanged at 3.2p. Health and personal products increased operating profits from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 16.1m, on sales up slightly at Pounds 120.9m (Pounds 119.1m), showing further margin growth. Good results came from condoms, surgical and industrial gloves as well as products such as Buttercup cough syrups. Photo-processing profits fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 6.3m as falling volumes reduced the efficiency of the plants and competitors cut prices in an attempt to keep market share. Another three plants are to close, costing 200 jobs and a second half exceptional charge of Pounds 2m. COMMENT The LIG story is beginning to be told and understood. Continual cost cutting in photo-processing is getting the break-even rate down to a level where an eventual recovery in volume should yield bumper profits. But in the short term, last year's second-half loss of Pounds 5.6m in that division could be repeated this time, unless there is a white Christmas, which would get people snapping. Meanwhile, the other side of the business is doing well despite the recession. Imaginative marketing on brands is having a good effect on margins. A repeat of last year's Pounds 39.4m pre-exceptionals, would give a p/e under 15. The shares have little downside, and should begin to perform when signs of economic recovery appear.</p>

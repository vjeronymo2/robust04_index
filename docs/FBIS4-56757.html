			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 7 May (PL) -- Today, the Cuban Government  acclaimed the National African Congress' [ANC] electoral victory  in South Africa and said the end of apartheid constitutes a  landmark in the struggle against imperialism, racism, and  colonial domination.    In an official statement, the Cuban Government stated the  election results end an arduous process of negotiations between  South Africa's leading political forces, a process that will  pave the way to racial equality, freedom, and justice for the  South African people.    The statement also said the end of apartheid befits the  process of profound transformations that took place in the  African South Cone following the battle of Cuito Cuanavale in  Angola, which effected a change in the correlation of forces in  that region of the world.    In the same document, Cuba also stated it is willing to  establish diplomatic relations with South Africa, to which Cuba  offered cooperation and support in the new stage of  reconstruction and consolidation of national unity.    The Cuban people, the note added, have made the South  African  people's cause their own and, together with all progressive  forces, bids the new government success in the complex and lofty  tasks that lie ahead.</p>

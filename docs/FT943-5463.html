			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Renault The prospects for Renault's privatisation are not as bright as they were even a week ago. Not only were yesterday's half-year results disappointing. Comments by Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, that the state will retain a majority stake in the motor group will also take the shine off the sale. Renault was able to boast a 125 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. But this was flattered by a large capital gain on the sale of part of its stake in erstwhile partner Volvo. Operating profit actually fell 11 per cent. And revenue in the car division was flat, despite 15 per cent growth in unit sales. There were special factors in the half year - notably government incentives which encouraged consumers to buy cheap cars, so pulling down the average price per vehicle sold. But the uninspiring results will spoil the marketing campaign for a share sale since the main bull point was supposed to be that Renault was in the midst of a strong cyclical upswing. Meanwhile, international investors will be worried about government plans to keep a controlling stake. Mr Balladur's remarks may be necessary to head off union opposition to privatisation. But they will fuel fears that wider political concerns could take priority over Renault's commercial interests. None of this means the motor group cannot be sold. Renault still looks a more attractive candidate than AGF, the insurance group. But the government will now have to settle on a lower price.</p>

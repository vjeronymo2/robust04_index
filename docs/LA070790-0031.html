			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MINING IN NATIONAL FOREST  </P> <P> I read your May 22 article about the request of P. W. Gillibrand Co. for a  grant for a demonstration project to mine titanium in the national forest. I  have also viewed a videotape prepared for the Gillibrand Co., and have lived  for 27 years on property immediately adjoining the Gillibrand claims.  </P> <P> In some ways, the company has been a good neighbor. Their road provides a  firebreak and a possible emergency exit from our canyon. The huge excavations  they have made in Oak Spring Canyon and Rabbit Canyon will provide catch basins  which may alleviate some of our flooding problems. When the building of their  road resulted in tremendous debris deposits in our driveway during the last  flood, Gillibrand arranged to have it removed.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the public has lost two beautiful oak-filled canyons.  Because of the deep excavations, it is not safe, or perhaps even possible, to  ascend the canyons up to their springs and waterfalls. I have still seen deer  in the area, but apparently our mountain lions have been displaced.  </P> <P> I have several concerns about having taxpayer money being used to finance  Gillibrand's further mining:  </P> <P> Why should the public help finance a mining-quarrying operation on public  lands?  </P> <P> If Gillibrand is so short of cash, how can he afford to pay his workers $35 an  hour?  </P> <P> If titanium is such a valuable commodity, why is the ilmenite selling for only  $70 a ton?  </P> <P> If titanium is so necessary for this country's industry and defense, and this  country is so dependent on foreign sources, why is Gillibrand selling it to  Finland?  </P> <P> Is it possible the mining of titanium is only incidental to Gillibrand's real  usage of the national forest -- a rock quarry?  </P> <P> RUTH KELLEY  </P> <P> Canyon Country  </P></p>

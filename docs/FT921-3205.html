			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Nigeria criticised by World Bank: 'Inconsistencies' in government accounts reinforce concern over corruption NIGERIA'S economic management 'lacks transparency and accountability', according to an unpublished World Bank report which is likely to reinforce concern about official corruption and set back the country's prospects for rescheduling external debts of Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.5bn). The report, Public Expenditure Management, is based on a review conducted early in 1991. It is under discussion with the military government of President Ibrahim Babangida, who seized power in a palace coup in 1986. It shows that the bank suspected the authorities of under-reporting oil earnings in 1990, when prices were boosted by the Gulf war. The report says the receipts were some Dollars 2bn higher than the bank had forecast. However, says the report, 'attempts to account for the proceeds from oil production in 1990 produced a shortfall of foreign exchange inflows reflected in the official central bank cashflow of around Dollars 2.1bn, of which only Dollars 0.6bn can be explained by the two continuing dedication accounts' - special accounts for project and other expenditures. A World Bank official would not say last week whether this and other 'inconsistencies' in government accounts had been resolved. Provisions for external debt servicing might account for the discrepancy, but the bank should have been informed of receipts set aside for that purpose. The official described the report as an 'internal document' and would not discuss it further. The government has not responded to a request for comment. In June, it maintained that all earnings could be accounted for, partly through debt-service payments. It also deported the Financial Times Lagos correspondent following his reports on the size and allocation of the windfall. Diplomats in Lagos said last week that full and accurate details of government accounts had yet to emerge. Pressure to spend the 1990 windfall led to a 'breakdown in fiscal and monetary discipline', the report says. It calculates that government spending 'outside the normal accounting and budgetary mechanism' in 1989 and 1990 exceeded the 1990 budget, excluding debt-servicing. The calculation assumes that the 'inconsistencies' detected represent actual expenditure. The report expresses concern about 'large scale' spending of oil revenue 'outside the purview of statutory controls'. It also criticises several government-backed projects, including a controversial aluminium plant. In a barely veiled reference to corruption, the report highlights 'a lack of transparency and accountability of big spending decisions and the exclusion of many items of capital expenditure from any rigorous project screening.' The report goes on: 'Public expenditures are used more to distribute oil riches and generate lucrative business and employment opportunities for selected groups than to ensure efficient delivery of goods and services to the public at large.' The damage to the government's reputation as a result of the report may be partly offset by this month's decision to float the naira, accompanied by a renewed commitment to the 1986 reform programme. The devaluation answers the report's concern that the now abolished multi-tier exchange system was open to corruption. Nigeria survey, Section III</p>

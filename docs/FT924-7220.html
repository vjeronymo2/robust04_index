			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Wacoal tumbles despite sales rise WACOAL, a Japanese underwear maker, yesterday reported a sharp fall in profits despite a rise in sales, due to lower margins and the cost of redeeming warrant bonds. Taxable profits fell 13.5 per cent to Y6.3bn (Dollars 50.8m) on a 4.3 per cent rise in sales to Y66.2bn. Net profits fell 9.3 per cent to Y3bn.

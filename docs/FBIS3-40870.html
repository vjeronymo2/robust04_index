This is the most sacred issue in the  realities of Indonesian politics. It not only triggers  controversy, but produces long discourses and polemics, as well.  It is also a question that always intrudes into the territory of  other issues and often generates a separate controversy.    One of the controversies involves the "difference in  opinion"  between two young leaders who come from the same "home":  Muhammadiyah. The recommendations of Amien Rais regarding  criteria for national leadership in 1998--which reportedly point  to B.J. Habibie--were directly countered by Din Syamsuddin's  "political prayer" for Try Sutrisno. What is actually happening?    There are a number of analyses, such as the one by Marzuki  Darusman. This political observer, who is also a lecturer at the  University of Indonesia, frankly calls the phenomenon a  "reflection of the internal struggle in the Muhammadiyah  organization." That is not all. From a broader perspective,  Marzuki in fact sees this phenomenon as a "symbiosis" involving  Muhammadiyah leaders who are members of the ICMI [Indonesian  Muslim Intellectuals Association]. "What Amien Rais asserted is  clearly an expression of ICMI voices in Muhammadiyah," he said,  summing up.    It is an attractive political step. Therefore, there is  another matter, apart from the "difference of opinion," that  should be examined in connection with the spread of this  succession issue. "This is proof that Muhammadiyah has been able  to produce new players for the political arena," Marzuki  declared. By "nominating" Habibie, according to Marzuki, Amien  Rais's position in Muhammadiyah is certain to be more dominant.  Moreover, "It is hard to believe that Muhammadiyah does not  understand the political implications of the step it has taken."  What does this mean?    Within Muhammadiyah itself, he said, a struggle is going on.  By nominating Habibie, Amien's position in Muhammadiyah is  certain to be more dominant, especially with respect to  relations between Muhammadiyah and the ICMI. Regardless,  Muhammadiyah, one of the largest Islamic organizations, is  increasingly presenting itself as a political force that needs  to be reckoned with in the Islamic political constellation in  Indonesia.    Indications of this began to appear when the ICMI was  founded  in December 1990. Prominent Muhammadiyah figures--besides people  from HMI [Islamic College Students Association] and other  Islamic mass organizations--became ICMI's "backbone" among  nonbureaucrats. The occurrence of the Muhammadiyah Congress in  the same month and year further emphasized this phenomenon.  Through its congress, Muhammadiyah was successful in  regenerating leadership, from older people to younger ones.    From the younger circles--especially intellectuals--emerged  the names of Amien Rais, Watiek Pratiknya, Ahmad Syafii Ma'arif,  and several other prominent young people. In fact, Din  Syamsuddin, a young Muhammadiyah personage, also in the end  became a member of the GOLKAR [Functional Group] DPP [Central  Executive Council] as a result of the creation of the  Harmoko-Habibie "duet" at the recent national conference.    Meanwhile, NU [Muslim Scholars League] figures are truly  acting outside the fence. Young NU personage Slamet Efendi  Yusuf, DPR [Parliament] member from the F-KP [GOLKAR Faction],  who previously was a member of the GOLKAR DPP under Wahono's  leadership, has been active outside the fence. Also, NU people  in the ICMI did not demonstrate any significant role. "They  merely went with the flow of the existing ICMI mainstream."    Therefore, when succession does occur, for example, many  people predict that NU masses as a political potential will turn  to ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] as the strategic group.  Reflections of that appear in the closeness between NU Muslim  scholars and Vice President Try Sutrisno. According to Taufik  Abdullah, one of Indonesia's foremost historians, the NU has  been going through a very disturbing process of transition since  1984, when it returned to the 1926 Policy.    After leaving the political world, the NU began to look  inward: It turned out that the NU has only Muslim scholars and  Islamic boarding schools. "What are NU's assets compared to  those of Muhammadiyah? There are none. Therefore, this process  of transition within the NU can be very painful," said Taufik  Abdullah. Previously, while the NU was still political, Muslim  scholars could say, "Let us choose politics...." Now, there is  no alternative to improving whatever there is on the inside,  while confronting extraordinary political temptations from the  outside.    According to Prof. Mitsuo Nakamura, author of the book  The Crescent Rises Over the Banyan Tree: A Study of the  Muhammadiyah Movement in a Central Javanese Town (Cornell  University, Ithaca, 1976), as of 1992 there were no signs that  Muhammadiyah was experiencing any change in the orientation of  its religious struggle.    Moreover, despite the existence of desires to participate  more actively in the political process, it is unlikely that  Muhammadiyah will take part as a political organization, he  said. Nevertheless, he said, it attracted considerable attention  when at its conference in Surabaya it touched on the issue of  criteria for national succession. "Perhaps this is one form of  contribution to Indonesia, which is now seeking a formula for  openness and democratization. Naturally, this needs to be  observed further," he said.    Changes in Indonesian political life, including the fact  that  a Muhammadiyah personage mentions the matter of  succession--while Pak Harto [President Suharto] has not been  president for even a year--shows the reality that Indonesia has  entered a new phase, one that has never occurred before. From  the international point of view, Nakamura said, this change will  improve Indonesia's image. Indonesia is a Southern nation on  which many hopes are pinned. It also is a market that should be  reckoned with. Thus, he said, Indonesia's legitimacy and  prestige as a democratic country are on the increase.    As for differences within Muhammadiyah regarding succession,  he stressed that they are merely natural. In fact, open debate,  for example, should be appreciated. It is true that, as Taufik  Abdullah said, Muhammadiyah is accustomed to differences of  opinion before decisions are made. Besides, its involvement in  politics has not been by the organization, but by people in it.  Differences of opinion may exist also because Muhammadiyah has  never had a central figure like the general chairman of the NU.  This apparently is what makes the difference between  Muhammadiyah and the NU.    Whatever the case, said Arbi Sanit, the Islamic community  will never be united as a political force. Because the Islamic  community is a large but diffuse force, the force will be  dispersed everywhere when succession occurs.</p>

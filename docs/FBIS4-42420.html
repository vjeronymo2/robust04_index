			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by unattributed </F> correspondent; place and date not given: "The Chances According  to the Chancellor"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [KNACK] As is the case  elsewhere, there is a chance that voters will come out against  the government and reject membership in the European Union (EU).    [Vranitzky] Some people will turn against the government in  the referendum. However, I do not expect their number to be  very large. Should the Austrians reject Europe, we will not  interpret their "no" vote as a motion of no confidence in the  coalition.    [KNACK] Your coalition partner has a large number of voters  in regions that are against EU membership. You encountered  difficulties in keeping the OeVP [Austrian People's Party] on  the European path.    [Vranitzky] Not in principle. Ever since the Social  Democrats embarked on EU membership with the People's Party,  our partner has always been in favor of accession. The OeVP  proved more hesitant, and was more restrained in its pro-Europe  statements. It did not recommend accession that fervently in  public. Our "yes" sounded more solid, which will not, I hope,  prevent things from running as we intended.    [KNACK] The result of the popular referendum will influence  the upcoming general elections.    [Vranitzky] It is probably too soon to make a statement  about  that. I am not afraid of any link being made between the  referendum and the general election. However, for the time  being I assume that both events are not linked together.    [KNACK] Why do you want to see Austria join the EU at all  costs?    [Vranitzky] There are many reasons for this. Three of them  form the basis of my personal conviction. First, there is  currently a contest under way between continents. And Austria  must strengthen Europe in that contest. Second, we cannot solve  a number of issues, such as environmental and transportation  problems, by ourselves. Issues of transnational importance are  best solved within a larger, European connection. Third, a  country that is in the middle of the continent cannot remain a  spectator on the sidelines. Austria is European historically,  culturally, and also in terms of popular mentality. We must  regard our membership as participation in one of the largest  projects for decades. Only by adopting a common position will  we be able to resolve the major issues. So we are not willing  to form small alliances, like a German-speaking bloc. This is  with a view to combating specific temptations.    [KNACK] Who is that statement aimed at?    [Vranitzky] At anyone who harbors doubts about our openness.  Despite the agreements regarding language and culture concluded  with Germany, we also enjoy equally good relations with a number  of other countries. We are talking about so-called industrial  nations. Admittedly, worldwide industrialization is making it  increasingly difficult to justify that kind of terminology.  Since the first oil crisis in the early 1970's, the number of  jobs in industry has been on the decline. It is not enough to  have forecasts made, then sit back and wait for the predictions  to come true. We must work on the future of Europe together.    [KNACK] Farmers and environmentalists have an almost  instinctive distrust of Europe. Many other people in your  country fear that standards will decline, both socially, from  the point of view of consumers, and as regards democracy.    [Vranitzky] Businessmen are now convincing company employees  that the quality of Austrian life will not decline. As in other  countries there is criticism of decisionmaking in the EU.  Understandably so. The citizens of West Europe are used to a  democratic game being played in their country, one in which they  feel more closely involved than in the mechanism of the EU.  They can scarcely accept less democracy. In order to prevent  that, the European Parliament will, in the long term, have to  play the role of legislator more emphatically.    [KNACK] You came to Brussels to talk with European  Commission  (EC) President Jacques Delors, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc  Dehaene, and Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes.    [Vranitzky] One of the topics that cropped up was the  construction of a railroad line linking Munich and Verona. That  line would run through western Austria, so as to alleviate a  number of problems associated with road transport (via the  Brenner Pass). The railroad line will feature on the agenda of  the European summit to be held in Corfu at the end of June  (making it a referendum trump card against resistance from  anti-Europeans in the Tirol).    [KNACK] Did you also come to lend your support to Dehaene as  a candidate for the post of EC president?    [Vranitzky] I have no comment on that. As is the case with  the questions concerning the qualified majority with which  Europe will make important decisions in the future. It is not  good to send too many signals out into the world on subjects  such as that, or to voice my own personal opinion. Austria is  not eavesdropping. The referendum must be held on the basis of  the issue in question. The debate must not be allowed to  founder over some statement made in connection with a partial  aspect.    [KNACK] Are you more in favor of deepening or enlarging the  EU?    [Vranitzky] Equally in favor of both. European integration  requires both intensification of its contents and a broadening  of its framework. In my view, the prime aim must be to deepen  its contents.    [KNACK] Will the constitutionally neutral Austria remain  outside the WEU [Western European Union], Europe's defense  community?    [Vranitzky] It is not out of the question that Austria will  join the WEU in the capacity of an observer. However, we are in  no hurry to do so. Incidentally, a large number of questions  regarding defense remain to be settled between today's 12 member  states and the WEU.    [KNACK] In Italy, the government now includes some  neofascists. How do you deal with that fact?    [Vranitzky] I would have preferred it if our neighbor's  government had not included any neofascists. However, I respect  the choice of the Italian people. We will try and enjoy equally  good relations with the new government as we did with previous  governments in Rome. We must allow ourselves to be guided by  what emerges from our working relations, not by prejudices.</p>

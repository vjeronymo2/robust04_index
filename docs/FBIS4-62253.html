			<p>BFN     [Text] Creation of the standing legislative Commission for  Military Issues, Security, and Protection of Servicemen's Rights  became a sensation at yesterday's session of the Crimean Supreme  Soviet. A report delivered by Mykhaylo Kukushkin, head of the  commission and commander of the Black Sea Fleet Air Force  Administration, shows that the commission will be seeking  substantial powers. In his words, the deputies should watch the  movements of all troops on Crimean territory. All military  exercises in the Crimea and visits by military ships to local  ports can only be conducted when permitted by the Crimean  president. The new commission intends to assume control over  the activities of the Crimean Security Service.</p>

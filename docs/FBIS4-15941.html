			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- "We are passing over from  voucher privatization to the financial and investment one,"  chairman of the Russian State Committee for Property and Russian  Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays told parliamentary hearings "on  results of privatization and control over state property in the  Russian Federation" at the state Duma here today.    In the words of Chubays, the main thing about the new stage  of privatization is the upcoming reconstruction of joint stock  enterprises. Their reconstruction is impossible without  considerable investments in the Russian economy, said Chubays.  That is why, the fact "millions of U.S. dollars and billions of  rubles have been invested in privatized enterprises to ensure  their high-efficiency and stability" was the most important  result of the voucher privatization.    He said the committee is creating a net work of special  funds  to ensure investment support of privatized enterprises. Another  result of voucher privatization is privatization of 70 per cent  of small ventures. He said this process will be completed by  fall 1994. At the same time, 15,000 out of the 19,000 large and  medium enterprises have been turned into joint stock societies,  which means "large privatization" has begun.    In the opinion of Chubays, "privatization vouchers created a  single property space in Russia," and voucher auctions have  proved their efficiency. Some 650 voucher investment funds are  working in Russia, they are absolutely necessary element of the  financial market and efficient market economy, said Chubays. In  his opinion, the funds will make the core of the non-state  system of investments in the Russian economy.    At the same time, privatization has its costs. Speaking of  crimes related to privatization, Chubays said his committee has  "established close contacts with the federal  counter-intelligence service" and this cooperation has brought  results.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (2): First signs of recovery for Japanese suppliers - After a slump in orders in every sector of the industry, brighter indicators have begun to appear THE JAPANESE machine tool industry, the world's largest, has entered a precipitous slump since production and orders peaked at record levels near the end of 1990. The industry, which produces over a fifth of all machine tools, was hit by the Japanese economic slowdown earlier than most, and 1991 orders dropped 19 per cent. Declines spiralled rapidly toward year's end, with orders for the final three months toppling 35 per cent, including a 38 per cent plunge in domestic orders to Y159.3 bn. The Japanese industry is no more immune to 'boom and bust' cycles than machine tool makers elsewhere, but the current trough appears especially deep in the wake of the all-time high tide that preceded it. In the three years to 1990, production and orders consistently grew at double-digit rates and the Japanese industry emerged as the world's pre-eminent machine tool maker. Its output the final year was valued at about Dollars 10.8 bn - 20 per cent higher than Germany's. However, the now over one-year-old recession has deepened in early 1992, with first-quarter orders were down an estimated 39 per cent to around Y200 bn - 'often, even in bad years, there are some strong sectors in the industry, but this time they're all bad,' says an official at the Japan Machine Tool Builders' Association (JMTBA). The auto industry, which accounted for 21 per cent of 1990 demand, has been among the most aggressive in cutting orders. Ironically, the first bright news appeared in February. Although orders were down 40.3 per cent from one year earlier, they rose 3 per cent from January to mark the first month-on-month increase since the previous May. With the US economy beginning to stir and Japan's own growth rate expected to begin recovering, the rebound is likely to build up steam later in the year, according to industry sources - 'at the beginning of this year, it was hard to say how far orders would fall, but they've been up a bit since January and it now looks like they will be increasing slowly (month-on-month), though not sharply,' says the JMTBA official. He points to three catalysts for a machine tool industry rebound: the government's so-called emergency economic package designed to stimulate demand through quickened infrastructure spending; manufacturers' responsiveness to declining interest rates since the Bank of Japan's 0.75 percentage point official discount rate cut April 1; and ongoing rationalisation and labour-saving initiatives. Orders in 1992 are still likely to decline at a double-digit rate the previous year, but just as the downturn hit machine tool makers early they are expected by autumn to be in the vanguard of the recovery. Unlike many Japanese industries which have reached a relatively stable oligopolistic equilibrium, the machine tool sector still includes dozens of small, flexible competitors as well as some of the world's largest. 'Concentrated, single-minded, highly competitive and cut-throat,' is how Mr Michael Remington, an analyst at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo, describes the industry. Despite such characteristics, machine tool makers have refrained from the debilitating price wars that have characterized previous downturns. Indeed, JMTBA figures show prices remained flat even as orders plunged early this year. The industry may have learned a few lessons from past experience. This time around, its order backlogs have remained consistent at around six months, suggesting makers did not over-burden themselves with excessive production capacity, as did many of their clients during the Japan's 1980s capital spending frenzy, says Mr Remington. Exports also have helped somewhat in steadying demand as the domestic slump has worsened and accounted for about a third of orders in the last quarter of 1991. US domestic orders have increased year-on-year every month since last November. This includes four consecutive months of double-digit gains through February, when they were up 21.5 per cent to Dollars 200.6m - 'the export side is not bad. Contact with US machine tool manufacturers shows the pickup is going to continue,' says Mr Remington. Sales to south-east Asia are also holding up well, despite a slowdown in Japanese direct investment there. Exports to the region increased year-on-year for five consecutive months through February, when they jumped 49 per cent to Y7.46 bn and surpassed shipment value to the US. The problem is Europe - 'the market is completely awful,' says an official of Toshiba Machine Company, one of the world's leading makers of large machine tools. In the first two months of 1992, Japanese machine tool exports to the European Community ran at only about half the previous year's pace, with the February total at Y5.29 bn. Overseas, Japanese machine tool makers face political problems as well as mixed demand. In the US, a so-called voluntary restraint agreement (VRA) was recently extended to give the domestic industry more time to take on foreign competitors. The head of Germany's machine tool association also warned recently that if Japanese makers persist with what he termed 'unfair competitive practices,' or if his own industry falls into the same state as America's, pressure will build for similar measures. However, Japan's own importance to the world machine tool market could help limit political damage. In the US, for example, the VRA works on a sliding scale so Japanese machine tool makers automatically receive larger quotas as demand rises. A blanket ban would likely hurt US industry most of all since Japanese machine tool makers are its only source for a number of vital products. 'The key to Japanese makers increasing sales in the US is not the VRA. The US economy's performance is more important,' says Salomon Brothers Tokyo analyst, Mr Fumihiko Nakazawa. Although Japanese machine tool makers' profits will fall by about 50 per cent during the current recession, the industry remains fundamentally healthy, has weathered downturns before and is undergoing few structural changes this time around, says the JMTBA official. If anything, it is shifting to higher value added equipment and manufacturing consultancy, says Mr Remington. As manufacturing equipment becomes increasingly complex and the debate heats up at home over whether it is really a cost-effective substitute for scarce workers, machine tool makers are finding niches helping clients decide what equipment they really need, he says.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (2): The patchwork that has to be ironed out / The EC's tightening grip THE PACKAGING industry is at the centre of an emotional tussle with the European Commission over plans for EC-wide rules covering disposal of waste used for wrapping products. EC plans for a harmonisation of packaging rules have attracted hostility, both from industrialists claiming that legislation will impose unfair burdens and from environmentalists calling for tougher action to curb the surge in waste from the 'throw-away society'. The EC's 12 members have put into effect a highly disparate series of regulations on the treatment of packaging waste. As in other areas of the environment, the most stringent action has been taken in Germany, the traditional leader in 'green' policy. The patchwork of systems, both voluntary and imposed, requires companies operating throughout the EC to apply widely different targets, quotas, levies and deposit measures on waste generated by packaging - a sizeable barrier to cross-border trade. Ironing out these disparities through the introduction of a common regulatory framework forms an important part of the aim of establishing a Community-wide single market for consumer goods. Yet legislation in the field of packaging also represents possibly the most difficult example of the bid to frame common rules to bridge the Community's north-south gap. The EC has to struggle to encompass both the concerns of the 'green' northern countries, led by Germany, and those of the poorer southern nations such as Spain and Portugal trying to catch up with higher living standards elsewhere. Governments in these southern countries see much EC environmental law as an expensive and unnecessary obstacle to this aim. The strict packaging legislation introduced by Germany during the past year serves as a highly controversial benchmark for the rest of the Community. The German law was further stiffened on April 1, when consumers gained the right to hand back unnecessary wrapping to retailers at the point of sale. Germany's measures have already sparked complaints from industrialists in other countries. This partly reflects fears that products from elsewhere in the EC are likely to face discrimination on the German market. Additionally, the large levels of excess waste material collected in Germany from recycling schemes threaten to swamp waste markets throughout the Community - unsettling attempts elsewhere to set up viable schemes for reusing waste. There has also been criticism that Germany's recycling schemes themselves are intrinsically inefficient. Far more energy is used collecting and transporting packaging waste around Germany, it is claimed, than is being saved through attempted passage towards an environment-friendly waste regime. Reflecting the impact of such criticisms, the final version of Brussels' plans for a packaging directive seems likely to be far less stringent than the measures in force in Germany. The Commission's plan of action centres on a 10-year programme for the reduction of packaging waste and the achievement of recovery and recycling targets. Individual countries are unlikely to transcribe the Community's proposals into national law until the mid-1990s. But first the EC's finalposition will have to be drawn up - probably after the summer. The tussle between industry and the environmental regulators looks likely to be one of the more intriguing wrangles coming to a head during Britain's six-month presidency of the Community in the second half of this year.</p>

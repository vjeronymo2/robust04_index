			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'THE SAINT' FIRST UP ON THE MYSTERY WHEEL  </P> <P> "The Saint," in the stylish persona of Simon Templar, is back -- and KCOP's got  him. The new face in the old role is likewise a Simon: suave Simon Dutton, a  British actor whose paltry 31 years is enhanced with a few gray brush strokes  across his temple hair.  </P> <P> Channel 13 runs the first of six new two-hour "Saint" episodes tonight at 8 in  a Friday cycle labeled "The Mystery Wheel of Adventure." "The Saint" will share  the slot with three Dick Francis tales about detective David Cleveland, as  played by Ian McShane. The first Francis story goes on Oct. 27.  </P> <P> The Saint was created in the 1920s by Leslie Charteris and went through various  incantations in books, radio series, TV and film. Among the saintly casts have  been George Sanders, Louis Hayward and Hugh Sinclair in the movies; Edgar  Barrier, Brian Ahern, Vincent Price, Tom Conway (Sanders' brother) and Barry  Sullivan on radio, and Roger Moore and Ian Ogilvy on the telly.  </P> <P> The bad news is that the episode tonight, "The Brazilian Connection," about  some byzantine baby selling ring, is unreasonably boring. If the producers were  going for cool, they drifted over that deadly line that seperates style and  dullness.  </P> <P> Simon sees a baby being kidnaped and sets out to investigate. Turns out that  16,000 babies were stolen in Brazil last year and sold off for 20,000 each or  more.  </P> <P> Not a bad premise, and Dutton seems a reasonable choice for saintly duty. But  he and his fellow players have nothing much to say or do in what is conversely  a thin and bloated script. Even the generic music employed to pump excitement  into a meaningless chase in the climax seems not to care. IRV LETOFSKY  </P></p>

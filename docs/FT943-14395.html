			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei makes its first gain in six sessions Hopes of an interest rate rise in the US at the end of this week encouraged some brokers, and the Nikkei average gained ground for the first time in six trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 index gained 139.93 to 20,540.41 after a low of 20,368.77 and a peak of 20,558.81. Consumer spending-linked shares were popular, reflecting the recent rise in consumption due to income tax cuts and the hot summer weather, but large capital stocks were hit by profit taking. Volume totalled 320m shares against 303m. Buying orders placed at low levels by life insurers and brokers supported investor confidence but some foreign securities houses took profits. Individuals were also reported to be picking up some speculative favourites. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 7.38 to 1,654.53 while the Nikkei 300 gained 1.34 to 300.81. Advances led declines by 606 to 358 with 228 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index unchanged at 1,340.01. Traders said that the rebound of the dollar from record lows against the yen supported sentiment. Speculation that the US Federal Reserave Board may act to prevent a further plunge also encouraged some investors. Stocks linked to Vietnamese oil development were actively traded on Mitsubishi Oil's discovery of its second oil well off the coast of Vietnam, earlier this week. Mitsubishi Oil was the most actively traded issue of the day, but closed unchanged at Y1,200 on profit-taking in the afternoon session. Japan Energy, which is also drilling for oil in Vietnam, rose Y1 to Y492 and trading houses involved in similar ventures advanced. Koatsu Gas Kogyo, a leading industrial gas producer, was actively bought on rumours that the company has received a patent for a process in the manufacture of a special carbon. The stock gained Y65 to Y795 in spite of later denials by the company. High-technology stocks were lower on the yen's recent rise. Hitachi fell Y10 to Y1,010 and Toshiba lost Y9 to Y780. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 44.68 to 22,955.83 in volume of 29.4m shares. Retail-linked shares gained ground, with the mens' suits retailer, Aoki International, rising Y230 to Y2,850 and Aoyama Shoji gaining Y190 to Y4,180. Roundup The strong performance seen in Hong Kong provided a fillip elsewhere in the region. HONG KONG rose another 2.8 per cent, taking the Hang Seng index above 8,800 at the close in a continued sharp technical rebound as bargain hunters swept back into the market. The index rose 237.46 to 8,828.91 in turnover that swelled to HKDollars 3.9bn from Tuesday's final tally of HKDollars 2.6bn. In subsequent London trading, the indicative index put on a further 67 to 8,896. Mr Nicholas Knight at Nomura commented that taken in isolation, the market's two day rise of 5.2 per cent looked impressive. However, he cautioned that in the wider context of the negative impact on valuations of rising interest rates, it looked somewhat of a swan-song. 'The slow slide in the market now looks destined to accelerate with third quarter 1993 levels looking the most obvious downside target'. Previously hard-hit property stocks led the rally for a second day. Cheung Kong rose HKDollars 1.90 to HKDollars 34.10, Henderson Land added HKDollars 2.70 to HKDollars 37 and New World jumped HKDollars 1.30 to HKDollars 22.50. SINGAPORE closed higher on demand from foreign funds for blue chips, and the Straits Times Industrials index rose 24.58 to 2,183.93. Commercial property stocks led the return of institutional buying in the wake of a pick up in commercial property rentals. KUALA LUMPUR was again encouraged by hopes of an early general election and the composite index put on 3.95 to 989.57. SYDNEY displayed renewed confidence although brokers warned that the positive sentiment was fragile ahead of the release of yesterday's US inflation data. The All Ordinaries index closed 5.7 points stronger at 1,978.6, after a day's high off 1,985.1. WELLINGTON saw demand for forest sector stocks and the NZSE-40 capital index gained 15.73 to 1,970.52. MANILA was weighed down by the continuing slide in PLDT although some second-line issues firmed. The composite index fell to 22.56 to 2,510.76, prompted mainly by PLDT's Dollars 1 1/4 drop to Dollars 52 5/8 in New York. The stock's local price fell 25 pesos to the year's low of 1,400 pesos. SEOUL was flat after renewed interest in financials and some smaller capitalised shares was eroded by profit-taking. The composite stock index added 1.38 points to 961.97. BOMBAY ended slightly higher as volumes fell sharply due to thin attendance on the trading floor after many employees were late arriving for work after monsoon rains threw suburban train services out of gear. The BSE 30 share index rose 2.45 to 4,131.52.</p>

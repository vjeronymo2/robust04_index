			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Brussels drafts drug proposals THE European Commission has proposed that EC countries relax controls on drug prices and introduce more competition to the drugs markets, Reuter reports from Brussels. The draft guidelines propose that national governments abandon direct price controls; require insured patients to pay a significant share of drug costs; and encourage pharmacists to use the cheapest products. A Commission official said the text was likely to change after consultations. The Commission was not yet ready to propose something more radical, such as an EC-wide pricing system, because that would involve overhauling national social security systems. Most EC countries try to limit health care spending by fixing drug prices, either directly or indirectly. But the Commission says the controls have not reduced costs. 'On the contrary, they have contributed to making the pharmaceutical market more rigid, by neutralising competition,' it says in a document explaining its draft proposals. The Commission also proposes harmonising package sizes to make it easier for companies to sell their products internationally.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Go-ahead for Heracles sale THE GREEK government has approved the sale of Heracles General Cement, the largest company on Greece's privatisation list, to an Italian-Greek joint venture led by Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of the Ferruzzi group. Calcestruzzi and the state-owned National Bank of Greece will pay Dr124bn (Dollars 647.1m) in cash for a 69.8 per cent stake held by the Industrial Reconstruction Organisation, the state umbrella for companies being privatised. This is equivalent to Dr3,500 for each share in Heracles, the second largest company listed on the Athens stock exchange. Heracles' shares rose by 10 per cent in active trading yesterday, closing at Dr3,128. Calcestruzzi and National Bank originally offered Dr107bn for IRO's shareholding, but raised their bid after Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement producer, indicated it was willing to put up Dr120bn. IRO said yesterday Calcestruzzi would be the majority shareholder in Calnat, the Italian-Greek joint venture through which the deal is being undertaken, with 'about 51 per cent'. It will also take over management of Heracles. National Bank's participation in the deal is considered crucial because of a dispute over a compulsory share increase imposed when Heracles was taken over by the state in 1983, which allegedly violated European Community company law. If the issue is eventually reversed, making IRO's shares invalid, National Bank would become the largest single shareholder in Heracles. Heracles is the biggest of Greece's four cement makers, producing 6.2m tonnes annually at two plants in central Greece. More than half of production is exported, using ships owned by the company. It said net profits for 1991 showed a 33 per cent rise over the previous year, at Dr6.39bn on turnover of Dr56bn.</p>

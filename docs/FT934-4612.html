			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Neo-fascists set sights on Rome: Seventy years after Il Duce marched on the Italian capital, the right-wing MSI party hopes Sunday's city election will catapult it to national prominence Italian politics have been electrified by the prospect of two key cities, Naples and Rome, falling under the control of a party inspired by the fascist ideals of Benito Mussolini. The neo-fascist MSI (Italian Social Movement) has a modest chance of winning the elections for mayor in both cities in Sunday's second round run-off. If it does, this would represent the biggest single electoral gain by a right-wing nationalist party in Europe in three decades. However, the sudden swing to the MSI is likely to be a temporary phenomenon. It is the product of the collapse of the centre parties and the absence of alternatives other than the Left. The party itself is ill-equipped to cope with success. To maintain its momentum it would have to tone down its intemperate rhetoric, weed out some of the uglier elements in its ranks and forge links with known moderate voices on the right. Polls show that Mr Gianfranco Fini, the MSI leader, is commanding just over 46 per cent of the vote in Rome against nearly 54 per cent for Mr Francesco Rutelli, the Green candidate backed by a left-wing alliance. In Naples, Ms Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of Il Duce, is running neck and neck against her rival, Mr Antonio Bassolino, the candidate of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Under the new local election laws approved in March, there is a run-off between the two candidates with the most votes when no one obtains an absolute first round majority. The winner is then entitled to the majority of council seats to ensure a stable government. In the first round on November 21, Mr Fini polled 36 per cent of the vote, Ms Mussolini 30 per cent - both of them running second but enjoying the largest single party vote. The party also did well in many southern Italian towns as well as near Rome, and in isolated instances in the north such as the city of Trieste. Part of the party's success is due to Mr Fini, a 40-year-old former journalist who took control of the MSI in 1987. Ambitious, street-wise and an effective public speaker, Mr Fini has polished the party's image with more moderate talk. Born seven years after the execution of Il Duce, he describes himself as a 'post-fascist'. He chose to stand for election in Rome, where the party has frequently joined forces with Christian Democrat elements, as a launchpad to project the party nationwide. Until these elections the MSI had remained a noisy minority party, averaging about 5 per cent of the vote in general elections since 1953. Traditionally the party has been strongest in southern Italy and among what has been sometimes called the 'clerk class'. Since the end the of the 1960s the party has also absorbed the Monarchists, giving the current full name MSI-DN (Destra Nazionale - National Right). The party has never disowned Mussolini, merely distanced itself from the fascist regime's excesses. Alessandra Mussolini is open in her admiration for her grandfather and exploits his name. ( A family detail is that her famous aunt, actress Sophia Loren, has not publicly supported her candidacy.) The MSI actively celebrates the anniversary of Mussolini's march on Rome in 1922 that paved the way for his assumption of absolute power. MSI literature is tinged with law and order metaphors and by Italy's tolerant standards is both xenophobic and racist. In the 1960s and 1970s, elements of the party were linked to right-wing terrorism. More conservative members of the military also tend to gravitate towards the party. Against this, the MSI has been fully accepted as a parliamentary party since 1948. In parliament MSI deputies are extremely active and vociferous. Their concerns have ranged from defence issues to budgetary discipline. Unlike other extreme-right parties in Europe, the MSI still formally espouses the state corporatism pioneered by Mussolini. Most commentators agree that the sudden swing to the MSI has little to with its policies. Especially in Naples and Rome, voters have deserted the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals in protest at the corruption they practised while running the country. The MSI itself has been caught in the scandals, but in a lesser way which has not damaged its image. But this is not simply a protest vote. Many voters see in the MSI a new source of patronage. In the specific case of Rome, Mr Fini has won support because he looks a more decisive figure than his rival, who seems too much under the wing of the PDS. Surprisingly, little propaganda has been made of the more unsavoury MSI elements standing for the council. This may yet prove Mr Fini's weak point in Rome.</p>

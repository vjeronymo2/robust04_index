			<p>BFN     [Text] There is no information that Turkish Cypriot leader  Rauf Denktas has accepted the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] and there is no reason for the UN secretary general to  delay his report to the Security Council. The report is  expected to be submitted next week.    In a telephone conversation this morning, Gustave Feissel,  the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in  Cyprus, reiterated this statement to President Glavkos  Kliridhis. Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the  president contacted Feissel to find out if the UN secretary  general would delay his report. He added that Kliridhis made it  clear to Feissel that he has accepted the 21 March UN document  as is and that he will not accept any changes either in the form  of interpretations or clarifications. President Kliridhis  stressed that the 21 March document is crystal clear in its  contents.</p>

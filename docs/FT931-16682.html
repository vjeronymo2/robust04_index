			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber reference price under review THE INTERNATIONAL Natural Rubber Organisation says it will hold a meeting on January 29 to decide if its buffer stock reference price should be cut. It sets the trigger level for Inro's buffer stock buying or selling interventions in the market. Under Inro rules the reference price must be reviewed every 15 months. Depressed rubber prices over recent months could mean a cut of 5 per cent or more in the reference price. Inro has stockpiled more than 160,000 tonnes of natural rubber over the past three years in an attempt to stabilise prices. Rubber traders say they are confident of some firming of prices in the coming months but doubt that a cut in the reference price can be avoided. Traders say that with the US economy showing signs of recovery, demand from the tyre manufacturers is likely to pick up this year. China is also expected to become a leading player in the international rubber market. The Inro affiliated international natural rubber study group forecasts that China will replace Japan as the world's second largest natural rubber consumer this year, with consumption of nearly 700,000 tonnes. The US remained the largest rubber consumer in 1992, with consumption of 825,000 tonnes.</p>

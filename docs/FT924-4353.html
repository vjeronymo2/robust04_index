			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Bristol &amp; West to price mortgages by family status BRISTOL &amp; WEST plans to become the first building society to price new mortgages according to the borrower's age and family status. The move is likely to lead to higher charges for young, unmarried couples without children. From the middle of next year the society will assess the credit risk of new borrowers on the basis of factors such as age, marital status and number of children. The switch could lead to a difference of up to 4 percentage points in the interest rates the society charges to different borrowers. Bristol &amp; West, the tenth largest building society by asset size, said unmarried couples and young adults living together as friends had proved to be poor credit risks in terms of mortgage arrears and repossessions. 'It is an economic policy, although it sounds moralistic,' Mr Tony FitzSimons, chief executive, said yesterday. 'You have to consider people's lifestyles because regretably those who are not bonded by marriage have a higher propensity to break up, and not pay the mortgage.' Mr FitzSimons said the society had found that unmarried couples were 50 per cent more likely to fall into arrears than married couples. Couples who took out mortgages before having children were more likely to default once they had started a family because their bills increased. Although the society had found that young adults sharing mortgages but not a sexual relationship were poor risks, it would not ask questions about sexual habits. 'It might be financially desirable, but it is a step too far,' Mr FitzSimons said. Mortgage rates are likely to reduce as borrowers get older and demonstrate a repayment record. However, Mr FitzSimons said changes such as married couples getting divorced would not lead to higher charges unless repayments suffered. He said Bristol &amp; West's existing borrowers would not be affected, but the society intended to reduce interest rates for existing borrowers who had held policies for more than five years and had not fallen into arrears. The society, which has a Pounds 5.7bn mortgage book, has suffered because of the depressed housing market in the south. Its bad debt charge for the first six months of this year was Pounds 29.7m compared with Pounds 7.2m for the first half of 1991. Most building societies have become more cautious about lending to first-time buyers who want to borrow 95 per cent of the purchase price. Some are now charging less to those who borrow smaller proportions of a property's value. The Building Societies Association said yesterday that societies were gradually varying charges according to types and sizes of loans. However, none had yet started to charge differently according to customer profiles. Bristol &amp; West is still working on details of its policy, based on research concerning defaulting among borrowers who took mortgages in the 1980s. It believes one problem is that young borrowers are less embarrassed about repossession. Most British and French couples prove faithful, Page 3</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: P&amp;O ferries weather the storm The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's ferries business put in a strong performance in the second half, and Lord Sterling, chairman, said bookings were 30 per cent higher than a year ago. The ferry operations, separated for the first time in the group's accounts, made profits of Pounds 81.7m for the year to December 31, up from Pounds 72.9m. The Channel Tunnel will undoubtedly affect revenue, but its late opening should at least secure flat 1994 earnings. Lord Sterling said excess capacity on the cross-Channel business could be moved to profitable European routes. COMMENT The market was pleased with the group's results and the evidence that dividends will finally be covered by recurrent earnings in 1994. Brokers have upgraded forecasts, but assuming Pounds 320m profits in 1994, the shares are on a p/e of 18.5 and a defensive yield of 4.4 per cent, assuming no increase in dividend. P&amp;O has weathered the recession without jettisoning capacity, and now offers exceptional operational gearing, particularly on the container shipping side. The Channel Tunnel may haunt senti-ment, but recent investment sales hinted at P&amp;O's underlying asset value and earnings are on a strong cyclical upswing, even without expected property sales. The shares look attractive, even after yesterday's 4 per cent rise.</p>

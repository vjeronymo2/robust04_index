			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President "Scalfaro is thinking of giving  Berlusconi the task of forming the new government, and this is  what he told Bossi when he met him yesterday at the Presidency  of the republic," Speroni, the head of the Northern League in  the Senate, told a journalist of the Agenzia Italia.    Speroni said that Berlusconi as prime minister would not be  a  problem "since he is not against federalism." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceuticals group, reports half-year results on Thursday with analysts forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 295m and Pounds 325m against Pounds 244m a year earlier on sales of about Pounds 1bn. Retrovir, the HIV-treatment, is expected to generate between Pounds 120m and Pounds 140m, while estimates for sales of Zovirax, the herpes and chickenpox medicine, range from Pounds 345m to Pounds 385m. The main reason for the large range of forecasts is the impact of the dollar in the US where Wellcome generates nearly half of its sales. Analysts will be watching how the cough and cold season has progressed, given Wellcome's non-prescription over the counter business is heavily geared towards winter-type remedies. Prudential, the insurer, is expected to report tomorrow a big jump in pre-tax profits for the year of around Pounds 415m from Pounds 267m, although forecasts range widely. A much improved second-half contribution from the US and benefits flowing from the reorganisation of its UK distribution network are two key factors. Reckitt &amp; Colman, the food, household products and toiletries group, should report on Thursday flat pre-tax profits for 1992 of around Pounds 250m. P&amp;O, the shipping group, is forecast tomorrow to produce only a modest increase of around Pounds 10m in pre-tax profits for 1992 from Pounds 217.4m a year earlier. Redland, the building materials group, similarly will manage on Thursday a moderate profit increase of around Pounds 20m from Pounds 186m, including a nine month contribution from Steetley. Lasmo, the independent oil company, is expected by some analysts to cut its final dividend on Wednesday despite an increase in profits to around Pounds 45m from Pounds 17.9m in 1991. Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, announces its 1992 results tomorrow. It released estimated results, showing an unaudited pre-tax profit of Pounds 147m, a 48.5 per cent increase on 1991,last month when it announced the Dollars 434m acquisition of Specialty Coatings international, the US coatings company. Argos, the catalogue retailer which this week announced the closure of its four pilot Chesterman furniture stores because of disappointing sales, presents its full-year results today. Forecasts range between Pounds 62m and Pounds 66m, compared with last year's Pounds 62.1m. These, however, do not include the Pounds 12.7m charge for the Chesterman closure, which is expected to be taken as an exceptional item, and so reduce pre-tax profits to the Pounds 50m to Pounds 54m range. Full year results tomorrow from Invergordon Distillers, the independent Scotch whisky producer, are likely to reflect the increased pressure on margins in the bulk whisky market. After five years of strong growth, pre-tax profits are expected to be virtually flat at Pounds 32.4m against Pounds 32.2m in 1991. Wolseley, the heating and plumbing supplier, is expected to announce mixed results when it reveals interim profits tomorrow. The company is expected to reveal pre-tax profits up more than 20 per cent to Pounds 40m-Pounds 42m in the six months to end-January. Profits from the US east coast and the UK are likely to be strongly ahead, although results from California and France could be disappointing because of recession.

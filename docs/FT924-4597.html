			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (6): Beyond conventions - The city recognises tourism's economic power CHICAGO'S muscular beauty has the power to stagger the first-time visitor. Instead of the dull, industrial city with little eye-appeal that many fear, it surprises with unexpected physical charm and lots of cultural sophistication. The city makes the most of its location on Lake Michigan, with a series of clean lakefront parks and beaches, and its modern architecture - including the world's tallest building - is impressive. The development that has lately come along the Chicago River, which cuts through the city, has also won urban planners' applause. The city can claim a world-famous symphony orchestra, a highly acclaimed opera, a first-rate art museum, a vast array of excellent and ethnic restaurants, America's best blues clubs and richest theatre life outside New York. It is odd, then, that it has promoted itself little as a tourist destination. But that is changing. Until now, given its central location in the US, it has built its travel fame on conventions, trade shows and business meetings. These brought over 3.35m visitors and Dollars 2.5bn in spending to the city last year. Although the number of visitors is expected to fall marginally this year, expenditure is projected to reach Dollars 2.7bn. Chicago hopes to expand this business further with a Dollars 987m expansion of McCormick Place, its premier convention and trade show location: 1.2m square feet of exhibition and conference space will be added to the current facility. The expansion, to be completed by 1997, is slated to bring in an additional Dollars 1.6bn annually in revenues to the state of Illinois. Chicago hoteliers can hardly wait. Occupancy rates have dropped to a painfully low 60-65 per cent, after the addition of eight large, new hotels since 1990. The construction spree began in the late 1980s after a period of relative shortage of hotel space. Since 1988, 5,551 rooms have been added in downtown Chicago. Of these, 2,086 have been added during the past year alone by Stouffer, Sheraton and Marriott. Nearly 25,000 rooms are available in the city itself, and there are 64,000 within the metropolitan area. But the additional rooms came on line just as the American economy slowed and the convention business began to shrink. Although the attendance at trade shows in Chicago has increased slightly over the past five years, convention attendance is down from a high of 538,000 in 1988 to 333,000 last year. But projections are up for 1992, and the hope is that 1993 will bring an economic upturn. Yet while the city continues to focus on the lucrative convention and trade-show business, it has begun to see the economic power of tourism. It has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in the past 20 years, and has little hope of attracting major industrial projects to restore them. Chicago thus finds itself pinning its economic hopes increasingly on the travel and tourism industry. The most striking example of this shift is Mayor Richard Daley's fight for a controversial Dollars 2bn casino complex (described on this page). Further evidence of Chicago's attention to tourism is its expenditure of Dollars 150m to renovate Navy Pier, a 1916 naval installation that juts directly from the city centre into Lake Michigan. It has been used for many purposes over the years, including trade shows and art exhibits. But the renovation, to be completed by 1994, will be directed primarily at tourism. It will include a children's museum, a botanical garden, a pavilion for performing arts, retail shops, a multi-purpose 170,000sq ft exposition space, and a destination restaurant overlooking the lake. While it already receives nearly 12m visitors a year, Chicago wants to increase that number. It would particularly like to draw more international tourists, who numbered roughly 1.5m last year, according to statistics for the state of Illinois. It is due to complete the construction next summer of a new international terminal at O'Hare airport, one of the world's busiest civil aviation hubs. This will especially help to handle traffic when Chicago hosts the opening of the soccer World Cup in 1994. A Dollars 10bn third international airport proposal was shelved earlier this year, after Mayor Daley had failed to win approval for the project from the Illinois legislature. Many speculate, however, that the proposal has simply gone on the back burner until the mayor finds a propitious moment to revive it. With the rising importance of the travel, tourism and the hospitality industry, the Chicago of the 1990s little resembles the gritty steel and meat-packing town that gained fame in the early part of this century as Carl Sandburg's 'city of broad shoulders'. But with era of heavy lifting gone from America, it cannot be faulted for failing to try to change with the times.</p>

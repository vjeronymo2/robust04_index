			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VIOLA LEARNS LESSON: IF YOU PITCH AROUND MITCHELL, WILLIAMS IS WAITING  </P> <P> Frank Viola, burned by Kevin Mitchell's three-run home run in New York last  week, pitched around the major leagues' home run leader in the sixth inning  Saturday at San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Mets have had trouble scoring runs for last season's American League Cy  Young Award winner, and, trailing, 2-1, Viola had to be careful.  </P> <P> The walk to Mitchell followed a one-out single by Will Clark and brought up  third baseman Matt Williams. Apparently neither Viola nor the Mets were aware  that since early August, Williams has hit more home runs than either Mitchell  or Clark.  </P> <P> Williams hit a 425-foot drive over the left-field fence to enable the Giants to  continue their mastery over the Mets, 6-2. The Giants, 8-3 against the Mets  this season, opened their lead in the West to five games.  </P> <P> The Mets, 3-5 on their final trip West, fell 3 1/2 games behind the Chicago  Cubs in the East. They lost for the second time in 10 days to Rick Reuschel  (16-6), who gave up four hits in eight innings for his best outing since  hurting his shoulder nearly two months ago.  </P> <P> Viola, who is 2-4 since the Mets acquired him from Minnesota, wasn't going to  let Mitchell beat him.  </P> <P> "I thought about the three-run home run he hit off me in New York," Viola said.  "He has 41 home runs and 114 RBIs, so you take your chances with Williams. He  has incredible power, but he's easier to pitch to."  </P> <P> It has not been true lately. In his last 24 games Williams has hit 11 home runs  and driven in 24 runs. During that span Mitchell has hit eight home runs and  Clark five. Williams has 14 home runs in 59 games for the Giants; he had 26  with Phoenix, giving him 40 this season.  </P> <P> "It was a changeup in the strike zone," Williams said. "I really haven't set  any home run goals. I'm just trying to drive in runs and win some ballgames."  </P> <P> The Mets activated Dwight Gooden, who has been on the disabled list since July  2 because of a shoulder injury. The Mets say the right-hander will be used in  late-inning relief, at least for his first two or three appearances. He is  expected to be ready for his first starting assignment next Friday.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want to do it next year," Gooden said. "But it sounds like a good  idea for now, especially with the other starters doing well. I like the idea of  coming in with the game on the line."  </P> <P> Chicago 10, Atlanta 3 -- After a brilliant start last season, Greg Maddux faded  in the second half. This season Maddux has become the Cubs' best pitcher down  the stretch.  </P> <P> Maddux (16-10) pitched seven innings at Atlanta, giving up six hits and walking  none.  </P> <P> The Cubs, in ending a two-game losing streak, stayed 2 1/2 games ahead of St.  Louis. They scored six times in the first inning, with rookie Richard Wrona  capping the burst with his first home run, a three-run smash.  </P> <P> Three errors, two by shortstop Andres Thomas on one play, made all six runs off  Marty Clary unearned.  </P> <P> St. Louis 13, Houston 5 -- The Cardinals scored only 10 runs in their first  four games on this homestand and in one game stranded 16 baserunners.  </P> <P> They figured out a solution that is foreign to them. For the first time since  the first week of last season, the Cardinals hit three home runs in a game.  </P> <P> Terry Pendleton, Tom Brunansky and John Morris hit home runs to lead a 15-hit  attack that dropped the Astros five games behind San Francisco in the West.  </P> <P> The Cardinals, who normally hit fewer home runs than any other team, have 62  this season.  </P> <P> "I was beginning to wonder if we would hit more than Roger Maris did when he  set the record (61)," Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said. "It is much more fun  watching a game in which we score 11 runs in the first four innings instead of  the one when we couldn't score in 13 innings.  </P> <P> Jose Oquendo had three hits and drove in three runs for the Cardinals, who took  over sole possession of second place in the East, 2 1/2 games behind the Cubs.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 6, Pittsburgh 2 -- Tom Browning (15-10) pitched into the eighth  inning at Pittsburgh to win his eighth in a row as the Reds won their third  straight.  </P> <P> During his streak Browning has an earned-run average of 1.75.  </P> <P> San Diego 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Ken Howell had a one-hitter and a 2-0 lead after  seven innings at San Diego, but the Padres erupted in the eighth.  </P> <P> Bip Roberts hit a two-run double to tie the score and Roberto Alomar singled  home the winning run. Bruce Hurst (13-9) went eight innings to get the win.  </P> <P> Mark Davis pitched the ninth to earn his 33rd save, most in the major leagues.  DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

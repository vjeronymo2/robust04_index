			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- A national meeting of  coal industrial workers was held here from April 20 to 22.    The meeting reviewed the achievements and experience gained  in the coal industrial sector in the past and discussed measures  to thoroughly carry out the party's revolutionary economic  strategy by effecting a new upsurge in coal production.    Present at the meeting were Premier Kang Song-san and  Vice-President Yi Chong-ok, Politburo members of the Central  Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK].    In a congratulatory message to the participants in the  meeting, the WPK Central Committee said the efforts for a great  upsurge in coal production were a very important and honorable  undertaking to accelerate socialist construction as a whole by  implementing the agriculture-first, light industry-first and  foreign trade-first policies of the party and a noble struggle  for smashing the moves of the U.S. imperialists and other  reactionaries to blockade and stifle the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea, the fortress of socialism, and defending and  further developing Korean socialism centred on the popular  masses.    It called upon all the officials and workers engaged in the  coal industrial sector to defend the party and firmly safeguard  Korean-style socialism and further develop it with increased  coal production.    Hong Song-nam, alternate Politburo member of the C.C.  [Central Committee], the WPK and vice-premier of the  Administration Council, delivered a report at the meeting.    He dwelt on the achievements registered in the coal  industrial sector in the past and future tasks.    He said:    Over the past three decades the production capacity of the  coal mines has increased 3.5 times. More than 40 mines and 50  pits have been built in promising coal fields, with the result  that Korea now produces in ten days as much coal as was produced  in 1946.    The main tasks facing the coal industrial sector are to  concentrate investment in coal mines with large deposits and  favorable excavating conditions, reconstruct the existing coal  mines on a modern and expansion basis, actively develop new ones  and, at the same time, vigorously promote the modernization and  scientification in this sector to fully meet the growing demand  of the national economy.    Speeches were made at the meeting.    A letter of pledge to the great leader President Kim Il-song  and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted there.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> OFF-THE-WALL HOUR OF WOODY ALLEN'S 'DEATH' IN FULLERTON  </P> <P> The great Woody Allen obsesses on a lot of things, but, as every fan knows, his  favorite misery is dwelling on death.  </P> <P> His comic ruminations on the big sleep show up in most of his movies, many of  his short stories and plenty of his plays. He even wrote a one-act, named  simply and appropriately "Death."  </P> <P> The Fullerton College theater arts department has taken this goofy, neurotic,  boisterous one-hour-long number and run with it -- Tuesday's opening night had  the right pace (quick) and the right attitude (off-the-wall).  </P> <P> "Death" loosely follows Kleinman, a typically compulsive Allen anti-hero, all  worry and hesitation, as he gets entangled in a vigilante group's crazed  efforts to track down a homicidal maniac who's running amok in New York City.  </P> <P> Kleinman, like the doomed character in Kafka's "The Trial," is wrested from his  bed and tossed into the fray, never knowing exactly what the whole deal is  about. First he's a suspect, then he's an important part of the posse, then  he's a suspect again. Finally, he's a victim.  </P> <P> Along the way, he runs into an insane doctor, an insane hooker (get a look at  Traci McWain's incredible hat) and, eventually, the insane murderer. All the  while, he nervously gabs about this and that, especially death. As Kleinman  mutters at one point, "It's not that I'm afraid to die, I just don't want to be  there when it happens."  </P> <P> Director Brian Kojac apparently feels that no actor but Woody Allen could do  justice to Kleinman, so he has Joey Napoli play him like a Woody clone. That's  OK, though -- Napoli does a pretty decent impression; it's an amusing, if not  always original, performance from start to finish.  </P> <P> The rest of the cast also adds to the fun, although the roles don't require  much more than going to the brink. These are exaggerated portrayals for  exaggerated characters.  </P> <P> There are some clever turns from Kojac. The first scenes, of the  power-tool-carrying vigilantes massed together and moving crab-like across the  stage, is accompanied by the Talking Heads' "Psycho Killer." We get a  counterpoint to that at play's end when everybody gathers around the body of  Kleinman and croons "The Lion Sleeps Tonight." Manhattan may be a jungle, but  Kleinman was no lion.  </P> <P> The program opens with a 20-minute adaptation of Allen's short story "The Whore  of Mensa," now entitled "Street Smart." This is just a trifle, sort of a  prolonged gag that has a few sharp lines but doesn't march anywhere. The joke  centers on buying prostitutes for their pretentious intellectual capacity  instead of their physical gifts.  </P> <P> In it, a private eye named Arrow (Thomas M. Nealeigh) goes undercover to ferret  out Flossie's (Karl Schott's) ring of "Moby Dick"-spouting girls. Arrow is  hard-boiled and Flossie is funny as a guy in drag "with Brenda Vaccaro's  voice." The bit may be worth it just to see Laura Lynn Orlow fake a good orgasm  while babbling smart stuff.  </P> <P> 'DEATH,' 'STREET SMART'  </P> <P> A Fullerton College production of one-acts by Woody Allen.

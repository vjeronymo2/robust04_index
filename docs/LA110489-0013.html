			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTLESS REPORTING OF RAIDERS TOO MUCH  </P> <P> Well, here they go again, continuing the unfair, slanted reporting that many  reporters seem to practice unconsciously.  </P> <P> I found it absolutely impossible to believe that nowhere in either Mark  Heisler's or Chris Baker's stories on the Raiders last Sunday was the name of  Coach Art Shell. Not once.  </P> <P> That's OK as long as they do the same next season after the Raiders lose five  of their first six or seven games.  </P> <P> JOHN ViDAHL, Windsor Hills  </P></p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (5): Paris reaps reward for boldness - Financial Markets Morgan Stanley of the US, the UK's Kleinwort Benson and Nomura of Japan - have expanded their activities in Paris. From a glance at the latest sets of figures from the existing players on the French securities markets, one could be forgiven for wondering why. All but a handful of the established Paris brokers lost money last year. Even the few profitable firms came under intense financial pressure. The latest figures from the Association Francaise des Societes de la Bourse show that the 55 French stockbrokers made combined losses of FFr600m in 1991. The reasons for the losses are obvious. The French stock market is over-crowded, with too many firms chasing too little business in an illiquid market. This problem is compounded by the continuing existence of a number of small, heavily loss-making brokers, which are propped up by their owners, often the big French banks, thereby destabilising the rest of the industry. Finally, as if to add insult to injury, despite the radical reforms of the 1980s, Paris has never succeeded in stemming the loss of business to its chief competitor, London. Why then, have apparently rational companies such as Morgan, Kleinwort and Nomura decided to invest in the lacklustre Paris market? The answer is that they, like the established players, are confident that the future will be far brighter when the second wave of France's financial reforms has taken effect. The first wave of reforms in the mid to late 1980s revolutionised the French markets as Paris followed London's lead by deregulating its financial sector. The labyrinth of closed markets, restrictive practises and other anomalies that had for decades dominated French finance was swept away. At the end of it all, France could claim to lead the world in terms of technology and to have opened up its markets for the 1990s. But Paris still had its problems. The market was illiquid, mainly because of the severe shortage of both investment and equity in France, a country where the state still controls the pension system and huge chunks of industry. Moreover, some of the old anomalies, such as the Bourse tax on share transactions and anachronistic takeover laws, had survived. The attempts of Paris to establish itself as an international trading centre were also impeded by the strict rules on disclosure, which made it easier for dealers to execute 'block' trades in large volumes of shares in London. Fortunately for the French financial community the socialist government has recognised these problems. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister who, as finance minister, pursued so rigorous an economic policy that he won over even the most conservative of financiers, is seen as the chief proponent of reform. Indeed, one of the ironies of French politics, at least to Anglo-Saxon eyes, is that the main opponent to financial deregulation has been not left-wing politicians but the Patronat, the lobbying body for big business. The second wave of financial reform is now underway. The first candidate for change was takeover law, which recently came under scrutiny during the controversial bids for the Au Printemps stores group and Perrier mineral water. The government has already abolished one anachronism in this area - the right to make partial bids for two thirds of a company. Meanwhile the stock market authorities are considering proposals to make block trading easier in Paris. There are also growing lobbies both to abolish Bourse tax - a move that Mr Beregovoy is believed to support - and to modernise the regulatory structure of the Paris markets,possibly by merging the two watchdogs, the Commission des Operations de Bourse and the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs. Further, the government is tackling the longer term issue of liquidity. The proposed reform of the French pension system, which will almost certainly involve encouraging the use of private pensions as a complement to the existing state system, should provide a sorely needed source of new investment by creating the sort of private sector funds that are already such important components of the US and UK markets. Looking into the future it is possible to paint an optimistic scenario whereby the private pension funds also instill more discipline into the French markets by challenging the power of the big banks and insurers, which now dominate the investment scene, and by insisting on higher standards of reporting from companies. At the same time the government's policy of partial privatisation - the sale of minority stakes in state-controlled companies - should help to address the equity problem. Partial privatisation started earlier this year with the sale of a stake in the Elf Aquitaine energy group. It will continue with the forthcoming Total oil group issue and future sales of stakes in the big insurers. The pension and privatisation programmes seem set to continue whichever party wins next year's National Assembly elections. The socialists, who have so far been impeded in their pension plans by trade union opposition, are expected to wait until then to accelerate their reforms. If the conservatives come to power in France, both programmes should be stepped up even further. It would be foolish to exaggerate the likely impact of all the various financial reforms. The new takeover laws are little more than a mopping-up exercise and noone expects the new block trading system to achieve anything more than simply stopping the loss of any more business to London. Similarly, it will take years, possibly decades, for the full effects of pension reform to emerge, given the complex logistics of the exercise. Moreover, the tradition of state ownership is so strong in France that, even if the right returns to power, it is difficult to envisage the state not continuing to control a large tranche of industry. But the important thing is that changes are indeed underway. It is this which has encouraged the likes of Morgan, Kleinwort and Nomura to expand in Paris and which has helped the established houses to lick their wounds and swallow last year's losses.</p>

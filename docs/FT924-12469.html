			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Former foes to discuss keeping the peace COLLABORATION on military peacekeeping operations between Nato and former Warsaw Pact countries is to be discussed by defence ministers early next year. Nato ministers backed a German proposal made at a meeting yesterday of the Nato nuclear planning group. They also sought to ensure that France  - which stands outside Nato's military organisation - should be fully involved in allied peacekeeping initiatives. Britain, the US and other allies yesterday put forward concrete proposals to help Nato prepare for peacekeeping operations, such as in former Yugoslavia. Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said Bonn was willing to increase its logistical support for humanitarian relief efforts in former Yugoslavia, but would not send soldiers. The alliance decided in June that troops and equipment could be used for peacekeeping outside Nato territory. So far there have been no requests from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe for such units.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Ford chief spells out how UK government must aid industry Sir, In your leader about manufacturing on March 8, you said that the answer to previous difficulties lies partly in government policies but also in the hands of industrialists. This is true, and for our part at Ford we have been working with some success to improve our basic design, engineering and assembly capabilities. Also, we have been investing in new products right through the recession. Our aim, along with many other manufacturers, is to provide more exciting, safer products, with higher quality and lower costs. From the government, in the near term, we hope that in today's Budget there will be no measures that will stifle the first indications of recovery in car sales, and that revisions to company car tax will not result in tax bands that would continue to cause distortion of the market at threshold levels. More fundamentally, we believe that the government should support industry through the provision of better scientific, technical and management education. Further, we consider that any education or training programme should recognise the importance of developing professional standards, at all levels of industry. Government should also assess the merits of establishing a new science and engineering college with the ambition to earn a reputation for excellence similar to that of universities such as MIT in the US. The government can help industry by creating the right economic environment. This includes stability in policies, investing in the nation's infrastructure, the creation of a true common market in Europe, and a conclusion of the Uruguay Round. With respect to investment from Japan, Britain should examine carefully whether it is likely to strengthen or weaken the base of vital research and engineering skills in this country. For example, Japanese cars produced in the UK, together with the components they contain, are largely designed and engineered at centres in Japan. Finally, the powerful long-term causal links between manufacturing success and success in key service businesses should not be forgotten. The huge success of Japanese manufacturing exports of the last decade made possible the dramatic growth of Japanese banking around the world; not the other way around.

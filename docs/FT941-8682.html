			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good reason for not investing in upturn Sir, Mr Tony Jackson ('Dangers of great expectations', February 12) seems to be perplexed that UK industry is not currently investing more than it seems to be doing in preparation for recovery from the recession. Perhaps my company's policy on investment, which is based upon our experiences of the last 14 years or so and which I believe to be typical of very many businesses, might help him to understand. The 1980s began with the government-engineered slaughter of manufacturing industry and our order book at that time, like so many others, went over the edge of a cliff. Those customers of ours which closed down overnight or went bust accounted for more than 80 per cent of our turnover. These happenings left in their wake a strong buyers' market with the characteristically low prices of such a market and these still continue today. During this 14-year period we have suffered the financial problems of a significant customer having gone into liquidation owing us a substantial sum of money; this has happened on three occasions and each time, perhaps more significantly, it has meant the end of yet another source of orders. During the same period we have worked at normal capacity for barely five years. Manufacturing industry is continuing to contract at quite a pace so that to maintain our sales level we have to get at least two new customers a month and at the moment we are nearly three years into another recession which none of the 'experts' quite seems to understand. While we will certainly always meet any demands which our customers may make upon us we will not spend money on creating additional production capacity 'in preparation for recovery' until we can be reasonably sure that we can make a good enough margin to cover us for the risks associated with a contracting industry and the seemingly endless blundering with the economy by the government. Jackson may think it 'curious', but our view is that it does not matter how cheap money is and how low a figure inflation has come down to; these are minor factors which do not come into our discussions on such matters as these.

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Cadbury's soft centre There is something touchingly naive in the Cadbury Committee's faith in a self-regulatory system of corporate governance. According to Sir Ron Dearing, former chairman of the Post Office, it is preferable to legislation which is obeyed to the letter but not in spirit. The Cadbury report is full of spirit, but the letter of its proposed code is frequently blurred, partly, one suspects, because the great and the good who compiled it do not wish to be inconvenienced by too much change. Little fear must attach to the implicit threat of stock exchange de-listing for companies which fail to disclose their level of compliance. Hardly ever has the exchange had recourse to such a sanction, which would, incidentally, make it harder for investors to sell their holdings. Nor are the proposed rules always as hard and fast as they look. The committee is reluctant to insist on separation of the chairman and chief executive roles, presumably because a unified post has worked well at companies like Grand Metropolitan. Directors have only to state that they have a 'reasonable expectation' that their company will continue in operation. The issue of rotation of auditors is ducked. There is no guarantee of legislation to protect auditors who report suspicion of fraud to the authorities. In any case that is not such a dramatic proposal: the authorities were slow to latch on to the BCCI scandal despite the existence of such protection for auditors of banks. Doubtless a latter-day Robert Maxwell would make mincemeat of the committee's efforts to strengthen the role of non-executive directors. Admittedly, the code does give shareholders more ammunition to insist on their rights as owners. That they are currently in a mood to do so was evidenced by yesterday's acrimonious exchanges over executive share options at the Rolls-Royce annual meeting. Whether they would be similarly militant in a boom is another matter.</p>

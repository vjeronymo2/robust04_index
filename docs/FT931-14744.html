			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Abbey National raises Pounds 150m in bond market Abbey National yesterday raised Pounds 150m in the bond market as part of a move to further boost its capital for regulatory purposes. At 10.5 per cent, Abbey's overall ratio of capital to assets is already comfortably ahead of most other UK banks. However, the bank said it wanted to raise new capital while it could borrow at favourable rates, rather than risking waiting until it needed the capital. The Pounds 150m of subordinated debt, which is structured to be repaid in 2018, comes at a time when long-term borrowing in the sterling market is scarce. With the gap between short- and long-term interest rates widening, most companies have shifted towards shorter-term borrowings.</p>

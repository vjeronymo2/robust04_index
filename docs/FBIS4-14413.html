			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] RIA-Novosti agency reports that a Russian diplomat,  Igor Makeyev, has disappeared in mysterious circumstances in  Thailand. He has allegedly disappeared with a portable computer  containing secret information. The Thai police believe Makeyev  has either secretly left the country or is no longer alive. The  Russian Embassy has so far refrained from commenting, but it has  noted that any information in the possession of an employee of  the consular department could only be concerned with that  department.</p>

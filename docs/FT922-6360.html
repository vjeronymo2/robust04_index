			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Council Services: Independents push for innovation AT THE forefront of the contracting-out revolution in local government is East Cambridgeshire, a small district council whose councillors claim a proud record of innovation. The council, which is controlled by independents, was the first to contract out the preparation of its district plan to consultants - including responsibility for the extensive public consultation process and responding to objections at the inquiry. It was also the first council to contract out tax collectionand the payment of benefits under a five-year arrangement that offers incentives for prompt collection of poll tax. The council has restructured itself around a core organisation dedicated to purchasing services and ensuring that they come up to standard. The services themselves will be provided under contract by a variety of organisations - including, in some cases, the council's own staff. Serving just 62,000 people from the cathedral city of Ely, East Cambridgeshire contracts out services such as housing maintenance and pest control. The council's housing stock is about to be transferred to a housing association following a vote by the tenants. But the council has decided to go much further in contracting out so that almost any part of its operations could be put out to tender. A 'client core' of senior officers has been created to handle the contracting-out process. The most important roles of the core are to draw up the specifications for the contracts and monitor performance. The rest of the council's staff have been reorganised into budget centres which will contract with the core to provide specific services. An increasing share of those services will be bought in from the private sector, so that the council itself will become less involved in direct service provision. Mr Trevor Hardy, East Cambridgeshire chief executive, is evangelical about the council's approach. 'The only criterion is whether change produces benefits for the people of East Cambridgeshire,' he says.</p>

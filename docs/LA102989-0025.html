			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GODFATHER'S SON  </P> <P> Having opposed Brooklier in a loan-sharking case some years ago while I was a  special attorney with the Organized Crime Strike Force, I have no quarrel with  those who are impressed with the trial skills of the son of L.A.'s former don.  It is the aura of glamour (or is it a halo?) that Murphy constructs around  Brooklier that does a disservice to those who accept the burden of immigrant  status without resorting to illegal activities to make their way. That Tony  Brooklier's father may have been faced with the difficult and soul-searching  choices of immigrants the world over does not excuse, or sanction, an end run  around those barriers by the use of extortion and racketeering. I object to the  rendering of criminal figures in sympathetic terms by the sleight of hand of  humanizing the experience of someone like Tony Brooklier. I recall, with as  equal and untainted an affection as Tony Brooklier has for his father, my  grandfather pressing pants for 50 years in the poor but proud sections of  Brooklyn for the munificent sum of $65 per week, 25 cents of which was usually  shared with the grandchildren. A tattered picture of my grandfather with a sign  reading "Please to tell your friends" in his tailor shop as he sought to  scratch out a living on the Lower East Side trumpets more courage than an army  of racketeers and hoodlums.  </P> <P> GEORGE KARL ROSENSTOCK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

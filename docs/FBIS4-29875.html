			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan will take  "appropriate and timely" measures to stem any excessive rise of  the yen that could put a damper on the recovering economy,  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [21 June].    "As I have repeatedly said, we are in close contact (with  other Group of Seven nations) to take appropriate and timely  measures," Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet  meeting.    Referring to the yen's rise to the 101 yen level against the  dollar Monday in overseas markets, Fujii quoted market  participants as saying the move stemmed from the German mark's  strengthening.    Asked about the impact of the yen's rise on Japan's economy,  Fujii said, "As Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and I have  been saying at the Diet, the economy is moving toward a  recovery, but the yen's rise is worrisome."    Concerning falling stock and bond prices, Fujii said he  wants  to "watch for a while" and that he should refrain from  commenting on day-by-day movements.</p>

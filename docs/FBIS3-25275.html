Chief Etiebet, in the  course of his trip, met and held talks with the Qatari minister  of energy and industries, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-'Atiyah, who is  the current OPEC president. Both ministers are reported to have  agreed on measures to check the sliding oil prices which have  resulted in a drop of about $4 in the price of Nigeria's Bony  Light crude.    In an international press briefing, Chief Etiebet described  his talks with Qatar's minister of energy as successful:    [Begin Etiebet recording] We resolved to tackle these areas  with a view to making sure that overproduction is reduced to its  minimum if not completely eradicated, and quota arrears are  meant to make sure that what will come out in our meeting on  March 25th will be enough to bring up the price to a comfortable  level for the producers again. We are very serious and very  determined in this area. I would not like to read or say  exactly the figures but we definitely think that we should work  from anything from between five and 10 percent until production  (?goes up). [end recording]    Chief Etiebet also paid a courtesy call on the Amir of  Qatar.    [Begin Etiebet recording] Our head of state, General Sani  Abacha, asked me to (?deliver a message) and convey his best  regards, his greetings, and to congratulate you and your  sovereign (?noblemen) of your country, which is seen as one of  the richest and most peaceful in the world. [end recording]    (?Later), the minister and his delegation went to Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia. While in Saudi Arabia, Chief Etiebet held talks  with his Saudi counterpart, Muhyi-al-Din Nazir. The minister  and his delegation have since returned to the country.</p>

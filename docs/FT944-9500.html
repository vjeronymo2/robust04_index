			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE cocoa study clears funds of distortion The hedge fund and institutional money that has poured into the commodity markets this year has not made futures contracts more volatile nor pushed prices out of line with physical supply signals, as is believed by many traders, according to a report to be released this week. The report, by Christopher Gilbert, professor of applied econometrics at Queen Mary and Westfield College, part of the University of London, was commissioned by the London Commodity Exchange and is the first to examine the activities of futures funds in the London market. It charts fund activity in the world cocoa market. Prof Gilbert notes that many institutional investors have been attracted to commodities since the beginning of the year as a way of diversifying their portfolios. At the same time, short-term trend-following funds with fairly large amounts of money to trade have been increasingly active in commodities. It is these short-term traders who base their decisions on technical trends that many dealers blame for exaggerating price trends and increasing volatility in the commodity markets. However, Prof Gilbert shows that intra-day volatility in cocoa has changed little in the past five years. In addition, he believes that there are enough dealers basing their decisions on fundamental analysis of the market to counteract the effects of technical trading. 'This suggests that technical trading is unlikely to have any sustained effect on prices, but does not preclude the possibility that it does exaggerate short-term price movements,' he notes. Fund activity does have the beneficial effect of dramatically improving liquidity in agricultural futures markets, where thinness has been a particular problem. This addition of depth offsets the exaggerated price movements generated by fund activity. Prof Gilbert says 'these two effects appear in general to cancel'. He also refutes the suggestion that funds have pushed prices away from physical supply signals, concluding that, on the contrary, in cocoa they have brought the two closer together. Institutional fund investors looking to play the long-term trends in commodity markets have provided much of the growth in liquidity in the cocoa market, particularly in New York, during the past eight years. Since last July, funds have also become large holders of cocoa stocks. From an analysis of US regulatory figures, Prof Gilbert concludes that these funds hold between 300,000 and 600,000 tonnes of cocoa in the London and New York markets. These holdings account for between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of the entire stocks held by the industry. 'The commodity funds have essentially bid it away from the grinders. They are willing to pay a higher price to control the stock. This reflects their concerns about inflation, their view that cocoa and other commodities (but not coffee) remain cheap and the poor performance of other investments,' the report states. Prof Gilbert says that the purchase of cocoa stocks by the funds has coincided with the general run-up in price experienced by the market. He says funds are not necessarily pushing the cocoa price out of line with market fundamentals, but that cocoa appears to have been under-valued in 1990-1992. The report suggests that the large fund purchases in July 1993 may have been the catalyst that triggered a return to prices more in line with costs. This points to the fact that 'fund activity has affected the level of cocoa prices, but in a direction which aligns them more closely with market fundamentals'.

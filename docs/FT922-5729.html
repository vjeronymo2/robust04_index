			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Management: No credit to banks - Why the clearers seem unable to match other companies in terms of service NAME your 10 favourite large service organisations. If you are anything like me, they will include several retail chains, a travel agency, a hotel group, and perhaps an airline, a utility, or a car rental company. My list is topped by three retailers: Boots and John Lewis in Britain, and LL Bean in America. But unless you live in the US, or use Citicorp or American Express abroad, I'll bet that none of your favourites is a bank or a credit card organisation. In Britain most retail banks seem to equate good service with little more than glossy advertising and restyled branch interiors. This is not just a matter of personal prejudice. My distrust of banks is shared, for a start, by Linda King Taylor, a service expert who is the author of a new book with the ambitious title of Quality: Total Customer Service*. She refused to include any bank in her volume, which consists of British case studies. Her reason, she says, was that she could find no UK bank which met her criteria of excellent customer service. These include: total board commitment to it; adaptation of all the company's systems to suit the needs of the customer; thorough training and empowerment of staff to deliver consistently good service; and continual measurement to ensure this. She did, however, include cases on a building society (the Portman), on one part of a utility (the south-eastern region of British Gas), and even - surprisingly - London's Metropolitan Police. With the exception of several small branches of two banks, my experience echoes Taylor's judgment to the letter. I have just had a telling experience with my new National Westminster Access credit card. Earlier this month, a polite standard letter arrived, pointing out that I had exceeded my credit limit, and asking for a payment. No deadline was given, nor any warning to avoid using the card until payment had been received. Yet a few days later I heard from a puzzled shop that a tiny charge - for Pounds 10.50 - had been refused. Not even the once-vilified North Thames area of British Gas, in its blackest days of service quality (now very much rectified), would have done such a thing. Cutting off a customer's supply without warning, whether the commodity be gas or credit, is to break one of the most fundamental principles of any type of service: the need to keep the customer informed. To be fair to NatWest, both its Access department and its HQ staff handled the matter helpfully. They also admitted that the velvet-phrased letter and the iron-fisted action were inconsistent, or 'faintly strange', as one employee put it. The mismatch between the offending systems is now being reviewed. This responsiveness in dealing with at least one customer's complaint dilutes (very slightly) one's obvious surprise at finding NatWest listed as one of '50 European companies with top quality service' in a new book which is directly competitive with Taylor's. The volume, under the main title of Total Customer Satisfaction**, is co-authored by two consultants, Jacques Horowitz and Michele Jurgens Panak. The latter has particular expertise in banking. But this does not make her any kinder to that industry than Taylor. She cites three main reasons why retail banks, especially in Britain, generally fail to offer as high service quality as many other types of organisation. First, she says they have to deal with relatively large numbers of people, both internally and externally. (She cites NatWest's 110,000 employees and 6m customers.) That makes for plenty of fallible human contacts between employees and customers. Yet some retail chains have nearly as many people to deal with, both internally and externally, and yet provide an excellent standard of service. Second, Jurgens points to the banks' high rate of staff turnover, which makes quality service difficult to achieve and sustain. Yet turnover is equally high among some retail chains - especially those laggards which do relatively little to retain staff. Jurgens hits the nail on the head with her third reason: that, until recently, British banks have not experienced much competition. Here they do differ markedly from the big retailers, who have to battle almost every week to stop flighty customers deserting to rivals. So why did Jurgens include NatWest? In some ways she is heavily critical of the bank, saying that it still suffers from considerable bureaucracy and an inward-looking culture that puts self-protection before the interests of its customers. It still has systems that she calls 'so anti-customer that it's unbelievable'. All the same, she says there is now a solid group of individuals within the bank committed to giving good service. She included NatWest because of the considerable and instructive effort which it has made since introducing its service quality programme in 1983. This has had patchy results, and has made little difference to the overall public perception of the bank vis-a-vis its principal competitors; customer expectations are at last rising. But the programme constitutes a vital part of the bank's future competitiveness. For organisations in any type of industry, Jurgens' book, like Taylor's, contains plenty of helpful advice on how to improve service quality. Good service companies empower their middle managers, the book argues, by giving them considerable independence, albeit within varying limits. Banks need to act likewise: to strike the right balance between empowered people who can make decisions on their own, and well-designed systems to which managers and other staff are programmed. Most banks still err excessively towards over-programming - to systems which are not even particularly well-designed. They do so at the expense not only of managerial morale but also of customer service and loyalty. * Published by Century Business in Sunday Times Business Skills series, Pounds 20. ** Published in Financial Times/Pitman series of Books for Business, Pounds 30.</p>

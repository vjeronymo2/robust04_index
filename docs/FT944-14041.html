			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth takes John Swire to Pounds 299m John Swire, owner of Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 299m on turnover of Pounds 2.11bn for the six months to June 30. The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 234m on turnover of Pounds 1.9bn last time. The bulk of the group's profits came from Swire Pacific, its listed, partly-owned subsidiary undertaking in Hong Kong. Trading profits of the wholly-owned businesses were slightly lower but there was a surplus on the 1994 disposal of an office property in Japan. Cathay Pacific experienced modest growth in profits, despite pressure on margins and higher net charges following a fall in returns from funds under management. The Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company turned in only a marginal increase. The property and industries divisions showed good growth and the insurance arm showed a slight improvement. Business at the Taiwan motor vehicle distribution arm was buoyant. Marine services had good results from container terminal and dockyard operations in Hong Kong. John Swire has requested that the London Stock Exchange cancel the listing of its 6.3 per cent cumulative preference shares as from December 30. It also intends to seek shareholder approval to amend its articles of association and for authority to purchase its preference shares. The company's ordinary shares are unlisted.</p>

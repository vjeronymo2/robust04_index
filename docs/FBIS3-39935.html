			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["R.O./DPA" report: "IG-Metall: Toughest Strike in 10 </F> Years"]    [Text] Hannover -- The west German metal industry is  facing a strike, the likes of which the republic has not  experienced in at least 10 years.    This was announced by Klaus Zwickel, chairman of the  IG-Metall trade union, in the event that "the employers do not  finally give up their demand for a wage suspension and abolition  of the vacation bonus."    The strike vote, scheduled for the first week of March, will  result in at least 75 percent of IG-Metall members voting for a  strike, Zwickel said, speaking to 3,500 members of his trade  union at an action day of the IG-Metall district of Lower Saxony  in Hannover. More than 1 million metal workers have proved  their readiness for strike by staging warning strikes over the  past two weeks. The IG-Metall chairman said the employers' plan  to abolish the vacation bonus, along with a wage suspension, is  "not only socially unacceptable but also economically  irresponsible." The trade union does not want a strike, but it  is necessary so that it can continue to represent the working  people's interests.    On Saturday [19 February], the employers of the west German  metal and electrical industry warned IG-Metall against a  "phantom strike." "One cannot gain employment security through  strikes," Dieter Kirchner, the main manager of the Gesamtmetall  employers' association, told WELT AM SONNTAG. The trade union  wants to ensure employment through shorter working hours.  However, working hours are regulated by uncanceled wage  contracts. "Therefore, a change in working hours cannot be  achieved through strikes," Kirchner stressed.    IG-Metall can hold a legally permitted strike only for the  canceled wage contracts on wages or the vacation bonus. These,  however, are precisely the topics of a "small solution" that the  employers have suggested. But IG-Metall does not want that,  because this would not cover employment security. However,  employment security can be achieved only through negotiations.  Therefore, a strike would not be just an economic disaster. It  must also "end in a disaster for IG-Metall, because it leads the  striking people into battle for the wrong goals," Kirchner said.  Kirchner does not believe that negotiations will still be held  on a peaceful settlement of the wage conflict.    In an interview with BILD AM SONNTAG Zwickel said a strike  could still be prevented "if the employers' association makes a  concrete offer for negotiations worthy of discussion."  IG-Metall must pay 41 million marks for 100,000 striking people  per week. "If we are forced to do so, we can hold out for  weeks."    Tomorrow IG-Metall leaders will decide on motions of the 14  wage districts concerning a failure of the current negotiations  and the holding of strike votes. A strike in the west German  metal and electrical industry, which has 3.6 million working  people, could begin in March. The last big strike in the west  German metal industry took place 10 years ago for the gradual  introduction of the 35-hour work week.    In his speech in Hannover, Juergen Peters, Lower Saxony's  IG-Metall district chairman, threatened employers that the metal  workers' patience has reached its limit. According to him, the  wage contract is not "the nation's piggy-bank." Lower Saxony's  Minister President Gerhard Schroeder (Social Democratic Party of  Germany) appealed to the employers' reason: "Do not force  IG-Metall to strike; this is something our economy does not  need." The Social Democratic politician expressed the hope that  a strike can still be avoided through reason.</p>

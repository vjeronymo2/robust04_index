			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Apr (NA) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina stressed this afternoon that the debt his  country has not yet settled with Argentina "is not an issue that  has been frozen." In this regard, he expressed his government's  willingness to seek alternative repayment methods.    The diplomat, who is paying a 48-hour official visit to  Argentina, also denied negotiations for a meeting between  President Carlos Menem and Cuban leader Fidel Castro during an  upcoming Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias.    In remarks made in the Senate, Robaina added: "The  possibilities are always open. It depends on the activities  each one of them has during the summit. My visit's goal,  however, is not to prepare a meeting. Thus far, there is  nothing on this issue."</p>

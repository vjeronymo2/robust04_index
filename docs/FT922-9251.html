			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Banks offered 20% of O&amp;Y in loan deal OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the troubled property developer, yesterday asked its bankers for a five-year freeze on repaying almost Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.7bn) of debt and a suspension of cash interest payments on Dollars 4bn of this. In return the banks were offered a 20 per cent stake in the company in an effort to prevent its collapse. Bankers suggested last night that agreement on the world's biggest restructuring plan would be difficult to reach. The rescue plan put forward by the world's largest property developer involved asking its 15 biggest bank creditors to defer principal payments for five years on its worldwide debt. O&amp;Y also wants Pounds 300m to complete the existing phases of Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest new office development, The O&amp;Y negotiating team, led by the company's founder, Mr Paul Reichmann, told the banks that work on later phases of Canary Wharf, in east London, was likely to be delayed for at least five years. Mr Jerry Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, admitted agreement from the banks would not come quickly or easily. Nonetheless, O&amp;Y's founders, the secretive Reichmann brothers, believe they are making a big sacrifice by offering outsiders a stake in their business for the first time in its 35-year history. At meetings yesterday there were 70 people from the 15 largest bank creditors, including representatives of O&amp;Y's three biggest lenders, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, Citicorp of the US, and Canadian Imperial Banking Corporation. Other banks represented were Barclays of the UK, Credit Lyonnais of France, Commerzbank of Germany and Royal Bank of Canada. The initial session of the bank meeting, held in the boardroom at the top of the Canary Wharf tower, the UK's tallest building, lasted from 3pm to 5.30pm and then continued into the evening. Mr Steve Miller, O&amp;Y's chief bank negotiator and a partner in James D. Wolfensohn Inc, presented a five-year business plan. The key elements were: The principal on most of O&amp;Y's Dollars 12bn of debt will not be paid for at least five years, to allow for recovery in property values. It will then be paid off over the following five years. The company hopes to be able to pay cash interest on around Dollars 8bn of debt. On Dollars 4bn lent to or guaranteed by the parent company, cash interest is unlikely to be paid. Instead, banks will receive non-voting equity shares of O&amp;Y up to a maximum value of 20 per cent of the company. O&amp;Y is seeking Pounds 300m of additional bank finance to complete existing phases of Canary Wharf. O&amp;Y is also asking permission of its Canadian banks to draw Dollars 130m of a Dollars 240m facility, which is in default. O&amp;Y is still waiting to hear from the 11 existing lenders to the Canary Wharf project whether they are prepared to provide a Pounds 30m loan to keep the project going for the next month, while the talks on the long-term restructuring continue. As an incentive to Canary Wharf lenders to participate in the long-term restructuring, the 11 providers of the core Pounds 500m Canary Wharf loan are being offered an equity stake of up to 30 per cent in the initial phases of the Docklands development. Mr Miller said: 'We have tried to achieve fairness for all lenders.' He said the Reichmanns would have the right to buy back the O&amp;Y shares over the next seven years. But after that the banks would keep the shares and could insist that the company obtains a public listing.</p>

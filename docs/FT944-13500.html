			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Woolwich takes own path by lifting life unit stake to 90%: Changes in the insurance market Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third largest, has moved to take decisive control of its joint venture life insurance subsidiary, of which Sun Alliance was the other shareholder. At the first opportunity for review of the arrangements for the company, Woolwich has increased its stake from 51 per cent to 90 per cent. The current arrangements are also likely to be reviewed at some point. The move is part of the unravelling of links between life companies and building societies, as societies want to take fuller advantage of the powerful distribution opportunities in selling to their large numbers of customers and making use of their extensive branch networks. Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, and Nationwide Building Society, the second largest, have already announced plans to set up their own wholly-owned life subsidiaries, ending the arrangements by which they sold policies only of Standard Life and Guardian Royal Exchange respectively. Of the ten largest societies, only Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest, and Northern Rock, the tenth largest, are still in 'tied' relationships with life companies without having announced plans to end them. Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, said the society felt the broadly equal shares in the subsidiary did not now properly reflect the importance of the distribution capability. The move will give Woolwich greater freedom and flexibility in deciding what new areas of life insurance it might want to develop. The disadvantage of getting income just from selling life insurance policies rather than from creating them as well is likely to be exacerbated next year when a new regulatory regime will require customers to be told the costs of selling life products. This is expected to put pressure on commission levels. Woolwich Life was set up in October 1990 with share capital of Pounds 30m. Sun Alliance has been paid about Pounds 25m for its stake and still has the contract to carry out administration for the company. Sun Alliance said the original arrangement had been a a successful enterprise, and had produced investment returns of more than 20 per cent a year to the shareholders. The 10 per cent stake it retained remained a good investment, it said. In 1993, Woolwich Life won Pounds 16.3m new regular premium business, and Pounds 54.2m single premium business. It had 86,000 policies in force at the end of the year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The possible delay of regional voting in the  violence-riddled kwaZulu region could be on the agenda when  President de Klerk meets with Mr. Nelson Mandela, Dr. Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, and King Goodwill Zwelithini on Friday. SAPA reports  that a government spokesman said all possibilities would be  considered in view of the importance of the millions of Zulus in  the region being involved in the post-electoral decision-making  process. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus rejected the possibility,  saying there would be no distinction between regional and  national elections.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Swiss row with Paris deepens on Iranians The Swiss government has stepped up the pressure on France over its expulsion of two Iranian murder suspects, demanding an explanation of why Paris sent the two home rather than comply with Switzerland's request for their extradition. writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. French leaders have said only that the move, which violates European conventions on extradition and the prevention of terrorism, was 'related to the national interest'. Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, has already given a dusty response to a US state department request for an explanation. 'I have no explanation to give the Americans. I am not an employee of Mr Clinton,' Mr Pasqua said on French radio. The two Iranians, Moshen Sharif Esfanhi and Ahmed Taheri, were arrested in France in 1992 at the request of the Swiss authorities in connection with the murder of Kazem Radjavi, the brother of a Mujahideen leader, in a Geneva suburb in April 1990.</p>

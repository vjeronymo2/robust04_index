			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Rothschild Bank moves to bolster equity base MEASURES have been taken to bolster the shrunken equity base of Rothschild Bank, the Zurich affiliate of NM Rothschild &amp; Sons in London. A source close to the bank would not reveal details of the operation, but said the bank's total capital, after write-downs, was now in excess of the SFr197m (Dollars 158.8m) shown in a June 30 balance sheet. Last month, the bank revealed that a recent credit review had found that some loans were not fully covered and so it quadrupled its provisions in the year to March 31 1992 to SFr99.8m and dissolved its SFr63.5m in hidden reserves. Since then, a former senior executive has been arrested in connection with his activities at the bank, and it was confirmed earlier this week that the bad loan total was higher than that indicated in July. Among the bank's known bad loans were those to the troubled York-Hannover property group, whose Coutinho Caro subsidiary in Germany filed for bankruptcy last week. The York-Hannover loans also exceeded the Swiss Banking Commission's regulations limiting the amount a bank can lend to a single client. The source said the bank planned to make a full statement on its affairs around September 7, after the current restructuring was approved by the Swiss Banking Commission. Rothschild Bank is controlled by the family interests of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of NM Rothschild. Rothschilds Continuation Holdings, a Swiss company, owns 51 per cent of Rothschild Bank. The ultimate group holding company of Rothschild Continuation is Rothschild Concordia, a Swiss vehicle of Sir Evelyn's family. However, Sir Evelyn's cousin, Lord Rothschild, does not have an interest in the Swiss bank, nor does his insurance business, J Rothschild Assurance.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Bush seizes on apparent growth as good news PRESIDENT George Bush claimed yesterday that the US economy was now outperforming the rest of the industrialised world, Governor Bill Clinton argued that the third-quarter improvement in national output could not disguise a long-term downward trend, and Mr Ross Perot was preparing to give a speech in Denver when he was expected, but not guaranteed, to concentrate on the need for economic reform. Mr Bush also claimed, in Ohio, that the Democrats 'can feel it (the presidential election next week) slipping away' now that the economic news was more encouraging. Last night, the latest tracking poll from CNN/USA Today gave some substance to this, finding that the gap had shrunk to just two points, with Mr Clinton on 40 per cent, Mr Bush 38 per cent and Mr Perot 16 per cent. But another tracking poll, from ABC News, reported last night that Mr Clinton still had a seven-point lead, unchanged in the last 24 hours. Mr Stan Greenberg, Mr Clinton's pollster, said he gave his man a seven to nine-point lead. A compilation of state polls by the Hotline newsletter had Mr Clinton ahead in 39 states with 413 electoral college votes, and Mr Bush up in 11 with 93, one state (Texas) being tied. In 26 of these, with 296 electors, Mr Clinton's lead was outside the usual polling margin of error, whereas the president had such an edge in only two states with 10 college votes. But the Bush campaign said late yesterday its polls had their man leading in 14 or 15 states, with 140-plus votes, another 15 states being very competitive. A total of 270 votes is needed for election. Mr Bush and Mr Clinton appeared simultaneously on different breakfast TV shows yesterday to give their very different views about the single, main issue to confront the US electorate next Tuesday. They both spoke before the mixed economic news was announced in Washington that last month durable goods order had fallen and personal income and spending had gone up. 'It is inarguable,' Mr Bush said, 'that we are not in a recession' - contrary to popular perception. 'Our economy is doing better than the world economy,' he insisted. 'We have six (successive) quarters of growth, we have unemployment going down, we have interest down, inflation down. 'A guy who's out of work' might think the US was still in recession, 'but 93 per cent are working.' The US being poised for a big recovery, it would be wrong to follow the Democratic 'tax-and-spend philosophy that brought us into a terrible recession.' Mr Clinton's simultaneous response was much more analytical. The larger than expected third-quarter growth, while 'good news,' was typical 'of the ups and downs in the economy over the last ten years,' and could not disguise the overall failure of 'trickle-down economics.' He noted that 20 per cent of the expansion was accounted for by arms sales, announced by Mr Bush 'in an election flurry' in September. Another 25 per cent came from people's savings as they made necessary purchases at this time of year for such as school uniforms. 'People can't deplete their savings by 20 per cent a month,' Mr Clinton asserted. The third element in the GNP improvement, which he said should be 'seriously questioned,' was that the statistics included an estimate for foreign trade in September - 'and most people don't think our trade performance in September will be that good.' In summation, Mr Clinton said 'you can't evaluate anybody based on three months' performance, when you know more than half of it is based on one-time developments.' More relevant were the long-term trends - 'declining incomes, more and more part-time employment, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, other countries growing more rapidly than we are.'</p>

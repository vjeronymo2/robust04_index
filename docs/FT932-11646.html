			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Escaping the mortgage trap A MONTH ago, Sara and Howard Fagelman moved into a familiar house. It was the same three-bedroom, semi-detached in Leeds which they had had to leave two years ago when they fell into Pounds 10,000 arrears on their joint mortgage after the liquidation of his business. 'The debt got to the point where we did not have any money to spend at all,' said Fagelman this week. But they were lucky in their mortgage lender. The Bradford &amp; Bingley is unusual in having a large mortgage-to-rent scheme, allowing those in arrears to become tenants instead. This week saw further evidence that the worst of the crisis in mortgage repossessions, caused by the rise in interest rates and fall in house prices at the turn of the decade, is easing. The government announced a 24 per cent fall in the number of repossession actions starting in the first quarter. The fall in base rates over the past six months has been the prime cause of the easing. Yet, there also is evidence that government initiatives, which have had teething difficulties since they were announced 18 months ago, have started to become effective. The mortgage-to-rent scheme which has helped the Fagelmans is a case in point. It was at the heart of the initiative announced by the government at the end of 1991, and suggested how lenders and housing associations might work together so that borrowers could become tenants. The idea was that associations would borrow from lenders to buy properties on which there were arrears. Those in arrears would then convert the debt into a loan on which there would be an interest 'holiday'; at the same time, they would pay a lower rent to the association to remain in their home. This has happened to the Fagelmans. Their home has been bought by a mutual housing association set up by Bradford &amp; Bingley and English Churches Housing, one of the largest associations. ECH is paid management fees to repair and manage properties. The Fagelmans now pay Pounds 220 a month in rent compared with the Pounds 900 they were paying on their Pounds 57,000 mortgage. They also pay Pounds 10 a month on their arrears loan. 'It has been a humiliating experience, but we have bounced back and it has made our relationship stronger,' says Mrs Fagelman. The terms of the scheme have been more attractive than some others established by lenders because the fully mutual vehicle can claim mortgage interest tax relief. Bradford &amp; Bingley has transferred the debt of 160 borrowers so far, and is planning to raise the number to about 500 a year from now. The society believes that others which had difficulty setting up acceptable terms with housing associations for mortgage-to-rent schemes  - the reason for early doubts about its viability - may not have adopted the right structure. It says it has had two inquiries from other top 10 societies. The scheme has also managed to establish workable new terms for tenants, with most rents falling between Pounds 41 and Pounds 50 a week. Colin Sherrift, ECH's housing director, says that thousands of households could benefit if more of the 90 societies and 2,000 associations adopted similar schemes.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK may build Eurofighter on its own BRITAIN WOULD consider producing the European Fighter Aircraft on its own if Germany, Spain and Italy quit the project, Mr Jonathan Aitken, the defence procurement minister, said yesterday. His statement is the first firm indication from the government that it is prepared to contemplate a solo programme. Mr Aitken said Britain would first need to study the cost implications and warned that a one-nation EFA would probably be more expensive. However, it was wrong to assume that the UK Treasury would necessarily take a negative or hostile view, he said. He expected the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Employment to maintain strong backing for the project. The Ministry of Defence did not accept the argument that a less capable aircraft might suffice. Mr Aitken said he remained 'reasonably, cautiously optimistic' there would still be some collaboration on the programme even if Germany stuck to its decision not to stay with the project into the production phase. Neither Spain nor Italy had ruled out trinational production, he said. 'It is simply that they are endeavouring to find a basis on which Germany might remain in the programme,' he added. Defence ministers from the four countries are due to decide the project's future at a meeting in late November following the completion of studies into cost reductions and a review of military requirements. The confidential quotation that industrial partners submitted in April for EFA's production phase was much higher than expected, Mr Aitken said. He added: 'We simply have to get the costs back into line.' Speaking at a defence industry conference in London organised by Westminster and City Programmes, he warned that any delays in the timetable would increase production costs. The alternative, lighter aircraft proposed by Germany would be cheaper to make, but would involve repeating much of the Pounds 5bn worth of development work done on EFA. 'The eventual cost could well turn out to be higher, and entry into service certainly later,' Mr Aitken said. If Britain were left alone in the EFA project, he said, savings could be made by rationalising facilities, and the cost per aircraft might not be greatly increased. Mr Aitken's comments followed notification from Germany reserving its right to withdraw from development work on the EFA as early as next February.</p>

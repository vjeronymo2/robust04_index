			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Dzhordzheva: "FRY Envoy Describes </F> Embargo as Genocide"]    [Text] According to FRY Ambassador Dr. Rados Smilkovic, the  Bulgarians in Yugoslavia do not want to be isolated in a ghetto.  He said this during a visit to Burgas, in answer to a question  from a KONTINENT journalist about violations of the human rights  of the Bulgarian minority in the FRY. Dr. Smilkovic declared  that the Bulgarian minority even enjoys certain privileges as a  Slavonic minority. He added that the Bulgarians there were  enduring the same difficulties as the Serbs and that the facts  reported in the press were false. He was surprised that even  when describing the Los Angeles earthquake, Bulgarian  journalists find it necessary to throw in a few profanities  about the Serbs. According to Smilkovic, now, when Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] has been  removed as a motive for conflict, the press is looking for a new  apple of discord. This was unjustified, because the FRY  leadership hopes that the border that separates us will become  one that links us together.    Dr. Smilkovic said that only the FRY and its neighbors were  suffering from the embargo, and he described the blockade as  genocide. Despite everything, the ambassador does not blame  Bulgaria for observing the embargo, and he pointed out that  incidents such as the "Khan Kubrat" case should not be used as a  pretext for worsening relations.</p>

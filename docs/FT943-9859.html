			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Shake-up for UK underwriters after Lords ruling - Legal Briefs UK insurance law permitting underwriters to reject claims because of misrepresentation or non-disclosure has been substantially altered following a House of Lords judgment. In Pine Top v Pan Atlantic, the Lords upheld the right of reinsurer Pine Top to refuse claims made in 1982 because of Pan Atlantic's claims history prior to then. However, the Lords ruled that insured parties can defeat underwriters' right to refuse claims on the grounds of non-disclosure or misrepresentation if they can prove that had the underwriter known the full facts at the time, they would still have taken on the business on the same terms. The ruling will have serious consequences for underwriters, say insurance lawyers. Mr Robert Viney of Davies Arnold Cooper, a London law firm, said underwriters may have to testify as to what induced them to write a particular risk and be cross-examined about their underwriting practices. Insured parties are also likely to make sweeping requests for disclosure of underwriting files in an attempt to prove their cases, he said.</p>

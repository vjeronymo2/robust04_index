			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 16 (BTA) -- The international community  and the World Bank are impressed by the Bulgarian Government's  efforts to reduce the budget deficit and stabilize the national  economy, said Michael Wiehen, World Bank regional director for  Europe and Central Asia, at a press conference today. Michael  Wiehen is heading a World Bank delegation to this country.  According to him, the government is close to signing a deal  with Bulgaria's London Club creditors and the World Bank is  ready to support this deal.    Support will be rendered parallel with the International  Monetary Fund and will find expression in a special loan which  the World Bank will extend to Bulgaria this summer. Michael  Wiehen declined to specify the exact size of the loan but said  it would be a considerable sum. It will depend on the final  balance of the separate instruments chosen by the creditor banks  and on their final deal with Bulgaria. The loan will be granted  for a period of 17 years with a four-year grace period.    The assistance rendered by the World Bank to Bulgaria is  aimed above all at stepping up economic growth, Michael Wiehen  said. He projected that this year the Bulgarian economy will  probably mark zero growth but, according to World Bank experts,  next year's growth will be positive. The only exception may be  agriculture, which under favourable meteorological conditions  may register positive growth already this year.    The World Bank is closely following privatization in  Bulgaria  as decisive for this country's transition to market economy.  Special attention should be paid to bank privatization and  strengthening the supervision of the commercial banks by the  central bank, Michael Wiehen said. According to John Wilton,  World Bank resident representative in Bulgaria, at present the  central bank has small potentials for exercising such control.  Some legislative changes are necessary in order to strengthen  it. John Wilton described the state of the banking system as a  whole as not very good, which is due to the interdependence  between the banks and state-owned enterprises and their "bad  debts." According to John Wilton, some of the banks in this  country may be privatized in the following 12 months.</p>

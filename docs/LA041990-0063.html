			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: IN 'STRANGE LOVE,' T.S.O.L. BLENDS GRIT, VERSATILITY;  </P> <P> RECORDINGS FROM FELLOW O.C.-BASED PERFORMERS -- COUNTRY SINGER JANN BROWNE AND  SYNTH-POP ANYTHING BOX -- OFFER PLENTY OF VARIETY.  </P> <P> Performers from the Orange County pop scene continue to churn out recordings at  a furious pace, making 1990 an exceptional year for quantity, quality and  stylistic breadth. Those reviewed below are rated on a scale from * (poor) to  ***** (a classic).  </P> <P> ***  </P> <P> T.S.O.L.  </P> <P> "Strange Love" (Enigma)  </P> <P> With the recent departure of founding bassist Mike Roche, T.S.O.L. lost the  last strand connecting the band to its origins a decade ago as a Huntington  Beach punk group. Musically, though, that connection had ended with the 1987  album, "Hit and Run," which veered away from punk and deeply into heavy metal.  A sell-out? Die-hard punkers may say so. But if "Strange Love" is an obvious  bid for mass-appeal commercial success, it is a bid made with honor intact.  </P> <P> At its worst, heavy metal offers escapist fantasies of power, rebellion and  easy, emotion-free sex. The strong point of "Strange Love" is the way in which  it baits pop-metal hooks as enticing as Def Leppard's or Bon Jovi's, while  still maintaining sonic grit and impact and a fatalistic outlook that is by no  means escapist. The protagonists of T.S.O.L.'s songs aren't sexual studs and  hard-rockin' heroes, but, in most cases, victims trying to shake off emotional  blows -- if they haven't already been brought down by something more final,  like a policeman's bullet or a drug overdose. In that respect, T.S.O.L. still  has a streak of punk-rock realism running through its work.  </P> <P> The songs, though, are painted on metal's epic canvas. That leads to broad  statements and big gestures that don't allow much room for lyrical subtlety --  and singer Joe Wood won't ever be mistaken for a crafty wordsmith. But if the  idea on a number of songs is no more complex than  life-is-tough-and-you've-got-to-have-guts-to-survive, at least that's a point  worth making.  </P> <P> The best songs are "Let Me Go," a ballad that recasts the old "Streets of  Laredo" cowboy death-rattle scenario, and "Candy," where T.S.O.L. gets low-down  and bluesy in a humorous tale about a drug moll on the lam who always seems to  get the drop on the song's luckless pursuer.  </P> <P> Versatility is one of the album's assets, as T.S.O.L. ranges from the raunchy  blues of "Candy" to the impressive head-banging momentum of "Blow by Blow," to  the sorrowful grandeur of "Angel" and the stormy, elegiac sweep of "In the  Wind." Wood's singing remains as raw and grainy as ever, but his voice has more  range and flexibility than in the past. Lead guitarist Marshall Rohner's  performance is for the most part a model of conciseness, high impact and  disdain for the noisy, note-spattering excess of metal-guitar convention  (Rohner, like Roche, is no longer in the band, which now has bassist Dave Mello  and guitarist Scott Phillips playing alongside Wood and drummer Mitch Dean).  </P> <P> T.S.O.L.'s punk past may be gone, but "Strange Love" is a strong bid from a  band whose realism and no-frills gumption stand as a healthy example in its new  field.  </P> <P> ** 1/2  </P> <P> JANN BROWNE  </P> <P> "Tell Me Why" (Curb)  </P> <P> This Orange County veteran's first album offers almost everything you could ask  from a country music new traditionalist. The only thing missing is what the  neo-traditionalist movement needs most if it is to keep (by now, regain might  be a more appropriate verb) its vigor: a willingness to break from tradition  with bold, imaginative sallies.  </P> <P> Browne's album showcases a voice full of classic sweetness and assured, throaty  twang (from the sound of it, Emmylou Harris is a big influence). She can ache  on a lovelorn ballad, or rock a little when the action moves to the honky tonk.  And if you can judge a performer by the company she keeps, Browne comes with  the seal of approval. Harris harmonizes on the south-of-the-border lament,  "Mexican Wind," New Grass Revival provides the backup on the plaintive  bluegrass tune, "Lovebird," and elsewhere Browne's ace picking staff includes  such players as Albert Lee, Byron Berline and the Desert Rose Band's John  Jorgenson and Bill Bryson.  </P> <P> It all adds up to an album full of impeccable performances. But, putting aside  the simple appeal of good singin' and good playin,' all that impeccable talent  is serving songs that too often fall into familiar ruts. Numbers like  "Louisville" (one of three tunes that Browne co-wrote) and "Losing You" do  little to make country's oldest subject -- heartbreak -- sound fresh again.  "Louisville" starts with a good premise -- woman travels to a rendezvous point  in the middle of the country and waits six weeks, only to be jilted by her  lover -- but Browne fails to build the song emotionally. It canters along as a  simple, bittersweet lament when the situation cries out for an angry outburst.  Most of the songs suffer from this one-note emotional tone, as Browne fails to  explore the complexities of feeling that romantic crises surely bring.  </P> <P> Browne does show some welcome sass on "You Ain't Down Home," by the O'Kanes'  Jamie O'Hara. The cool, contemptuous edge in her voice as she laces into a  trendy materialist devoted to gold cards, Jacuzzis and high-tech telephones is  sharp enough to cow Donald Trump himself. The other highlight is "Lovebird," a  sweet, sad bluegrass ballad that works on sheer loveliness.  </P> <P> "Tell Me Why" shows that Browne has major league ability. Next time out, she  needs to set herself apart from the crowd of country performers who offer lots  of ability, but not enough individuality and imagination.  </P> <P> **  </P> <P> ANYTHING BOX  </P> <P> "Peace" (Epic)  </P> <P> Originally from New Jersey, this synth-pop trio moved to La Habra last year to  work under producer Jon St. James. Its debut album follows the basic pattern of  such British techno-pop success stories as Depeche Mode, but with one atypical  wrinkle: Instead of offering dark, brooding, ironic commentaries about how  futile and corrupt the world is, Anything Box offers sweetly melancholy  meditations on the sad state of life and love.  </P> <P> Melody is the group's strong suit. "Living in Oblivion" and "Kiss of Love"  feature insinuating refrains carried along by singer Claude S.'s fragile tenor.  Songs are put together like Lego houses, out of discreet bits of linked melodic  material. But the process becomes formulaic after a while: mechanical beats  overlaid with soft keyboard gauze and a puff of vocal melody. The moods and  methods repeat from song to song. Reinforcing this sameness is a reliance on  repetition within individual songs, most of which go on too long without  development or progression.  </P> <P> Claude tends to drift in hazy reverie, mourning romantic disappointments and  worldly conflicts while holding fast to his ideals. Occasionally he tries to  switch from choirboy sweetness to a huskier lower range. But when he does, his  voice isn't full-bodied enough to sound anything but forced. Instead of adding  body and contrast to the sound, backing singer Dania Morales mirrors Claude's  fragility.  </P> <P> Anything Box succeeds best on songs that hint at a story line and a conflict.  "Our Dreams" works nicely by setting Claude's plaintive vocal against an  ominous beat -- a combination that follows the lyric's juxtaposition of  innocent hopes against crushing realities. "Carmen" is another tale about an  innocent wronged, and "Just One Day" at least gives some direction to Claude's  romantic mooning, tracing his emotional state as it evolves over the course of  a day.  </P> <P> When the songs take a coherent shape, Anything Box holds some weight. Mostly,  the music floats away on a pretty but diffuse cloud of melancholy.  </P> <P> HIGHER GROUND: Fullerton dance-pop singer Stacey Q has been studying Buddhism  in Nepal for the past few months, raising questions about future career moves  and, more immediately, about her safety in a Himalayan country racked recently  by political turmoil. Earlier this month, a massive pro-democracy demonstration  in the capital of Katmandu met with a violent government response before the  nation's king relented and agreed to implement reforms.  </P> <P> "We've been really worried, but her mother said she called and said, 'Don't  worry, everything's OK,' " Stacey Q's manager, Jon St. James, said Tuesday.  "She was supposed to start a month ago on a new record for Atlantic. A week ago  we got (a card): "Coming back in two weeks."  </P> <P> St. James says he isn't sure whether the singer (whose real name is Stacey  Swain) is going to want to return to the lightly romantic mold of her three  previous albums.  </P> <P> "I don't know what to expect," he said. "I don't think she's going to be in a  frame of mind to work on a dance record."  </P> <P> NEW LEATHER CHAPS: Leatherwolf, the Fountain Valley-based heavy metal band that  recorded two albums for Island Records, has gone through some career  reshuffling, personnel switches, and stylistic revamping over the past few  months. Singer Mike Olivieri said Tuesday that he and guitarists Geoff Gayer  and Carey Howe remain together from the original lineup, but the bass and drums  team of Pat Guyton and Marco Forcone is new. Olivieri said that the band lost  its recording deal after Island was bought out by PolyGram Records -- a move he  said Leatherwolf took willingly, since the band felt Island hadn't given its  releases enough of a promotional push.  </P> <P> Now Leatherwolf is seeking a new record deal, with a new musical direction  after two albums of gothic heavy metal full of complex guitar harmonies: "It's  way more straight rock 'n' roll," Olivieri said. "I hate to jump on the Guns N'  Roses bandwagon, but it's more in that vein."  </P> <P> Leatherwolf also is contemplating a name change, but the band hasn't thought up  anything permanent yet. When it plays Saturday night at the Marquee in  Westminster, it will be billed as Wasted Flesh, a joke name that Olivieri said  the members thought up just for the occasion.  </P> <P> FIDDLE ABOUT: Oklahoma-born bluegrass veterans Byron Berline and Alan Munde  will team up for duo performances Saturday night at 7 and 9:30 at the Shade  Tree in Laguna Niguel. Fiddler Berline, has performed with the Dillards, the  Flying Burrito Brothers and his own band, Sundance, as well as playing on  myriad sessions for the likes of Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones. Banjo player  Munde first teamed with Berline in the Country Gazette in 1972. The show is the  first in a spring series at the Shade Tree. On May 5, Tuxedo Cowboy, a local  group with an unusual country-classical blend, will share the bill with pop  songwriter George Lawton. Redmond O'Colonies sings humorous songs in the  British music hall style on May 18. Highly regarded mandolin player Evan  Marshall headlines June 2, with lute player David Rastall opening, and  classical guitarist Gregory Coleman performs on June 16.

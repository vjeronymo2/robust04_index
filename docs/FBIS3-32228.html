Based on statements made by several people, we surmise that  the population is angry because although economists close to the  administration say that the increase in the price of fuel is the  best way to collect funds for the treasury without having a  major effect on the increase in the price of other articles, the  theory does not work in practice because even before the  economic package was implemented, prices began to rise rapidly,  thus adversely affecting the prices of basic foods in several  cases.    The outlook at the marketplace was disheartening. Vegetable  prices doubled and sometimes tripled. The increase in the price  of gasoline, according to some experts, will also lead to an  increase in medical fees, medicines, education, plane tickets,  and other goods.</p>

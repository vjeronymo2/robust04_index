			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Babangida allies ousted in reshuffle A RESHUFFLE at the head of Nigeria's armed forces has strengthened the position of General Sani Abacha as defence minister and swept aside allies of former President Ibrahim Babangida as pressure builds on the interim government to settle the dispute with Mr Moshood Abiola, winner of the cancelled June elections. The army-backed interim government led by Mr Ernest Shonekan has begun to assert its independence from the Babangida regime and is still searching for a compromise between the plan to hold fresh elections in February and the demand by Mr Abiola and his supporters to uphold the result of the June polls. Gen Abacha has restructured the senior ranks of the armed forces, reversing appointments made by retired Gen Babangida just before leaving office. Babangida loyalists have been transferred to less powerful positions and vocal opponents of the extension of military rule have been promoted to more strategic posts. Brig-Gen Halilu Akilu is being transferred from head of internal security to director of army reserves, recruiting and resettlement. He will be replaced by Brig-Gen A Abdullahi, the present defence attache in London. Four of the key field commanders have been transferred to staff jobs. Lt-Gen Joshua Dogonyaro and Air Commodore Nsikak Nduak, who were appointed as chief of defence staff and chief of air staff respectively by Gen Babangida, have also been replaced. The new chief of defence is Lt-Gen Dapo Diya, a Yoruba who opposed the banning of Mr Abiola. Lt Gen Salihu Ibrahim, an opponent of the military clinging to power, has retired and been replaced by Lt Gen Aliyu Mohammed, formerly Gen Babangida's national security adviser. These changes will have done much to quell unrest in the middle and junior ranks of the armed forces over the appointments made by Gen Babangida in senior posts in the military and in the mainly civilian interim government. Gen Abacha has emerged from the turmoil of recent months with his stature enhanced. Although the only military member of the interim government and the only survivor of the cadre of officers who ousted civilians from power a decade ago, he is credited with forcing Gen Babangida to step aside. The majority of the armed forces voted for Mr Abiola in the June polls and the new posts may improve Mr Abiola's prospects of achieving his political aims. Mr Abiola claims the right to Nigeria's presidency but has been taking refuge in Europe for over a month.</p>

The Present State of Russia. A Brief  Description    The present state of Russia may be defined as general crisis  enveloping the main spheres of social life -- statehood and the  economy, politics and culture, everyday life and morality.    The "free" market has divided society. A tiny minority is  becoming fabulously rich out of plundering national wealth.  While the huge majority whose labor created that wealth is  reduced to poverty. The swift division is breeding a civil  split and social strife. Ruthless exploitation of working  people and the embezzlement of natural resources are taking  place in Russia. The people have been deprived of fundamental  socioeconomic and political rights. Economic crime has become  the basis for all other types of crime. The criminalization of  society is threatening personal and public safety. The class of  a new bourgeoisie, primarily a comprador bourgeoisie, is being  purposefully and swiftly formed through the destruction of the  social sphere and the Russian state.    Since the forcible elimination of the soviets in  September-October 1993 an authoritarian regime -- a regime of  personal presidential power -- has been established in Russia.  In effect what has been established is dictatorship by capital,  which is merging with the criminal world. The corrupt state  apparatus is serving the interests of mafia clans, which control  much of the country's economy. The people are debarred from  management and from monitoring state power.    The confrontation between the ruling regime and the huge  majority of the population is deepening with every passing day.  There is a ripening understanding among the masses that the  general crisis enveloping Russia is the consequence of the  breakdown of the socialist system and the deliberate destruction  of a unified and powerful state -- the USSR.    The Soviet Union was the victim of betrayal by the ruling  elite which had seized the leading posts in the CPSU and of the  actions of national-separatists, who aligned themselves with the  most aggressive forces of international capital, which is  seeking a new repartition of the world.    The perestroyka of socialism announced by the bureaucratic  CPSU elite turned out to be an adventure without precedent in  the history of manipulations of mass consciousness. The  so-called "new thinking" and demagoguery about "pan-human  values" eroded ideas about working people's genuine interests  and about the country's national, state interests. This was  aided by the "radical democrats," who secured the adoption of  declarations of the sovereignty of Russia and other republics  and ratification of the Belovezhskaya agreements, which ignore  the results of the referendum on preserving the USSR. The  destruction of the Soviet Union created a threat of the  disintegration of Russia, exacerbated national relations  everywhere, and resulted in fratricidal civil wars. A great  power was thrown onto the margins of world politics. It is  increasingly becoming a raw materials appendage, a market for  low-grade goods, and a source of cheap skilled manpower.    The crisis that has erupted in Russia is taking place in  conditions of a world crisis. The West is seeking to escape it  at the expense of our country. The weakening of Russia is to  the advantage of the strategists of the new world order.    The threat of economic, political, and spiritual enslavement  hangs over a great multinational community of people linked by a  common historical destiny.  <H5>  II. The Lessons of History and the Way Out of the Crisis </H5>   At the start of the 20th century the exacerbation of  inter-imperialist contradictions led to our country's  involvement in World War I contrary to its national-state  interests. The October Socialist Revolution extricated Russia  from that war.    Great October was a breakthrough to the future -- to  socialism. History demonstrated that the turn onto the path of  socialist development ensured the sovereignty of the working  people, the qualitative renewal of the centuries-old Russian  statehood, and the salvation of Russia as a great power.    After tremendous sacrifices caused by World War I and the  civil war, the party elaborated a program for stable development  -- it took the road of the New Economic Policy. The NEP  prevented a fresh outbreak of civil war and ensured the  necessary conditions for the next stages of state development:  electrification and industrialization of the national economy,  broad socialization of the means of production in city and  countryside, and cultural revolution.    This policy underwent serious changes as a result of the  external threat hanging over the USSR. The mobilization economy  and the swift development of education, science, and technology  enabled the country to create the necessary potential for  defense from military danger. This subsequently ensured  restoration of the war-ravaged economy within the shortest  possible time. Social ownership and the people's selfless,  heroic labor saved the country. Despite the distortions and the  violations of democracy and legality, the people's masses  retained and strengthened their belief in socialism.    At the same time the mobilization economy, which had  demonstrated its effectiveness during the war and the  restoration of the national economy, began to lag behind the  demands of the scientific and technical revolution that had  begun in the world. Without democratization and improvements in  the management system, without the use of flexible and adaptable  forms of economic activity, it became a brake on the development  of many spheres of social life.    Society needed new ideas and stimulation of the creative and  production activeness of individuals and labor collectives.  However, the reforms launched for these purposes did not produce  the expected result. Everything was stifled by the opposition  of the party bureaucracy, the unpreparedness of cadres, and the  inertia of mass consciousness.    Socialism's economic potential was not realized in  conditions  of the world technological and information revolution. The  pursuit of wealth by any means, careerism, corruption,  irresponsibility, and incompetence were not properly assessed in  society. Private capitalist tendencies emerged in society. The  exploited section of working people began to lose faith in the  justice of the existing system, which devalued socialist and  communist ideals in the eyes of millions. The crisis enveloping  Soviet society stemmed to a considerable extent from the crisis  in the CPSU, which had been the ruling party for many decades.  Its theoretical activity and methods of managing the economy  and the state as a whole were in particular need of renewal.    The "communist arrogance" of the leaders, who had come to  believe that their position was unshakable, plunged the CPSU  into the state of a "conceited party," which in turn  foreshadowed its defeat. The inequality between the party  "leadership" and the "grassroots" emerged increasingly clearly;  the careerists became increasingly deeply isolated from the  millions of Communists and from the working people. The CPSU  was transformed from a mass party into an apparatus party.    The upshot of this was primarily that the CPSU, assuming  responsibility for all spheres of social development, was unable  to find solutions to pressing problems. The gap between word  and deed, between program promises and the fulfillment of those  promises, became increasingly marked.    The errors and miscalculations made by the CPSU in the  process of socialist building were presented in a distorted form  by the mass media, which were in the hands of renegades and  pseudo-democrats.    The consciousness of the working people's masses was  thoroughly muddied by a powerful stream of denigration of Soviet  history. Along with ideological and psychological indoctrination  of the masses, a section of the working class was suborned for  use in the political struggle against the Communists and Soviet  power. As a result the majority of the working population  remained indifferent to the dramatic fate of the CPSU and the  soviets.    The so-called "Gorbachev perestroyka," which was ostensibly  aimed at renewing socialism, deepening democracy, and overcoming  the distortions and abuses, was in fact a deviation from  socialism. The equality of all forms of ownership was  proclaimed and the role of the most viable form -- social  ownership -- was undermined in every way, and the essence and  forms of the cooperative movement were distorted. This gave a  free hand to shady capital and other antisocialist and  antipeople forces opposed to the gains of October, Soviet power,  and the unified union state.    During this period the conditions were created for a  transition to a monopoly of private ownership and for the fusion  of the new bourgeoisie and corrupt functionaries. Yeltsin's  "reforms," the liberalization of prices, and the predatory  privatization struck a crushing blow to the country's economy  and caused chaos and disarray, total impoverishment of the  people, and a slide by society toward national catastrophe. The  political formalization of these actions was the August events  of 1991, October 1993, and the finagling through of a  constitution of private ownership and presidential autocracy via  a referendum supported by a minority of voters.    The country can and must emerge from the crisis. How can  this be done? This is impossible, first, without stopping the  capitalization and colonization of the country, and, second,  without turning toward socialism. The CPRF [Communist Party of  the Russian Federation] sees three political stages in  consistently resolving these tasks: a general democratic stage,  people's power; the transition to socialism along with the  restoration of the power of the soviets, working people's power;  socialist development proper.    During the first stage Communists in alliance with the  progressive patriotic movement seek the formation of a  government of the people's trust. This is called upon to  eliminate the catastrophic consequences of the "reforms" and to  stop the slump in production. Here it is necessary to return to  the population the illegally appropriated (privatized) property  and to involve working people in control over production and the  distribution of national wealth. During this stage the mixed  economy foisted on society is retained. The government and  representative organs of power ensure security and the country's  independence from the colonial policy of the makers of the "new  world order" and promote integration processes among the former  USSR republics.    During the second stage, after relative stability has been  attained, working people increasingly participate in the  management of the state via soviets, strike committees, and  other social organs of people's power brought forth by life. A  transition to transformations based on the dominance of the  socialist mode and the consistent economic elimination of  private ownership begins.    The third stage of social transformations is the development  of a socialist society on the basis of post-industrial and  information technologies while utilizing the best domestic and  world achievements of science and culture.    We see the new socialism as a society stimulating the  individual's creative activeness and working people's  self-management. At the same time the foundations are laid for  the future -- a communist association in which the free  development of each will be the condition of the free  development of all.  <H5>  III. The Minimum Program </H5>   During the first stage, proceeding from tactical aims, the  CPRF deems it necessary to implement a number of priority  measures and presents these in a minimum program.    Using vigorous activity in the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly and all accepted methods of extraparliamentary  struggle, the CPRF will seek:    In politics    -- the formation of a government of people's trust  accountable to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly;    -- nationwide discussion of a new constitution and its  adoption by a real majority of voters;    -- the adoption of a new electoral law;    -- the restoration of the Soviet form of people's power;    -- national accord on the basis of a renaissance of the  age-old friendship of the peoples;    -- the restoration of the union state by constitutional  means and on a voluntary basis, beginning with denunciation of  the Belovezhskaya agreements;    -- the implementation of an independent foreign policy  according with the country's national-state interests and its  security, even including the abrogation of international  treaties and agreements damaging Russia's interests and dignity.    In the economy    -- a change in economic course, the abandonment of "shock  therapy," and the implementation of measures of state regulation  with a view to ending the slump in production and combating  inflation and unemployment;    -- the reform of tax policy with a view to stimulating  investment in domestic production;    -- state regulation of the sale of military output on the  world market;    -- the elaboration of targeted programs of state support  for producers for specific sectors of the national economy  (primarily science-driven, high-technology production  facilities);    -- state support for highly productive and efficient farms  in the agro-industrial complex irrespective of their forms of  organization and ownership;    -- state investments in modern production facilities for  the processing of agricultural output;    -- the priority right of commodity producers (kolkhozes,  sovkhozes, joint-stock companies, farmers) to acquire  controlling blocks of shares during the flotation of enterprises  in the food and processing sectors of industry;    -- the establishment of control by the Russian Federation  Federal Assembly over the expenditure of money on major projects  in order to prevent departmentalism and parochialism in forming  the expenditure side of the state budget;    -- the elaboration of a state program to extricate the  country from the environmental crisis;    -- the creation of state, regional programs to ensure  employment; the definition of a package of measures to eliminate  unemployment.    In the social sphere    -- the restitution to Russia's citizens of guaranteed  socioeconomic rights: to labor, rest, housing, free education  and medical services, and a secure old age;    -- the formulation and signing by the supreme organs of  state power and the trade unions of an agreement on ensuring a  realistic subsistence minimum for working people;    -- guarantees of the preservation of working people's  property;    -- state support for the family, mothers, and children,  the restoration of the destroyed network of preschool and young  people's cultural, recuperative, and sports institutions,  support for the disabled and pensioners, and the introduction of  state grants for underprivileged families;    -- the priority safeguarding by the state of the  development of science, education, and culture at a higher  standard than that of advanced countries, as used to be the case  even during the difficult postwar years;    -- the creation of state-guaranteed normal conditions for  the life of servicemen and their families and the safeguarding  of dignified living conditions for retired servicemen, first and  foremost job availability;    -- the restoration of state centers for youth training and  employment.    In the protection of the people's personal and public  safety and spiritual health    The CPRF advocates the peaceful development of revolution  but  will not be indifferent to violence against the working people  or the flouting of human and civil rights. It has supported and  will support civil resistance and disobedience toward illegality  and tyranny, utilizing all forms of nonviolent resistance. It  will seek:    -- the restoration, through the mediums of public education  and enlightenment and the mass media, of the prestige of honest,  voluntary labor and a creative attitude to things in general, to  the traditions of community and Russian collectivism, and to the  Russian language and the culture of the peoples of Russia, which  are the basis and medium for spiritual inter-ethnic  communication and mutual enrichment;    -- an end to the policy of implanting westernism and  Americanism, historical vandalism, and the cult of profit,  violence, and depravity;    -- the prohibition of the propagation of ideological  revanchism and political vengeance;    -- an end to the denigration of Soviet history and the  memory and teaching of V.I. Lenin;    -- the suppression of crime and the toughening of punitive  measures against people engaged in the theft of property,  corruption, speculation, banditry, and the selling off of the  country's natural and intellectual resources;    -- the adoption of laws to intensify the struggle against  organized crime, to protect witnesses and judges, and to provide  social guarantees for law-enforcment agency staffers.  <H3>  IV. The CPRF Is a Party of State Patriotism and Social  Justice </H3>   The CPRF is a party of the working people. Its traces its  lineage through the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, the  Russian Social Democratic Workers Party (Bolsheviks), the  Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the All-Union Communist  Party (Bolsheviks), the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and  the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist  Republic. The CPRF takes on board everything of value from the  past experience of the Russian and world communist movement,  which is enabling it to take shape as a self-renewing party of  working people seeking to provide answers to the most acute  problems currently arising for society.    In the current specific historical conditions the CPRF  utilizes nonviolent methods for changing social life and opposes  developments which could lead to civil war. The fatherland will  be saved by an effective alliance of progressive state-patriotic  forces.    The CPRF expresses and defends the interests of hired labor,  the overwhelming majority of whom are industrial and  agricultural workers. The program being formulated by the party  is intended to become a document for working people to determine  the direction of their life so they can say, as during Lenin's  time: "Here we have our comrades, our brothers, here we have  our common cause."    The strengthening of the alliance of workers, peasants, and  the intelligentsia and the solidarity of working people of all  nationalities is not history but an insistent requirement of the  present day.    The working class will fulfill its historic mission if it is  aware of the vital need for society to emerge on the path of  socialist development. If it heads up a people-wide, nationwide  movement for Russia's independence and integrity and for the  restoration of the union state. It is the CPRF's duty to give  it every assistance here.    The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the destruction  of  the state and economic foundations of the Russian Federation  have led primarily to social vulnerability for working people.  The establishment in the country of the omnipotence of mafia  comprador capital, for whom the motherland is a commodity, has  also hit the interests of the small stratum of patriotically  minded private property owners and civil servants.    In present-day conditions the CPRF defines state patriotism  as the ideal of a Great Russia, the ideal of restoring a Soviet  union state and acquiring reliable allies beyond its borders.    The CPRF considers that the strengthening of the nationwide  patriotic ideal is only demonstrated when it is combined with  the socialist ideal.  <H3>  V. The CPRF Is a Party Advocating an Alliance of Communist  Parties and Unity of Action by All Communists </H3>   The CPRF is an independent party which has defined its path  to the future as the path of the nonviolent transition of  society to a socialist condition.    The CPRF considers that the communist parties active in the  former union republics are independent political organizations.  The CPRF advocates an equal and strong alliance among them and  regards this as an essential precondition for the restoration of  the union state.    The CPRF advocates cooperation among the communist parties  active in the Russian Federation on condition of their  recognition of the restoration of the union state on a voluntary  basis; the restoration of the Soviet state system; the  inadmissibility of political extremism in any form;  noninterference in intraparty affairs and inadmissibility of  abuse against one another; and unity of action in fulfilling the  commitments assumed by each side. The CPRF does not permit  double membership -- the presence in its ranks of members of  another party with its own program and statutes.    The CPRF is a party of creative Marxism and progressive  social thinking and advocates the constant exchange of ideas and  experience.    The CPRF sets the following as priority tasks for its  activity inside and outside the party:"    -- the organizational strengthening of the party, starting  with its foundation -- primary party organizations;    -- the ensuring of party discipline on the basis of  equality and moral relations among party members;    -- the giving of moral and material assistance to the  older generation of the CPRF -- CPSU veterans;    -- the expansion of the reserve of party activists and  activist party supporters;    -- participation in elections to organs of supreme and  local power and organs of local self-government;    -- maximum utilization of the party's factions in the  Federal Assembly and local organs of power and self-government  to protect the interests of hired labor;    -- the ensuring of a CPRF presence in all spheres of  social life;    -- the maximum utilization of legal forms of work in labor  collectives;    -- the conducting of actions in defense of rights to  support the just demands of labor collectives and all working  people;    -- the implementation of measures of social assistance to  deprived people;    -- the defense of civil and human rights when they are  violated in the Russian Federation and nearby and distant  foreign countries;    --the scientific and ethical protection of the  fatherland's history and its Soviet period;    -- participation in various forms of nationwide people's  patriotic movements for the restoration of the friendship of the  peoples and the union state.    The CPRF retains the red color of its banner and the symbol  of working people's unity -- the hammer and sickle.    The CPRF's slogan is: "Russia, labor, people's power,  socialism."    The theses were adopted as a basis at a CPRF Central  Executive Committee plenum on 15 March 1994. The text was  finalized taking account of proposals received from the  commission approved by the plenum with the following membership:  Comrades Belov, Zorkaltsev, Zyuganov, Kosolapov, Kuptsov,  Lukyanov, Melnikov, Osadchiy, Slavin, Tsiku, and Shabanov.</p>

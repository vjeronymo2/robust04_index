			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two equivalent standards, each of which is an equipment and design standard, are also proposed. The first equipment and design standard is the requirement that gas streams be routed to a combustion device (other than flares) designed and operated at a minimum temperature and residence time. For flares, an equipment standard with stated equipment and operating specifications is being proposed as the format because it is very difficult to measure emissions from a flare to determine its efficiency. These standards have been determined by the EPA to be equivalent to the emission standards and are proposed to provide maximum compliance flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Selection of Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section discusses the rationale for the selection of the standards for the SOCMI process unit wastewater source category. The selection of applicability levels, numerical limitations for the emission standards, and design parameters are included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicability Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of developing wastewater standards, the EPA has concluded that the effectiveness of the control technologies available to limit VOC emissions from wastewater does not vary. Controls are assumed to be either ``on'' or ``off,'' depending on whether a particular stream is identified as one that must be controlled. Therefore, the basic foundation of the proposed provisions for SOCMI process unit wastewater is to identify wastewater streams for control and treatment based on a specific criteria or action level at the point of wastewater generation, prior to dilution and air emissions losses. Control of a wastewater stream is triggered if it is determined that the stream exceeds the action level established by the standard. With this approach, the primary decision that needs to be made in establishing BDT is selecting the appropriate action level for the source category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory alternatives for a standard to control emissions from wastewater have, in previous EPA regulatory analyses, been typically expressed in terms of action levels based on a concentration cutoff above which a wastewater stream must be controlled. For the SOCMI wastewater NSPS, the primary action level will be defined in terms of the volatile organic concentration, as measured by method 25D. The standard also includes exemptions for low flow streams. This is in consideration of the fact that, even though a waste stream may exceed an action level, the total mass of contaminant present in a stream with a low flow rate is low enough that the waste or wastewater stream does not have the potential for significant emissions. Process units that generate wastewater with a total annual volatile organic mass less than 1 Mg are also exempt from the control requirements of the proposed rule. The impacts analysis indicated that the 1 Mg/yr small quantity exemption has little effect on the emission reductions achieved under the regulatory alternatives examined while significantly reducing the overall cost of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The five regulatory alternatives analyzed in the development of the proposed standard were combinations of volatile organic concentrations and flow rate cutoffs. The alternatives were analyzed both with and without the small quantity cutoff of 1 Mg per year of volatile organic mass. For each regulatory alternative, steam stripping (or an equivalent emission reduction technique) would be required for all wastewater streams with flow rates and volatile organic concentrations greater than their respective action levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Values were chosen for concentration and flow rate cutoffs to span ranges believed by the EPA to be reasonable based on knowledge of the SOCMI wastewater streams to be regulated and on previous standards development efforts. Further, the ranges of flow rates and concentrations represented in these alternatives, when impacts are estimated, illustrate the range of cost-effectiveness levels that apply to regulatory alternatives and allow selection of an alternative that will achieve optimum control (i.e., greatest emission reduction for lowest cost).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously noted, method 25D provides a relative indicator of wastewater emission potential. While not a true measure of VOC emissions, the volatile organic concentration of a wastewater stream does provide a relative means of comparing the emission potential of a wastewater stream to other streams similarly managed and of comparing the emission potential of a wastewater stream before and after treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the proposed rule regulates VOC emissions, the first choice for a test method is one that measures the concentration of all VOC. However, this approach would require speciation test methods which are costly to use. As an alternative, the EPA selected method 25D which does not speciate but measures total volatile organic concentration. This method, which is much less costly, has been used in other wastewater related regulations. For example, method 25D is allowed in the HON for measuring volatile organic concentration in applicability determinations. However, the HON does not allow use of method 25D in calculations of mass removal for treatment processes. Instead, the HON uses a test method that speciates HAPs for determining mass removal by treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

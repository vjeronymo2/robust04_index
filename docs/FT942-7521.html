			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Germany The Bundesbank always has an excuse for the explosion in M3 money supply. This time it is the particularly ingenious one that broad money is being swollen by the size of the central bank's own profits. But, after April's annualised increase of 15.8 per cent, it will take a miracle for the 1994 target to be met. The aggregate would have to shrink by DM5bn between now and the end of the year to hit even the top of the target. By July at the latest the bank must confront this reality. Then its council is scheduled to review progress towards meeting this year's target. It has numerous options: it could ignore the overshoot, suspend the target temporarily, scrap it altogether, rebase it to a different period that excludes the tax-related inflows at the end of last year, choose another aggregate on which to focus, or raise the target ceiling. None of these, however, will restore the Bundesbank's flagging credibility with the bond market. Perhaps it would have been different if the bank had not itself made such a fetish of the M3 target. One of its hopes at the time of the last rate cut was that lower short term rates would encourage investors to move further out along the yield curve. There is little evidence of this so far, despite the sharp steepening of the curve since the start of the year. The worry spreading outward from the US is one factor. But the Bundesbank's inability to get a grip on the money supply is also likely to hold Germany's bond market back, especially now there is a whiff of economic recovery in the air.</p>

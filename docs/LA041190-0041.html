			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SIMI AND LIBRARIES  </P> <P> Libraries and librarians are endanger of becoming extinct in Simi Valley  Unified School District.  </P> <P> Schools are charged with the responsibility of preparing our children with the  knowledge of the opportunities and resources in the world around them, to teach  them how to look for information, to analyze and communicate that information.  </P> <P> Libraries are the facilities but more importantly librarians are the  facilitators for providing information and resources. Yet, both are considered  fluff when it comes to education in California and Simi Valley!  </P> <P> I was recently asked by a teacher to provide information for her class on U.S.  foreign policy. The most recent book in my collection was copyrighted 1969.  </P> <P> Today's youngsters are going to need more education than every before in order  to be marketable. It is unconscionable to cut programs that provide them with  the key to a better future.  </P> <P> SHARON J. KERMAN  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

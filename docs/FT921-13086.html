			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on hopes of discount rate cut HOPES OF a cut in the official discount rate and bargain hunting by institutional investors lifted share prices, and the Nikkei average jumped 3.2 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 675.82 up at the day's high of 21,534.12 after falling for four consecutive trading days. The index opened at 20,851.29 and briefly declined to the day's low of 20,702.98. Volume rose marginally to 270m shares from 230m as trading remained dealer-led. Share prices surged across the board, with rises finally outnumbering falls by 868 to 179, and 114 issues remaining unchanged. All 36 sectors advanced on the TSE first section. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 34.38 to 1,603.81, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 1.70 at 1,238.42. The market lost ground at the opening on futures-related selling, but later firmed as foreign securities houses were seen short-covering in the futures market, which prompted arbitrage buying. The sharp fall in short-term interest rates triggered speculation that the Bank of Japan was ready to cut the official discount rate. Yields on the three months certificates of deposit plunged below 5 per cent for the first time in two years and eight months, and the No 129 10-year benchmark bond closed at a record low of 5.195 per cent. Bargain hunting by domestic institutions was noted, and pension funds and insurance companies were seen buying just before the close. Mr Shin Tokoi at County NatWest commented: 'The mood has improved and it seems that the market has seen the bottom.' However, some investors were still cautious. A fund manager at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life said there could be investors wanting to sell at higher levels. Purchases by foreign investors lifted international blue chips. Hitachi climbed Y19 to Y939 and Fujitsu added Y11 at Y820. Interest rate-sensitive, large-capital issues were picked up by domestic investors, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries firming Y3 to Y643 and Nippon Steel Y3 to Y356. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y4,000 to Y702,000, recovering the Y700,000 level for the first time in three days. Financials were also higher, Fuji Bank gaining Y120 to Y2,260 and Nomura Securities Y40 to Y1,530. Oji Paper put on Y11 to Y881 in active trading on expectations that the paper industry will recover at the end of this year. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 528.55 to 22,723.48 in volume of 131.5m shares. Investors sought high-priced issues, with Nintendo advancing Y550 to Y10,500 and Ono Pharmaceutical Y500 to Y4,870. Roundup RISES and falls were almost equally balanced in the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG set its seventh consecutive record as the Hang Seng index appreciated 28.51 to 4,550.72 in turnover up from HKDollars 2.11bn to HKDollars 2.31bn. Properties and banks led, conglomerates registered small advances and utilities were slightly lower. After an early index retreat of 20 points, shares climbed steadily to an intraday peak of up 40 points before easing after the lunch break. SEOUL rallied on expectations of lower interest rates, the composite index rising 16.28 to 646.28 in turnover up from Won416.4bn to Won461.9bn. Shares priced below Won10,000, and those with low price/earnings ratios, led the market up, the first category because they tend to belong to smaller companies which are interest rate-sensitive, and the second, seen as undervalued, following a fashion of recent days. AUSTRALIA weakened on economic worries. The All Ordinaries index closed 15.4 lower at 1,631.5. BHP fell 14 cents to ADollars 13.74. The company reported that domestic steel sales rose 6 per cent to 186,000 metric tons in December but that steel sales for the seven months to December dropped 14 per cent to 1.8m metric tons. NEW ZEALAND came under pressure from foreign selling. The NZSE-40 index ended 11.84 down at 1,472.58. Turnover rose to NZDollars 34.2m from NZDollars 23.5m. Telecom was steady at NZDollars 2.39 on the day's heaviest market volume of 4.4m shares. Fletcher Challenge initially fell to NZDollars 2.38 before ending a net 2 cents up at NZDollars 2.45 on the next biggest volume of 3.1m shares. The turnround was triggered by news that the company has signed a lucrative 10-year contract to supply methanol to Japan. MANILA continued to consolidate last week's gains. The composite index lost 19.69 to 1,281.31 in turnover of 149m pesos, after 163m. Meralco further strengthened, the 'A' shares climbing 21 pesos to 162. BANGKOK balanced profit-taking with heavy buying in two finance issues, and the SET index ended 3.30 off at 772.71 in turnover down from Bt12.5bn to Bt8.49bn. BOMBAY reached a new closing high of 2,132.82, up 17.11, on reports that the government might allow multinationals to increase their minority stakes to 51 per cent.</p>

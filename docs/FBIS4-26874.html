			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Beijing, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Foreign Affairs  Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC] sponsored a  forum at the Great Hall of the People this morning to mark the  40th anniversary of the promulgation of the five principles of  peaceful coexistence. Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun spoke at the  forum.    Tian Jiyun said: The five principles of peaceful coexistence  were first formulated by China and later advocated by China,  India, and Burma. These principles represented the common  aspirations of the newly independent nations and their peoples.  Over the past 40 years, the five principles have been accepted  by more and more countries and have played an important role in  maintaining world peace. Exactly as Comrade Deng Xiaoping  pointed out: "Reviewing the practice of international relations,  the five principles of peaceful coexistence proved to have the  greatest vitality."    Tian Jiyun pointed out: The five principles of peaceful  coexistence are of immediate guiding significance in  establishing a new international political and economic order.  The five principles represent a summarization of the most  fundamental norms of international relations, conform to the  purpose of the principles of the United Nations Charter,  illustrate the fundamental characteristics of a new-type of  international relations. They should be the basis for the  establishment of a fair and reasonable new international order.    He said: Nowadays, some nations flaunt the banner of human  rights and democracy and use them as a major tool of foreign  policy to exert pressure on other nations in an attempt to  impose their will on them. Historical experience told us that  no matter what banner they flaunt, so long as they pursue such  practices as the big bullying the small, the strong insulting  the weak, and the rich suppressing the poor, they will never win  people's hearts, and they will be condemned and opposed by  people around the world, and they are doomed to fail in their  attempt.

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MILLIONS CHEAT ON DEPENDENT CLAIM -- IRS  </P> <P> Millions of Americans have been cheating the government out of billions of  dollars a year by claiming non-existent children and parents as dependents for  tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service said.  </P> <P> The year after Congress required that children 5 or older have Social Security  numbers, the number of dependent exemptions dropped by 7 million below what had  been predicted.  </P> <P> That brought in an extra $2.8 billion in taxes in 1987 alone, the agency said.  </P> <P> Returns filed by 11,627 couples and individuals showed declines of seven or  more dependents claimed from the previous year. Nearly 67,000 claimed four,  five or six fewer dependents than before. In most cases, the exaggerated claims  had been made for several years.  </P> <P> "The decrease is particularly significant because it seems to indicate that a  20-year trend of increasing numbers of improper dependency exemptions has  finally been reversed," IRS researcher John A. Szilagyi concluded.  </P> <P> The study indicated that most of the cheating was being done by single  taxpayers and by married people who filed separate returns. The number of  dependents claimed by singles dropped 48.3% from 1986 to 1987; claims by  married people filing separately fell 28%, while the number claimed by couples  filing joint returns dropped 3.9%.  </P> <P> Returns filed for 1987 claimed 69.7 million dependents; the IRS had anticipated  76.7 million.  </P></p>

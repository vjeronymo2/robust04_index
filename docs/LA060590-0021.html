			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL AT JAPAN AMERICAN CULTURE CENTER PROVES A SIZZLING SUCCESS  </P> <P> At 1 p.m. Sunday, there wasn't enough breeze to budge the balloon arches that  festooned the plaza at the Japan American Culture Center in downtown Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> It was hot outdoors, verging on beastly. And Jack Shakely, director of the  California Community Foundation, was worried.  </P> <P> The free, multicultural festival scheduled from 1 to 5 p.m. was to be a 75th  birthday party for the CCF, which has endowments of $90 million and gives away  $10 million each year to Californians involved in the arts, education,  environment, health, human services and public affairs. But what if nobody  came?  </P> <P> Dressed for the tropics in navy polo shirt and khaki shorts, Shakeley surveyed  the near-empty plaza with food tents ready to serve those not yet there, and  chairs set up in front of an empty outdoor stage. He explained that this was  CCF's first attempt at a multicultural street festival of the arts, and "it  will probably be our last."  </P> <P> By 3 p.m. he had changed his tune. And by 5, with the plaza filled, he thought  maybe this should be an annual affair.  </P> <P> Shakely's expertise as head of the under-publicized foundation is, as he puts  it, "to know what the community needs and to invest in those things." And what  the community needs, it became apparent on Sunday, is a festival where people  can congregate, free of charge, to celebrate the cultural diversity and  creative energies of Los Angeles' most talented new artists. Actors, dancers,  poets, musicians, composers and performance artists of many stripes offered  their creations to an audience which responded with joy and gratitude.  </P> <P> All who entertained were recipients of grants from the CCF. The impassioned  monologue of actor Roger G. Smith was an excerpt from a work in progress about  a self-educated slave, "Frederick Douglass Now." It will be presented at the  Inner City Cultural Foundation later this year, with help from a CCF grant.  (Smith, who grew up in the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles, played the stuttering  Smiley in Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing.")  </P> <P> Also on the outdoor stage were a variety of ethnic dance troupes (Peruvian,  Persian, African, Croation), including a rousing crowd pleaser, Trinidadian  limbo dancer Perry Hernandez. All now live and work in California.  </P> <P> As food lines lengthened and outdoor action continued, performances of a more  delicate nature took place in the air-conditioned Japan America Theater that  opens onto the plaza. Actor-writer Michael Kearns presented excerpts from his  solo performance piece, "more intimacies," in which he portrays a priest with  AIDS.  </P> <P> Rhapsody in Taps tap-danced to jazz; The Theatre Workers Project presented  seven Latino immigrant workers never on stage before, in a piece focusing on  their lives and aspirations. Cold Tofu (a comedy improvisation group), the Lula  Washington/Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theater and the Koto String Society  were among other groups who performed indoors.  </P> <P> The crowd eventually swelled to between 1,000 and 3,000 people; civilized  people who didn't push, shout or litter and many of whom said they'd like to  come back if the event were held again.  </P> <P> "I envisioned 500,000 people here, fighting for 300 parking places. But it  wasn't like that at all," said Michelle deLude, a writer for the auto club.  Lois Arkin didn't worry about parking, because she pedaled downtown to the  festival on her bicycle. Arkin loved the entertainment and food, she said, but  worried that the "elegant" clear plastic plates on which it was served might  not be recycled.  </P></p>

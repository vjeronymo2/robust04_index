			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> ADOPTING A PARK HELPS ALL-AROUND  </P> <P> Minh Nguyen was a young man with a mission as he worked one afternoon picking  up beer cans, candy wrappers and other junk at Richman Park in Fullerton.  </P> <P> "We pick up trash and then we play," said Minh, 9, as he and his fourth-grade  classmates from Richman Elementary School scattered over the park. "If you just  pick up trash, you can't do anything fun."  </P> <P> The afternoon outing was intended to be both fun and productive. Fifteen such  weekly outings will earn Minh's school $500.  </P> <P> The program, called Adopt-a-Park, has worked successfully since the city  started it several years ago, program coordinator Nancy L. Guider said. Up to  20 nonprofit city groups, including schools, adopt a city park each fall and  spring and agree to pick up litter and report hazards or problems to city  officials.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful," Guider said. "The residents get clean parks, the  participating groups get $500 to help toward their worthy causes and the city  -- heck, we get a bargain in the fact that it costs less to send these groups  out than one senior maintenance worker."  </P> <P> Keeping their parks and schools clean teaches the students to respect their  neighborhoods and gives them a feeling of accomplishment and pride, teacher San  Roman said as Minh and his classmates finished their work.  </P> <P> "We hope the lesson carries through and to their home life also," Roman said.  "It's fun, but it's also a learning experience."  </P> <P> The afternoon assignment began with students lugging five-gallon buckets to the  park and carrying long black claws to help keep trash at arm's length and then  some.  </P> <P> Picking up trash is not a clean job. "It's gooshy and it's yucky," 9-year-old  Steve Hoskins said as he deposited grimy papers into a bucket.  </P> <P> In 10 minutes, the students half-filled two buckets. They spent the rest of  their time collecting their rewards: banana Popsicles and the remaining class  period to play in the park.  </P> <P> Adopt-a-Park does not replace city maintenance workers, Guider said, but  augments them. City crews still visit the parks to clean and remove large  trash, such as old couches and mattresses.  </P></p>

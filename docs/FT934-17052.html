			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: In fear of the bank - Keep an eye on your business account THE REPORT in the Financial Times on August 12 that customers are 'fed up to the back teeth with banks dipping into their accounts without notice to extract charges and interest' will have struck a chilling note with many small businesses. The quotation was from a Which? report into banking practices. Are some High Street banks getting up to their old tricks again? When my wife and I started our retail business in 1983, we approached the bank at which we had our personal accounts and inquired about opening a business account. The bank could not have been more helpful until we came to the delicate question of charges. I asked how these were calculated for a business account. The bank manager was clearly embarrassed by the question. He explained, at length, that the banks did not publish tariffs for business accounts; that the amounts charged depended on too many factors for him to explain to me; and that if he did explain I would not understand anyway. Intrigued, I approached the other major banks and asked the same question. Each time I received the same reply and left no wiser, although with the feeling that my attempts to uncover the mysteries of bank charges were regarded as indelicate. We have come a long way since then. In the mid-1980s the banks, anxious to increase their small business customers, started to publish information about tariffs. The movement gathered pace in 1991 following a press campaign, in which the Financial Times played a prominent part, which drew attention to the poor treatment meted out to small businesses by some banks. Our business suffered from a particularly outrageous example of high-handed behaviour. I was astonished to discover, on examining our quarterly statement, that our bank charges had tripled since the previous quarter. I assumed an error had been made and wrote to the bank. The manager explained that, since our sales had increased (by about 20 per cent), the bank had decided to triple its charge on each transaction - each cheque written, each sum paid in etc. Moreover they had done this without even informing us even though we visited the branch at least once a week to pay money in. I pointed out that in any other business such behaviour would be regarded as little short of sharp practice. He replied that it was customary in banking and would no doubt remain so. He was wrong, as I discovered when I changed our bank and saved Pounds 1,000 a year in charges. Faced with many similar examples the director-general of Fair Trading investigated the relationship between banks and small businesses and the banks decided that they should do something to mend their ways. All the major banks publish 'Charters' that set out the terms on which they will handle small business accounts. These include details of charges for different types of account. The major banks also give an undertaking not to change the charges without giving a month's notice, so my experience should not be repeated, although the Which? survey suggests that vigilance remains necessary. Now that the banks publish their tariffs, it is possible to make comparisons. Midland Bank has an Enterprise Account for small businesses with a turnover of less then Pounds 100,000. A standing charge of Pounds 2.50 a month is levied on the account and 60p is charged for each cheque issued, 60p is also charged every time money is paid into the account. These charges are waived during the first year of trading provided the account remains in credit. The Co-op has a different charging structure, with a standing charge of Pounds 13.50 a quarter but no charge for the first 18 cheques per quarter. After that, a charge of 69p per Pounds 100 debit turnover is raised. Debit turnover is the total amount of money paid out of the account. For a small business with takings of Pounds 100,000 a year, raising 200 cheques a year and paying into the account twice a week, I estimate that Midland would charge about Pounds 220 a year and the Co-op about Pounds 640 a year. The Co-op does pay a little more interest on funds held in the account but the Midland would still offer a significant saving for such a customer and it is worth shopping around for such deals. For a smaller business, raising fewer than 18 cheques a quarter, the Co-op would be cheaper but for very small enterprises there are building society accounts aimed at small businesses. The Nationwide Building Society has introduced a Business Investor Account that makes no charges at all for the first six cheques raised each month, charges Pounds 2 per cheque raised once this figure has been passed but offsets this by paying 4 per cent gross interest on funds held in the account. For a small business raising 13 cheques a quarter this would be better value than the Co-op. In an attempt to differentiate their services some banks are also beginning to offer 'soft' benefits. Midland runs seminars to which small business clients are invited to learn about Trading out of the Recession or Improving Cashflow, to cite two recent seminars that I attended. The were greatly appreciated by the small business proprietors to whom I spoke afterwards. As the range of services becomes more varied, and as the banks and building societies struggle to differentiate their services, it is worth a few minutes of every small business proprietor's time to review banking facilities to see where savings can be made. And if your bank behaves as ours did, and tries to alter your charges without proper consultation, take it up with the manager and tell him that, if the matter is not resolved satisfactorily, you will take it as far as the Office of the Banking Ombudsman at Citadel House, 5-11, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1BR Stephen Halliday is principal lecturer in small business at Buckinghamshire College Business School and author of Which Business?

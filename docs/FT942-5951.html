			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Work tensions 'growing': Acas chief says demands on industrial tribunals remain high Tensions are increasing beneath the surface in the workplace because of growing pressures on business in Britain's economic recovery, Acas, the independent conciliation and arbitration service, warned yesterday. In its annual report published today, Acas says the number of individual conciliation cases has reached record levels for the third consecutive year. There has been a 4 per cent rise in such cases to 75,181 from 72,166 in 1992. Acas says: 'If not channelled into creative ends, these tensions could increase the level of conflict. Often during 1993 managements were compelled to deal with immediate pressures rather than managing change in a positive way. In such situations tensions were almost inevitable.' Mr John Hougham, chairman, said yesterday: 'Industrial tribunal work shows no signs of any downward trend. We remain very busy.' In 67 per cent of cases a settlement was reached or an application to an industrial tribunal withdrawn. Only one in three cases proceeded to an industrial tribunal. As many as 62 per cent of the cases concerned unfair dismissal. There were 1,852 race discrimination cases, the highest recorded - and a 6 per cent increase on 1992. Sex discrimination cases totalled 5,772, six fewer than in the previous year. There were 1,601 equal-pay cases, of which 859 were claims for equal pay for work of equal value. Acas reported a 1 per cent fall in public inquiry calls about industrial relations matters to 481,392 last year. Demands on the organisation's collective conciliation service remained high at 1,211 requests - four more than in 1992 - in spite of a continuing fall in recorded strikes. The government has already announced that Acas's budget is to be cut by nearly 15 per cent during the next four years, from Pounds 23m in 1993-1994 to Pounds 20m in 1996-1997.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the morning of 17 February, Shinto Sakigake  [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party [JNP] held a staff meeting  of Toitsukaiha, their joint floor group in the lower house, and  exchanged views on the question of a possible cabinet reshuffle.  As a result, they agreed on the following: 1) They will  support the Hosokawa administration qualitatively; 2) the two  parties will continue to cooperate in the lower house by  maintaining the joint floor group; and 3) Diet members of the  two parties will further solidify their ties.    Following the meeting, a senior Sakigake member explained:  "Supporting the Hosokawa administration qualitatively means that  we will support it even if Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura is assigned to another post in the cabinet reshuffle."  Thus, he indicated Sakigake would accept a cabinet reshuffle if  it means Takemura is not ousted and remains in the cabinet.</p>

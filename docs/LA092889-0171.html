			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UEBERROTH GROUP PEGS HAL SALE TO UNION CONCESSIONS  </P> <P> An investment group headed by J. Thomas Talbot and Peter V. Ueberroth, the  former major league baseball commissioner, said Wednesday that it will not buy  troubled Hawaiian Airlines as planned unless it gets hefty concessions from the  airline's unions.  </P> <P> In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Ueberroth group  said it is seeking a three-year wage freeze from the unions and changes in work  rules that would increase productivity 30%. The Ueberroth group told the SEC  that it must obtain the concessions, worth an estimated $6 million over three  to five years, by Oct. 5 to complete the Hawaiian Air transaction.  </P> <P> The Ueberroth group last month agreed to pay $22 a share to obtain a majority  stake in HAL Inc., the airline's parent firm. However, it is not clear whether  the group will try to acquire the entire company, which is 20% owned by a  subsidiary of Japan Air Lines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Replace Officers  </P> <P> The Ueberroth group also told the SEC that it expects to place "substantial  additional indebtedness" on Hawaiian Air as a result of the transaction. The  borrowed money would be used for working capital and equipment, the group said.  </P> <P> In addition, the Ueberroth group said it plans to replace the corporate  officers of HAL Inc. and some of the airline's senior managers.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview Wednesday, Talbot refused to discuss negotiations with  the airline's five labor unions, saying the talks were confidential. Spokesmen  for the Air Line Pilots Assn. and the Assn. of Flight Attendants, however, said  talks had been productive and that they were hopeful that an agreement would be  reached.  </P> <P> Besides the pilots and the flight attendants, the Ueberroth group is  negotiating with the International Assn. of Machinists, which represents  mechanics, and two smaller union groups that represent dispatchers and other  communications workers. Talbot said about 83% of the airline's 3,000 employees  are union members.  </P> <P> The negotiations are unlikely to hold up the Hawaiian Air acquisition, said  Daniel A. Hersch, aviation industry analyst with the Los Angeles investment  firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. If the unions do not strike a deal with  Talbot and Ueberroth, he said, members who work for Hawaiian are likely to be  looking for new jobs, because the airline's survival hinges on a sale or some  other deal that will result in a sizable infusion of cash. And any deal will  depend on union concessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negotiating Tactic  </P> <P> "At least Talbot and Ueberroth aren't asking for wage cuts, but for a wage  freeze and changes in work rules to get more work for the same buck," Hersch  said. "That is a fair request because that company needs to improve its cost  structure" to stop its losses, he said.  </P> <P> "I think all they are doing is trying to force labor to come to terms," he  said. Filing a report of stalemated talks with the SEC, Hersch said, "is just a  negotiating tactic."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Capsule Performance Presentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 4.21(a)(4) currently requires performance to be disclosed in tables showing at least quarterly the beginning and ending net asset values for the period, all additions, withdrawals and redemptions, whether voluntary or involuntary, the net performance for the period, net of additions, withdrawals and redemptions, and the rate of return for the period. These requirements have been applied in practice such that multiple pages of small-type numerical tables, frequently including performance data not required by Commission rules, are presented, often mixing without differentiation the performance of trading vehicles similar to the pool offered and of vehicles different in material respects. Such performance presentations are voluminous and may give equal weight to relevant data and to data of secondary or marginal pertinence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is proposing a new summary format for presentation of all required past performance history. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  This format is intended to capture the most significant information concerning a pool's history in a reader-friendly, largely nontabular form, which would generally permit multiple performance track records to be provided on a single page. The proposed new format, which is set forth in Rule 4.25(a)(1)(i) for pools and Rule 4.25(a)(1)(ii) for accounts, calls for core information intended to convey relevant data in a condensed format. The capsule format for pools would set forth the date when the pool commenced trading, the aggregate gross capital subscriptions for the pool, and the pool's current net asset value. The ``largest monthly draw-down'' and ``worst continuous peak-to-valley draw-down'' are intended to show that material changes in rates of return may occur. Rates of return would also be included, on a monthly basis for the pool offered, and on an annual basis for other pools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The only exception to the summary format presentation is that a CTA disclosure document would be required to present the performance of the program offered in the full format currently required by current Rule 4.31.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``largest monthly drawn-down'' and the ``worst continuous peak-to-valley draw-down'' would demonstrate the significant one-month and sustained declines to which commodity pool returns may be subject. Both draw-down figures would be expressed as a percentage of the pool's net asset value. The largest monthly draw-down would indicate the largest net asset loss experienced by the pool in any calendar month and the month and year in which it occurred. The peak-to-valley draw-down would indicate the largest calendar month-to-calendar month continuous net asset loss experienced by the pool during any period and the months and year in which it occurred. Dating the monthly and peak-to-valley draw-downs would permit participants to assess whether the losses were connected to market conditions by comparing the draw-downs of several pools. As explained in the rule, a peak-to-valley draw-down of 4 to 8&hyph;91/25% would indicate that the peak-to-valley lasted from April to August of 1991 and resulted in a twenty-five percent draw-down of the pool's net asset value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rate of return would be presented for each month for the pool offered and for each year for other pools. It would be computed on a monthly compounded basis in order that the rate of return for a given month will take into account the prior months' trading profits. Annual rates of return computed on a monthly compounded basis assume reinvestment of accrued profits and therefore the investment base on which rates of return are calculated is effectively adjusted by these amounts, presenting a more accurate picture of actual returns realized on an investment. Information currently required by Rule 4.21(a)(4) concerning additions, withdrawals and redemptions, the beginning and ending net asset values and the number of units outstanding at the end of each period at least for each quarter, would not be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed capsule format for CTA accounts would contain similar core information,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the name of the CTA or other person trading the account and the name of the trading program; the date when the CTA began trading client funds and the date of inception of the program being disclosed; the number of accounts in the program; the total assets under the management of the CTA and in the trading program; the largest monthly and worst continuous peak-to-valley draw-downs for the program; and the annual and year-to-date rates of return. Registrants who compute rates of return for CTA programs on the basis permitted by Advisory 93&hyph;13 would continue to be required to state the actual and nominal account sizes, as required therein. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> But see note 23.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The summary format is designed for presentation purposes only. CPOs and CTAs must continue to compute pool performance on the basis set forth in current Rule 4.21(a)(4)(ii) (proposed to be renumbered as Rule 4.25(a)(6)), as interpreted by the Commission and to maintain records substantiating such computations in accordance with Rule 1.31. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Among other things, Rule 1.31 requires all books and records to be kept for a period of five years and available for inspection by any representative of the Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An example of capsule past performance presentation follows.

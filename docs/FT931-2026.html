			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit again Glaxo, weakened in recent weeks by the resignation of its chief executive and deputy chairman and official criticism by US drug authorities of the company's claims for Zantac, its anti-ulcer drug, came under renewed pressure after press suggestions that Zantac could cause allergic reactions. The shares fell to the lowest levels since June 1991. At worst the shares touched 591p before stabilising to settle a net 12 off at 601p. Turnover was a hefty 5.6m shares. Some UK pharmaceutical analysts, strong supporters of Glaxo over the past year or so during which their US counterparts have adopted an increasingly critical attitude to the shares, maintained that selling of Glaxo had been overdone. SmithKline Beecham, another of the big drug companies quoted on the UK market, closed 12 1/2 lower at 424 1/2 p on turnover of 2.1m. ICI, suffering from the general retreat by the London market, settled 15 off at 1,225p.</p>

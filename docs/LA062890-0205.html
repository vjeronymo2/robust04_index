			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HANFORD CITY MANAGER QUITTING TO ACCEPT NO. 2 JOB IN ANAHEIM  </P> <P> City Manager Jim Armstrong is leaving his post to become assistant city manager  in Anaheim. He is the third Kings County city manager to move to larger cities  in recent months.  </P> <P> Armstrong, who has managed the city of 29,000 residents for seven years, will  resign effective July 20, he announced on Wednesday.  </P> <P> He said the move to Anaheim, which has 240,000 residents and a budget of about  $550 million, is a wonderful career opportunity.  </P> <P> Armstrong is following the lead of former Corcoran City Manager George Lambert,  who left for Norco in Riverside County in May, and former Avenal City Manager  Steve Casey, who accepted a job in Crescent City earlier this month.  </P> <P> As a result of the recent moves, Lemoore City Manager Allen Goodman wants to  put to rest any speculation that he might follow his colleagues to bigger  cities.  </P> <P> "I'm staying," he said.  </P></p>

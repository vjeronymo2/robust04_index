			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (6): Hybrid service now set for rapid growth - Virtual private networks start to make an impression in Europe BARCLAYS BANK has a private telephone network for 250 of its offices and branches in the UK. The network is made up of private circuits that are leased from BT and Mercury Communications, and switches that it has bought directly from manufacturers to route calls between its sites. But having built and refined the network over a number of years, Barclays is about to dismantle it and go back to using a service provided and managed by BT. The UK bank is a guinea-pig for for a new service called FeatureNet. This is BT's name for what have become known as virtual private network (VPN) services. VPNs were first offered to large corporate telecommunications users in the US in the mid-1980s, but are only now starting to make an impression in Europe. Virtual private networks are a cross between private networks and the public switched telephone network. A private network is a closed network, and the telephone lines that make up the network only carry the calls generated by the owner of the network. The public switched telephone network carries all the telephone traffic that is not on private networks. VPN services offer reserved private capacity on the public switched telephone network through the use of sophisticated switches. Each user effectively has its own private network, but the network is defined by the software in the system rather than by the physical location of the plant. The switches enable the VPN customer to access a range of advanced services that are not available to people using the public switched telephone network. Ovum, the London-based telecommunications consultancy, forecasts that by 1997, VPN services will account for eight per cent of the revenues of European telephone operators derived from national services, and 17 per cent of the revenues of US operators. The impact of virtual private networks will be even greater for international services. Ovum predicts that by I997, 21 per cent of the international revenues of the world's largest telephone operators will be accounted for by international VPN. Cost-savings are the main incentive for companies to start using VPN services. In the US, there were price wars between the long-distance operators in 1988 and 1989 which led to a rapid take up of VPN services. Today, most of the top 1,000 companies use VPN services, but as a complement rather than as an alternative to private networks. Cable and Wireless offers big businessness a comprehensive telecoms services with products such as its 'global virtual private networks.' Multinational users include Esso, Rockwell International and Grand Metropolitan. In Europe, where virtual private network services are only now starting to become available, Ovum analysts have found that large users expect to receive discounts that will enable them to make reductions of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent in their total telecommunications bills. Barclays says that the switch to the VPN service will lead to savings of millions of pounds a year in lower call costs, plus a one-off saving this year of Pounds 5 million from not having to renew its telecommunications equipment. Lower tariffs are not the only way in which VPN services can bring about cost savings. The fact that the network is built and managed by BT means that companies no longer need to keep a full-time group of professionals to maintain the network. BT says that this will free the professionals to 'tackle more important issues of planning resources and develop new ways of improving business performance.' In reality, it is more likely to lead to a number of staff being made redundant. Cost savings are not, however, the only benefits of VPNs over private networks. For a number of users, one of the key benefits of VPN services is the fact that they can be extended to outlying sites which are too expensive to serve via a company's private network. Barclays, for example, intends to extend its VPN to 1,400 sites by spring 1993. Its private network only covers 250 sites and the rest have to rely on the public switched telephone network. VPN can also provide more flexibility than a private network. Many companies which lease private circuits use them to their maximum capacity only at certain times of the year. In the retail sector, for example, there is higher capacity utilisation before Christmas and at sale times than at other times of the year. With a VPN service, companies can mould their capacity around these seasonal variations and avoid paying for capacity that they do not require.</p>

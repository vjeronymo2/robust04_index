			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN SAYS THEY DO COSTUMES RIGHT  </P> <P> As president of Western Costume Co., I would like to take exception to the way  our company was portrayed in the article, "Gone With Neglect" by Gaile Robinson  on Feb. 23.  </P> <P> Robinson is evidently ignorant of the difference between what she refers to as  a "rental shop" and one of the great costume houses of the world, which Western  has been and will continue to be.  </P> <P> We create costumes with some of the finest craftsmen and designers in the  industry for stars and films acclaimed throughout the world. We do a lot more  than "rent."  </P> <P> While it is true there have been abuses and neglect of Hollywood's artifacts,  no credit was given to those of us who, at considerable expenditure of time and  money, are trying to preserve what remains of the past as well as the treasures  of the present for the future. My partners and I have been refurbishing and  rebuilding our collection so that it will be here for future generations. Our  costumes will not be "Gone With Neglect" but, instead, "Preserved With Love."  </P> <P> PAUL ABRAMOWITZ, President, Western Costume Co., Hollywood  </P></p>

Korea-China  routes handled 215,000 teus (twenty-foot equivalent units) last  year, up 67.9 percent from 1992, and will carry 350,000 teus  this year, up 62 percent from 1993. Korea-Japan lines took  306,000 teus in 1993, virtually unchanged from 305,000 teus in  1992, and this year will haul 332,000 teus.    China will be in second place in containerized cargo with  Korea for the first time this year, after the United States but  ahead of Japan.    Korea and America exchanged 680,000 teus last year.    There are bright prospects for container traffic between  Korea and China due to the rapid growth of china's external  trade, which has expanded more than 20 percent annually since  1985, and the ever-expanding Korean investment in China. The  first direct line between Korea and China opened in 1989.</p>

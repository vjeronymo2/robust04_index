			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, April 10 -- Keen as they appeared to be  to get Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao to visit Washington, the U.S.  side, in the course of Mr. Strobe Talbott's talks here, sought  to convince India that the strategic significance of getting  Pakistan to cap verifiably its fissile material production would  be far greater than a marginal increase in the latter's  conventional arms strength.    One aspect of the proposed trade-off, entailing supply of 38  F-16 aircraft, what Mr. Talbott sought to highlight was that the  exercise, if successful, would amount to Islamabad "delinking"  its nuclear programme from India's. Consequently, New Delhi's  security concerns, which extend beyond Islamabad, even the  Indian sub-continent, would stand acknowledged with the China  factor also being taken care of.    The Indian interlocutors weren't obviously impressed by the  American logic. It was conveyed in very clear terms to Mr.  Talbott and also reportedly to Mr. Robert Einhorn, Deputy  Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs  of the State Department, that the induction of the  deep-penetration jets would affect the balance of forces  adversely against India in the region, forcing it to take steps  in line with the changed situation.    Mr. Einhorn has been engaged in Indo-U.S. bilateral  discussions on disarmament and international security since  1992. His role in the recently concluded negotiations, which  Mr. Talbott preferred to categorise as consultations, was much  deeper than that of Ms. Robin Raphel, the U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State in charge of South Asia. On the sidelines of  the talks at the political level, Mr. Einhorn is understood to  have had meetings covering the nuts and bolts of the F-16 issue  and its security implications for India.    The future contours of Washington's new policy of pursuing  the nuclear issue separately with New Delhi and Islamabad would  depend on the extent to which the Benazir Bhutto regime is  willing to play ball. Unless Pakistan accepts the deal, the  move would remain a non-starter. It's because of the Kashmir  issue that South-Asia is perceived as a potential nuclear  flash-point. In recent months, Pakistan has sought to link the  two, the message being that the nuclear imbroglio cannot be  resolved ahead of the Kashmir question for the need for a  deterrent against India was felt due to the situation in the  Valley.    In November last year, Ms. Raphel, in the course of her  visit  to Islamabad, had described the linkage drawn by Pakistan  between Kashmir and its nuclear endeavour as a "natural line of  thought." From accounts available of the latest Pak-U.S.  bilateral exchange, it can safely be deduced that Washington's  thinking has since changed. "The issue of non-proliferation is  so important," Mr. Talbott is reported to have told his  Pakistani audience "... that it needs to be discussed very much  in its own terms."    Against this backdrop, Ms. Raphel, as President Clinton's  pointsperson in South Asia, may have problems selling the  intended package despite her reputation of being a friend of  Pakistan. The rosy side (for India) of the proposed deal, if  that, indeed, is the case, also hasn't been lost on the Pak  foreign office. It has already spoken about the need to evolve  an "agreed and equitable approach" in the U.S. linkage between  the delivery of F-16 aircraft and the verifiable nuclear cap.    The message emanating from Islamabad is, therefore,  unmistakable: the India factor cannot be ignored in Washington's  bilateral dealings having a bearing on Pakistan's nuclear  option. Said a spokesman of the Pak Foreign Office following  talks with Mr. Talbott: "We have now informed the U.S. of our  willingness to consider any ideas that might prompt a balance of  obligation by India, on the one hand and by Pakistan on the  other, although these country-specific obligations could be  different in substance."    As pointed out by the U.S. official the process is going to  be complicated and time-consuming, requiring a lot of work  through "quiet" diplomatic channels. However, Ms. Bhutto does  not appear to be in a position to accept the quid pro quo,  especially not if Army Chief Gen. Abdul Waheed has returned  unimpressed from Washington. According to Pakistani Press  reports, he was to reach Islamabad before Mr. Talbott and his  teammates.    Essentially, it's the Pak army which has to weigh the  advantages of acquiring the 38 F-16s and some other "toys"  against the major nuclear concession being demanded of them by  the U.S.. As of now, only the Americans have some assessment of  Gen. Waheed's thinking which, for evident reasons, Mr. Talbott  refused to share at his Press conference in New Delhi, terming  as "confidential" the record dialogue held in Washington.    Talking of confidential conversations, one may mention that  not much also is known about what transpired at Mr. Talbott's  one-to-one chat with Mr. Rao before leaving for Islamabad.  Originally planned for Thursday last, the meeting had to be  rescheduled for the next morning.    Privately, Mr. Talbott is understood to have confirmed to  the  Indian officials the components of the arms package offered to  Pakistan. Besides the F-16s, the offer includes three P-3 Orion  anti-submarine warplanes, 15 T-37 trainer aircraft and  military-to- military cooperation and training for Pakistani  army officers at U.S. war colleges.    It's against this background that the Foreign Office is  exercising caution and care while working out the details of Mr.  Rao's visit to Washington. The basic objective is to avoid any  embarrassment to the Premier in terms of the timing of the  supplies to Islamabad -- if Pakistan accepts the deal, that is.  At his Press conference here, Mr. Talbott was categorical that  the gifts offered bilaterally would be delivered "if and only if  Pakistan accepts a verifiable cap on its fissile material  production."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Simopekka Nortamo, former HELSINGIN SANOMAT </F> chief editor: "Beliefs Regarding EU Discussion: 1"]    [Text] During President of the Republic Mauno Koivisto's  farewell interview on television Channel 2 the day before the  change of presidents, he was asked a clear and brief question:  "Should Finland join the European Union [EU]?"    Koivisto's reply was even briefer: "Unquestionably," he  said.    At that time the negotiations in Brussels had not yet been  concluded, nor was the exact final result known.    Koivisto stressed the fact that the differences of opinion  that arose during the negotiations were not very important ones.    On the following day, in the speech he delivered before the  Eduskunta, new President Martti Ahtisaari said that Finland  would secure its future best as a member of the European Union.    The membership negotiations were only in the final stretch  at  that moment, and no one could have said exactly what the final  result would be.    How could two Finnish presidents so unhesitatingly voice a  positive stand on EU membership even though they did not yet at  that point know what might be agreed on in Brussels with  reference to subsidies for Southern Finnish farmers or the  cultivation of vegetables and cut flowers?    The answer is an easy one. The presidents did not entertain  the belief that seemed to prevail among most Finns: that the  details of the agreement negotiated in Brussels will presumably  be decisive when we estimate "whether it will pay" for Finland  to join the EU.    Of course, it was important for Finland's negotiators to  successfully put the finishing touches to the agreement as well  -- beyond any realistic hopes. Many different kinds of monetary  values were involved.    However, we should bear in mind that the most important and  essential issue of all from the standpoint of Finland's  membership is not included at all in the agreement concluded in  Brussels. It was not even negotiated there.    This is why the differences of opinion in Brussels "were not  very important," as Koivisto put it.    What is important is the fact that the opportunity has  finally opened up to Finland to quite openly link itself with  other Western-style democracies -- unless Finland itself decides  to remain a no-man's-land between East and West in which our  political and economic reference groups are the former Soviet  states and satellites.</p>

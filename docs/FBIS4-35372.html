			<p>BFN     [Text] In Amman, Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for  the Hamas Movement, has stated that the Movement intends to  establish a political party in the occupied territories that  comprises all the opposition forces in the territories.    Ghawshah explained that the party will deal with political  tasks that would be agreed upon and that will be in line with  the changes and current facts on the ground in the Palestinian  arena, particularly following the implementation of autonomy in  Gaza and Jericho. Ghawshah added that this issue is being  discussed within Hamas, which holds consultations with its  allies within the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, or the 10  Palestinian opposition factions which have their headquarters in  Damascus.</p>

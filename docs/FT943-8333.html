			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Russian court suspends fund A Russian court yesterday suspended the operations of a Russian investment fund in a move which court officials said could trigger a financial scandal as serious as the collapse of the MMM pyramid scheme earlier this summer. Russki Dom Selenga (Russian House of Selling), the suspended fund, has also become the target of strong-arm tactics similar to those the state dramatically employed against MMM earlier this month. Over the past few days in raids throughout Siberia and central Russia, where the company is based, armed tax police have confiscated billions of roubles in cash from Russki Dom Selenga branches. Like MMM, the company responded to the state crackdown by 'temporarily' freezing its operations. Russki Dom Selenga has attracted over 1.5m investors, company officials say. Russia is plastered with billboards depicting a typically dilapidated Russian apartment on the left and a glowingly prosperous western-style home on the right with the slogan: 'Others only promise a better future, we guarantee wealth today.' But, unlike the Moscow-based MMM scheme, which was integrated into the capital city's burgeoning financial market, Russki Dom Selenga has focused on the Russian provinces. The company is not licensed by the Central Bank to trade securities or to handle the funds of private investors.</p>

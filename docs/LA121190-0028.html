			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OAKLAND GETS SHOW WITH $2 MILLION PACT;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: SHOW, THE PADRES' ALL-TIME LEADING PITCHER, AGREES TO A TWO-YEAR  GUARANTEED DEAL WITH OAKLAND.  </P> <P> Eric Show, who was unceremoniously dumped by the Padres in the off-season,  signed a two-year guaranteed contract Monday night with the Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> Show, the Padres' all-time leader with 100 career victories, is guaranteed $2  million, and can earn another $500,000 in incentives, according to his agent,  Arn Tellem.  </P> <P> "We're not sure of the circumstances around (free agents) Bobby Welch and Scott  Sanderson," said Dave Duncan, A's pitching coach, "and of all the people out  there, he was interested in us, and we were interested in him.  </P> <P> "It's hard to put in ink what role he'll play for us, but I expect that he will  be a member of the starting rotation."  </P> <P> The irony of the Athletics' acquisition is that the Padres did not feel Show,  6-8, 5.76 ERA, still could pitch. They paid a $250,000 buyout in October rather  than pick up the 1991 option year of his contract.  </P> <P> The Padres still have openings in their rotation and bullpen, but they are  planning to offer contracts to free-agent reliever Larry Andersen and  free-agent starter Danny Darwin, sources said. They also have offered salary  arbitration to starter Dennis Rasmussen, and if he rejects the offer as  expected, the Padres have until Jan. 8 to sign him.  </P> <P> Show, who earned $800,000 this past season, would have had his option vested if  he had pitched in 175 innings, but he wound up pitching 106 1/3 innings,  bouncing in and out of the rotation. If the Padres had picked up his option,  Show would have been allowed to file for an arbitration award worth $1.1  million to $1.7 million.  </P> <P> The Padres, however, decided that he was not worth the money, and released him  after the season. The Athletics had a different viewpoint.  </P> <P> "People in our organization saw him pitch, and really liked him," said Duncan,  "especially the way he pitched at the end of the season."  </P> <P> Show, recovering from a 1989 back operation in which a disc and several  fragments were removed, lost five of his first six starts and was removed out  of the rotation May 14. He pitched in relief, winning his first game July 4,  and rejoined the rotation July 16. He made five more starts, going 2-2, and  spent the rest of the year in long relief until the final game of the season.  </P></p>

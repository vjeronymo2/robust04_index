			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS WARY AS SPRAYING ENDS;  </P> <P> MALATHION: WEDNESDAY'S FLIGHT OVER COMPTON WAS LAST ONE SCHEDULED FOR LOS  ANGELES COUNTY. BUT EXPERTS SAY THEY CAN ONLY HOPE THE HIATUS OF NEW FLY  DISCOVERIES WILL CONTINUE.  </P> <P> Late Wednesday night, a squadron of helicopters lifted off from Long Beach and  flew a one-hour sortie over the city of Compton, carrying a final dose of  malathion to fight a flare-up of Mexican fruit flies.  </P> <P> The mission was something of a milestone in a long and frustrating aerial war  that has been waged over Southern California. After 10 consecutive months of  regular helicopter excursions -- first against Medflies and more recently  against the Mexfly -- the raid Wednesday was the final scheduled malathion  spraying for Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> But there was no celebration. State officials can only hope that their luck  will hold and the hiatus of new fly discoveries will continue.  </P> <P> If more flies are found, more spraying will probably be ordered, and experts  say it will not be until late July that they can claim with confidence that the  infestations have been eradicated.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to call it a victory," said Don Henry, chief deputy director of  the eradication campaign. "We still have to get through the middle of July.  Then you'll see us a little less somber."  </P> <P> At its height, the state's spraying campaign covered 536 square miles and  reached into parts of five counties in Southern California. The sound of  helicopters, rattling windows and sending pets scurrying for cover, became  commonplace for more than 4 million Southern Californians, some of whom angrily  fired back at the state's aerial assault with a flurry of noisy protests and  lawsuits.  </P> <P> But in the last month, the war against the Mediterranean fruit fly and its kin,  the Mexican fruit fly, has become quiet.  </P> <P> The last malathion spraying for the Medfly in Los Angeles and Orange counties  was conducted May 30 and no Medflies have been found in six weeks -- the  longest stretch since the beginning of the infestation last July. No Mexican  fruit flies have been found since May 8.  </P> <P> With the final spraying in Compton, only 64 square miles in San Bernardino  County, El Cajon in San Diego County and the Woodcrest area in Riverside County  have been left with the dubious honor of being the last in the spray zone.  </P> <P> Despite the noticeable deceleration of the unpopular spraying program, the  political heat continues. The Los Angeles City Council has been considering  barring the state from using any airport in the city to launch its squadron of  malathion-bearing helicopters.  </P> <P> In addition, demonstrations and press conferences attacking the spraying  campaign have persisted, although at nowhere near the frantic pace of spring  when the spray zone was growing in leaps and bounds.  </P> <P> "I think people are relieved and tired. They're taking a breather," said Patty  Prickett, coordinator of the community group Residents Against Spraying  Pesticides. "But there's no way we are going to give up until we know this  won't ever happen again."  </P> <P> The spraying campaign over the last 10 months has been the largest mounted in  Southern California, involving more than 480 workers and costing an estimated  $36 million so far.  </P> <P> The statistics of the campaign have been mind-boggling, even for veterans of  the fruit fly wars. About 47,000 gallons of malathion have been dropped on  Southern California. Close to 4 billion sterile Medflies have been released to  breed the pest out of existence.  </P> <P> The questions about the success of the eradication program have persisted  through these quiet weeks, driven by two disturbing factors that have left even  eradication program officials wary and uncertain -- a shortage of sterile flies  and the warm weather ahead.  </P> <P> The state's Medfly eradication program has been plagued with a serious shortage  of sterile flies, which are released by the millions to disrupt the breeding  cycle of the wild Medflies.  </P> <P> Because of production problems at three sterile-fly breeding facilities in  Hawaii, the program has been receiving about a third fewer flies than what  scientists have recommended.  </P> <P> Richard Rice, one of the five entomologists serving on the state's Medfly  Science Advisory Panel, has said that the shortage could open a "window of  opportunity" for the wild flies to breed.  </P> <P> Eradication project officials also have expressed concern about the shortage,  but add that the lack of flies is an encouraging sign that no serious damage  has been done.  </P> <P> With many warm months ahead, offering ideal conditions for both flies, there  also is the possibility of new discoveries popping up any day.  </P> <P> James Carey, a UC Davis entomologist and another member of the Medfly Science  Advisory Panel, said the historical pattern of a Medfly population surge in  late summer almost guarantees that more flies will be found.  </P> <P> Carey said that during the last 15 years in Southern California, only 9% of  Medflies have been trapped from January through July, while 69% have been found  in August, September and October.  </P> <P> "Based on that pattern, I'm not optimistic," Carey said. "This is the lull  before the storm. The only time I will be optimistic is if we go through the  summer and fall without a single fly. Then I'll be a believer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TALLYING MEDFLY COSTS  </P> <P> Cost of Medfly eradication program (to June 1): $36 million  </P> <P> Amount of malathion sprayed (as of May 30): 47,000 gallons  </P> <P> Number of sterile Medflies released (as of June 1): 3.6 billion  </P> <P> Number of people involved in eradication program: 487  </P> <P> First Medfly find: July 20, 1989  </P> <P> First malathion spray: Aug. 10, 1989  </P> <P> Maximum spray zone: 536 sq. miles  </P> <P> Medflies found: 270  </P> <P> Mexflies found (from September, 1989 to present): 11  </P> <P> SOURCE: Cooperative Medfly Project  </P></p>

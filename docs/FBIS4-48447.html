			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 19 May (AFP) -- About 30 wounded people  were killed in their beds when a mortar shell slammed into  Kigali's main hospital early Thursday [19 May], a United Nations  spokesman said, quoting reports by witnesses. UN officials were  on their way to the hospital to check the report, spokesman  Abdul Kabia said. It was unknown who had fired the mortar shell.    Fierce fighting between rebels and Army soldiers erupted  overnight around Kigali Airport and prevented a UN relief plane  from landing, Kabia said. Artillery and small arms fire resumed  overnight in various parts of Rwanda's capital, which had been  relatively quiet for several days.    UN officials shuttled between rebel and Army commanders  Wednesday in their latest attempt to win an agreement to make  the airport a UN-controlled neutral zone. But a spokesman for  the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front said the airport remained a  military target because it was surrounded by government  artillery positions and there was a big Army camp nearby.</p>

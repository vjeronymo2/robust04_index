			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Fidelity has 1.4% stake in YPF FIDELITY, the leading US investment fund company, has become the largest private investor in YPF, Argentina's recently-privatised oil company. The Economy Ministry confirmed yesterday that Fidelity paid Dollars 95m for its 1.4 per cent stake in YPF. According to data leaked to the local press yesterday, 20 of YPF's largest private investors now hold 16 per cent of its equity. Last month the government raised Dollars 3.04bn from the sale of 45.3 per cent of YPF. A further 12.7 per cent has been reserved for pensioners in Argentina. The federal and local governments and employees hold the remaining 42 per cent of the company's shares. Perez Companc, Argentina's third-largest company, and FIMA, a local unit trust fund, are the only Argentine groups with significant holdings in YPF, with 1.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively. Investment funds, including SG Warburg, Mercury Asset Management and Schroders of the UK and Capital Research and Management, Oppenheimer, and Alliance Capital of the US, make up the bulk of YPF's new private investors. Two foreign debt-driven investment funds run by foreign banks also took large stakes. Citicorp, acting through an investment company funded with Argentine foreign debt, and the APDT debt-for-equity fund took 1.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively.</p>

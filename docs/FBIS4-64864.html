			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl has  reiterated his view that "with the coming of spring, the climate  for a new upswing in Germany has got warmer." Speaking at the  21st round of talks on economic development in eastern Germany  on Monday [9 May], Kohl said in front of top industrialist and  trade union representatives that "the upswing that is becoming  apparent in western Germany will also have a favorable effect on  the further reconstruction of the east."    Industrial research in the new laender continues to be a  problem, with the number of people working in this field  declining drastically from 80,000 (1990) to 16,000. Kohl  pointed out that companies in the new laender have the important  task of developing new ideas, turning them into marketable  products, and opening up new markets for these. He said that  the Federal Government has supported research and development in  east German industry with some 2.4 billion marks since 1991.    Research Minister Paul Krueger and Economics Minister  Guenter  Rexrodt reported that industrial research in eastern Germany is  showing positive signs in spite of the difficult overall  situation. The shrinking process has clearly slowed down.    The president of the Federal Association of German Industry  (BDI), Tyll Necker, said that the BDI has called upon west  German industry to assign a large amount of research commissions  to companies in eastern Germany. This is included in a  "Purchasing Offensive East," which has helped a good deal in  promoting product sales. The president of the Chamber of  Handicrafts, Heribert Spaeth, announced new training initiatives  by companies in order to secure a sufficient number of  apprenticeship positions.</p>

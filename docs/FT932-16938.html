			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Royale Belge rises to BFr4.4bn ROYALE BELGE, the Belgian insurer, yesterday announced that its net consolidated profits rose 3.6 per cent last year to BFr4.4bn (Dollars 129.4m) from BFr4.2bn, in spite of economic and tax uncertainties. Turnover at the group, nearly 50 per cent of which is controlled by UAP, the French insurer, rose 5.1 per cent to BFr97.2bn. The company is proposing an increase in its net dividend to BFr147 per share from BFr140. The group announced it had finished restructuring itself into two operations, one working with independent brokers, the other with networks of salaried agents. Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, announced a return to profit before extraordinary charges, and reduced losses after tax and extraordinary charges. The group lost BFr2.65bn after tax and extraordinary items in 1992, compared with a loss of BFr4.8bn in 1991. Before extraordinary charges of BFr2.92bn against BFr3.73bn, mainly relating to the group's review of all balance sheet items, the company was narrowly profitable, recording current profit of BFr764m, compared with losses of BFr693m in 1991. Union Miniere is one of the main holdings of Societe Generale de Belgique, the country's largest holding company. La Generale, which announces its 1992 results next week, owns just over 82 per cent of the metals group.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (2): Most owners would welcome reform - Unfinished Legislation / Officials are keen to amend privity law but the Queen's speech in November, setting out the government's legislative programme for this parliament, did not mention it The commercial property market has been living with the cloud of potential legislation for so long that many in the industry now dismiss the threat. It is six years since the the Law Commission recommended abolition of Privity of Contract, which leaves the original tenant liable for rent under a lease even if it was assigned several years ago. The government has said that it will not enact retrospective legislation, so existing leases would not be affected. But will it find the time in the parliamentary timetable to introduce a bill ? Officials are keen to amend current privity law but the Queen's speech in November, setting out the government's legislative programme for this parliament, did not mention the issue. A private member's bill could still be introduced with government blessing. Conservative MP Mr Peter Thurnham introduced such a bill earlier this year, only to see its second reading cut short. Most property owners would welcome reform of the current law. Mr Richard Lay, commercial property spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, welcomed the Thurnham Bill. 'It is in the industry's interests that the matter is settled sooner rather than later,' he said. The British Property Federation, which represents property owners, has also said that it favours reform of privity, so long as landlords are given the right to approve assignees. At present, consent cannot be 'reasonably withheld.' The threat of legislation on the wider structure of commercial leases also appears to have receded. In July, the government said that it would not introduce legislation to curtail upward-only rent reviews. It asked the industry to agree a code of conduct to encourage more flexible lease terms. The voluntary approach has widespread support. Yet it is not clear that landlords and tenants will be able to agree a code of practice which satisfies either side or the government. The BPF has proposed a 'health warning' which reminds tenants that leases are negotiated in a free market. It argues that anything more prescriptive would be ignored by big landlords. Pressure groups representing tenants were hoping for something more. Without a consensus on this issue, there is an outside chance that the threat of legislation will return. Contaminated land is the one issue where the property profession would, almost unanimously, like to see legislation as soon as possible. A government policy statement on the issue last month received widespread support from within the industry and legislation - in the form of the environment and countryside bill - is expected within weeks. The policy statement set out the broad principles that legislation will follow. The most important is that land only needs to be cleaned to a standard suitable for its intended use. This is designed to avoid the vast clean-up costs which have dogged countries such as the US. The principle that the polluter should pay remains, although landowners will be liable where the original polluter is no longer around. Importantly, banks which lent to polluting companies look likely to escape liability in all but the most exceptional circumstances. This pleases many in the banking and property worlds, who feared that banks could stop lending to 'dirty' industries if they were held to be liable. Moreover, the policy statement confirmed once and for all that the government has dropped plans for a register of contaminated land based on past use. This proposal, originally contained in section 143 of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, caused widespread outcry and was withdrawn last year. Under the new proposals, local authorities will maintain a record of significantly contaminated land in their areas, but based on actual rather than potential pollution. The authorities will also have to specify what action needs to be taken to clean up the site.</p>

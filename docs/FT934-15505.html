			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Russia may conclude commercial debt agreement soon RUSSIA could conclude an agreement on its commercial debt in a few weeks, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, said yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. It would then start making payments on debts to commercial banks which have been subjected to 90-day rollovers until now. Moscow had set aside Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m) for London Club debt servicing this year, to be paid in three instalments of Dollars 166m, Mr Shokhin said. Russia had failed to conclude a rescheduling agreement with western commercial banks in Frankfurt last week because of outstanding disagreements and the banks' desire to consult further among themselves.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Shenzhen blasts trigger fires CHINESE firefighters early yesterday extinguished blazes triggered by a chain of massive industrial explosions in the southern city of Shenzhen, Reuter reports. A local government spokesman said seven bodies had so far been recovered following Thursday's disaster. It was not known how many people were missing. The semi-official China News Service quoted spokesman Huang Xinhua as saying 137 people had been admitted to hospital and that as many as 70 people could have been killed. Witnesses likened the explosion to an atomic bomb's mushroom cloud and said it could be seen on the northern fringes of Hong Kong just across the border from Shenzhen. Fires from an initial chemical blast at the Anmao Dangerous Goods Shipping and Storage Company in Qingshuihe, north of Shenzhen city centre, ignited warehouses storing inflammable goods. There were seven minor blasts between the two major explosions at the plant, which is run by the Chinese military, and the blaze took more than 10 hours to control. Thousands of residents were evacuated. An investigation has been launched into the cause of the blast, a spokesman said.</p>

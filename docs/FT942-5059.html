			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Heads obliged to pass information Head teachers will be legally obliged to pass information about the national curriculum to their staff under teachers' pay and conditions arrangements announced today. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said teachers were 'frustrated that information sent to the school, such as the initial proposals to slim down the national curriculum and circulars', was not made available to all staff. This now becomes a duty for heads. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which lobbied for the change, said he both welcomed it and regretted that it had been necessary.</p>

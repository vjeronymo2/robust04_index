Custodio said  that the Philippines should be concerned over the United States'  move in reviving a provision of the U.S. law known as Super 301  which if not settled could erupt into a trade war. Custodio said  the "U.S. move is a discordant note of the emphasis in the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round (UR) negotiation." [passage  omitted]    The United States will come out with a target list of  countries which it deemed to have erected trade barriers against  the United States.    Apparently, the Clinton administration's decision to revive  the Super 301 came after its failure to settle trade disputes  with Japan, where the U.S. has a $59.3-billion trade imbalance.    Although the issue is bilateral in nature, Custodio said the  situation may reach to a point where "every man has to fend for  himself."    "The point of the matter is that we are entering a stage  under the Uruguay Round where most unilateral action based on  national objective is subject to multilateral obligations and  multilateral disciplines," Custodio stressed.    He added that the conclusion of the UR signals that it is  now  ready to give powers to international trading which provides a  forum for settling disputes. "There is no room for unilateral  action in adversarial manner," Custodio stressed. If the United  States pursues the trade sanction against Japan, Custodio said  "we cannot prevent other countries from picking the same tool  where countries have to defend themselves." But if the U.S. and  Japan dispute is taken up in the GATT (General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade) a trade war can be prevented but if not then  a trade war looms.    "We are voicing our concern," Custodio said noting the  Philippine concern is also a very valid concern of other  developing countries. The Philippines was once subjected to the  U.S. Super 301 for alleged rampant violations of intellectual  property rights but we have come to successful arrangement last  year," Custodio said.    Aside from being a trade tool, the United States is also  using Super 301 as a political tool where the United States may  impose trade sanctions against countries.</p>

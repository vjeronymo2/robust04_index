			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / The bank that has to say 'whoops': Problems faced by Kleinwort Benson Slipping on banana skins has become almost a way of life for Kleinwort Benson, the 200-year-old City of London merchant bank. The familiar cry of 'whoops' will be uttered by the bank's executives once again on February 26 when its 1991 results are published. In the six months to June 30, Kleinwort made pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.7m. However, analysts believe profits for the full year were in the vicinity of Pounds 30m, a meagre return on the group's equity of Pounds 412m. In other words, Kleinwort made tiny profits in the second half, even though Mr David Peake, chairman, was expressing 'cautious optimism' about prospects last April. In four out of the five years since the stock market was deregulated at the end of 1986 - including 1991 - Kleinwort's financial performance has been worse than management or outside analysts had been expecting. The nadir was 1990, when it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 68m, due in large part to a Pounds 34m loss from the bungled sale of shares in Premier Consolidated Oilfields. But even in its best year of late, 1989, it failed to meet its target of pre-tax profits equivalent to 25 per cent of capital. Much of the blame for the poor performance lay with its stockbroking subsidiary, which had been acquired in stages in the mid-1980s. But Kleinwort's executives say the broker - now called Kleinwort Benson Securities, though its original name was Grieveson Grant - is performing adequately. So it is all the more galling for them that pre-tax profits in 1991 are still below par. On this occasion the problems have arisen in one of its traditional businesses: lending to companies. Analysts believe that Kleinwort's results will include a Pounds 40m bad debt charge. However, the losses could have been far greater, if management had not decided to shrink the loan book. When Mr Peake and the chief executive, Mr Jonathan Agnew, took the helm at the beginning of 1989, Kleinwort had total loans to companies, excluding undrawn facilities, of Pounds 2.3bn. By the end of 1991, this had been more than halved. Indeed, Kleinwort's rate of loss as a proportion of total loans does not compare unfavourably with many banks. Its Pounds 40m charge is thought by analysts to consist of a great number of provisions against small loans. Kleinwort executives admit they were were too slow in reducing exposure to small and medium-sized companies, the corporate sector recession. But the error was spotted 18 months ago and now loans are made only to big, sound companies. There is one bigger exposure - of Pounds 18m - to the French publisher Hachette which is causing concern to analysts. Kleinwort acquired this exposure in an indirect fashion, via an investment in the French cable television company, La Cinq, which filed for bankruptcy at the beginning of the year. Kleinwort had been given an indemnity against possible losses on the La Cinq investment by Hachette, which already owned 25 per cent of the TV company. It is confident that its 'risk is on Hachette'. So analysts are not expecting it to make any significant provision against the La Cinq exposure in its 1991 results, though they point out that Hachette itself is burdened by big debts. But for all these problems, Kleinwort has no intention of completely withdrawing from lending to companies, though some merchant banks, such as Lazards and SG Warburg, have almost no presence in the lending business. However it will reduce its loan portfolio - perhaps by another Pounds 300m. But what about the recent performance of Kleinwort's other businesses? Even if the loan losses are ignored, Kleinwort's profits were disappointing in 1991 - the return from the merchant banking division, which includes stockbroking, earned a rate of return on capital probably half the company's target rate. Progress has been made by its stockbroker, which now has a market share in 'UK customer business' - deals with investors rather than with other marketmakers or wholesalers - of around 7 per cent and is making a modest profit. But the management and financial resources devoted to saving this business may have deprived other activities of support, at some cost. Kleinwort's corporate finance department, the traditional heart of the group which gives advice to companies, has lost ground to rivals such as Schroders and Warburg, on the basis of various league tables of merchant banks' activity. Mr Agnew and Mr Peake undoubtedly inherited problems. However, shareholders' patience - including that of the Kleinwort family, owner of 20 per cent of the shares - may soon start to wear thin. One possible remedy was mooted last year. In March 1991 Kleinwort began talks with France's Banque Nationale de Paris about an alliance between their international merchant banking operations. Such an agreement would involve BNP boosting its holding in Kleinwort from 4.8 per cent to at least 20 per cent. Indeed, a full takeover of Kleinwort cannot be ruled out. Such a link would give Kleinwort access to a continental network matched only in the City of London by Morgan Grenfell, whose parent is Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank. However, these talks are currently on ice, pending completion of BNP's negotiations on establishing a mutual co-operation arrangement with Germany's Dresdner Bank, which is expected in May. So Kleinwort is keen to play down the importance of a BNP deal, which will not take place until the year end, if ever. In the meantime Mr Peake and Mr Agnew have a higher priority. They are on permanent banana skin alert.</p>

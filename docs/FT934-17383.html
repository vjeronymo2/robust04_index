			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Full endorsement for ERM stance LABOUR will fight next year's elections to the European parliament on a platform of support for economic integration and fixed exchange rates, conference decided yesterday. Delegates gave overwhelming support to a National Executive Committee policy statement reaffirming Labour's faith in 'a co-ordinated strategy for Europe-wide economic recovery.' The statement confirms Labour's support for the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, in spite of the collapse of the system earlier this year. It says that British re-entry 'will clearly require the adoption of policies designed to strengthen our weakened industrial capacity and revive our depressed economy'. However, the statement does not set out a timetable for a British re-entry, which the government has ruled out for the duration of the present parliament. The statement was strongly opposed by the leftwing Campaign group, which described it as a capitulation to the 'strait-jacket of Euro-monetarism'. Mr Tony Benn, MP for Chesterfield, dismissed the statement as 'the most Euro-federalist document ever produced' by the Labour party. The shadow cabinet said the statement would provide the basis for a Labour landslide in the European elections in June. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the election offered 'an excellent opportunity to take a crucial step towards getting the Tories out'.</p>

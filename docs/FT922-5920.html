			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Dowty claims TI's accounting methods exaggerate earnings DOWTY GROUP, the aerospace and specialist engineering company fighting a hostile Pounds 494m bid from TI, yesterday launched a sweeping attack on its aggressor's accounting techniques, which it said were at the very boundary of acceptable practice. Dowty said the accounting treatment exaggerated the true level of the engineering company's earnings per share and the quality of its management and, as a result, gave Dowty shareholders an inaccurate impression of the quality of the shares they are being asked to accept. In a letter sent yesterday to TI's shareholders, as well as its own, Dowty says that not only was the cash alternative of 175p a share inadequate, but that the value of TI and its future was uncertain. TI said the letter looked like a smokescreen. 'An increasingly desperate Dowty is trying to divert attention away from its own shortcomings and the real issues of the bid,' the company said. TI has dismissed Dowty's claims about its accounting as the raking over of old issues which shareholders have fully understood for some time. It says Dowty shareholders are being offered a fully underwritten cash alternative and that in any case TI no longer utilises the particular accounting practice which the City roundly criticised in 1989. Dowty, however, says shareholders may not have fully understood the implications. In its letter, it says TI has 'boosted its earnings record effectively by charging costs against reserves'. This had helped TI report earnings growth from 29.6p in 1987 to 44.8p in 1991. Specifically Dowty concentrates on 'retrospective' goodwill write-offs, including a Pounds 52m provision taken in the 1989 accounts which related to the acquisition of Bundy in the US the previous year. Dowty says these provisions against the balance sheet led to 'low quality earnings' as they related to costs that should have been taken through the profit and loss account. Dowty then restated what it calls TI's 'hard core' earnings in a way it says is consistent with how most other companies report. It concludes that TI actually increased its earnings only from 28p to 30.5p over the past five years, a rise of 8 per cent, rather than the 51 per cent it actually reported. The scale of TI's provisioning at the time of acquisitions also meant that its assets had hardly grown over the five year period, Dowty said. It was very unusual for an engineering company to have such little asset backing. In order to continue this deceptive earnings growth TI needed to make another acquisition. Without an acquisition, TI would be left with only Pounds 16m of provisions against acquisition costs and would soon be left with no opportunity to take costs against reserves, Dowty says. The attack on TI's accounting policies marks the beginning of the last 10 days of the bid before it closes on June 10 and an intensive round of presentations to institutional shareholders.</p>

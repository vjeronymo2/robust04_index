			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / House prices expected to fall 2% HOUSE PRICES are likely to fall by an average of 2 per cent this year according to a review of the housing market published today. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the firm of stockbrokers, forecasts that prices will not rise until 1994 even though it expects the number of house sales to rise by 12 per cent this year. The firm says that numerous empty, unsold properties on the market will continue to depress prices even when sales start to recover. A Financial Times poll last week of estate agents, house builders and mortgage lenders showed that there had been a sharp increase in interest from prospective house purchasers since the beginning of the year. Very few agents and builders felt, however, that the improvement, which traditionally occurs after Christmas, would lead to a rise in prices. The UBS study says there were at least 222,000 empty, unsold homes at the beginning of this year. They included homes repossessed by building societies, houses and flats which builders had not been able to sell, and a growing number of inherited homes still seeking purchasers. UBS expects mortgage lenders to repossess a further 80,000 homes this year. That is after taking account of the government's 'mortgage-to-rent' rescue plan, which the study says will apply to about 15,000 homes and 'will have only a marginal beneficial effect'. The study cites three factors acting as brakes on the housing market. They are a more cautious lending policy by building societies and banks, rising unemployment and concern that a Labour government would increase taxes. Falling commercial property prices and rents will benefit small businesses, according to a survey published by National Westminster Bank. The south-east and south-west are most likely to see an increase in property available, while the biggest price falls are likely to be in London and the south-west, the bank says.

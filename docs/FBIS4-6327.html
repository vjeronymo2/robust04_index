			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- More than 300 North  Koreans who escaped from Siberian logging yards are hiding in  Russia, besides the 200 or so who have already sought refuge in  the South, a senior government official said Sunday.    The official said, "the government has investigated the  number of escapees from Siberian logging camps and found that  there are still 300 more North Korean escapees who have not  sought refuge in the South."    However, he said, once the government actually allows the  North Koreans to settle here, more escapees are expected to seek  refuge in South Korea.    "It seems that they have not visited the South Korean  Embassy  to seek refuge for fear that it would harm their families in  North Korea," he said.    The government has also discovered that some escapees want  to  settle in Russia rather than in South Korea.    "If they wish to live in Russia, the government will support  their settlement there through consultation with the Russian  Government."    North Korea operates logging yards in Siberia under a  contract with the Russian Government, with hundreds of North  Korean loggers reportedly having escaped due to poor working  conditions and alleged infringement of human rights.    The logging contract between Russia and North Korea was to  expire at the end of last year and the two sides are now  negotiating renewal after Moscow demanded an improvement in  human rights conditions at the camps.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Chamber of Deputies of the Croatian Assembly  wound up today's discussion on Croatia's foreign policy. Around  20 deputies as well as Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, took part. After a recess until  1600, the chamber is to vote on resolutions that a multiparty  commission has proposed to the chamber. Kreso Zadravec and  Jasenka Dudic have a report on the assembly's work so far:  [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Addressing the deputies, Mate  Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister,  spoke about the strategic goals of Croatian foreign policy.  Explaining the goals of the joint Yugoslav-Croatian  declaration, he said that the present situation is untenable and  a military option would cause casualties and the complete  isolation of Croatia, which, as he said, we were clearly told.  There is no compromising over our fundamental goals --  reintegration and the return of refugees -- which will be our  guiding idea in the normalization of relations. Asked why  Croatia was not recognized by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  before the signing of the declaration, Granic replied:    [Begin Granic recording] Of course, we demanded that in  precise terms. However, as Milosevic was not ready for it at  that time, we did not establish relations at the level of  ambassadors, but at the level of offices, bureaus, refraining  from forming judgements in advance. [end recording]    [Correspondent] He also dwelled on the resolution of the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina where, as he said, Croat-Muslim  relations ought to be permanently regulated for political,  economic, and strategic reasons with the cessation of  hostilities as a priority task.    He again denied allegations about the presence of Croatian  troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said that he had informed the  Security Council about the fact that between 1,500 and 2,000  Croat volunteers of Bosnian origin are in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  while at least 3,000 to 8,000 Muslim volunteers in  Bosnia-Herzegovina come from Islamic countries.    Among other things, Minister Granic spoke about Croatia's  admission to the Council of Europe and said that the admission  was primarily blocked because of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. He supported [Serbian National Party Vice  Chairman] Pejnovic's proposal that legitimate [as heard] Serbs  from the assembly be included in the talks with international  factors.</p>

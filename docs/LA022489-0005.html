			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUATEMALA'S CRUEL SIDE  </P> <P> Even in Central America, where military men have never been overly concerned  with the niceties of human rights, the Guatemalan army has a fearsome  reputation. Its generals and colonels expound a fiercely protective doctrine of  national security, which their soldiers enforce with cold-blooded efficiency.  That is why most outside analysts agree that Guatemala, alone among the many  nations fighting local insurgencies, was able to crush its guerrillas.  </P> <P> But that victory, achieved without assistance from the United States, produced,  in addition to tens of thousands of deaths, some profound side effects. One of  the more visible side effects was recently documented by Times correspondent  Kenneth Freed, who visited several "model villages" built in Guatemala's  hinterlands to resettle Indian peasants displaced by warfare. While government  officials proudly display these villages as symbols of progress -- complete  with running water, electricity and other modern amenities -- they are also  plagued by underlying social tensions. Many of the residents cannot afford to  pay for electricity. Males are forced to take part in civil-defense patrols  organized by the military. Others are pressed into labor gangs, which are not  paid for the work they do. Saddest of all, many refugees are so alienated and  isolated in their new surroundings that drunkenness is common. As one resident  told Freed, "Coming here was not our idea. The army told us we were going to do  it. Life was hard before, but it was our life. Now it isn't."  </P> <P> Pondering Freed's graphic descriptions of the conditions in these villages, a  reader in the United States might be reminded of the social problems on many  Indian reservations in this country. In some important ways, the comparison is  apt. Certainly the anti-guerrilla campaign in Guatemala had an undercurrent of  racial warfare. Most of the war's victims were Indian, descendants of the  ancient Maya. The victors were the Spanish-speaking Guatemalans of mixed  ancestry who run the government and its institutions, including the army. And  while some government officials claim the model villages are a solution to the  social problems that plague Guatemala's Indian population, like illiteracy and  poor health, the real reason they came into existence was to help the army wage  its counterinsurgency campaign.  </P> <P> The United States has given only minimal aid to the Guatemalan military since  the 1970s, when the generals then running that country refused to accept U.S.  military assistance because the Carter Administration had the temerity to  criticize their human-rights record. Given the harsh methods the Guatemalan  army used to win its war, U.S. officials can be grateful that they have no  blood on their hands. But for the same reason, there is probably little this  country can do to rectify the conditions that exist in the model villages.  </P> <P> But there is a civilian government in Guatemala City now, which technically has  some authority over the military (although how much remains an open question).  That government badly needs, and wants, U.S. economic assistance. The United  States should provide whatever it can. But in doing so U.S. officials must make  their disapproval of model villages clear, and do all they can to ensure that  none of the aid this country gives Guatemala is used for such dubious  experiments.  </P></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Management: Quality street cred - TQM is struggling to make an impact in Europe They were handing out the Oscars to Europe's leading 'quality' companies last week. But amid all the razzamatazz in Turin no one seemed to notice that this year's winning businesses - like some of last year's - are foreign owned. The 1993 award conferred by the European Foundation for Quality Management was won by last year's runner up, the European operations of textile products group Milliken - a US company with its headquarters in Georgia. ICL, whose manufacturing and supply division had to settle for second place, is an 80 per cent subsidiary of Fujitsu of Japan. Ranx Xerox, which was the overall victor in 1992, the first year the Award was given, is a hybrid, 50 per cent controlled by the US Xerox Corporation. The non-European parentage of all three companies is too much of a coincidence to let pass. At the very least it reinforces the view that Total Quality Management - the addictive religion of the quality movement - remains better understood and more widely accepted in North America (where it was invented) and in Japan (where it was first properly applied). Nearly all the attendees at last week's Quality Forum organised by the EFQM, which culminated in the prize-giving ceremony in Turin, were converts. The challenge they face is how to spread the word beyond the tiny elite of mostly large companies which practice what they preach, and how to reinvigorate a message which may be losing its force. At its baldest, TQM means applying quality right across an organisation  - to delivery systems, administration and customers as well as to a product or service - in the quest for competitive advantage. TQM reached Europe in the early to mid-1980s and has been as durable as any recent management idea, although it has encountered considerable scepticism in the market place. For some it was an attractively simple concept, which has now been needlessly overloaded with jargon and used as a meaningless 'catch all' for other management nostrums. Consultancy firms - always on the look out for new ways to sell their services - have contributed to a feeling that TQM has been superseded by concepts such as Just In Time manufacturing or Business Process Re-engineering. The fuss over European-wide certification - notably complaints by small and medium-sized suppliers about the time and money spent on acquiring the quality standard ISO 9000 to appease their more demanding customers - has also given TQM a bad name. On top of this, surveys have shown that TQM programmes have too often failed to deliver the sort of benefits anticipated by managers. The correlation between TQM and financial performance is particularly hard to prove, though one recently demonstrated that out of a sample of 29 companies running formal programmes, 70 per cent did better than the average in their sectors. Mike Gallagher, manager of the European quality award, acknowledges the confusion but argues that TQM has highlighted four 'timeless' ideas 'which are constantly of importance to the top team'. These are the importance of the customer; the need to involve everyone in the company; the concept of process management (every business activity should be viewed as a process); and the goal of continuous improvement. Business Process Re-engineering, he argues, is 'really just looking at process management starting with first principles. It does not provide all the answers - what about employee involvement or customers, for instance?' Besides its annual prizes and award, EFQM's mission is to stimulate quality activity as widely as possible, notably through the application of its self-assessment model*. This is based on the simple premise that processes are the means by which the organisation harnesses and releases the talents of its people to produce results. As the illustration demonstrates, customer satisfaction, people (employee) satisfaction and impact on society are achieved through a company's leadership driving its policy and strategy, people management, resources and processes. This ultimately leads to excellence in business results. Each of the nine elements is a criterion which can be used to assess the organisation's progress towards TQM and thereafter to adopt improvement strategies. The percentages shown are those used for the purpose of the EFQM award, but can be varied depending on the nature of the company concerned. Besides its use as a self-improvement tool, Gallagher believes that the EFQM self-assessment process offers a sound basis for strategic direction and priority setting. Naturally enough, strong endorsement comes from ICL and Milliken Europe. The latter's chairman and managing director, Clive Jeanes, adds that the assessment process for the award was 'a great learning tool' and among other things prompted him to institute bi-monthly meetings of top executives from the company's four European businesses. Jeanes says Milliken Europe first adopted a planned approach to quality in 1981. 'We have always believed in buying the best technology, but I remember being struck how the Japanese in those days were more efficient than us using machines that were 20 years older.' By 1985, the company noted that measuring performance was having a bottom line impact, but it still had not asked its customers what they wanted. 'When we did we were amazed to find that after product quality, on-time delivery was the next most important item. At that stage, however, only 75 per cent were arriving when we said they would.' Jeanes says Milliken's TQM took off in 1987 and 1988. Before visiting Japan in 1991 - when 24 of the company's executives saw 10 companies in 10 days - he read six textbooks on the subject. 'With a quality programme you add to your costs in the very short term, you recognise problems you didn't know about. But the payback over two to three years is tremendous.' *Brochures on self assessment and applications for the 1994 award (deadline March 18th) from EFQM, Avenue des Pleiades 19, 1200 Brussels.</p>

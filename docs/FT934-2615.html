			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered The rapid rise of Standard Chartered's shares, which have more than doubled this year, prompts a second look at the fundamentals. Part of the increase can be explained by the fact that Standard is a much more direct reflection of the Hong Kong economy than HSBC since the latter bought Midland. Its shares thus tend to track the Hang Seng index more closely. And earnings look likely to bounce strongly over the next couple of years. But it would be rash to rely too heavily on the third factor underpinning the shares: the prospect of lavish dividend growth implicit in a yield of little more than 2 per cent. Standard's dividend, which was cut to 20p from 35p in 1990, costs less than Pounds 50m. The bank's tax rate is likely to fall as the Bombay provisions, which were not deductible, drop away. Together with buoyant earnings in Hongkong, that should ensure that the dividend is covered as much as four times this year. Standard could afford a striking increase in its payout and still retain the bulk of its earnings to fund future expansion. Bulls argue that the case has become even stronger after last week's preference share issue brought its tier one capital ratio close to 6 per cent. Yet the mere fact that the bank is prepared to raise expensive capital in this way is an indication of its need for capital strength. Not only must Standard satisfy growing loan demand in Asia, where most of its profits are generated, it also requires an ample cushion to absorb the occasional accident that is bound to strike an institution with such extensive operations in developing countries. Different arguments apply to domestic UK banks whose profits are also rising as provisions fall. With loan demand sluggish, they may not need much extra capital. Their generosity to shareholders may be correspondingly greater.</p>

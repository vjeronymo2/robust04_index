			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hanson 'over zealous' on changes LORD HANSON, chairman of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday apologised to shareholders for 'over zealously' attempting to change the articles of association which would have given him more power at annual meetings. Hanson withdrew the offending changes before yesterday's extraordinary meeting after a number of large shareholders expressed their concern. Asked by one whether the group's non-executives had agreed with the proposed changes, Lord Hanson said: 'Not all the non-executives were able to go through the fine print. It was presented to the board but we did not go through the fine detail . . . that was a mistake.' The six non-executive directors include Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, part of the Jardine Matheson empire, Sir Christopher Harding, chairman of BET and Mr Kenneth Baker, the Conservative MP. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said after the meeting that there had been no question of Hanson 'trying to slip' the changes through the board without the non-executives noticing. However, he said it may have been the case that the executive directors had been deficient in providing them with all the material necessary. The extraordinary meeting was originally called to approve a scrip dividend plan which requires the modification of the company's articles of association. At the same time Hanson proposed introducing a number of other alterations to the articles designed 'to facilitate the orderly conduct of meetings' by giving the chairman of Hanson's annual meeting (which is always Lord Hanson) greater powers. The changes would have limited shareholders' rights to nominate directors, speak at annual meetings, call for votes at meetings and amend agenda items. Lord Hanson said: 'Certain amendments that we proposed were misinterpreted as a move on our part to restrict shareholders' rights at meetings. Nothing could have been further from our minds. But since some of our shareholders were unhappy with the proposed changes we decided not to proceed with them.' Many of the group's US institutional shareholders were the most vocal in their opposition to the proposed changes. Over the past two years the US shareholding has increased from 9 per cent to almost 25 per cent of the group. In response to questions about the strike at 13 of the 29 mines at Peabody Coal, one of the group's subsidiaries, Lord Hanson, said he would rather 'sit out the strike' than give in to intimidation. The meeting yesterday approved the revised executive share option schemes to bring them into line with the Association of British Insurers' current guidelines. A further extraordinary meeting to consider the scrip dividend plan will be held on July 23.</p>

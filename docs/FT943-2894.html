			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Logica advances to Pounds 13.5m - Significant turnround in North America behind 50% improvement Profits before tax at Logica, the computing services company, rose 50 per cent in the year to June 30, after a significant turnround in North America, which saw the US operation in profit for the first time since 1989. The result was ahead of market expectations and the shares rose 14p to 318p. Mr Martin Read, chief executive, said the improvement was a result of rationalisation and restructuring, coupled with a powerful focus on key markets implemented by a new and effective management team. Pre-tax profits came in at Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 9m). In the UK, where Logica makes about half its sales, profits rose only marginally to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 9.2m). The US, however, turned a Pounds 2.6m loss last time into a Pounds 300,000 profit. In continental Europe, profits rose 38 per cent to Pounds 3.6m on strong underlying growth, but the company has still to improve its performance in the Asia Pacific region where a Pounds 300,000 loss was repeated. Revenues grew five per cent to Pounds 228.8m (Pounds 217.4m). Earnings per share rose 61 per cent to 14p. A final dividend of 3.6p is recommended making a total of 5p - a 25 per cent rise. Interest income halved to Pounds 495,000 (Pounds 942,000), a result of lower interest rates and a decline in average cash balances, which fell to Pounds 15.3m after a number of acquisitions. The tax rate, however, improved as overseas subsidiaries moved into profit, eliminating unrelieved tax losses. Operating profits rose 61 per cent to Pounds 13m (Pounds 8m), but Mr Read said he was still dissatisfied with the 5.9 per cent gross margin. He believes it possible to improve margins to 10 per cent and above. In the second half of last year, UK margins rose from 7.4 per cent to 9.5 per cent, as restructuring and tighter operational control had their effect. Logica is a broadly-based computing services group with its main activities in the finance, government, energy and telecommunications sectors. COMMENT Martin Read has reasons to feel pleased, but not complacent, about his first 18 months at Logica. He has kept his promises, delivering improved growth and profitability in a steady, unspectacular way. His no-nonsense approach has proved effective in a company hitherto better known for chutzpah than tough management. Poorly performing Italian and German operations have been closed and the black hole of North America stopped at last. The company culture is changing. Mr Read believes he is half to two thirds of the way through the transformation. The company has won some significant orders, notably a key RAF logistics project and the order book is healthy. Nevertheless, the market remains fragile. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m or 18.6p of earnings are expected next year giving a prospective p/e of about 17. Good value, therefore, with an excellent 1996 in prospect if European and US economies hold steady.</p>

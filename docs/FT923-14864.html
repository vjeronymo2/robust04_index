			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / The fragile truce is broken: Co-operation is giving way to confrontation in South Africa President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela this week gave notice that the battle for post apartheid South Africa is about to begin in earnest. Amid a welter of often vituperative exchanges between the two leaders and their lieutenants, the fragile truce established when Mr Mandela walked to freedom two and a half years ago has finally collapsed. It may yet be restored if wiser heads prevail, whether within South Africa or from outside. But unless that happens very soon, industrial strife and bitter confrontation on township streets and city centres seem inevitable. President de Klerk's anxiously awaited television appearance last Thursday evoked memories of an earlier watershed in the country's history. Seven years ago South Africa and the world watched their screens to see whether Mr de Klerk's predecessor, Mr P W Botha, would cross the Rubicon and press ahead with reform. He did not; and his finger-wagging, pugnacious television performance triggered the worst crisis since Sharpeville. Mr Botha rejected majority rule and retreated into the political cul-de-sac from which Mr de Klerk still has to escape. He has yet to show that his insistence on a power-sharing agreement can be reconciled with Mr Mandela's demand for majority rule, notwithstanding the optimistic gloss he placed on the last round of constitutional talks last May. 'We were very close to reaching an agreement,' Mr de Klerk told his television audience on Thursday night, 'which would have led to the first election in which all South Africans would have voted.' Within months, Mr de Klerk continued, South Africa could have had an interim government and a transitional constitution ensuring the rights of all, which 'would have prevented domination and the abuse of power'. It would be difficult to find a member of the ANC who would agree with this assessment. Mr de Klerk's unrepentant stance on Thursday night will have confirmed that little, if anything, has changed to narrow the gap between the two sides. Far from backing away from his concept of power-sharing, Mr de Klerk made it clear that he believes it is a viable option. For a man confronted with the most serious crisis of his career, Mr de Klerk looked and sounded remarkably confident. It was as if he believed that in South Africa's hour of need he could play the role of a statesman, addressing his message over the heads of squabbling political leaders to a silent majority yearning for reassurance that peace and stability were within reach. 'I appeal to all South Africans, wherever you may be, whatever community or party you may belong to, be calm and responsible,' he urged. 'Say 'No' to those who try to incite anger and hatred. Say 'No' to any act or deed which will endanger your job or your security.' For most observers with experience of the mood and circumstances of Johannesburg's black townships, the 'just say no' appeal seemed risible. Yet Mr de Klerk has experienced that anger at first hand. Furious residents of Boipatong, scene of the massacre of 42 residents last month which precipitated the current crisis, drove the president away when he attempted to convey his sympathy. Mr de Klerk, however, had an explanation: it was not a spontaneous response but a politically organised protest, he told listeners. This may be partly true, for the ANC had advance warning of his visit. But if Mr de Klerk believes that he would otherwise have received a sympathetic and appreciative welcome, he is misreading the township mood. But while Mr de Klerk was playing statesman on television he was also preparing for the elections that he believes lie ahead. On the morning of his address to the nation, he consolidated his own alliance with Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, leader of the predominantly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, whom he met with other conservative black politicians. Later that day, he sought to drive a wedge through the coalition led by Mr Mandela. It took the form of a memorandum to the ANC leader, putting the government's formal reply to the organisation's terms for the resumption of talks at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). It provided striking confirmation of Mr de Kerk's political game plan, based on a seemingly unshakeable belief that - provided the ruling National Party plays its cards right - it will remain central to the government of South Africa. Going on the offensive, he angrily accused the ANC of responsibility for political violence and warned that 'mass mobilisation' could jeopardise stability. More important, he singled out for attack two of the ANC's most important allies - the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the South African Communist Party - accusing them of seeking to foment an 'insurrection'. Even during the most cordial period in relations with the ANC, government ministers have expressed unease about forming a coalition with a party with such supporters. In his memorandum to Mr Mandela, the South African president effectively said that, as presently constituted, an ANC'National Party coalition is ruled out. Critical to his strategy of appealing to the silent majority over the head of the ANC, however, is the question of whether Mr de Klerk has read the mood of the townships and the black community as a whole accurately. Many observers believe that he may be underestimating the strength and passion of African nationalism. Nowhere was this more clearly displayed than earlier in the week when the ANC-led coalition assembled in Boipatong's football stadium to lead the mourning for the massacre victims. Old rivalries between the ANC and the radical Pan Africanist Congress were set aside as speaker after speaker, led by Cosatu's fiery general secretary, Mr Jay Naidoo, endorsed the call for 'mass action' - a series of strikes, demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience designed to force Mr de Klerk to capitulate to majority rule. 'Every time when we try to negotiate, they tell us to go to hell,' said Mr Naidoo. 'We will take them to hell with us,' he declared to roars of approval. This apocalyptic vision may be distant. Mr Mandela has to take into account the fact that many black South Africans, notwithstanding their impatience for change, will be apprehensive at this prospect. On the other hand, those to whom it appeals, notably the young, jobless blacks, may conclude that the veteran, essentially moderate ANC leader should be supplanted by somebody more radical. Adding to Mr Mandela's predicament is the fact that aside from mass action he has few weapons to bring to bear. The ANC's guerrilla army poses no significant threat, while the prospect of a resumption of trade sanctions is at best remote. Mr Mandela believes, however, he can veto Mr de Klerk's strategy by refusing to co-operate with him. It remains to be seen whether the ANC campaign can be sustained in the face of high unemployment, and of the security forces that Mr de Klerk has made clear will be vigorously deployed. Even as the two sides were preparing for confrontation, influential voices of alarm were starting to be heard. In Cape Town yesterday, where earlier this week police fired on demonstrators, Archbishop Desmond Tutu was expressing concern about the wisdom of mass action. 'I am worried,' he said: 'Having marched, what then? It's impressive but, in a way, so what? I am not entirely persuaded that the ANC and its allies would always be able to ensure that these demonstrations are peaceful.' Some observers believe that the gap between the government and the ANC over terms for the resumption of Codesa talks has, despite the furore, been closing. Mr de Klerk has moved some way towards meeting the ANC demand for an international commission of inquiry into the Boipatong massacre. Two legal experts from abroad have joined the Goldstone Commission, currently inquiring into township violence, while the local police investigation will receive external evaluation. Other demands, including an end to alleged covert security force operations and a ban on dangerous weapons in public, are in principle at least not resisted by government. But even observers inclined to a charitable view of the government's role in township violence acknowledge that Mr de Klerk needs to put principles into practice. The disclosure that former members of a notorious counter-insurgency unit are now part of a police unit reinforces speculation about government involvement in political killings. Nor has the government's reluctance to disband the 32 Battalion, which has been strongly criticised by the Goldstone inquiry, inspire confidence. For most black South Africans and many whites, Mr de Klerk's renewed denial of government complicity in violence does not carry weight. One senior western diplomat said that Mr de Klerk's handling of the issue to date suggested the president was either 'complicit, incompetent or complacent'. Only Mr de Klerk's fiercest detractors suggest the former, but few people can now convincingly defend him against the other charges. 'What Boipatong has shown, above all, is the cost of a police force which nobody trusts, which cannot prevent its own members from opening fire at the most disastrous moments, which will not disband its covert units,' wrote one political commentator. Western diplomats, once reluctant to advocate external involvement in South Africa, are coming to the conclusion that the time may have come for a United Nations, Commonwealth or European Community role. Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary general is already in town. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, is expected to lead a 'troika' of Community ministers on a fact-finding visit within the next three to four weeks. And Mr de Klerk on Thursday said he would consider creating a joint monitoring body on violence, on which representatives of the international community might serve in an 'observer capacity'. Western diplomats take cautious hope from this tentative offer, to which the ANC has yet to respond. But they remain deeply apprehensive about stepping into the South African minefield. 'We might be prepared to help monitor a peace agreement adopted by de Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi,' said one, 'but they must first make peace.' Such is the climate of distrust and hostility, however, it is difficult to see South African politicians managing to reconcile their differences without the help of outsiders.</p>

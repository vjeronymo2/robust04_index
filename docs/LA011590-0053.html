			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> TOP PRIORITY PUT ON KEEPING OPEN SPACE  </P> <P> Open space preservation, a new civic center and financial concerns are the  issues facing San Juan Capistrano in 1990, Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer says.  </P> <P> If city officials have their way this year, a parcel of open farmland in the  north end of town will be preserved by voters in a special election scheduled  for April.  </P> <P> Hausdorfer targeted a proposed, $21-million general-obligation bond issue to be  used toward the purchase of the 120 acres of open space for parkland as the  single most important issue for the coming year.  </P> <P> "This is one of the last opportunities we have to preserve the signature of San  Juan Capistrano," Hausdorfer said. "There aren't any other areas of open space  like it in the city."  </P> <P> To maintain the rural aspects of this 213-year-old community, which became a  full-fledged city in 1961, the city decided to sponsor the bond issue as a way  of keeping the land out of the hands of private developers.  </P> <P> Some developers have said they would like to convert the acreage, covered with  dying orange trees and bisected by two major creeks, into residential and  commercial projects. Former farming families who have owned the land for  generations are waiting for the election outcome before making a decision on  selling, relatives have said.  </P> <P> Other issues to watch in the coming year include a move forward on plans to  build a new civic center in the middle of town, one block north of Mission San  Juan Capistrano, Hausdorfer said.  </P> <P> He said the staff has outgrown the current facility on Paseo Adelanto and also  complained that it is not centrally located. The aluminum building was  originally intended as a temporary facility when it opened in the late 1960s,  and has been expanded several times since then.  </P> <P> The new city hall would be located next to the library, on a site now occupied  by asphalt tennis and basketball courts. The recreation facilities would be  relocated, Hausdorfer said.  </P> <P> Financial issues for next year include the council's recent decision to back  away from building a joint sewage-treatment plant with the neighboring  Capistrano Beach Sanitary District.  </P> <P> Because a joint plant would cost $30 million, city officials have decided to  pursue more sewage-treatment capacity at a Dana Point plant that now handles  the city's wastes.  </P> <P> "I think the 1990s will see San Juan Capistrano manifest itself as a mature  city," Hausdorfer said. "We would like to be a leader in regional issues for  South Orange County." WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

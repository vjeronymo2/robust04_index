			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BIM accountants knew of deficiencies ACCOUNTANTS to Bishopsgate Investment Management, the pension fund manager owned by Mr Robert Maxwell, found serious control weaknesses and deficiencies as early as February 1991. These included the absence of controls on stock lending and the failure to record investments in the name of the pension fund. In testimony before the Parliamentary Select Committee on Social Security, officials at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte said that despite the deficiencies, they saw no need to qualify the accounts for BIM nor did they feel it was their responsibility to report the shortcomings to regulators or to the fund's trustees individually. Copies of their management report were sent solely to the pension fund manager. In a copy of a February 1991 management letter submitted to the Select Committee, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte detailed a number of serious shortcomings in the way BIM managed the Maxwell company pension funds. They included an absence of regular review of fees generated by stock lending activities and the failure to ensure that stock lent had proper collateral. The accountants recommended that BIM document its stock lending activities and regularly review the value of collateral. They also found that shares bought by the pension funds from two other Maxwell-owned companies, Maxwell Communication Corporation and Pergamon Media Trust, remained in the name of their former owners. Further findings of the accountants included the inability to locate supporting documents for a number of payments and that the terms of an agreement with IBI Holding Company, a Maxwell-related company, were verbally changed after its signing. The investment administration and accounting departments were not informed of the change. Separately, Mr David Shaw MP said that the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Fund appeared to have no minutes of meetings of its investment committee at which decisions about stock lending or self-investment should have been discussed. He noted that minutes of one meeting on September 2 1991, showed that Mr Robert Maxwell discussed sending a letter to Invesco MIM, fund manager for a portion of the pension fund, reassuring the company about stock lending activities. On the subject of self-investment, Mr Ian Pittaway, solicitor to the MGN pension scheme, said that he periodically reminded the trustees of the Occupational Pensions Board's recommendation that self-investment should not exceed 10 per cent of total investments. By April 1990, more than half the MGN pension fund's 20 largest investments were in some way connected to Mr Robert Maxwell or his private interests.</p>

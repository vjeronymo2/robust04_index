			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MR. FROST' A LUKEWARM CHILLER  </P> <P> "Mr. Frost" (selected theaters) is a minor genre piece with major names -- Jeff  Goldblum, Alan Bates and Kathy Baker. Although this thriller of the  supernatural is not nearly thrilling enough to warrant a trip to the theater,  it's worth renting for admirers of its stars when it becomes available at the  video stores early next year.  </P> <P> Written by Philippe Setbon and Brad Lynch and directed by Setbon, "Mr. Frost"  is simplicity itself, a struggle of wills between a brilliant mass murderer  (Goldblum) and his strong, open-minded psychiatrist (Baker). Bates, the  policeman who arrested Goldblum, is convinced that Goldblum is the devil  incarnate, and there's no denying Goldblum wastes no time wreaking havoc at a  posh asylum.  </P> <P> It's too bad that the film isn't remotely as witty as Goldblum, who has lots of  fun playing an insinuating, sexy tempter who calmly tries to explain that he's  not mad, just plain evil. Indeed, what pleasure there is in watching this very  standard item, vague and a bit flat as so many international co-productions can  be, is derived from watching a fine cast doing a thoroughly professional job of  trying to make something out of nothing.  </P> <P> A Franco-English production handsomely photographed by Dominique Brenguier, it  has an extraordinary lineup of players in addition to its stars, including a  sinister Vincent Schiavelli, "Three Men and a Cradle's" Roland Giraud in his  English-speaking debut (as the rigid chief of the mental institution) and the  veterans Jean-Pierre Cassel, Daniel Gelin and Henri Serre (who was Jim to Oskar  Werner's Jules).  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (7): Clouds of suspicion  -Chemicals must fight to clear their name THE CHEMICALS industry is not loved. Spectacular accidents and continuing attacks by environmentalists have knocked the sector's reputation. If the industry fails to respond to environmental pressure, both in performance and public relations, it risks being legislated to extinction, at least in populated areas of the developed world. 'The chemical industry is blamed for most of the world's environmental difficulties. It has most to gain and farthest to go,' says Mr David Buzzelli, corporate director for environment, health, and safety at Dow Chemical. Chemical companies have some real environmental problems and some problems of public perception, argues Mr Michael Eckstut at management consultants, Booz-Allen. The problem is that the perception is reality. The industry must recognise both, he says. The industry certainly has an image problem. Unfavourable opinions in the US about the chemicals sector increased between 1980 and 1990 from 40 per cent to 58 per cent, according to Mr Roger Hirl, president and chief executive officer of the Occidental Chemical Corporation. Meanwhile, favourable opinions slumped from 30 per cent to 14 per cent. Mr Hirl told the International Council of Chemical Associations' conference this year: 'We have many of the most energy-efficient, highest technology and environmentally sound facilities in the world. But we ignored the shift taking place in what people were thinking about the industry. We failed to see ourselves through the eyes of the public.' The image of the industry is important because it affects its freedom to operate. Companies are concerned that environmental legislation - not always necessarily justified - may threaten companies ability to compete. 'Failure to improve both performance and image will be very expensive,' says Mr Buzzelli at Dow Chemical. 'Planning approvals for investment will be refused, making sites uneconomic so the companies themselves close the factories. Plants will be driven further from employees and markets, adding further costs.' The chemicals sector could follow the nuclear industry and be legislated to the point of economic unviability, warns Mr Ernie Deavenport, president of Eastman Chemical Company. Already, the three chemicals giants, BASF, Bayer and Hoechst, are warning that the cost of domestic environmental legislation threatens to cripple the German industry by reducing competitiveness. The chemical industry has recognised it cannot improve its environmental image until companies have improved their environmental performance. It is trying to clean up its act. In 1988, the US Chemical Manufacturers' Association set up a programme in the US called responsible care. The initiative, originally invented by the Canadian industry, now involves 175 US companies. Responsible care calls for chemical companies to 'demonstrate their commitment to improvement of all aspects of their performance which relates to health, safety and the environment'. 'We've moved from a period of denial to a period of dialogue. The next stage is to deliver on our promises,' says Mr Hirl. 'This is not a public relations programme, a PR solution to a PR problem. Responsible care is nothing less than a cultural revolution for the way we are going to do things in our industry.' Companies, many for the first time, are now trying to measure their emissions' effect on air, land and water. German companies have been doing this for some time, but British and French groups are now joining in. Chris Hampson, executive director at ICI with responsibility for the environment, says the need for measurement is vital, so that improvement can actually be demonstrated. This year, Imperial Chemicals Industries, BP Chemicals and Rhone-Poulenc all published their emissions for the first time. The formats were not always similar, and there were omissions in parts of the data, but it was a brave step in the right direction. The groups have also publicly set targets for themselves. ICI plans to reduce its wastes by 50 per cent by 1995. Rhone-Poulenc has promised to halve its effluent and solid wastes by 1995 and and cut them by 65 per cent by the year 2000. BP Chemicals has promised to slash hydrocarbon air emissions by half and water emissions by two-thirds by 1997. And Dow Chemical in Europe has promised to reduce the emissions of 56 compounds to air and water between 1988 and 1995. Mr Buzzelli at Dow Chemical says such promises are important to avoid government legislation creating time-consuming and expensive regulations that may not be as effective as voluntary measures. The cultural revolution implied by responsible care comes both from the top of organisations as well as from employees who share the concerns of the general public. Many chemical companies now have board members responsible for health, safety and the environment. However, in spite of the rhetoric, implementation is not always easy. Mr Mike LaGraff, BP Chemicals' manager for health, safety and the environment, explains: 'Not everyone in this company is in favour of reducing emissions. There are manufacturing guys who prefer to keep costs low. They still exist. Bob Horton, our previous chairman, said 25 per cent of employees did not believe what we were saying about the environment. But we are working on them with internal and external pressures.' Much has already been achieved by the industry. BASF of Germany, for example, claims it has reduced its effluent load into the Rhine by 95 per cent since 1973. Air emissions are down between 80 and 85 per cent during the same period. But can the industry afford to continue to invest, particularly during a recession when all chemicals groups' earnings are suffering? Improvements do not come cheap. BASF spent D-Mark 500m between 1988 and 1992 on capital projects to reduce pollution, according to Dr Wolfgang Jentzsch, BASF deputy chairman. The group plans to spend D-Mark 900m between 1990 and 1994 on environmental capital projects, while between 1992 and 1996 it will spend as much as D-Mark 1.6bn. Mr Eckstut at Booz-Allen says companies are recognising that waste management is an opportunity to reduce costs. By reducing waste production in the first place, yield can be improved and disposal costs reduced. However, the industry is beginning to flinch from the costs of environmentalism. It proves relatively inexpensive to reduce 80 per cent of emissions, says Mr Eckstut. But it can cost substantial sums to reduce the last 10-15 per cent. Many groups are already spending 20 to 30 per cent of their capital expenditure on environmental measures. That, he says, is hard to swallow, especially when capital spending is being slashed. The operating costs of environmental equipment are also high. 'We are swallowing hard right now. Times are tough but we are staying with it,' says Mr Buzzelli at Dow Chemical. 'We are on track because by not doing it we put our business in peril.' Although the burden of environmental improvement is expensive, the cost of not investing is even more so. The cost of not communicating the improvement effectively could prove terminal. The future success of the industry is dependent upon its credibility with the public.</p>

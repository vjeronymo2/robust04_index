			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Gluing operations are also sources of HAP emissions. Formaldehyde is contained in urea-formaldehyde resins and is emitted during gluing operations, as well as during the storage, use, and cutting of composite wood products that contain these cured resins. Contact adhesives contain volatile solvents such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane, methylene chloride, toluene, and n-hexane that are HAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The solvents contained in cleaning and washoff materials are typically the same solvents that are found in the coating formulations. Those that are HAP (identified above) are regulated by the proposed standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Selection of the Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The source category regulated by the proposed standards is wood furniture (surface coating). Specifically, major sources of HAP emissions are covered by the proposed rule; i.e., sources that have the potential to emit, considering controls, 9.1 Mg/yr (10 tons/yr) of any one HAP or 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tons/yr) of multiple HAP. Table 2 lists the many products that are manufactured by the source category and illustrates the diversity of the industry. As indicated in Table 2, the proposed rule applies to facilities included in at least nine SIC codes because some or all of the facilities that are included in these SIC codes produce wood furniture. The SIC codes listed in Table 2 are estimated to include greater than 11,000 facilities. Of these, it is estimated that 750 sources are major. This estimate is based on data collected from EPA's survey of the industry. The remaining sources are thought to be area sources, or synthetic area sources, and as such would not be subject to the proposed rule (see related discussion in section VI.A.2.b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subcategorization.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of sources within a source category in establishing standards. There are many reasons for subcategorizing a source category. A primary reason for subcategorizing a source category is that different types of control techniques may be appropriate depending on the type of product manufactured, the manufacturing process, and the size of the plant. Due to the diversity of this source category, the Committee considered subcategorizing the source category by industry market segment (e.g., kitchen cabinet manufacturers, residential furniture, upholstered furniture, etc.) and by manufacturing process (e.g., finishing a piece before it is assembled, finishing a piece after assembly).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Discussions of subcategorization occurred through several regulatory negotiation meetings. A recurring issue during the discussions was the difficulty in assigning a facility to one subcategory. Some wood furniture facilities manufacture products for different market segments and some use multiple manufacturing processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the data were evaluated and the recommended format of the standards was developed, it became apparent that the proposed standards were most likely going to be a limit on the pounds of HAP emitted per pound of solids used at a source (see section VI.D). The Committee's review of the data revealed that the HAP limit of facilities in the source category did not vary significantly according to the industry market segment, the size of the facility, or the manufacturing process. In addition, subcategorization by market segment could not address the diversity of the industry as there was as much variation in the types of control techniques used within each market segment as between the market segments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another aspect that the Committee discussed was the potential for subcategorization to limit the flexibility of sources in complying with the standards. One compliance method under consideration (and ultimately included in the proposal) was one that allowed averaging across various finishing steps within a facility. In this industry, however, the finishing steps could be within different subcategories and the EPA interprets the Act as not allowing averaging across subcategories for compliance determinations. This made subcategorization less attractive to the Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee decided that the disadvantages of subcategorizing this industry outweighed any benefits to either the affected sources or to regulators. Instead, the Committee worked to allow multiple compliance techniques that could address the operational differences among the various segments within the source category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

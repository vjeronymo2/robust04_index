Gaydar:  because only 50 percent of the 1990 economic potential remained  intact there. It is necessary to change priorities and period  keep key sectors of industry under government jurisdiction  during the transition,"    --thinks the chairman of the economics committee of the  Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Leytland. Our correspondent  speaks with him.    [Badov] In everyday terms the evaluation of the crisis  differs depending on the position of the person doing the  evaluating--who has been burned and who has kept warm. In this  sense, as far as I know, your view of the economic barometer is  "three dimensional"--as an industrialist in the post of  president of the Siberian Highway Corporation, a banker as the  representative of the board of the Narkombank, and as a  politician who heads up the economics committee of the  Democratic Party of Russia.    [Leytland] No matter which side you look from, there is  nothing to make you feel better. The "Chicago model" turned out  to be utter quack medicine for our sick economy and it must be  replaced before it is too late.    [Badov] Many see the defeat of the Gaydar bloc as a sign of  public rejection of the monetarist model of reform. Since  Gaydar's resignation, those who took his rhetoric at face value  are grieving over the notion that Russia is about to be knocked  off the bright path of economic liberalism. And right at a time  when the most unfavorable, "shock" part of the reform is behind  us. But the economic program of the Democratic Party of Russia,  in which you along with Glazyev and Bogomolov also had a hand,  not only denies the correctness of the path chosen by Gaydar and  his followers in government but also raises doubts about whether  these reforms were actually liberal in nature: "Today instead of  a market with free competition, a semi-feudal market is being  formed." Is this not a polemical exaggeration?    [Leytland] I do not see any exaggeration. During the course  of what was called liberal reform the mechanisms the suppress  competition became even stronger. While in terms of degree of  "liberalization" of the economy we outdid developed capitalist  countries. What kind of paradox is this? But the dirty trick is  that this present "free will"--freedom from state  regulation--has been absurdly "augmented" with freedom from  responsibility for the means and results of economic activity.  And the first victims of these economic machinations were the  consumers and small enterprises. An oligarchy is appearing which  is suppressing competition and advancing the interests of  society, which include the demand for efficiency. Incentives for  productive activity are simply disappearing.    [Badov] The old bureaucratic command system tied the hands  of  people with entrepreneurial inclinations but it was unable to  close its eyes to their self-will. The imperative for economic  growth held sway over bureaucrats from the Gosplan [State  Planning Commission] and also local party bosses. One gets the  impression that the present authorities have no such imperative.    [Leytland] Perhaps not. Two years of life according to a  monetarist calendar have led to a degradation of the economy  that it would have been difficult to imagine. We industrialists  and entrepreneurs, who in words have been given our "freedom,"  have ended up in traps stronger than those of the nomenklatura--  financial and doctrinaire ones, but with the opposite sign.  Remember the discussions of Bukharin and Larin from 1918 and  their furious attack on "bourgeois" commodity production. It is  as though this historical scene has returned again: There is the  same restraint and "righteousness," but with a switching of the  poles. And the same indifference to the price they pay to get  what they want. They have thrown the works of the Putilovs and  Ryabushkins on the bonfire--the potential of the second largest  economy in the world.    We had ruined everything with our reforms when the national  economy began to go on the auction block and the best capital  and resources were being used to pay for debts and forfeitures.  Does the fact that foreign investors have actually invested a  paltry $180 million in Tyumen oil and gas not tell you anything?  In my times as leader of the trust in Samotlor we assimilated  comparable sums with a large trust in one season.    Foreign investors are bypassing Russia. It is not only  political instability that is to blame for this. It is simply  that they see that our economy is failing and more and more  appreciably oligarchic tendencies are coming forth to control  it. Western entrepreneurs and bankers are surprised at how  "democratic" we are. They give us to understand in an open  exchange of opinions that this is good, that the Russians have  finally recognized the advantages of a market economy, but in  our enthusiasm for renouncing communism, why should we let the  economy slide downhill?    Not one of the former socialist countries has had such  pathetic results. Go through the Western supermarkets. They are  crammed with high-quality clothing from the Chinese provinces,  Singapore, and even Bangladesh, where people live in shacks like  during Kipling's times. But you will not see Russian goods of  export quality next to them on the shelf: They simply are not  produced. There is a true sign that Russia does not have healthy  business activity.    Light industry has dropped the production of more than half  of its goods. And the most rapid turnover of capital is here.  Instead of this the stores and shops throughout Russia are  filled with discarded imported goods of mediocre quality. And  the burgeoning network of shops will soon begin to fail because  of the decline of consumer demand. But all that is trivial  compared to the closing of mines, shops, and institutes....    Only 57 percent of our 1990 economic potential has remained  intact. And the decline of production has accelerated sharply in  recent times. Essentially we are experiencing not the costs of  reform but economic disaster. True, there are still enthusiasts  whose heads have not been cleared even by the cold breeze of the  elections to the Duma, and they are calling for making the  policy more radical. They are inciting the government to  "accelerate" the reforms even more. As in the tragic plot from  the "Golden Calf," these radicals are prepared to saw even more  weights in two. "But what if suddenly the weights are not made  of gold?" The people who were about to accept the radicals'  promises on faith are worried. But in response they hear the  sacramental: "Saw, Shura, saw." The pragmatic wing in the  government were hanging onto the coattails of the "monetarists"  even before. Let us just recall the practical and businesslike  steps of Chernomyrdin and Soskovets and the demarches of Lobov  and Zaveryukha. Realists and pragmatists have long been aware  that the dough being mixed by the "monetarists" will never  rise....    Thanks to the pragmatists in all stages the economy is still  functioning somehow and the infrastructures are still whole. The  government has undertaken a number of protectionist measures to  protect the national producer. But it is too early to get our  hopes up. In terms of many indicators, the crisis, I repeat, has  entered a destructive phase.    [Badov] Let us sum up a certain outcome from the Russian  version of "shock therapy." Is it true, as inveterate optimists  assert, that the critical phase of the crisis of the economy is  behind us and the forces of market self-regulation will rectify  the situation themselves?    [Leytland] In January 1992 the "government of intellectuals"  ventured to refrain from state regulation of economic processes,  concentrating on macroeconomic policy. So that the market could  start to function and money would become the "commodity of  commodities," a simple gentlemen's "collection" was  proposed--achieving a deficit-free budget, stiffening credit  policy, and restricting the money supply. The result was the  opposite of what was expected: There was sharp decline of  production, high inflation, a growing threat of collapse of the  state sector, and ineffectiveness of the weak private sector.  There was an increased tendency toward deindustrialization of  the national economy with a real prospect of turning Russia into  a cheap market for raw material and work force for highly  developed countries.    [Badov] But there are also signs that the course is being  adjusted.    [Leytland] The failure of the policy of macro-stabilization  forced the government to take the reigns but, in the big  picture, the course that was selected has not changed: from  liberalization of prices--to demonopolization. Still it seems to  me that we must take the opposite path, that is, to  liberalization through the creation of competition.    The real condition of the economy, the extreme level of its  monopolization, and the "difficult" structure as well as the  lack of an effective competitive environment make it necessary  to change economic priorities. The potential base for the new  economic policy would be the consumer sector defining and not  backward development of it--only it is capable of restoring  material incentives for labor and accumulation, which will move  the investment process off the mark.    Next I want to say something that will cause general  indignation among the radicals: During the transition period we  must keep the key sectors of industry, the most important ones  for the survival of the entire economy, under state control,  consistently creating along with this a nonmonopolized, nonstate  sector.    [Badov] Do you really consider it possible to put up with  monopolies for a certain amount of time?    [Leytland] The monopolies have not gone anywhere. The  problem  is that all at once, in one fell swoop, we gained a decaying  market where the monopolists, left uncurbed by the state,  grabbed us by the throat, establishing arbitrary prices and  decontrolling production volumes. A change in the form of  ownership is frequently not accompanied by the elimination of  monopolies. In order to escape the vicious circle it is  necessary to use the as yet unforfeited ability of the  monopolized sector to stabilize and maintain the level of  industrial production.    Further, through state regulation it is necessary to change  price ratios in the economy in favor of the nonmonopolized  sector. Such a system of shifting relative prices will make it  possible to stimulate rapid development of small and  medium-sized entrepreneurship and to set the mechanism of  competition in motion. It is necessary to restore the national  market as well. The most important thing for Russia is still a  market within the boundaries of the CIS countries. I consider  the deepening tendency toward isolation of national markets to  be unpromising and dangerous.    [Badov] And what about inflation?    [Leytland] There is no miraculous means of curbing inflation  as long as the factors encouraging it are in play. I would  include among them the government's eagerness to raise prices of  energy sources and raw material to the world level while the  exchange rate of the ruble is declining and monopolized large  sectors of the economy are uncontrolled, and money is being  printed in "waves."    The only real ways of fighting inflation are at the micro  level. Such a deep and steady depression throughout the entire  front of the economy as we have today cannot be surmounted with  ordinary market methods. I think that in very short periods of  time the industrialists, trade unions, and government should  conclude a General Agreement on Wages, Prices, Profit, and  Capital Investments. After this, officially regulated prices can  be legally documented as maximum prices.    There is an urgent need for indexation of the assets of the  enterprises. We need an official monthly price indexation based  on the balance of the industrial and product "baskets," with  priority for agricultural products. Finally, we must take steps  to abolish the value added tax in both construction and  agriculture.    [Badov] So you do not share the favorite idea of the  monetarists about a "deficit-free budget at any price...."    [Leytland] A budget with a zero deficit under conditions  where only half of the pre-perestroyka national income is left  and you cannot knock very much off state expenses is a utopia.  The main measures in the area of finance and credit should be  aimed at surmounting the crisis and stimulating production and  business activity, which will produce added national income and  hence more for the budget.    The resignation of the "architect of the reform," Gaydar,  seems to have marked the end of past illusions and seductions.  We have all emerged from a situation where freedom of  entrepreneurship was suppressed and denied. To use the apt  comparison of our great compatriot and Nobel prize winner  Vasiliy Leontyev, we were trying "to teach penguins to fly" just  like that. Neither "penguins" nor "storm petrels" will replace  the pragmatists if we really do not want to create an efficient  economy where everyone pays his own bills.</p>

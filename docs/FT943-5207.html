			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (1): Price cuts are in the wind again  -Reinsurers are reviewing their traditional ways of doing business as they cope with the mounting cost of catastrophe losses Price reductions are again on the agenda of international reinsurance underwriters and brokers, gathering in Monte Carlo this week for their annual conference. But the increasing scale of catastrophe losses, graphically underlined by the mounting toll of claims from this January's Los Angeles earthquake, means rate competition is unlikely to be acute. Despite the introduction of some Dollars 7bn of fresh capital into reinsurance ventures in the past two years, growing exposures - the result of economic, demographic and even climatic change - are putting an increasing strain on the industry's capital base and forcing reinsurers to re-examine traditional approaches to their business. Earlier this year the influx of new capital - much of it raised to support new ventures based in the offshore Bermuda market - stirred fears in some quarters that the reinsurance industry was returning to the kind of competition which proved so disastrous in the late 1980s. Events this year provide some evidence of softer market conditions. Some Australian and Japanese insurers - who renew their annual policies in April and July - did pay less, with rates down by as much as 15 per cent for Japanese buyers, for example. And a number of brokers expect to be able to obtain quite substantial cuts in prices when they start negotiating to renew covers for European and some American buyers over the next few months. 'We can probably obtain a 25 per cent saving in reinsurance costs, taking into account deductibles and price,' said one leading London broker. 'And you can certainly budget for a 15 per cent cut.' However, there are indications that rates will not fall much further. Reinsurers point out that prices for catastrophe cover are many times higher than they were five years ago. Mr Richard Keeling, one of the leading reinsurance underwriters at Lloyd's, says that rates are holding in the US and that his syndicate has shed exposures rather than follow the market down. Following the violent fluctuations in international capacity in recent years, many buyers want to secure long-term relationships with reinsurers, points out Mr Keeling, adding that concerns about 'longevity' are outweighing those linked to price. 'Many companies realise they really need reinsurance. They've seen the dark side of the moon and are not reckless in abandoning long-term relationships,' explains Mr Keeling. Other Lloyd's underwriters also argue that the market is likely to remain stable. Another Lloyd's underwriter says he expects 'the market will renew pretty well as before'. Every area of the Lloyd's market is under 'gentle pressure' he continues, but underwriters are still more worried 'about losing their jobs than losing premium'. Especially for reinsurers with US exposures the Los Angeles earthquake has provided a useful reminder about both the scale and uncertainty of exposures. Loss estimates from the quake were originally estimated at some Dollars 2bn but have been successively revised upwards, with the current figure of Dollars 7.2bn, representing the US industry's second most expensive catastrophe after hurricane Andrew. 'Everybody is kidding themselves over the extent of the exposure,' notes Mr Jacques Blondeau, chairman and chief executive of SCOR, the rapidly growing Paris-based reinsurance company. 'People were over optimistic. Computer models were just not accurate enough. It is striking to see how poorly equipped we are to measure these catastrophes.' These perceptions mean that reinsurers are continuing to insist on much tougher conditions for insurers underwriting business in areas highly exposed to catastrophe risks, with more selective pricing and higher deductibles the norm. And reinsurers are also becoming much more selective about the companies they choose to reinsure. 'They want to understand what the underwriter is doing much more than they did before,' says the chief executive of one of the UK's composite insurance companies. Outside the catastrophe area reinsurers have questioned the logic of granting unlimited liability coverage on employers' liability and third party liability covers. Unlimited cover of this kind looks likely to disappear from the market almost entirely in 1995. 'It is very hard to argue that any individual or corporate body actually needs the luxury of unlimited coverage. The loss events covered can be quantified and as insurers and reinsurers we should not leave the door open to rampant legal and social inflation,' points out Mr John Engestrom, chief executive of Mercantile &amp; General Re, the UK's biggest reinsurance company and a subsidiary of Prudential Corporation. Caps have been placed on exposures under proportional covers (policies in which reinsurers take a fixed share of the risk for the same share of the premium less a ceding commission). 'Uncapped exposures under proportional covers are impossible to price adequately,' notes Mr Engestrom. More broadly, Mr Engestrom argues that insurers and reinsurers need to rethink their roles and redefine the concept of fair sharing of risk. He adds that there should be 'open and trusting information sharing in the widest sense'. The theme is echoed elsewhere in the market, where groups as diverse as Centre Re, the Bermuda-based subsidiary of Zurich Insurance, and Benfield Re, the highly successful reinsurance broker, are increasingly keen to develop multi-year relationships between insurer and reinsurer. The use of some reinsurance products - such as 'spread loss' contracts  - has declined following changes in accountancy rules. Nevertheless reinsurers are continuing the search for policies which reward buyers who agree to share some of the risk and renew their policies with the same reinsurer. 'All we are really trying to do is provide contractual encouragement for long-term relationships,' explains one London reinsurance broker. 'Nobody wants to buy or write a risk for just 12 months,' says Mr Matthew Harding, chairman of Benfield, who insists that cedants take a compulsory co-insurance on all contracts he brokes. 'The customer base in the industry wants continuity and certainty. The emphasis should be on continuity rather than price.' In other ways, too, reinsurers - both brokers and underwriters - are looking for longer term responses. For one thing, there has been an increasing recognition within the industry of the need for financial strength and security. Many smaller firms have withdrawn, while bigger ones have chosen to work closely together. Earlier this year, two of the industry's largest companies - Cologne Re of Germany and General Re of the US - agreed to form a 'strategic alliance'. The new holding company, in which the US group will have a majority interest, has been hailed as a third force in the market to challenge Munich Re and Swiss Re. 'There has been a sorting out of the industry, with those companies that offer size, security and capacity coming out on top. The top seven or eight are playing a different game from the rest,' said an industry analyst. There are also signs that reinsurers are developing products which can attract a broader class of investor. Scepticism in the industry about the future of reinsurance derivatives is widespread. Nevertheless there are signs that interest and take-up of the new derivative products is growing, following the launch in December 1992 of the Chicago Board of Trade's catastrophe futures and options contract. Although the volume of business at the exchange is still modest - exposures on the Chicago contract amount to an estimated Dollars 25m - interest in an 'over the counter' product - a loss warranty product which uses the Chicago contract's loss index - is much greater. Enthusiasts such as Mr Andrew Martin, managing director Sedgwick Payne Insurance Strategy, say the dev elopment of derivative products could eventually bring greater flexibility and transparency to the reinsurance market. Capital markets could become more willing to trade reinsurance risks, he suggests.</p>

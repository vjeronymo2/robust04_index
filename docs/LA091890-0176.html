			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GWYNN TO HAVE FINGER SURGERY  </P> <P> Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn, a four-time National League batting champion,  will undergo an operation Wednesday to repair a fractured finger that ended his  season.  </P> <P> Gwynn will receive a general anesthetic and the compressed top joint of his  right index finger will be snapped back in place. It's likely that a pin will  be injected below the joint to support the bone structure, the club announced  Monday.  </P> <P> The injury occurred when Gwynn ran into the outfield wall in the third inning  of Saturday night's game at Atlanta while trying to catch a ball hit by the  Braves' Jeff Treadway.  </P> <P> Gwynn finished the season hitting .309 with four home runs and 72 RBIs.  </P></p>

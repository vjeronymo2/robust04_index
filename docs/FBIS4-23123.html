			<p>SUMMARY                                 Appearing to join leftists rather than fight them, President  Leonid Kravchuk on 15 June proposed that the Supreme Soviet elect  as premier Vitaliy Masol, a foe of reforms whom Kravchuk himself  had helped force out of office in late 1990.  Kravchuk explained  that he chose the leftist Masol over others simply because he was  the only candidate with a chance of winning a majority in the  Supreme Soviet, where leftists form the biggest faction and  control the leadership, and in fact the Supreme Soviet quickly  approved him.  The nomination of Masol--a sharp critic of  Kravchuk rival Leonid Kuchma and a favorite of new Supreme Soviet  Chairman and presidential candidate Oleksandr Moroz--suggests  that Kravchuk may be collaborating with Moroz, whom Kravchuk  surely wants to keep in the presidential race to take away some  of Kuchma's votes in the east and prevent any possibility of a  Kuchma victory in the first round.                           END SUMMARY      Kravchuk offered Supreme Soviet leaders several possible  candidates for premier, including some who were at least moderate  economic reformers, but virtually no nationalists or non-  easterners.  He presented the candidates to the Supreme Soviet  Presidium, commission chairmen, and heads of factions on 1 June  (Vysokyy Zamok, 4 June).  Vecherniy Kiev on 7 and 8 June reported  "from unofficial sources" that Kravchuk had proposed seven  possibilities--present acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy (from  Donetsk), Kravchuk's Odesa protege Valentyn Symonenko, Industry  Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko, head of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast  State Administration (Presidential Representative) Pavlo  Lazarenko, Liberal Democratic Party leader and former Kuchma and  Kravchuk adviser Ivan Markulov (Donetsk), Dnipropetrovsk factory  director Anatoliy Melnyk, and Masol (Donetsk).  Markulov is a  strong advocate of privatization, Vecherniy Kiev characterized  Lazarenko as leaning to reform, saying that he "has the  reputation of an adherent of reforms among circles close to  Kravchuk," while Symonenko had been put in charge of economic  reform by Kravchuk in 1992 but was assailed by reformers as not  really pushing reform.      After gauging reaction from the Supreme Soviet leadership,  Kravchuk on 15 June formally proposed Masol, probably the most  anti-reformist of the group and certainly no friend to Kravchuk.  Kravchuk explained that he was proposing Masol simply because he  was taking account of the "balance of forces in the Supreme  Soviet" and that "other candidates do not have the support of a  majority in the Supreme Soviet Presidium and groups" (Kiev radio,  15 June). (See Note 1)  Kravchuk had played the key role in  forcing Masol to resign as premier in 1990 (see below), and Masol  has been harshly critical of Kravchuk, accusing him, for example,  of tolerating corruption in his presidential entourage (Silski  Visti, 14 June).  As the 17 June Kyivska Pravda pointed out,  Kravchuk said "not one word about Vitaliy Masol's working  qualities" when he presented his candidature to the Supreme  Soviet.   (Note 1) Kravchuk had similarly bowed to the will of the dominant  forces in the Supreme Soviet in late 1992 when he proposed Kuchma  for premier instead of his own favorite, Valentyn Symonenko.  (See the Trends of 21 October 1992, pages 25-27.)   The leftists, who won the largest number of deputies in the  March-April election and won control of the posts of Supreme  Soviet chairman and deputy chairmen, clearly supported Masol.  Moroz praised him as a possible premier in a 21 May Demokratychna  Ukraina interview, and Masol had been shown special honor when  the Supreme Soviet opened in early May.  On its opening day, the  parliament elected a temporary Presidium of five, including Masol  (ITAR-TASS, 11 May), even though he, unlike the other four, was  not head of one of the main Supreme Soviet factions.  After  Kravchuk's nomination, leftist Supreme Soviet First Deputy  Chairman Oleksandr Tkachenko announced that 12 of the Supreme  Soviet's commissions backed Masol's candidacy, while two opposed  and three abstained (Kiev radio, 15 June).   Masol was quickly approved by the Supreme Soviet, but angry  democrats and nationalists boycotted the election.  The vote was  199 to 24 for Masol, with one invalid vote, but the announcement  of the vote specified that 302 deputies had received ballots but  only 224 cast votes (Kiev radio, 16 June), indicating that almost  80 deputies had boycotted the vote.  Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav  Chornovil had said that "since we are not able to effectively  influence the formation of the cabinet, our faction, after  holding consultations, will probably not take part in forming the  government" (Holos Ukrainy, 28 May), and ITAR-TASS on 16 June  reported that the majority of the opposition did not participate  in the voting.   Masol   Judging by Masol's recent statements as well as his background,  he is probably the most leftist-conservative of the proposed  candidates.  In his 15 June speech to the Supreme Soviet after  being nominated, Masol called for closer ties to Russia and for  more state regulation of the economy.  Although he committed  himself to Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity, he  defined Ukraine's "economic isolationism" and "breaking of  economic ties with our age-old partners and neighbors" as "the  main causes of the state's economic decline" and called for  closer ties with Russia.  While citing the need for faster  reforms, a transition to market relations, and support for  entrepreneurship, as well as declaring Ukraine "a market  economy," Masol assailed the Ukrainian Government for having  copied Russian reformer Yegor Gaydar's reforms and he stressed  protection of the population against the effects of market  forces; he said nothing about free prices.  Masol added that  "while giving the reforms a stronger impetus, the government must  ensure state regulation of the economy, especially in strategic  industries, which is being done in every market-oriented country"  (Kiev radio, 15 June).  Although he gave favorable mention to economic reform in his  Supreme Soviet speech, Masol had made clear his anti-reform views  and his hostility to Kravchuk and Kuchma just a few days earlier.  In a long interview in the 3, 7, 9, and 14 June Silski Visti  entitled "What the 'New Political Course' Has Brought," Masol  delivered scathing attacks on even the modest reforms of the  Ukrainian Government, contending that since he left power in late  1990 the "least favorable variant" of policy has been followed.  He argued that the fall of production, the "catastrophic lowering  of people's level of living," and the growth of social tension  "could have been avoided" and blamed these on the repeated  "experiments on our own people" and those who "deceived" the  people with "slogans of 'freedom' and 'democracy,' 'national  revival' and 'independence'" and promises to create a "miraculous  market" by means of "shock therapy."  To divert the public from  dissatisfaction with dropping living standards, he argued, the  leaders blamed "conservatives" for resisting change and stirred  up tension with Russia to create an external threat.  He made it  clear he was blaming both Kuchma and Kravchuk for the disastrous  policy and, reflecting his dislike for Kravchuk, also directly  accused the president of tolerating corruption in his  presidential entourage.  In addition to the Silski Visti  interview, in a 14 June interview with UNIAN, he criticized those  who opposed a planned economy and said that he really did not  want the post of premier but he was "unable to remain on the  sidelines after the Kuchma government made so many ill-considered  moves."   Masol's dislike of Kravchuk and the reformers and his fond  nostalgia for state planning and the Soviet Union are not  surprising in view of his career.  He had been Ukraine's Gosplan  chairman from 1979 until 1987 when he was named premier by  Ukrainian Communist Party First Secretary Volodymyr  Shcherbitskyy.  He was driven out of that office in October 1990  when the democratic opposition organized strikes demanding his  resignation and dissolution of the Supreme Soviet, after which  then Supreme Soviet Chairman Kravchuk worked out a compromise,  persuading Masol to resign to placate the strikers.  Masol's  subsequent occasional interviews--in the 23 February 1993 Holos  Ukrainy, 24 July 1993 Demokratychna Ukraina, and in the June 1994  Silski Visti--underscore how much he resented being sacrificed as  the scapegoat in a cave-in to the democratic opposition.  In  retirement he wrote a book "The Lost Chance" lamenting the  collapse of the USSR (Kyivska Pravda, 17 June).  He has not been  prominent since leaving office, but ran for the Supreme Soviet  this March as an independent and won in a runoff in Chernihiv  over a CPU candidate (Post-Inform, 11 April).  Although not a CPU  member, he says he "remains a communist at heart" (ITAR-TASS, 16  June).   Kravchuk-Moroz Connection   Kravchuk's nomination of Masol suggests that he has made some  sort of deal with Moroz or is at least collaborating with him to  undercut his rivals Plyushch and Kuchma, seeing them as more  threatening than Moroz and Masol, at least for the moment.  The  nomination's timing strongly suggests that Kravchuk was motivated  by political calculations rather than a desire to get the  government moving in a new or more activist direction.  Kravchuk  had been willing to let the government go on with only an acting  premier and virtually no cabinet changes since.shortly after  Kuchma left as premier last September only to now rush to name a  new premier just before the presidential election.  In doing so,  he appeared to be responding to Moroz's expressed wishes, since  the parliament speaker in his first speech after being elected  called for immediate election of a new premier without waiting  for the presidential election (Kiev radio, 18 May).  Kravchuk,  according to Moroz, also did not object to Moroz's proposal to  amend the constitution to put all executive power in the premier  rather than the president (UNIAN, 20 May; Aktsent, 10 June).   Masol's nomination aids Kravchuk by placing a sharp critic of  Kuchma as head of government (someone Kuchma will surely seek to  dislodge if elected president) and pleases Moroz, who not only  praised Masol as a potential premier (Demokratychna Ukraina, 21  May) but laid out an economic program apparently based on Masol's  ideas.  Moroz's report to the Supreme Soviet, carried on Kiev  radio on 15 June, called for more state regulation and blamed the  crisis on the dismantling of the "planned-administrative system  of management" without replacing it with new market structures,  the "collapse of the USSR national economic complex," the  "mechanical" adoption of other countries' experience, and "ill-  considered price liberalization" and privatization.  Masol denied  having drawn up the economic program that Moroz was to present to  the Supreme Soviet but said that much of it had been borrowed  from his own writings (UNIAN, 14 June), and he lauded Moroz's  program in his own 15 June Supreme Soviet speech (Kiev radio, 15  June).   Whether or not Kravchuk secretly provided Moroz with the extra  votes needed to be elected Supreme Soviet chairman (as Chornovil  charged in the 20 May Nezavisimost and Silski Visti) remains  unclear, but Moroz's election did undermine Kravchuk rival  Plyushch and did not disturb Kravchuk.  Kravchuk spoke favorably  of Moroz's election and said he could work with?him, according to                                                ?  the 19 May ITAR-TASS.  Now Kravchuk's nomination of Masol appears  to establish a temporary alliance to weaken Kuchma, whom he has  said is his main rival (Interfax, 3 June; Izvestiya, 4 June).  For his part, Moroz also has an interest in working with Kravchuk  because Kuchma is a competitor for some of the same constituency  as Moroz and also because an aggressive President Kuchma may be  more difficult to work with for Supreme Soviet Chairman Moroz  than President Kravchuk.  Kuchma reacted negatively to Masol's  appointment, calling the appointment just 10 days before the  election a political game, and predicted a clash with Masol if he  himself is elected president (Mayak radio, 17 June; UNIAN, 18  June).   Implications   Ukraine is clearly lurching to the left, as exemplified by the  big Communist victory in the March-April Supreme Soviet election,  the leftists' capture of most leadership posts in the Supreme  Soviet, and now leftist Masol being named head of government.  Even if Kravchuk, who is virtually the only hope for the  nationalists, is elected president, he may be pulled in a more  socialist, anti-reform, pro-Russian direction along with the  Supreme Soviet and cabinet, especially if the Supreme Soviet  amends the laws to transfer some presidential powers to the  premier.  Even though Kuchma is more pro-Russian, he favors a  strong presidency and his election would lead to an early clash  with the Supreme Soviet and new Premier Masol over power, if not  policy.

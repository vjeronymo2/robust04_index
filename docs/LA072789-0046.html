			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: BONITA  </P> <P> The torching of a store owned by an Iraqi businessman was not racially  motivated as first believed, Sheriff's Department investigators said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Instead, the arson stemmed from a long-running personal dispute between the  store's manager and the key suspect in the case, Dr. Douglas Wofford, 41, a  Carlsbad chiropractor, said Sheriff's Sgt. Conrad Grayson of the arson and bomb  squad.  </P> <P> Swastikas spray-painted on the storefront shortly before the fire led  investigators to assume a racial motive at first, Grayson said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Seoul by Somphon Chitphonprasoet, public </F> relations department correspondent]    [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, accompanied by a  delegation, arrived at the Seoul's Air Force Command airport at  1510 local time to begin his official visit to the Republic of  Korea from today to 26 June as the guest of Korean President Kim  Yong-sam. The prime minister was welcomed upon his arrival by  ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Chuchai Kasemsan, Thai  ambassador to the ROK. The prime minister was accompanied by  the Korean foreign minister and they reviewed the guards of  honor. The prime minister and his delegation also visited the  Korean national monument for a wreath-laying ceremony.    Speaking about his visit to South Korea, Prime Minister  Chuan  Likphai said he will take the opportunity to discuss with Korean  leaders about the trade imbalance problem and will persuade  South Korea to invest more in Thailand. He noted that Korean  investment in Thailand is still very low. He looks forward to  the possibility of Korea's opening up its markets for farm  products from other countries, especially rice from Thailand, in  keeping with the GATT agreements. It is anticipated that Korea  might import as much as 50,000 tons of rice from other countries  next year. How much of that quota Thailand will be allocated  depends on the negotiations. The prime minister said that South  Korea is a GATT member and despite its political problems, the  country will have to abide by GATT agreements and open the  country for farm products.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he also learned that the  Board of Investment, or BOI, declared 10 more trade categories  entitled to promotional privileges. He will inform South Korean  businessmen of this and urge them to invest in Thailand. He  wishes to see more investment from South Korea since there is  still very little interest in Thailand from South Korean  businessmen, who still prefer to invest in Vietnam. Korea, he  said, is facing a growing wage problem and he will persuade  Korean investors to invest in Thailand.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil ends a net 1.8% up, Mexico down 2.8% Brazil Brazilian equities closed a net 1.8 per cent higher in moderate trade after the market absorbed a late profit-taking bout and remained bullish on economy minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's anti-inflation plan, including the creation of a new single price index. The Bovespa index of the 54 most active shares gained 194 points at 10,733 in Sao Paulo. Volume ended at Cr216.8bn (Dollars 335m). Traders said investors sold on concern that congress would not muster quorum to approve the promulgation of a bill creating Mr Cardoso's social welfare fund. But a congressional spokesman said shortly after the market closed that congress had reached minimum quorum to proceed with the vote. Brazil's central bank will use the newly created single price index, Real Value Unit, as a parameter for its interventions in the foreign exchange market, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo. The bank said it will sell US dollars in the commercial and the interbank domestic forex markets at the URV price of the day the deal takes place. The rate at which the central bank will buy dollars in the market will be set freely between market players and the monetary authority. The deals will be settled two days after the transaction takes place. The URV's value will be set daily, based on the average of three inflation indices which measure the depreciation of the cruzeiro real and expressed in dollars. Mexico Mexican stock prices tumbled more than 70 points to close sharply lower, hit by fears of a rise in domestic interest rates and losses on Wall Street. The IPC index of 36 leading shares ended 71.29 down at 2,514.15, a loss of 2.76 per cent. Telmex accounted for about half of the total of 90.23m shares traded. The 'A' stock dropped 3.15 per cent and the 'L' shares, which may be held by foreigners, lost 2.60 per cent. Of 115 issues changing hands on the wider market, falls outpaced rises by 78 to 15.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BILTMORE HOTEL SITE SUBJECT OF 2 NOV. 7 BALLOT PROPOSALS  </P> <P> Once again, the question is being put to Hermosa Beach voters: What should the  city do with the old Biltmore Hotel site?  </P> <P> The issue has been a familiar refrain in city elections since 1972, seven years  after a hotel on the beachfront property was condemned and razed. Voters have  rejected seven proposals, including various plans for hotel developments at the  .84-acre site, most recently in November, 1988.  </P> <P> On Nov. 7, voters will be asked to consider the latest incarnations of the  Biltmore issue, propositions C and D.  </P> <P> Proposition C, a citizens' initiative, proposes dedicating the entire area,  between 13th and 15th streets on the Strand, as a beachfront public park. The  initiative was approved for the ballot in March after a petition drive  spearheaded by community activist Parker Herriott.  </P> <P> Proposition D is a proposed compromise that the City Council voted to put on  the ballot last May, based on recommendations from an 11-member advisory  committee appointed by the council.  </P> <P> Under Proposition D, 59% of the parcel -- the area facing the Strand -- would  be developed as an urban beachfront park; 25% of the lot would be commercially  developed for use as a restaurant, and 16% would be sold for high-density  residential development for an amount estimated at $1 million by the  proposition's supporters.  </P> <P> They argue that Proposition D is a balanced compromise that addresses concerns  of open space advocates and also could bring the city funds to build the plaza  and buy land for parks elsewhere in the city.  </P> <P> Proponents of the park plan, however, call the city's proposal a "concrete  urban plaza jungle," and argue that any development on the site would add to  existing parking and congestion problems. A "yes" vote on Proposition C would  provide a three-block expanse of green space near the ocean and the city would  retain much-needed open space, supporters say.  </P> <P> But some residents have urged a "no" vote on both measures, saying this would  allow the city to sell and develop the entire site for residential use. Such a  move would raise more than $8 million to buy excess school property and the  Santa Fe Railroad right of way, they argue, and would allow the city to repeal  the 4% utility tax being used to help purchase the right of way.  </P></p>

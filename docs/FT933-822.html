			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Servomex downturn SERVOMEX, the gas analysis instrument maker, announced a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.04m to Pounds 747,000 for the half year ended June 30. Mr Terry Clements, chairman, said that trading conditions had remained unsettled in almost all its markets but the group had held its business volume close to the 1992 level. The 12 per cent increases in the order and sales levels arose from the combination of exchange and price effects, he said. Turnover was Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 9.68m). Earnings per share fell to 4.8p (7p) but the interim dividend is held at 1.9p.</p>

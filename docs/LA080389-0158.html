			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> RENEWAL STUDY ORDERED  </P> <P> The City Council has ordered a study to determine whether neighborhoods along  Long Beach Boulevard and Atlantic Avenue should be declared redevelopment  zones.  </P> <P> The study area, running roughly from Anaheim Street to the Signal Hill border  and the San Diego Freeway, is somewhat blighted. There are many vacant lots;  some longtime auto dealerships on Long Beach Boulevard will move to the city's  new auto mall when it opens, and light rail construction has disrupted some  businesses.  </P> <P> If parts of the area are eventually included in redevelopment zones, the city  Redevelopment Agency could condemn property, buy land and sell it to businesses  to encourage commercial or residential development.  </P></p>

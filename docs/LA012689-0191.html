			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT OSTLER: THIS MAY BE GAME WITHIN A GAME, BUT THE MIND BOGGLES  </P> <P> The big game is over, but the memories linger, like a hangover.  </P> <P> Football fans are still buzzing.  </P> <P> Two days after the big one, a Times co-worker asks me, "Are you, like I was,  surprised at how easily Bud moved the ball against Bud Light?"  </P> <P> The co-worker, Bill (not his real name; his real name is Jeff Fellenzer), also  mused, "Do you get the feeling those two teams really don't like each other?"  </P> <P> I set Bill straight, told him that these are two teams headed in opposite  directions. Bud Light, obviously suffering from too much patented beechwood  aging, is overdue for a major recycling. They simply have to get off their  cans.  </P> <P> Bud, meanwhile, hasn't even tapped its potential.  </P> <P> For years, the L.A. Kings were too nice, soft as a goose-down pillow.  </P> <P> This season they added the ultimate nice-guy, Gretzky, but they also toughened  up with Marty McSorley and Ken Baumgartner, guys who mix it up but also do some  skating. McSorley skates, anyway.  </P> <P> But have the Kings gone too far? To beef up their defense, they traded for Jay  Miller, who is closing in on 1,000 penalty minutes in his 4-year career. He  also averages about a goal every 20 games, so guess what his speciality is?  </P> <P> To call Miller a defensive specialist would be like calling Mike Tyson a dental  technician.  </P> <P> Maybe it's impossible to win in the National Hockey League without playing  eye-sockey ice hockey, but it would have been nice to see the local club give  it a try.  </P> <P> My hockey knowledge runs as deep as the L.A. River, so I don't understand why  Bernie Nicholls got a 10-minute misconduct penalty and a game misconduct  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> For something he said.  </P> <P> In a league in which players casually attack one another with wooden carving  tools, in which fistfights occur more frequently than goals, a player can be  penalized for talking?  </P> <P> I guess that's a good policy, though, considering how many kids watch hockey.  We wouldn't want to give them the idea that it's OK to use bad language.  </P> <P> Speaking of finesse, where did the San Francisco 49ers get this reputation as a  finesse football team?  </P> <P> You don't tiptoe and tap dance your way to 3 Super Bowl titles.  </P> <P> Tough guys? One report is that Ronnie Lott was so storming mad at halftime that  he accidentally broke the handle off his teacup.  </P> <P> New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica has brought peace to his city by  arranging an arbitration settlement between warring parties Dave Winfield and  George Steinbrenner.  </P> <P> In a similar spirit of public service, I would like to head off the greatest  menace facing our city -- the threat of the Dodgers losing Orel Hershiser next  season by alienating him in their current contract talks. Remember Steve Sax?  </P> <P> Here's the solution, Dodgers: Stop negotiations at once. Hand Orel a blank  contract, signed by Peter O'Malley, and let Hershiser fill it in.  </P> <P> Look at Orel's face. If you can't trust him, who can you trust?  </P> <P> Would he overcharge? Impossible. Let's say he inks himself in for 5 years at $4  million per.  </P> <P> A steal. A bargain. Trust me.  </P> <P> Of course, you Dodgers should be protected against the ugly eventuality of a  damaged arm. Thus, a contract clause: If Orel hurts his arm and can't pitch  anymore, limiting him to pinch-hitting duty, he would take a pay cut of several  hundred dollars a year.  </P> <P> Speaking of steal, here's another suggestion for Fast Freddie Claire, Dodger  GM:  </P> <P> Remember when Charles O. Finley owned the A's and he hired sprinter Herb  Washington as a designated baserunner? Washington bombed, because he never  grasped the concept of the pickoff.  </P> <P> But the idea had merit, and your Dodgers are going to be lacking in overall  team speed next season.  </P> <P> Solution: Florence Griffith Joyner.  </P> <P> She's a local hero, she's between Olympics, she's smart, tough and fast.  </P> <P> And with those fingernails, she would be unstoppable with a headfirst slide.  </P> <P> We may not have seen the last of football's suddenly-passe dance step.  </P> <P> There is a rumor that the CHP has adopted the Ickey Shuffle as the official  field sobriety test.  </P> <P> I swear, honest, I'm rooting for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. We old people have to  stick together.  </P> <P> I hope Kareem gets fired up and makes all the sportswriters clamoring for his  retirement eat their words.  </P> <P> If Kareem does bounce back, the Lakers will re-repeat.  </P> <P> He seems to be asserting himself more on offense. He's working on defense,  muscling up. He fouled out against the Knicks Tuesday.  </P> <P> But 1 rebound in 24 minutes against the Knicks? One rebound in 23 minutes  against the Mavericks?  </P> <P> Looks like an ominous trend, but I could be wrong. If Kareem averages 8  rebounds over the next 6 games, I'll eat this column at the Forum, midcourt,  halftime.  </P> <P> How do you stop a wave?  </P> <P> At Mickey Thompson's Off-Road Championship Grand Prix Saturday in Anaheim  Stadium, 65,000 fans were doing the wave, which is as outdated as the Ickey  Shuffle. Come time to start a race, the public-address announcer barked:  </P> <P> "Knock it off!"  </P> <P> It worked.  </P> <P> Highlight of the night: Danny Thompson screaming through 4 laps of the winding,  killer course with the hood of his mini-pickup sticking straight up in front of  his face.  </P> <P> Goes to show that as a driving aid, seeing is vastly overrated.  </P></p>

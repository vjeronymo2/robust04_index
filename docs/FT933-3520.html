			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Spain backs France on farm trade SIR Leon Brittan, EC commissioner in charge of trade, yesterday held meetings in Washington designed to avert a new round of transatlantic trade hostilities. His visit to Washington, where he will receive an award, comes in the wake of a formal diplomatic protest, delivered by US officials on Friday in Brussels. They warned that French demands to reopen the Blair House accord on farm trade, reached last year, could undermine the entire pact. However, Spain yesterday backed France's opposition to the Blair House accord, in effect threatening its own veto on this vital building-block for concluding the Uruguay Round world trade reform talks. In a memorandum to the European Commission and Spain's EC partners, Mr Javier Gomez Navarro, the Spanish trade minister, called for a series of modifications to Blair House which echo some of the main French demands. The pact's provisions on oilseeds last year averted a trade war, during which the US was threatening sanctions against EC trade worth up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 650m). US farm interests believe they made great concessions on oilseeds in order to get a barely acceptable Uruguay Round deal covering agriculture. Spain, like France, wants the 21 per cent cut in subsidised food exports to be spread over longer than six years; to exclude from these cuts added value food products, food aid, and current EC food stockpiles; and for the cuts to fall on sectors rather than individual products, thereby allowing the EC to export more in areas where it either earns most or is most competitive.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (4): Grasping the nettle - The privatisation of ZCCM QUESTIONS hang over whether, when and how the Zambian government will privatise Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the giant copper producer. Although the new government has shown a commendable willingness to take unpopular decisions, it is doubtful whether there is a larger nettle to grasp than the privatisation of ZCCM. Not only does the company remain the single dominant economic entity in the country - it has often in the past been referred to as a 'state within a state' - but it is also the repository for much emotional and ideological baggage. Within the miserable economic legacy of President Kaunda, the nationalisation of the copper industry probably ranks as the greatest act of folly. It took place in two stages: In January 1970, the industry was reorganised with the government taking 51 per cent of the two companies running the industry - Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines and Roan Consolidated Mines (merged into ZCCM in 1982). In late 1974, the government also took over the management of the mines, hitherto provided by companies associated with the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and AMAX. Nationalisation was disastrous. Strapped for cash, the government placed ever greater burdens on ZCCM forcing it into all sorts of peripheral activities at the expense of investment in the core business of mining metals. The result was a steady decline in production, slumping to a nadir of 387,000 tonnes of copper in the 1991/2 financial year from an average annual 600,000 tonnes combined production of Nchanga and Roan before they were merged into ZCCM. The Chiluba government came to power in November 1991 on a platform which included privatisation as a vital component of its economic programme. However, scepticism has persisted about its strength of conviction - fuelled a few months ago when vice-president Levy Mwanawasa said he favoured taking '20 to 30 years' over ZCCM's privatisation. Supporting this view, is the fact that the company's restored profitability gives the government less incentive to proceed with a sell-off. Second, many senior figures in government are intimately connected with the initial decision to nationalise the mines. Indeed, Mr Humphrey Mulemba, the incumbent minister of mines, presided over the nationalisation in 1970 in the same capacity as minister of mines. No matter what such men say in public, privatisation would involve a considerable humiliation. Furthermore, the government has already been accused of seeking to make a quick buck and may be anxious to dispel such accusations. However, the government will not want to compromise its hard-won economic reform credentials by bending to the wind over ZCCM. Baulking over the sell-off could also prompt the World Bank to make this a necessary condition for the provision of further aid. Ministers also appear committed, albeit for different reasons. Although Mr Mulemba cautions that the government must be 'very, very careful not to move carelessly', he adds that the privatisation of ZCCM is 'one of those things we would like to push as quickly as possible'. His reasoning is simple: maximising government spending options depends on putting ZCCM on a path of sustained profitability. This requires new private sector investment, which is most likely assured by withdrawing the spectre of government interference and control. Dr Mathias Mpande, deputy minister of mines is unequivocal that his priority as a minister is to achieve the turnaround of ZCCM through privatisation. 'If you're an economic nationalist, you're just a lost economic dinosaur in the world,' he says. Dr Mpande argues that whereas he originally envisaged a protracted debate of about a year, things are now going 'very quickly. All parties want to get it over'. The World Bank will be conducting a study, during the first quarter of 1993, which will come up with an action plan for ZCCM's privatisation. The other issue is what shape a sell-off would take. Mr Mulemba believes the government should maintain a minority stake, but says he is flexible depending on what will best foster investor confidence. Dr Mpande favours breaking up ZCCM into smaller units to attract as many foreign investors as possible, allowing the government to profit from competition between them. Although many of South Africa and the world's main resource groups have shown interest in the Zambian mining sector - RTZ, BHP, Phelps Dodge, Gencor and JCI among them - Anglo American, holder of a 27.3 per cent minority stake in ZCCM, is in pole position. Anglo has not disguised its interest in lifting its stake, and Dr Mpande says he takes it for granted this will be the case. 'When they come back they will be in charge of management, but there will be very little change. The people they need are already there. The human resource is there, but they can enrich it.' The chances of a total sell-off appear unlikely. The government will not want to forsake all influence over what is seen as the jewel in Zambia's crown. Any controlling shareholder is also likely to deem it prudent to have the government on board, if only to share responsibility for difficult decisions such as retrenchment. Although the government is unlikely to commit itself until after the World Bank study is completed, the chances of the privatisation being resolved within the next year must be good. The interim is likely to see a good deal of horse trading as private investors jockey for a piece of the action.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3-A BASEBALL;  </P> <P> ORANGE'S SIXTH-INNING RALLY ELIMINATES SANTIAGO  </P> <P> Orange High School baseball Coach Ed Howard was able to save his ace for  another day.  </P> <P> The Panthers dealt Howard a winning hand Tuesday by scoring three runs in the  sixth inning to beat Santiago, 4-3, in the second round of the Southern Section  3-A playoffs.  </P> <P> And Orange did it without having to use its best pitcher, Ruben Hernandez, who  had pitched a one-hitter against Newport Harbor in the first round last Friday.  </P> <P> Curveball specialist Josh Belovski held Santiago to three runs in four innings  before giving way to reliever John Martinolich.  </P> <P> Before Orange came to bat in the sixth inning, trailing 3-1, Howard pulled his  players aside for a huddle in front of the dugout.  </P> <P> "They were tired, but I told them I'd rather seem them tired than watching TV  this week," Howard said. "I didn't want them to be reading about the rest of  the playoffs in the paper."  </P> <P> The pep talk paid off. Orange shortstop Greg Folsom led off the inning with a  single, and Jason Smith and Rich Prater followed with singles to load the  bases.  </P> <P> The next batter, Hernandez, hit a sharp grounder to second baseman Marco Perez,  who got the force at second but threw wildly to first for an error. Two runs  scored on the play, tying the score.  </P> <P> Two batters later, Jesus Romo's sacrifice fly drove in Hernandez with the  go-ahead run.  </P> <P> Santiago (18-8), which had won several one-run games this season, ran out of  comebacks in the seventh, when Martinolich (8-0) retired the side in order.  </P> <P> Mike Kissell (7-4) took the loss for Santiago, which was making its first  playoff appearance since 1968.  </P> <P> Orange started the season 2-7, but has won eight in a row and 14 of 16 since  moving Folsom from third base to shortstop over spring break.  </P> <P> Folsom played a major role Tuesday, handling nine tough chances without an  error.  </P> <P> "Our defense has been flawless," Howard said. "I can remember only two errors  as a team since Easter break."  </P> <P> First baseman Romo also made several nice plays on low throws, and center  fielder Jeff Peterson robbed Santiago's Enele Scanlan of a hit with a diving  catch in the sixth.  </P></p>

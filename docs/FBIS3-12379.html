The committee (?failed) to return the military  units of the al-Wahdah Brigade, which were moved from the  Hadramaut Governorate to the Mudiyah area in the Abyan  Governorate, and the 30th Brigade forces, which were moved to  the village of (Kumkawz) in the Abyan Governorate because the  other party did not respond to the committee's instructions and  insisted on keeping the forces in these positions, thereby  violating the decisions of the Presidential Council and the  provisions of the pledge and accord document.    The source regretted the committee's failure in its mission  as a result of the obstacles placed in its way. This, the  source added, will escalate tension in the area and aggravate  the situation. The source added: At 1530 today, Friday, two  military planes flew at low altitude over the city of Mudiyah  and the al-'Amaliqah Brigade garrison and broke the sound  barrier. This caused a state of fear among citizens. These  irresponsible and reckless acts fall within the framework of  provocative acts and continuous blatant aggressions to which the  innocent, defenseless people in the steadfast Abyan Governorate  are being exposed. Furthermore, the source added, these acts  aim at tightening the siege on the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, which  began on Sunday, 10 Ramadan [20 February], the moment the pledge  and accord document was signed in Amman.    The source urged the Political Forces Dialogue Committee and  the military committee to shoulder their responsibilities at  this delicate moment and put an end to these reckless acts which  only aim at obstructing the ongoing efforts to implement the  pledge and accord document and at endangering the unity of the  homeland and its Armed Forces.</p>

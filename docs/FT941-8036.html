			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Government starts talks with Zapatista rebels The Mexican government and delegates from the rebel Zapatista Army of National Liberation opened peace talks yesterday in the hope of ending the nearly two-month conflict in the southern state of Chiapas, Damian Fraser reports from San Cristobal de las Casas. The two sides appeared together after the opening session and said they would meet today to continue to discuss the agenda of negotiations. Bishop Samuel Ruiz, acting as mediator, said there had been 'sincerity' and 'mutual respect' in the talks. The Zapatistas seemed to be led by so-called Sub-Commander Marcos, with 17 other delegates. The government side was represented by Mr Manuel Camacho, peace envoy of President Carlos Salinas. For the first time he explicitly recognised the guerrillas as the Zapatista Army of Naional Liberation, and called them a fully Mexican and predominantly Indian movement. The two sides at the begining of the talks appeared divided on a number of issues. Mr Camacho insisted in a communique on Sunday that negotiations exclude national issues, contrary to the apparent aspirations of the rebels. However, Mr Camacho left some room for negotiation, saying that 'certainly there will be a discussion on national issues and we also know that the solutions to some local problems have national implications.' With many towns in southern Chiapas divided between Zapatistas and supporters of the government, the rebel demand for political autonomy for Indians in Chiapas is likely to meet resistance. Rich landowners, and some of the estimated 20,000 mainly Indian people who have fled their homes since the New Year uprising, partly in fear of Zapatistas, are likely to oppose autonomy that gives political power to rebel leaders.</p>

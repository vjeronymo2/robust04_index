			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China's mine reform plan unveiled CHINA HAS unveiled plans to liberalise access to its mining sector for foreign companies in an effort to boost lagging minerals production. A draft mining law was circulated this week at a conference in Beijing organised by China's Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources and the United Nations as a step towards engaging international miners more closely in China's resource development. But representatives of mining companies have given the draft a fairly lukewarm response. The requirement that foreign companies pay 20 per cent royalties on gold produced was described as 'unrealistic' by one representative. China, which has emerged as the world's largest gold consumer, has previously banned foreign involvement in the exploration and exploitation of its gold reserves; but now is anxious to tap foreign expertise and capital. Vice minister Zhang Wenju told the conference that China had decided that exploitation of its minerals resources should be speeded up to keep pace with the country's high-speed economic growth, which was nearly 13 per cent last year and is expected to exceed 10 per cent this year. Under the draft law, foreigners could explore either on their own or in partnership with Chinese organisations.</p>

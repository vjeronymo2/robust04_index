The specifics of the period which we are experiencing are  such that under current conditions the primary threat to  Russia's national security stems not so much from foreign  sources as from various destructive forces within the country.  Among the most dangerous factors, along with the prolonged and  deep economic and social crisis, we must cite also the crisis of  national policy of the state as a whole.    The absence of a unified conception of national policy in  essence has made it impossible to localize even one of the  inter-ethnic conflicts arising during the period of  disintegration of the USSR as well as after it, to expose the  main reasons for their emergence, and to develop a mechanism for  early prevention and effective reaction to crisis situations.  <H6>  The State of Interethnic Accord and Possible Prospects for  Its Development </H6>   A rather high level of inter-ethnic tensions continued to be  retained in 1993. Experimental studies and an analysis of the  conflicts allow us to conclude that at the present time there  are three levels of tension in inter-ethnic relations.    The first of these--ethnic limitation (i.e., the  unwillingness to opt for contacts beyond the boundaries of one's  ethnic group)--is the most widespread. It is manifested in  increased interest toward creation of mono-national families  (there is a reduction in the relative share of mixed marriages),  in a preference to work in mono-national collectives, and in the  monopolization of leadership positions of all levels by  representatives of one's own people.    Practically each of the peoples, especially those which have  a national-state or national-territorial autonomy, is gripped  with this illness, which is the initial and primary basis for  disintegration of interethnic accord.    The second level--ethnic egoism (the desire to ensure  advantages for one's own people at the expense of others)--is  becoming ever more widespread.    Up to 30-40 percent of the native population of the  republics  believes that it is natural for them to get advantages over  other peoples populating this republic. It has become almost the  rule that the employment of Russians exceeds their relative  share in the population only in industry and partially in  science, public health and education. In all other spheres and  sectors, including the organs of state and economic  administration and the make-up of the student population, the  relative share of Russians is lower than their specific share in  the make-up of the population. In Tatariya, for example, there  is a de facto introduction of strict limitations by national  indicator on the ownership and management of natural resources.  Russian joint-stock holders are being edged out, and the  representatives of the Tatar people are gaining the controlling  packets of stock, etc.    In Dagestan, ethnic egoism is manifested in the hidden  opposition of the Laktsy and the Kumyks (because of Kumyk  lands), and in the desire by the Nogay to achieve unification of  Nogay territories which are currently divided up between  Dagestan, Stavropol Kray and Chechnya.    Ethnic egoism may go into the third stage--ethnophobism,  which is characterized by open enmity and irreconcilability in  regard to other people who are "foreign" and "not one's own."  This has been particularly manifested in the well-known  Ossetin-Ingush conflict, when the fires of hatred,  nonrecognition and mutual accusations continue to rage on an  interpersonal level.    Individual regions of the Cossack brotherhood and certain  rayons of the North Caucasus stand on the brink of open  opposition to the interests of various peoples.    However, the level of acuteness in national relations has  become stabilized. While undoubtedly being exceedingly high, it  has nevertheless been retained within the framework of 1992  indicators. As compared with a year ago, the mass consciousness  of the native population is somewhat less taken with the ideas  of national separatism and unification of one's ethnic groups  presently living on other territories into a single state  formation.  <H6>  Ethnopolitical Movements, Organizations and Parties </H6>   Their growth in 1993 continued. There was an increasing  number of associations and organizations based on the principles  of national rebirth and self-preservation. Their organizational  consolidation continued, and in some of them the extremist wing  grew stronger. Their actions led to a forced decision on the  rates and content of sovereignization. Part of the national  associations strived to become parallel organs of power, to  replace the state structures. Efforts were made to create  militarized formations. In a number of republics (Komi, for  example), they were granted the right of legislative initiative,  as well as the actual right to conduct expert evaluation of  drafts of legislative decisions.    Many of them became the bearers of new consolidating  principles, appealing not to the political consciousness of the  citizens, but to the historical, ethnic, and ethnosocial, i.e.,  to more universal interests than, for example, class or group  interests.    And although more significant differences were manifested in  1993 than before, differences between positions of titular  peoples and their "representative" national parties and  movements (extremist nationalist demands were supported by 10-15  percent of the native population, with an alarm indicator of 7-8  percent), we cannot underestimate their negative influence.    Thus, the activity of the All-Osset Council "Styr  Nakhas" and the socio-political association "Our Ossetiya"  not only intensifies the Osset-Ingush conflict, but also  facilitates the emergence of anti-Russian and anti-military  sentiments among the Osset people.    In the second half of 1993 there was a sharp increase in the  propaganda of nationalist ideas in the Republic of Dagestan by  the socio-political movements "Tenglik," "Birlik," and  "People's Front imeni Shamil," whose leaders call for the  struggle against the colonial policy of Russia in the North  Caucasus as one of the conditions for prosperity of the nations.    The Lezghin people's movement Sadval" promotes in  its activity the idea of forming a "Unified Lezghistan," which  leads to the violation of the territorial integrity of Russia  and Azerbaijan.    The activity of the Komi national party "Doryams  AsnyMES" ("We Will Defend Ourselves") has a notably  expressed nationalistic and anti-Russian position.    The Buryat-Mongol People's Party promotes the idea  of unifying all Mongols with an orientation toward Mongolia.    The "Union of the Banished", the "Eastern Prussia"  association of fellow countrymen and other organizations of  an extremist ilk in Kaliningrad Oblast have set for themselves  the goal of creating a powerful German community by means of  implementing broad economic cooperation with Germany, which may  also evoke negative consequences.    The Party for Chuvash Rebirth and the  Chuvash National Congress are expanding contacts with  representatives of Turkish religious centers for the purpose of  spreading the principles of Islam and gradually edging out  Christianity, which may cause friction between the adherents of  different religious confessions.    A particularly destabilizing factor in inter-ethnic  relations  is the presence or creation of possible military or militarized  formations. In the Chechen Republic there are subdivisions of  the regular army in various stages of formulation. Among these  are a mountain-infantry brigade, tank and artillery regiments, a  border brigade, and a special purpose regiment. Within the  make-up of the ChR [Chechen Republic] national guard there is a  regiment of the national guard, a Muslim fighting regiment, and  an "Abkhaz batallion." Detachments of the people's militia are  being created or have already been created in each population  center, based on territorial principle.    In North Ossetia there are also measures being implemented  on  the formation of a future national army, the nucleus of which is  the Administration for Defense of Facilities of the National  Economy. At the end of 1993, its ranks numbered up to 7,000  persons and around 100 units of armored equipment.    The overall number of personnel of various military  formations in Ingushetia is in excess of 2,500 people.    And finally, the emergence (retention) of interethnic  tensions, work on regulating conflict situations which is long  in its duration and ineffective in its content and, on the  contrary, a stable situation in multinational regions largely  depends on the opposition of the national-political elite. The  conceptions of national statehood and national sovereignty of  individual national-state formations often conceal the political  ambitions of the ethnic elite, and efforts to translate their  slogans into the language of practical actions end in human  tragedies.    At the same time, the danger of ethnopolitical organizations  for the present time is most likely exaggerated (perhaps with  the exception of Tatarstan and, in part, Dagestan). They are for  the ruling national elite sooner a means of trade with Moscow  than a real opposition. The pressure of national organizations  on the leaders of republics will evidently continue, but its  effectiveness will be determined in the nearest time by the will  of the national majority--the people, and not by the degree of  pressure exerted by the extremist part of the national parties  and movements.  <H6>  Refugees and Forced Migrants </H6>   1993 was a year of gradual transition of almost all parties  to a more precise definition of their positions in regard to  Russians in the "near abroad" countries. Out of a total of 26  million people who found themselves abroad in the Spring of  1991, 2 million have already returned to Russia. According to  official statistical data, in 1990-1992, one-fourth of the  Russians left Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, and 17 percent left  Georgia. Central Asia and the Transcaucasus gave up 2/3 of the  repatriates (although only 16 percent of the Russians located in  the near abroad countries live there).    On the whole, the return of a total of 6 million people is  expected.    The complexity of solving the problems of Russian refugees  (in the political plane) consists of the fact that they  represent a dynamic, active and explosive group under conditions  of Russia, inclined to support nationalist forces and  nationalist organizations.    At the same time, this is the most skilled, the most  organized and creative part of the Russians living abroad, which  by its knowledge, experience and skill is capable of  successfully resolving economic and social problems and actively  aiding the new Russia.  <H6>  Migration of the Population </H6>   Along with the continuation of emigration of the Russian and  Russian-speaking population, there has been a significant  increase in the influx of people of other nationalities who have  left their native land as a result of economic and political  instability in their regions, as well as inter-clan and  inter-tribal clashes under the threat of physical and moral  annihilation.    An operative analysis of the flow of migrants to Kaluga  Oblast shows that, along with Russian refugees, a significant  portion is comprised of forced migrants from Moldova, Armenia,  Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, and the republics of the Northern  Caucasus. Aside from the difficulties of integrating into a  foreign-speaking environment, this situation bears  contradictions which are difficult to resolve:    --the urban population predominates within the influx of  refugees and migrants, while Kaluga oblast (like most of the  Russian oblasts) primarily offers them employment involving farm  labor;    --among the refugees and migrants there is a very high  relative share of the intelligentsia, which in a certain sense  hinders its employment due to lack of correspondence of skills  to available jobs, or due to saturation of traditional  professions.    We should also note that the influx of the foreign-speaking  population to the territory of Russia will increase, because  along with the political reasons there is an increase in the  significance of socio-economic ones: Growing unemployment (lack  of jobs), especially for young people, as well as problems of  water and land.    The lack of resolution of the newly emerging problem--the  foreign-speaking population among the native Russian  population--requires increased attention in 1994 in order to  prevent the emergence of ethnic tensions and conflicts in the  central part of Russia.  <H6>  Sore Spots in Interethnic Relations </H6>   The retained tendencies toward intensification of regional  separatism, the expansion of interethnic conflicts, the  aspirations of the national elite toward re-division of the  territories and toward greater sovereignty, and the struggle for  power all pose a threat to the territorial integrity of the  country and Russian statehood in general.    The direct sources of real threats in the sphere of  interethnic relations are: Efforts to form enclaves according to  the ethnic principle on the territory of the Russian Federation;  intensification of socioeconomic inequality of various peoples  and ethnic groups; increase in ethnic migrations, migration of  refugees and forced migrants; mass violations of civil rights  and freedoms in individual regions.    By indicator of conflict, all the sore spots in Russia may  be  classified by the following principles:    --zones of acute crisis (military conflicts or balancing on  their brink);    --potential crisis situations;    --zones of strong regional separatism;    --zones of moderate regional separatism;    --zones of weakly expressed separatism.    We will deal primarily with the "painful", crisis zones.  <H6>  Regions of Acute Crisis Situations </H6>   The most explosive remains the situation in the zone of  North  Ossetia and Ingushetiya. After the trip by the Russian  Federation President to the zone of conflict and the 13 December  1993 edict on the procedure for returning refugees and forced  migrants to Digaron, Chermen, Kurtat and Dachnoye, the tensions  have not declined, but continue to increase.    Despite the positive evaluation expressed by officials of  these republics regarding the results of the achieved accord,  there is, nevertheless, an expression of apprehension that  extremist forces will make use of the situation and will push  the Ingush toward elemental resettlement to the indicated  population centers, the negative consequences of which are  unpredictable.    Meetings of extremist directionality have been held in North  Ossetia, organized by the opposition. The session of the North  Ossetia Supreme Soviet refused to rescind its previous decision  on the impossibility of Ingush and Osset living together. The  information spread by extremists regarding the forceful  provision of Ingush resettlement to places of their former  residence once again intensifies the mutual enmity.    Negotiations within the framework of the mixed commission  have been suspended. Efforts by the temporary administration to  put the factors of "people's diplomacy" into action have not  yielded positive results.    In order to reduce tensions in this region, it seems  expedient to implement a series of successive measures. First of  all, to tie in the solution of the problem of refugees not with  the territorial aspirations of the Ingush and Osset, but with  the creation of opportunities for each people for realization of  their rights to national self-sufficiency.    Secondly, stricter measures are needed for disarmament of  the  military formations created in Ingushetiya and North Ossetia  after the armed conflict.    Thirdly, it seems expedient to more effectively utilize the  additional financing of Ingushetiya and North Ossetia, to  establish strict control over the expenditure of financial means  allocated for target programs.    Fourthly, it has long been time to give a public legal and  political evaluation of the events of October-November 1992 and  to name the names of the organizers and participants in the  criminal actions.    Fifth, it is necessary to change over from a  military-administrative form of administration to a direct  federal form of administration and to repeal the state of  martial law.    Another point which personifies the acute crisis situation  is  Chechnya and the indeterminacy of its status, as well as the  separatist policy of its current leadership. The approaches to  the problem of Chechnya as defined at the conference in Nalchik  on 7 December 1993 do not have favorable prospects. Moreover,  the closure of the border with the Chechen Republic along its  entire perimeter, including the undefined line of administrative  division with Ingushetiya, may lead to an exacerbation of the  situation in the region and to provocation of anti-Russian  sentiments. A mild course toward keeping Chechnya within the  make-up of Russia, juridically and economically, seems more  preferable. The interests of stabilization of the situation in  the region and reduction in the criminal situation in Chechnya  would be served by efforts of the leadership of Dagestan and  Stavropol to conclude bilateral agreements with the regime of D.  Dudayev regarding cooperation in resolution of socio-economic  questions and provision of human rights. At the same time, it  would be expedient to continue contacts with the opposition to  D. Dudayev's regime, and to support the social base of the  opposition. This course is desirable also because the Chechen  diaspora in the nearby and distant foreign countries is  beginning to speak out against the regime of D. Dudayev.    It would be expedient to involve such influential movements  as the Conference of Peoples of the Caucasus and the Tersk  Cossack Brotherhood in the regulation of problems of a crisis  character in the North Caucasus.  <H6>  Potential Acute Crisis Situations </H6>   Among these we must cite primarily the tense ethnopolitical  situation taking shape in the Republic of Tyva (Tuva). Beginning  in 1990, the separatist course of the People's Front of Tuva  provoked the mass departure of the Russian-speaking population.  Tensions are being increased by the actions of organizations of  former prisoners, particularly by the mass "seizure" of the  vacated apartments of refugees.    On the wave of increased nationalism, increase in crime, and  decline in productivity, the Supreme Soviet of Tuva adopted a  new constitution in November of 1993. The first article of this  constitution calls the republic a sovereign state within the  make-up of Russia, having the right to full self-determination  by means of an all-people's referendum. At the same time (29  November of this year), the Supreme Soviet of Tuva adopted a  decree on holding a referendum on the question of Tuva remaining  in the Russian Federation.    Considering the fact that Tuva was included in the make-up  of  the USSR only in 1944 and that Tuvins comprise the overwhelming  majority in the republic (around 65 percent), the probability of  its separation from Russia in the next few years is very great.  The population of Tuva is largely comprised of lamaists of the  Mongol doctrine and is culturally oriented toward its former  suzerain--the Mongol state. Unemployment and a high crime rate  facilitate the increase in anti-Russian demonstrations, which  are not opposed by the official authorities.    The second zone of potential acute conflict is Krasnodar  Kray, which has become multi-national. Analysis shows that it is  among the regions which are most explosive in a national sense.  The concentration of situations generating conflict has long  been prevalent here, but especially since the late 1980's, and  continues to the present time.    The causes of such situations which arise in the kray are  varied. One of the reasons is concealed in the multi-nationality  of the kray, where along with the 4-million Russian population  there are representatives of 22 peoples, including Ukrainians,  Armenians, Adygey, Greeks, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Meskhetin  Turks and others. Most live compactly and represent groups which  are ethnically rather cohesive, retaining their native language  and traditions.    The second factor giving rise to inter-ethnic conflicts in  the kray is associated with migration, primarily forced  migration, and the influx of refugees which was facilitated by  the disintegration of the Union, the inter-ethnic conflicts, the  exacerbation of socio-economic and national situation in a  number of regions. The changed geopolitical position of  Krasnodar Kray evoked a new wave of migrations. It became a  border region of Russia.    The migration processes in Krasnodar Kray occurred in the  1970's-1980's. Crimean Tatars, Meskhetin Turks and Kurds moved  here. A new wave of influx of Meskhetins was caused by the  events of 1989 in Fergan. The influx of Armenians into Krasnodar  Kray increased in connection with the earthquake in Armenia in  1988, and was later spurred by the flare-up of genocide in  Sumgait and Baku and the war in Karabakh. The Abkhazo-Georgian  War gave a new impetus to forced migrations--of Russian,  Armenian and other refugees from Abkhaziya.    The dynamics of refugees in Krasnodar Kray is such: The  first  half of 1991--32,000 persons; October 1991--38,500; January  1992--54,000; April 1992--53,000; June 1992--58,500. In 1993 the  flow of refugees increased even more. By nationality, the  refugees were distributed as follows: Russians and  Russian-speaking peoples--27,000; Armenians--over 16,000;  Meskhetin Turks--around 13,500, and Azerbaijanis--1,500.    The influx of refugees and forced emigrants is continually  complicating the situation in the kray. Part of them are not  registered, and therefore cannot be employed. Inter-ethnic  relations between the Russians and the Armenians, the Cossacks  and the other population, the Adygeys and the Russians have  become particularly acute. In recent times there have been  repeated demands for the deportation of the Armenians and the  Meskhetin Turks. There are frequent cases of deportation of new  settlers from the kray. According to a sociological survey  conducted among the local deputies, the conflict situation in  the kray may intensify, since 60 percent of the population  (throughout Russia it is 20-25 percent) believes there is a  possibility of open conflict between individual national groups.    The third potentially dangerous point may become the  Republic  of Dagestan. Although on the whole it has been possible to keep  the situation under control there, the probability of a  breakdown and violation of relative ethnopolitical stability and  inter-ethnic accord is great.    A zone of increased conflict is the region settled by the  Chechen-Akkin, the once liquidated Aukhovskiy Rayon. The  authorities have been able to find a compromise decision which  satisfies the Chechen (their rayon is being restored) and the  Laktsy and Avartsy who are living here, and who are now being  relocated to new lands next to the Kumyk. On the other hand,  sentiments are increasing among the Kumyk against the occupation  of the "Kumyk lands" by the Laktsy. As the settlement continues,  the prospect of a conflict with the local Kumyk population  becomes rather probable.    Another notable point of inter-ethnic opposition in Dagestan  is the situation in the south of the republic, where the Lezghin  popular movement "Sadval" actively speaks out for the  preservation of the ethno-cultural and ethno-political unity of  the two parts of the Lezghin ethnos, currently separated by the  borders of the RF [Russian Federation] and Azerbaijan (there are  over 170,000 Lezghin living in Azerbaijan, and over 75,000  Azerbaijanis living in Dagestan). The formulation of the  boundary in this region may evoke sharp exacerbation of the  situation and lead to conflict.    Of the other points of inter-ethnic tensions, one that  requires particular attention is the Kumyk problem, which  consists of the desire by part of the Kumyk population for  administrative separation of their ethnic territory, as well as  the Nogay problem, which reflects the intentions of the Nogay  people to achieve unification of all Nogay territories which are  currently divided between Dagestan, Stavropol Kray and Chechnya.  <H6>  Regions (zones) of Strong Separatism </H6>   The Republic of Tatarstan occupies a peculiar place in the  ethnopolitical situation. The republic is located in the center  of the Russian Federation, and its population is almost half  comprised of Russians (43.3 percent). The most numerous and  influential national parties agitate for secession from the  Russian Federation and acknowledgement of equal rights for  Tatarstan. It is possible to preserve peace in Tatarstan because  the current leaders of Tatarstan are among the proponents of  Tatarstan independence who are gravitating toward gradual  disunification with Russia.    Slogans about Turkic unity are becoming ever more popular,  although on the whole the idea of creating a parliament of the  entire Tatar people, presented at the 1st All-Tatar Congress in  February of 1992 by the newly formed Milli Medjlis (people's  parliament), did not find deep-seated support in society. The  appearance of the Milli Medjlis changed the placement of  political forces: An organ emerged which was an alternative to  the official parliament. In the case of a political crisis in  the Republic of Tatarstan, we cannot exclude the possibility  that the Milli Medjlis may be changed into some semblance of an  all-national congress and that there will be a changeover by  members of the Milli Medjlis to extremely strict positions in  regard to the existing organs of power. A confirmation of this  is the joint announcement, in which the only lawful organ of  power of the Tatar people is acknowledged to be the Milli  Medjlis, and which contains an appeal for cohesion of the Tatar  people under its flag.    In the last two years there has been a radical  re-distribution of power and prestigious positions in favor of  the Tatars: 70-80 percent of all heads of administration and  chairmen of rayon soviets, rayon procurators, chairmen of rayon  courts, leaders of the RUVD [rayon internal affairs  administrations] and chief physicians. Nevertheless, the  leadership of Tatarstan stands on the positions of preserving  ties with Russia and conducting civilized negotiations with  Moscow on all important questions, especially on problems of  handing over the rights and authorities of the federation  subject to the center.*  <H6>  Regions of Moderate Regional Separatism </H6>   The political situation in the Republic of Komi is becoming  more complicated. The organization "Komi kotyr" created in  January of 1991, which speaks out as the initiator of  consolidation of the Komi national movement, has formed a  permanent organ--the Committee for Rebirth of the Komi People.  The active work of this committee in the republic and close  cooperation with analogous organizations of Finno-Ugric peoples  have significantly increased the prestige of the Committee for  Rebirth of the Komi People and its influence on the  ethnopolitical situation in the republic.    We must note that, within the Komi national movement, a  tendency has emerged toward merging of the Committee for Rebirth  of the Komi People with the constitutional system of power,  turning it into an organ representing the Komi people on the  foreign economic arena. At the demand of the Second Congress of  the Komi People (December 1992), the Republic of Komi Supreme  Soviet adopted a law on granting the congresses of the Komi  national movement the right of legislative initiative.    The Third Congress of the Komi People (December 1993)  demanded that an article be included in the republic's  constitution stating that Komi is a sovereign republic, with the  right of secession from the make-up of the RF. Demands were also  presented regarding the return to the Republic of Komi of five  rayons which had "previously been handed over" to the make-up of  Arkhangelsk Oblast.    We must stress that the Committee for Rebirth of the Komi  People is trying to establish control over the power structures  of the republic and, relying on the support of Estonia, to take  a course toward national self-determination.    We may also relate the situations which have arisen in  Yakutiya, Kalmykiya, and Gorny Altay to the zones of moderate  separatism. Despite the assurances by the republic leadership  that they have no intention of seceding from Russia, already  today the line of their legislative and executive organs of  power toward treaty, and not constitutional, relations with the  Russian center is becoming quite evident. This in fact leads, at  best, to the establishment of a specific form of confederative  relations.    And finally, we should note the group of regions with the  lowest level of inter-ethnic tensions. These include the  territories populated by the minor peoples of the European  north, Siberia and the Far East, a number of republics in  Povolzhye, Kareliya, specifically "Russian" krays and oblasts,  as well as regions of compact settlement of peoples who do not  have national statehood or autonomy (Veps, Izhor, Greeks,  Koreans, Tofalars, etc.).  <H6>  Prognosis for 1994 </H6>   New conflicts of a violent character over a large part of  the  territory of Russia are improbable in 1994, although in the  North Caucasus and in Dagestan the conflict potential is more  significant than in other regions.    On the whole, 1994 will not be a year of opposition by  specifically national groups or confessions. It will be a year  of "war" of the federal and national-republic structures over  the division of statehood, property and authority, over  questions of citizenship, the state language, and especially  questions regarding the sale (or redistribution) of land.    At the same time, the following problems will become objects  of political discussions and speculations, and may exacerbate  and undermine inter-ethnic accord.  <H6>  The Russian Republic </H6>   A number of social movements and political parties are  actively promoting the idea of the possibility of creating a  Russian Republic in Russia, based on the fact that Russians do  not have statehood, despite the fact that they are the most  numerous ethnic group. Russia is characterized as a federation  without Russians, and in this connection the task of struggling  for the creation of a single unitarian Russian state on the  territory of Russia is presented. For the present, this demand  does not yet find support in the mass consciousness. However, we  cannot exclude the possibility of an increase in the number of  its supporters.    The very idea, naturally, increases the status of Russians  in  Russia, but the creation of a Russian Republic would lead to an  actual dismantling of the RF and a disintegration of Russia.  <H6>  Russian Nationalism </H6>   There is a real danger that the Russian national ideal will  grow into a militant force, into everyday chauvenism, when,  under the influence of economic disintegration and political  instability, the mechanism of national self defense will begin  to operate in the public consciousness, growing into aggressive  behavior.    If we do not oppose this process now, then, by its  consequences, the nationalism of a large people cannot be  compared to any social catastrophes.  <H6>  Territorial Disputes Between Russia and the `Near Abroad'  Countries and Within Russia </H6>   Although there are no pretensions between the republics of  the former USSR at the state level, in fact there are a number  of situations which, under certain circumstances, may turn  latent (hidden) processes into open ones.    First of all, this is manifested in the position of part of  the Russian population (and certain foreign national groups  associated with them) not to migrate to Russia, but to go under  Russia's jurisdiction together with the territory on which they  are living. This concerns the Dniester region, the Crimea, the  region of Kokhtla-Yarve and Narva in Estonia, and certain  regions in the Northern Caucasus and Eastern Ukraine.    Secondly, this is the desire by a number of autonomies or a  number of peoples to enter the make-up of the Russian  Federation--Abkhaziya, South Ossetia, or the Lezghin (37 percent  of whom presently live in Azerbaijan).    Thirdly, there are territorial claims also inside the  republics, stemming from the fact that the people of a given  nationality live on adjoining territories. This is manifested in  the claims of a number of political leaders of Tatarstan to  regions with a predominant Tatar population in the Republic of  Mari El and the Republic of Bashkortostan, and in Ulyanovsk and  Samara Oblasts. Among the Komi people, the notion of  reunification with the Komi-Permyaks, who have their own okrug  within Perm Oblast, is actively propagandized. There is an  analogous situation in Buryatiya, where the idea of  reunification with fellow countrymen having their national  formations in Irkutsk and Chita Oblasts is actively supported.  An intensification of Kalmykiya's claims regarding the regions  which have been "lost" and handed over to Astrakhan Oblast and  Krasnodar Kray can also not be excluded.    And finally, there is the desire by a number of peoples,  especially those who had been previously deported and now  returned to their homeland, to regain all the territory which  previously belonged to them.    The problem of the Germans in the Povolzhye [Volga region]  occupies a special place. And although many demands have as yet  been expressed in the form of wishes, this does not remove the  danger of aspirations to review the boundaries.    Despite all the disputes, indecisiveness and even historical  injustice, to try to change the existing boundaries at the  present time means to create a dangerous groundwork for the  emergence of bloody inter-ethnic conflicts. Moreover, the first  precedent of this sort will open the way for violence on an  inter-ethnic basis, which, taking on an avalanche character, has  the prospect of lasting for many generations.    All disputed questions must be resolved only by means of  lengthy negotiations and through striving for accord. In this  sense, we must return once again and permanently declare a  correction to the previously adopted law, "On Rehabilitation of  Repressed Peoples," which states that their political  rehabilitation is associated with the restoration of the  boundaries lost during the time of relocation of these peoples.  As experience shows, the implementation of this law in terms of  defining the national-territorial boundaries must be repealed,  making the consideration of the interests of the peoples  previously living here dependant on other methods of resolution.  <H6>  The minor peoples (national minorities) </H6>   Among the most numerous people of Russia, aside from the  Russians (82 percent), are the Tatars (3.7), Ukrainians (3  percent), Chuvash (1.2 percent), Bashkirs (0.9 percent), the  peoples of Dagestan (1.2 percent), and the Belorussians (0.7  percent). These seven peoples make up 93 percent of the  population. The remaining 7 percent are comprised of 110  peoples, among which only 26 number more than 100,000 persons.  Thus, there are currently 29 primary peoples residing in  Dagestan (according to the census of 1926 there were 81 ethnic  groups).    On the whole, the picture appears as follows: 16 national  groups (a total of 7.8 million people) represent the peoples of  the CIS countries; 30 national groups (1.3 million people)  represent the peoples outside the boundaries of the CIS  countries (Englishmen, Bulgarians, Finns, etc.); Another 30  national groups (173,000 people) represent the peoples which do  not have statehood anywhere in the world (Gypsies, Assyrians,  Uygurs, Kurds, etc.). There are another 22 peoples (116,000)  living in Russia but not having national-territorial formations.  And, finally, there are 10 peoples (67,000 people) who do not  have any national territories, neither in the RF, nor in the  CIS, nor in third countries.    Based on the fact of such a large number of peoples, we may  conclude that the primary means of development for most of them  is the creation and strengthening of a national-cultural, and in  a number of places also a national-territorial autonomy. In  principle this is the most progressive approach for Russia, in  which, due to historical peculiarities, the national groups are  found in compact groups as well as being dispersed.    As for the representatives of all peoples, it would be  possible to create a civic (national) assembly under the Russian  government, which would operate as a consultative organ  according to the principle of representation: One people--one  vote.  <H6>  Possible Scenarios for the Development of the Ethnopolitical  Process </H6>   These scenarios are closely associated with the resolution  of  cardinal tasks on reforming Russia, and with the effect of  outlined tendencies in the development of basic spheres of  society, including the sphere of relations between various  ethnic communities and groups and their political structures.    Variant 1. This could be called the ideal. It  presupposes the development of events under which the program of  stabilization of the economy would be successfully realized,  social protection of the population would be ensured, the  impulses of market relations would manifest themselves in a  positive manner, demands would be unconditionally met, including  those directly relating to the problems of inter-ethnic  relations on the basis of the negotiation process.    In this case, we would be able to expect a resolution of  acute inter-ethnic conflicts, an extinguishing of the "hot  spots," and a significant reduction in the level of tensions in  inter-ethnic relations.    However, the realities are such that the negative factors in  the economy in 1994 will not disappear, and at times may even  make themselves known in more acute forms. The currently  intensifying heterogeneity in development of subjects of the RF,  and the national-state and national-territorial transformations  are manifested in the ever-deepening gap in living standards,  and in the indicators of meeting the material and cultural needs  of various ethnic groups. As for the possibility of the effect  of such a factor of a centripetal tendency as the constitution,  this is in grave doubt. Based on the fact that the constitution  has been adopted by only a part of the republics, efforts at its  active application may evidently exacerbate inter-ethnic  contradictions to a certain degree and intensify the negative  attitude of the ethnopolitical elite in some republics who view  the RF Basic Law as an effort to "tighten the screws" on the  part of the center and to turn Russia into a dictatorship or at  best a unitarian state.    Thus, the factors stimulating centrifugal tendencies are  still strongly making themselves known. Therefore, the examined  variant of the prognosis, if we keep in mind the near future, is  improbable.    Variant 2. This characterizes the disperse state  of inter-ethnic relations in Russia, distinguished by a rather  high degree of tension and national-regional instability. We are  speaking specifically about the fact that tensions may be  manifested in one form or another within the scope of one or  several regions. These are primarily the Northern Caucasus,  Povolzhye, certain border zones, places of accumulation of  refugees, etc. This variant is probably the most likely. Under  such a variation, the primary task will consist of putting a  timely end to the conflagration in one region or another, using  non-violent methods wherever possible, and not allowing the  conflict to expand to an all-federal level. Evidently, it will  be necessary to act in such a manner for a number of years. An  obstacle to the realization of this variant will be the rather  deep mistrust of the real possibilities and abilities of the  power structures to resolve inter-ethnic conflicts.    Variant 3. This may conditionally be called the  "division of Russia." Its scenario presupposes the possibility  of such a situation when several republics at once (for example,  two or three) reject the requirements of the RF Constitution,  and in the process of the escalating confrontation with the  center strive to leave the make-up of the Federation.    In no case should we underestimate this variant, even though  it seems significantly less probable than the second.    Variant 4. The "Yugoslavian." This is war, blood,  pain and suffering for millions of people--representatives of  various ethnic groups. It is the least probable and is reviewed  only as a warning. However, we must not lose vigilance. The  world of inter-ethnic relations is so complex and multiplanar  that what yestereday seemed merely an "abnormal" phenomenon may  tomorrow suddenly turn out to be a great misfortune.

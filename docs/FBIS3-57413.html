"An economic coup is taking place in the country", Fedorov  said in a statement on Wednesday.    "Boris Nikolayevich, we pin all our hopes on you. The  question is not in Fedorov, the question concerns the fate of  the country which is being determined in these days, in these  hours. I hope that nobody has illusions that economy can be  separated from politics", Fedorov said addressing the president.    The new government is now dominated by "red industrialists"  who doom the country to an inevitable collapse and the people to  decreasing living standards, Fedorov warned.    "All this contradicts many official government documents for  which I voted and for which a fought with former Supreme Soviet  the dreams of which are now being implemented. All this  contradicts the course of the president confirmed only several  days ago", Fedorov said.    Fedorov denied claims that his resignation was prompted by  personal ambitions and dislike of Central bank Chairman Viktor  Gerashchenko and deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha.    "My position has nothing in common with personal reasons",  he  said and explained that he resigned because "it is inadmissible  that people who had inflicted colossal economic and political  damage to the state, who are resolute and open opponents of the  course of reforms, keep their positions in the government".    "I cannot agree with the turn in the policy which has been  publicly formulated by the prime minister of late and which is  being implemented", he added.    This policy consists, according to Fedorov, in backtracking  from anti-inflation work, in increasing money printing and in  the fact that the government is dominated by "a lifeless and  incompetent ideology".    Fedorov said that the government is now raising the  inflation  rate planned for the end of 1994 to 8-9 per cent compared to the  earlier target of 3-5 per cent. "This means that instead of the  annual inflation rate of 80 per cent we are being offered at  least 300 per cent. The gap is too big. Moreover, it will be  several times bigger in reality", Fedorov warned.    "The Ukranization has crossed the Russian border", Fedorov  said, referring to the deep economic crisis and skyrocketing  inflation in Ukraine.    There is no alternative to the policy of reform and "we  shall  soon see that in reality", he added. Sidetracking from the  course of financial stabilisation will boost inflation, decrease  real incomes of the population, collapse the exchange rate of  the rouble to 10,000 at the end of the year, devaluate savings,  restore shortages of goods, trigger exodus of capital to the  West, isolate Russia from world markets, according to Fedorov.    "At the same time there will be no rise in production, no  investments, no solution of unemployment problem. This is a way  to a deadend at the expense of the people", Fedorov said  predicting that the threat of a social upheaval becomes a  reality.    However, it is not yet late to stop backtracking from  reforms, Fedorov said and urged the president to do that.</p>

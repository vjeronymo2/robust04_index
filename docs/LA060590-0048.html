			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 12-YEAR-OLD BOY WOWS EDUCATORS WITH TEST SCORES  </P> <P> A 12-year-old Camarillo boy was among three top scorers in California under age  13 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and has been honored by Johns Hopkins  University in Baltimore.  </P> <P> Jeffrey A. Smith was among 11 preteens nationally who were cited by the  university for scoring at least 700 on the math portion and at least 630 on the  verbal section of the test, said Angela James, talent search coordinator for  the Johns Hopkins Center for the Advancement of Academically Talented Youth.  </P> <P> Smith scored 1,360 of a possible 1,600 points on the exam, which measures a  student's college preparedness.  </P> <P> "It was pretty tricky," Smith said of the test, which has intimidated many high  school juniors and seniors seeking high scores for college admission.  </P> <P> "I had the most problems on reading comprehension but felt pretty comfortable  on the science section," Smith said. He said his only preparation was taking  the practice test in the SAT registration booklet.  </P> <P> A seventh-grade student at Mesa Union School, Smith took the SAT in January  with more than 46,000 other gifted students in 19 states and the District of  Columbia.  </P> <P> Johns Hopkins asked schools to choose their best students from among those who  scored in the top 3% of standardized achievement or aptitude tests to take the  SAT along with high school students, James said. Other universities conducted  similar programs in the other states.  </P> <P> Smith, who scored 630 on the verbal portion and 730 in math, won two $100 merit  scholarships -- one each in math and English -- to be used toward accelerated  summer programs that Johns Hopkins offers through several California colleges,  including Redlands University in the Los Angeles area, James said.  </P> <P> Clay Smith, Jeffrey's father, said he knew that Jeffrey is "pretty smart on the  local level," but the family was pleasantly surprised that he had done so well  nationally. Jeffrey has won his school's spelling bee for the past three years  and also placed first in math and science earlier this year in the Camarillo  Academic Olympics.  </P> <P> He also participates in track and field and is an accomplished clarinetist who  plays at local functions with a six-piece clarinet ensemble whose other members  are high school students.  </P> <P> Dennis J. Convery, superintendent of the one-school, 350-student Mesa Union  Elementary School District, said Smith "excels in just about everything."  </P> <P> Convery said the district is proud because Smith has been a student there since  he was in kindergarten. "We feel that the learning that's taken place here, and  being able to help him reach his potential and keep him challenged, is a  reflection on the staff," he said.  </P> <P> Smith said he has profited from the district's small size. "I like it," he  said. "You get lots of personal involvement from the teachers, and you know  everybody at the school."  </P> <P> Smith said he would probably wait until his junior year in high school before  taking the test again, and would try to score even higher.  </P> <P> Despite his high SAT scores, Smith said he would not try to skip a grade or two  and graduate ahead of his classmates.  </P> <P> "Oh no," he said. "I wouldn't want to do that."  </P></p>

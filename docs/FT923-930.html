			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: The relegation zone Sterling's fall of nearly three pfennigs yesterday was a taste of what life in the slow lane can be like. We do not yet know whether the Bundesbank and the Bank of France have finally triumphed in their battle with the currency speculators. It may be that the latter will have another go, but the Bank of France will doubtless ensure that the cost of being short of francs is prohibitive over the weekend. And the central banks certainly seemed to be on a winning streak yesterday. That not only lessens the chance of a cut in German interest rates; if the attack on the franc is repelled, France and Germany may want quickly to cement their victory by establishing a hard currency zone within Europe. Encouraged by Mr Major's apparent distaste for a speedy return to the ERM, the UK equity market jumped to the conclusion that sterling's position outside such an arrangement left more room for rate cuts. The trend in the currency market suggests otherwise, at least in the medium term. Sterling will be more vulnerable to speculative swings. Monetary policy will have to be rigorous if foreigners are to be convinced to buy gilts. The UK joined the ERM in 1990 partly with the immediate aim of cutting short term interest rates. It is easy to forget that that was preceded by a period in which the government was running a surplus and had no need to fund itself in the bond market.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Bonds: SEK launches Dollars 100m zero-coupon offering Another slow day in the eurobond market was enlivened by just one deal yesterday, a Dollars 100m offering of two-year bonds by Swedish Export Credit (SEK). The zero-coupon issue, which offers a pick-up in yield of about 500 basis points above two-year yen deposit rates, will be placed entirely with Japanese retail investors, lead manager Daiwa said. SEK, a frequent borrower which has raised about Dollars 5bn this year on international markets, launched an almost identical deal at the end of October. Italy, Finland and the Canadian province of Ontario are reported to be looking at the five-year dollar sector. Finland has also been linked with a long-dated sterling deal. Kansai Electric Power is rumoured to be considering a dollar deal via Merrill Lynch. Current favourable swap levels mean that other Japanese electric power companies are likely to follow, said one trader. A number of borrowers are reported to be looking at the yen sector, where demand - especially from the life insurance companies - remains strong. The European Investment Bank is reported to be considering a six- to 10-year offering of at least Y100bn.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FORMALLY SPEAKING  </P> <P> Taffeta, satin and sequins for the girls; pegged pants and fancy cummerbunds  for the guys.  </P> <P> These were the fashions most prominent at Brea-Olinda High School's winter  formal dance Dec. 9 at Plaza de Cafes in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Most of the dresses were strapless or spaghetti-strapped, and almost all were  cut above the knee. Some girls went for metallic golds, silvers, blues or  greens. Popular colors tended to be the darker ones -- black, royal blue and  jade -- though some opted for pastels. "I like the pink dresses," said Archana  Hardas, a Brea-Olinda junior.  </P> <P> Velvet was still the most desired fabric, though only a few actually wore  dresses made of it. "Velvet dresses with ruffles, either sleeveless or with big  sleeves, are nice," junior Chrissy Barlet said. "But there is a limit to the  ruffles, as nobody likes too many frills and bows."  </P> <P> Senior Wendy Winslow said the fashion key was to keep it simple. "Tight, short  dresses are in, but they have to be simple," she said. "Wear a lot of  accessories."  </P> <P> For guys, it was much easier: Black tuxedos and patent leather shoes. Of  course, bow ties and cummerbunds had to match the girl's dress.  </P> <P> "Most wore short, fitted jackets rather than long ones," junior Ray Jordan  said. "Though some did show up in tails."

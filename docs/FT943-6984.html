			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Selective interest revives banking sector Interest in the underperforming banking sector, selective in Zurich but more general in Frankfurt, was a key feature in yesterday's bourse recovery, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Robert Law, a banking analyst at Lehman Brothers in London, said this week that there were now strong valuation arguments for selected bank stocks: bank p/e and yield relatives, he said, had returned to 1980s levels and the fall in bank shares had been almost indiscriminate. FRANKFURT rose in moderate activity, turnover only easing from DM7bn to DM6.9bn as the Dax index increased 18.50 to 2,126.37, more than incorporating Tuesday's post-bourse gains, and climbed again after hours to an Ibis-indicated 2,132.98. Investor interest in banks, along with consumer and building stocks, took Deutsche Bank up DM15.50 to DM701.50, Dresdner by DM10 to DM398.50 and Bayernhypo by DM7.50 to DM410. Interest in the chemicals sector was positive, but relatively muted, Hoechst leading after its 39 per cent rise in first half pre-tax profits with a gain of DM3.50 to DM347.50. In pharmaceuticals, however, Schering bounced back strongly after coming under sharp recent pressure on news of an official probe into some of its drugs, recovering another DM24 to DM912.50 . PARIS tracked bond futures and ended a little higher, the CAC-40 index rising 5.66 to 2,006.29 in turnover of FFr3.2bn. Banks mostly did well, Suez rising FFr3.50 to FFr261 and CCF FFr4 to FFr213.50. The losers included Canal Plus, down FFr16 to FFr911 after Les Echos, the newspaper, said that Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, France's new communications minister, was expected to put stricter conditions on the operations of France's main coded television channel. MILAN ended higher, the Comit index rising 12.77 to 688.32, but political factors continued to influence shares. Investors were waiting for Friday's cabinet meeting at which draft 1995 budget proposals are due to be discussed. As a result, short-term buying was evident in most sectors, although insurance and telecom stocks proved to be notable exceptions. Insurers were popular among foreign and domestic institutional investors who were said to be bargain hunting after the heavy losses suffered by the sector in the market's recent correction. The sector also benefited from speculation that it could gain from budget changes. Generali, for example, was up 1.1 per cent at L41,771 and RAS gained 1.4 per cent at L25,849. ZURICH drew support from a firmer dollar, with the SMI index advancing 10.2 to 2,541.1. However, volume remained thin and most activity was limited to position-squaring by professionals. Investors focused on Georg Fischer, up SFr105, or 7.2 per cent at SFr1,560 after reporting better than expected first half profits. UBS bearers recovered SFr19 to SFr1,097, while buy orders boosted Nestle SFr10 to SFr1,194 and Roche certificates by SFr60 to SFr5,740. AMSTERDAM was supported by a slightly firmer bond market, and by Wall Street as the AEX index closed 3.21 higher at 414.04. One of the bright spots was Internatio-Mueller which jumped Fl 6.90 to Fl 86.40 after reporting first half results above expectations, while KPN closed up Fl 0.20 at Fl 51.80 in fairly heavy turnover ahead of half-year results released after the close of trade. KPN, the Dutch telecommunications and postal group partly privatised in June, posted a rise of nearly 17 per cent in first-half net profit. In contrast, Pakhoed was down Fl 1.30 at Fl 48.90 after first half results which were below expectations while Hagemeyer closed down Fl 0.20 at Fl 136.80 on its progress report. Philips advanced by Fl 0.60 to Fl 57.70 after Moody's Investors Services, the US credit rating agency, said that it had placed the company's long-term debt ratings under review for a possible upgrade. MADRID accelerated its recovery a little on Wall Street's gains and a firmer dollar, the general index rising 1.91 to 306.15 in turnover of Pta23bn. Banks were mixed with BBV, Banesto, Popular and Argentaria all losing ground, BCH gaining a little and Santander rising Pta60, or 1.2 per cent to Pta5,160. ADR stocks like Repsol and Telefonica offered a gentle response to Wall Street, rising Pta15 to Pta4,005, and Pta10 to Pta1,795 respectively. STOCKHOLM finished sharply higher, underpinned by the stronger trend on other European bourses. The Affarsvarlden General index climbed 25.3, or 1.8 per cent to 1,436.6 on turnover of SKr2.95bn. Astra A jumped SKr5, or 3 per cent to SKr170 on speculative buying ahead of mid-term results next week. WARSAW dropped on intense profit-taking in blue chips and brokers said that the slide would probably continue tomorrow. The all-share index fell 535.8, or 4.2 per cent, to 11,971.2, weighed down by a 10-per cent decline in the market heavyweight, Wedel.

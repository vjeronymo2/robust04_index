			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AN EARLY CAMPAIGN OF CURTIS RECALLED  </P> <P> I have watched, with much bemusement, the current trials and tribulations of  Mission Viejo Council Member Bob Curtis and the recall election instigated by  the so-called "Alliance For Mission Viejo." It brought me back to my high  school days when I helped Bob in his first campaign for a seat on the student  council.  </P> <P> He hasn't changed all that much.  </P> <P> I have to agree with his critics that Bob can be rude, arrogant and quite  adamant in his convictions. So what? History has shown us that many of our  leaders have behaved similarly. It is kind of scary to think that some  self-serving companies, corporations and individuals are so scared of Bob  opening his mouth that almost $440,000 has been spent to silence him.  </P> <P> DAVE HUTCHINSON  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

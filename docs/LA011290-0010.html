			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEMOCRATS' IRRESPONSIBLE ROGUE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: NO MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN IS AS FAR TO THE RIGHT AS JESSE JACKSON IS  TO THE LEFT -- AND HE'S THE STAR OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  </P> <P> Which aspiring Democratic presidential candidate compares the American  military's action in Panama with the massacre of defenseless protesters in Tian  An Men Square by the loathsome Chinese 27th Army? The redoubtable Rev. Jesse  Jackson.  </P> <P> When the average American is asked to name the most prominent Democrat in the  country, whom do you suppose he names most frequently? Is it the benign Speaker  of the House? You know, Congressman What's-His-Name, the one who just had his  dog, Alice, put to sleep? You know, the one who replaced that wheeler-dealer  Texan, Jim Wright? No, he is not the most prominent Democrat. Well, would it be  the congressman who had the homosexual prostitute staying in his home, or,  perhaps, the recent House whip who absconded from Washington before the Ethics  Committee sent a posse out to haul him in? No, again. The most prominent  Democrat of all is either Sen. Edward Kennedy, the guy whose Oldsmobile could  not swim, or, perhaps a point or two more frequently mentioned, Jesse Jackson.  </P> <P> Thus I think we can all see why, absent Jackson on the national scene, the  Democrats would be in rather bad odor with the American people. With Jackson on  the scene they are in worse odor. There are many nice, polite Democrats at all  levels of American government. Their problem is that there are also many  irresponsible rogues among the party's eminences and Jackson is the most  irresponsible of all. He is not just insufferable. He is a left-wing rigorist  whose presence reminds ordinary Americans that not all anti-Americans live in  Libya.  </P> <P> It is the misfortune of mainstream Democrats that about the time that former  Sen. George McGovern won the Democratic presidential nomination, these  left-wing anti-Americans gained a hoof-hold in the Democratic Party. They have  not been dislodged. Many are as far to the left as various right-wing fringe  groups are far to the right, but right-wing fringe groups are beyond the bounds  of the Republican Party. Left-wing fringe groups, as alienated from America as  are their right-wing equivalents, now figure prominently at every Democratic  presidential convention, and their candidate is Jackson.  </P> <P> Comparing our invasion of Panama with the Chinese army's slaughter of its  fellow citizens in Tian An Men Square is as irrational a flight of malevolence  as it would be to compare our invasion of Panama with the Soviets' invasions of  Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Afghanistan. No normal mind would think of such a  wild comparison, but Jackson's did, and he is right now quite possibly the  front-runner for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. He said that our  action was similar to those Soviet invasions. He said that we had lost our  claim to moral high ground. He said that our troops were burying Panamanian  civilians "in mass graves," and that the corpses numbered more than 1,200. This  he declared when most estimates settled on 300 civilians killed (the official  U.S. government figure is now 220), and when there was relief on all sides that  the tyrant Noriega was in irons.  </P> <P> These are not the statements of an ordinary Democrat, an ordinary black  Democrat or even an ordinary liberal Democrat. They are the statements of a  far-out left-wing zealot receiving ideas from fringe groups such as something  called the Caribbean Action Lobby.  </P> <P> Jackson's spokesman cites the Caribbean Action Lobby as his source of the  intelligence on Panama. It is an organization that is very hard to track down.  A Washington journalist tried and finally found a telephone number somewhere in  Brooklyn, where a somewhat distracted woman, speaking over the din of noisy  children, suggested calling back in a few days.  </P> <P> Now, that is the enlightened source of this prominent presidential candidate's  utterances, and he ventilates his extremist claptrap regularly, sometimes on  national television, sometimes before distinguished Democratic audiences. Early  this month at a prayer service honoring New York's Mayor David Dinkins, he  declared Christ's birthplace "under occupation" by Israel. Well, those who now  occupy Bethlehem are its original inhabitants, Christ's fellow Jews. But that  is not what Jackson meant. Once again he was making an extremist point from the  swales of the far left.  </P></p>

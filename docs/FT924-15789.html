			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Beckman declines 18% to Pounds 903,000 Pre-tax profits at A Beckman fell by almost 18 per cent, from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 903,000, in the year to June 30. Turnover slipped by Pounds 580,000 to Pounds 10.8m. The company said conditions in the textile division continued to be difficult, but it remained profitable. Stock levels, debtors and overheads continued to be controlled. In the property division, the company's investment portfolio was almost fully let, with interest payable more than covered by rental income. A revaluation of investment properties, coupled with the downward revaluation of assets, reduced the revaluation reserve to a little less than Pounds 2.7m. Earnings per share emerged at 5.2p (6.4p). A same-again final dividend of 3.15p is recommended, maintaining the total at 4.78p.</p>

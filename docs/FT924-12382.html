			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: UK machine-tool maker in Indian licensing deal BRIDGEPORT MACHINES, the Leicester-based machine tool builder, has signed an important collaboration agreement under which Batliboi, the Indian industrial conglomerate, will make Bridgeport horizontal machining centres under licence. The agreement stems from a Pounds 4m order won earlier this year by Batliboi from the Ishapore-based Rifle Factory for 16 horizontal machining centres to manufacture arms. Machining centres are automated, multi-function machine tools. Batliboi wanted access to the latest machine-tool technology so that it could win the military order and subsequent commercial contracts. The deal has taken four years to negotiate, and is the first such agreement in India for Bridgeport. The UK company fought off competition from German rivals that dominate the market for machine tools used in arms manufacture. Mr Malcolm Taylor, Bridgeport's managing director, said collaboration was 'the key' to the Indian market, which has been very difficult for western suppliers. 'But there is a general feeling that things are opening up somewhat.' Batliboi's Rifle Factory is worth about Pounds 1m in export business to Bridgeport, which is supplying three complete machines and the key parts such as spindle assemblies and Siemens controls for the other 13. Once the contract is fulfilled, production will continue at Batliboi's factory at Surat, Gujarat State.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: No. 10 defends Gummer's pond MR JOHN GUMMER, the agriculture minister, was supported yesterday by officials at 10 Downing Street yesterday as he insisted that there had been no impropriety in accepting improvements worth Pounds 2,600 to the grounds of his country house, Alison Smith writes. Labour MPs have sought further details of the landscaping of a pond paid for by Hillsdown Holdings as part of an agricultural show in September. The Ministry of Agriculture said Mr Gummer had ended up out of pocket over the show, but it emerged last night that Adas, the farm advice agency, had drawn up the specification for the pond, but had not charged Hillsdown Holdings for the work. Downing Street said Mr John Major had not been consulted at the time, but was convinced Mr Gummer had done nothing wrong.</p>

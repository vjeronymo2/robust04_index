			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee tumbles - Market report London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures tumbled yesterday following reports of rain in Brazilian growing areas. The January contract ended Dollars 133 down at Dollars 3,530 a tonne after dipping below Dollars 3,500. As speculative selling pushed the market lower the Brazilian weather reports 'had buyers holding off until the full effect. . . on the (1995-96) crop is known', one trader explained. Buyers were also on the sidelines during a sluggish session at the London Metal Exchange. Dealers said nearly all metals opted to consolidate, absorbing speculative profit-taking and selling. They added that the underlying trend remained upwards in most cases. The three months COPPER price closed just 50 cents down at Dollars 2,556 a tonne, but ALUMINIUM added Dollars 12.75 to Friday's Dollars 21.25 setback to close at Dollars 1.740.50 a tonne.

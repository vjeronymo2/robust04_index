			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> On its simplest, silliest level Herbie Goes Bananas (ABC Sunday at 7 p.m.), the  Latin American adventures of the anthropomorphic VW bug, is agreeable enough  piffle. In this 1980 release, the fourth in the popular series, Herbie's new  owner, a young racing-car driver (Stephen Burns), and his sidekick (Charles  Martin Smith) hope to race Herbie in Brazil's Grande Premio.  </P> <P> The new four-hour, two-part Brotherhood of the Rose (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.,  completed Monday at 9 p.m.) pits father, a CIA deputy director (Robert  Mitchum), against his CIA agent-sons (Peter Strauss, David Morse).  </P> <P> Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a rousing,  deliciously sophisticated update of the 1941 fantasy "Here Comes Mr. Jordan"  that preserves the wonderful, funny, lyrical optimism of the original. Beatty  produced, co-authored (with Elaine May) and co-directed (with Buck Henry) this  1978 production in which he stars as a pro football quarterback whose death is  untimely in every sense and who gets two more tries at earthly pleasures.  </P> <P> In the quietly endearing 1982 Tex (Channel 5 at 8 p.m. Monday and Saturday),  Matt Dillon stars as an impoverished, small-town Oklahoma 15-year-old in this  Tim Burton film of S.E. Hinton's novel. He's one of a group of likable,  resilient teen-agers, some trapped by the burden of too-early maturity, getting  on with their lives yet valuing the bonds of friendship and familial love.  </P> <P> The Day After (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.), Nicholas Meyer's shocking, horrifying and  utterly uncompromising 1983 TV movie about the lethal impact on Lawrence, Kan.,  when nearby Kansas City is destroyed by Soviet missiles, is being repeated, but  be warned: It's a half-hour shorter than the 2 1/2-hour length at which it  originally was aired, having already been pared down from four hours. Jason  Robards stars as a Kansas City surgeon who is making the 37-mile trip to  Lawrence when the missiles hit.  </P> <P> Broken Arrow (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is an authentic and engrossing 1950  Western in which Jeff Chandler's Cochise and an ex-Army man (James Stewart)  join to seek peace between settlers and Indians.  </P> <P> In the 1954 Western Broken Lance (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), Spencer  Tracy plays a Lear-like rancher losing control of both his family and his  cattle empire.  </P> <P> With a wild and antic imagination, The In-Laws (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.)  has Peter Falk sweep Alan Arkin, his son's future father-in-law who's a nice,  decent Manhattan dentist, into an adventure crazier than Arkin's wildest  imaginings. Directed in 1979 by Arthur Hiller.  </P> <P> The Return of a Man Called Horse (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.), decidedly  superior to the original, finds Richard Harris as an English lord returning to  the Dakota Territory for more adventures.  </P> <P> All That Jazz (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) can now only seem more poignant:  The late Bob Fosse predicted his own untimely death in this sleek,  autobiographical musical about an intense, womanizing Broadway  director-choreographer, played by Roy Scheider.  </P> <P> The 1988 TV movie Man Against the Mob (NBC Friday at 9 p.m.) stars George  Peppard as a police detective taking on Chicago mobsters and corruption in Los  Angeles in the 1940s.  </P> <P> Sam Fuller's The Big Red One (Channel 9 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a handsome,  almost leisurely recollection of the World War II experiences of five soldiers,  told from the point of view of the foot soldier whose dearest victory is merely  surviving. Lee Marvin stars.  </P></p>

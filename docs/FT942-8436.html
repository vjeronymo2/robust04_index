			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Observer: Exit third man And then there were two. Derek Rosling, 63, who retired this week from Hanson, was one of the Yorkshire trio which founded Britain's seventh biggest company. A partner in a firm of Huddersfield accountants which audited Hanson's family haulage business, Rosling has never had the same public recognition as Lords Hanson and White. He got a CBE - they got peerages. But Alex Brummer, whose book on Hanson comes out later this year, says that Rosling was a key figure behind the scenes. White did the deals, Hanson knocked them into shape, and Rosling kept the books. Whereas Hanson, 72, and White, 71, intend to soldier on till 1997, Rosling is quitting while he's still young enough to enjoy retirement in California's Palm Springs. He shouldn't be short of brass - Pounds 100 invested in Hanson in 1964 is now worth Pounds 137,000.</p>

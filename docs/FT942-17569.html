			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei in modest recovery after Thursday's setback A sharp rise in the yen hurt share prices on Thursday, but the Nikkei regained some ground yesterday on buying by dealers and individuals, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index, which plunged 447.99, or 2.3 per cent, to 19,111.92 on Thursday, firmed yesterday by 165.24 to 19,277.16. after a low of 19,161.63 and a high of 19,378.08. The 225 was down 2.8 per cent on the week. Wednesday's fall on Wall Street and fears over mounting US-Japan tensions over trade, which depressed investors' confidence, subsided as the New York stock market regained some ground overnight. The Topix index of all first section stocks, which fell 25.01 to 1,563.21 Thursday, ended up 7.97 to 1,571.18, while the Nikkei 300 rose 1.38 to 287.11 following a 5.26 point decline the previous day. Volume was 230m shares, against 305m. Gainers led losers by 643 to 361 with 160 unchanged. Analysts expect the current volatility in share prices to continue due to the uncertainty of yen movements against the dollar, and turmoil on the political front. On the trading floor, mobile phone related issues were higher. Kenwood, the most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y996. Fuji Photo Film fell Y90 to Y2,200 and Konica lost Y8 to Y630 on a preliminary decision by the US to impose anti-dumping duties on their products. In Osaka, the OSE average, which fell 254.78 to 21,495.30 on Thursday, rose 60.85 to 21,556.15 in volume of 15.1m shares. Roundup The region's markets were upset by the sharp fall on Wall Street on Wednesday. Manila was closed on Thursday and Friday. Seoul, Taiwan, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were open on Friday, Taiwan reacting most strongly to the Dow's late recovery on Thursday. HONG KONG's losses were trimmed by a late round of buying as news that Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Group had bought a large site at a government land auction was seen as a vote of confidence. The Hang Seng index finished 202.30 down at 9,029.91, down 2.2 per cent on the day and the week. Turnover remained scant at HKDollars 4.51bn. Hongkong Land, 10 cents higher at HKDollars 22.60, bucked the downward trend. AUSTRALIA saw its sixth straight fall, to its lowest since December 1993. The All Ordinaries index lost 39.30 at 2,053.1 down 4.6 per cent on the week, in turnover of ADollars 395m. Blue chips led the fall, with BHP down 48 cents, or 2.8 per cent, at ADollars 16.48 and News Corp 25 cents at ADollars 8.95. TAIWAN fell back 1.3 per cent on Thursday, but recovered most of that yesterday when the weighted index rose 59.65 to 5,308.87, 0.8 per cent down on the week. Turnover was TDollars 34bn. KUALA LUMPUR took its lead from Wall Street, ignoring a Bank Negara's forecast of sustained economic growth and its smaller-than-expected losses on foreign exchange operations. The composite index, which lost 10.05 on Thursday, picked up 7.22 to 952.72 yesterday, 1.8 per cent down on the week. SINGAPORE was cautious about developments abroad and the Straits Times Industrial index ended 47.49 or 2.2 per cent lower at 2,080.90 lower in quiet trading ahead of the long weekend, little changed on the week. KARACHI declined on profit-taking, the KSE 100-share index falling 23.24 to 2,540.46. Losers led gainers 112 to 237.</p>

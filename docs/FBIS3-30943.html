[Kucerova] The cabinet has decided on the participation of  the Czech Republic in the Partnership for Peace program. The  so-called presentation document will be submitted by 31 March.  The individual program of the Czech Republic in this project  will be worked out on its basis.    The government also discussed the situation of national  minorities. Vaclav Klaus said the following on this question:  Our point of departure is no discrimination against minorities.  The government, however, does not intend to set up any special  institution to discuss these problems.    A draft amendment to the law on land communications was also  adopted. In practice, this will mean the introduction of the  long-discussed motorway tax. The preliminary day of  introduction is 1 January 1995.</p>

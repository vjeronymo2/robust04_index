			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``The Indorayon Lesson''] </F>   [Text] For those who believe that economic considerations  alone can determine the failure or success of a business  investment, the string of protests which the North Sumateran  pulp and paper factory, PT [Company Limited] Inti Indorayon  Utama, has had to endure ever since the beginning of its  operations in 1989 should provide convincing proof to the  contrary.    Many of us probably remember the furor that arose a few  years  ago over the alleged contamination by the factory of village  water resources in the Porsea area, about 200 kilometers  southwest of Medan, where the plant is located. The agitation  died down after assurances by high-ranking officials that the  plant had done what needed to be done to ensure a clean  environment. The incident developed into the first  environment-related court case in which charges were pressed,  although without success, against an alleged offender by the  public, represented in this case by the Indonesian Environmental  Forum (Walhi).    Complaints of environmental pollution and indiscriminate  logging have since emerged off and on, although the company has  disclaimed allegations that its felling of trees has caused a  drop in the water level in Lake Toba, which feeds the Asahan,  one of the major rivers of North Sumatra.    Nobody, however, could have foreseen the vehemence of the  massive protest that occurred on Saturday, 6 November, after  what was reported to be an explosion at the plant set off panic  among villagers living nearby.    Newspaper reports quoted one of the PT Indorayon directors  as  saying the explosion involved one of the factory's three  bleaching tanks, each of which contained several hundred  kilograms of chlorine. As white smoke billowed from the damaged  installation, fear of another Bhopal incident triggered panic in  Porsea and thousands of villagers fled to safer areas at  Siborong-borong Tarutung and Parapat.    Later, into the night, hordes of enraged villagers forced  their way past the outnumbered security guards into the  compound, smashing everything in their path. The hysteria  receded for a while, when factory officials agreed to speak with  the villagers.    But some time later, scores of the terrified villagers  returned, demanding that the plant be closed for good as they  set houses ablaze and vandalized the factory. Informal local  community leaders had to be called in to restore calm and order  at the site of the violence.    In Jakarta, reports of the unrest motivated a member of the  House of Representatives to urge the company to suspend  operations until a thorough investigation could be conducted and  proper safety measures taken.    As the company's general manager for corporate affairs,  Brett  Hutton, later explained in Jakarta, the ferocity of the  villagers' reaction was the result of ``wild rumors fanned by  parties including the Medan press'' about the dangers of the gas  leakage. ``The explosion concerned a very small pipe. It let  out some gas but basically posed no danger to anyone. It was  fixed very quickly,'' Hutton said. He also said the company had  made a policy of fostering good relations with the community,  ``as attested by the award it won last year for its efforts in  this area.''    To judge by the constant public complaints about its  operations, however, it is apparent that still more effort is  needed.    Our mention of the Indorayon case, of course, serves merely  as an illustration of the importance of considering other than  economic factors in any undertaking in which community  acceptance can play such a decisive role. Surely, the recent  Porsea incident can serve as an important lesson for not only  Indorayon, but for any businessman about to invest his money in  Indonesia.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Ofwat outlines flow of price increases: The water industry's likely battleground Ofwat, the water industry regulator, will today tell the 31 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales how quickly it thinks water bills should rise in the next 10 years. During the next 10 weeks the water companies have a chance to respond to the proposed K factors - the rate above inflation at which prices may rise. The final K factors, which Ofwat will set at the end of July, will have more implications for the industry's structure and investment than any policy decision since privatisation in 1989. The difficulty for Ofwat is that the companies have embarked on huge investment programmes - which could reach a total of Pounds 40bn this decade  -to compensate for years of under-investment and to comply with European environmental directives. However, public concern about water bills, which have been rising faster than inflation to pay for the spending, has been growing. Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, has been under pressure from consumers and the government not to allow further high price increases. He is clearly sympathetic to that concern. As a result some expect Ofwat to issue K factors of up to 70 per cent less than that requested by some companies. The water companies, however, have been stressing that if Ks are set too low, customers will still suffer. Although customers judge drinking-water quality primarily on colour, taste and smell, such spending might be sacrificed to pay for legal obligations, one water industry executive said. The tussle between the industry and Ofwat will turn on the complex detail of the calculations. Companies have made it clear that they disagree with the regulator over some of its assumptions. In particular they have clashed on the method of valuing companies' assets, and on the rate of return companies should be allowed to earn on that capital. In their detailed submissions to Ofwat this year, setting out the Ks they want, many companies will have used their own valuation principles. 'The factors (such as rate of return) the companies will have put into their version of the models will certainly be higher (than Ofwat's),' said one water executive. 'They will not want to give away the arguments on cost of capital, for example.' Mr Byatt has said that he is determined to avoid 'horse-trading', and the next 10 weeks will allow companies to point out mistakes or oversights. However, many in the industry assume that the eventual Ks could differ greatly from the figures sent to companies today. Some companies have taken a more aggressive approach. 'He has told us there will not be any negotiation, so we have prepared our submission in terms of what we can defend at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,' says one water executive. Analysts believe Ofwat's aim is to secure an overall industry K of between zero and 2 percentage points. They argue that because the industry's capital spending is concentrated on the 10 water and sewerage companies, these will attract the highest Ks at the 'expense' of the smaller ones, which could see negative Ks - that is, rises below the rate of inflation. The smaller companies argue they deserve a higher cost of capital because of the greater financial risk of being smaller. They say they face the same legal obligations on drinking-water standards as the bigger companies and the same criminal sanctions if they do not comply. In the end, it is likely that some companies will be forced to go to the commission. Most analysts point to Northumbrian Water as a certainty. Northumbrian, with most of its population based on the coast or estuaries, is particularly vulnerable to the urban waste-water directive, which demands greater treatment of organic sewage previously simply filtered and dumped offshore. Northumbrian could face almost doubled capital expenditure of up to Pounds 200m a year during the next five years as a result. Yet it is unlikely to achieve anywhere near the K of seven it was given in the first price review. Most speculate that at least two other companies could end up at the commission. South West Water and Southern, like Northumbrian, are heavily exposed to the high costs of legislation on coastal clean-ups. Any more approaches to the commission could seriously undermine Mr Byatt's findings. It is a balancing act. 'If everybody goes then Byatt will be seen to have failed,' said one director. 'If nobody goes then he will be attacked for being too generous.'</p>

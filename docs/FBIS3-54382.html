			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The conference's official  spokesman stated that 1,235 people participated in the  conference. [passage omitted]    The official spokesman Abdelkader Bensalah affirmed further  that the disbanded Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] is not present  in the conference. However, contacts, which are still  continuing, have taken place but they have been very difficult.  The first signs are nonetheless encouraging. The following are  excerpts from the statement of the official spokesman of the  conference:    [Begin Bensalah recording] As far as the Islamic tendency is  concerned, I would like to say to you here that such a tendency  is not present at the national dialogue conference, contrary to  whatever has been said or published. On this occasion, however,  it is necessary to inform you that contacts have taken place  with this tendency. Such contacts are still continuing but they  have been difficult given the particularities of this tendency.  However, the first signs of these contacts have been  enouraging. [end recording] [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, there is intense activity in the corridors of the  Palais des Nations. There are consultations, contacts, rumors,  and reports on the personalities who could be appointed for the  transition period. Nobody can at this stage confirm or deny  these reports. Some parties have even held meetings on the  sidelines of the conference. Tension became so acute at times  that some participants stayed outside the conference hall.    In a nutshell, this conference is shrouded in suspense as  several assumptions are being made. Some say the conference has  failed or will fail, while others say this conference is a  prelude to a serious dialogue. The rest say that the conference  will remain open and that the remaining partners to the dialogue  may join.    This evening, the text of the draft proposal on the platform  for a consensus on the transition period was handed out to the  participants and journalists. The article which was amended a  second time and which has attracted everybody's attention is  article six of section one on the presidency of the state. This  article says: A head of state will be in charge of the  presidency of the state. The head of state can appoint one or  two deputies. The two deputies will assist the head of state in  the tasks assigned to them by him. The head of state will be  appointed by the Higher Security Council. This last point is  reported to have caused huge disagreements between the  participants and the bureau of the conference represented by the  National Dialogue Commission.    It is also reported that some parties may withdraw from this  conference to protest this amended article six of the draft  proposal on the platform. All these reports give an idea of the  general atmosphere here at the Palais des Nations and constitute  food for discussion for all journalists and political analysts.  Thank you. We will be back at 2000 [1900 GMT].</p>

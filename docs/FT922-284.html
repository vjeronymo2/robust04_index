			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: Bosnians leave cellars to hail unexpected visitor - French president's arrival lifts the spirits of a besieged capital city near to starvation IN the midst of the devastation of Sarajevo, people came out of their cellars to greet the French president yesterday with cries of 'Vive La France]' and hastily-scribbled placards proclaiming: 'Merci Mitterrand'. 'This visit could be a step towards ending the horror and avoiding military intervention,' said Mr Nikola Bilic, an editor of Sarajevo Radio, who for three months has been surviving on rice and macaroni. 'We have too many dead, too many wounded, who, if they survive, will be invalids. Bombs do not discriminate their targets.' Undaunted by the security risks, the 75-year-old president spent part of his six-hour trip walking through the centre of the shell-shocked city with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. They visited the military hospital, where they wished a speedy recovery to some 150 patients. When Mr Mitterrand arrived at Mr Izetbegovic's office, a large crowd chanted 'Mitterrand, Bosnia, France'. Some had tears running down their faces. Later, the unexpected visitor from Paris laid a red rose on an altar at Vase Miskina street, where 20 people were recently killed in a Serb mortar attack as they queued for bread. 'The efforts of Mitterrand are more than symbolic. The president of a great country shrugged off warnings of danger in a bid to show solidarity with the people of Sarajevo,' said Mr Bilic. The president appeared shaken by the devastation. He told journalists he felt saddened by the visit which recalled images from the second world war. 'I didn't think it would be like that because really most buildings are destroyed,' he told Reuters. 'It is destruction of great magnitude, nearly all the houses. After three months of siege it's become very dangerous and very sad.' Mr Bilic explained: 'He saw buildings that were once our treasures.' His visit lifted the spirits of a people at their wits' end after weeks of near-starvation. 'We had stopped hoping it would be possible to receive humanitarian aid by air. There was food for only two days more,' said Mr Zoran Pirolic, a Sarajevo editor. 'If the French manage to send a plane with food and medicine here, it will save the lives of many people.' But jubilation was mixed with apprehension about the coming days, and fears that this gesture would not end the bloodshed, or the fighting. Some inhabitants of Sarajevo feared the killing would not stop without foreign military intervention. Mr Aleksandar Karadjordjevic, the crown prince of Serbia, and the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church joined a demonstration of up to 100,000 people in Belgrade yesterday to demand the resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic. A group of 20,000 demonstrators remained on the streets last night blocking the city centre. Since the imposition of UN sanctions against Serbia, the opposition has grown more confident in its calls for the Serbian president to step down. Mr Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal Movement party, accused Mr Milosevic of leading Serbia and Montenegro, members of the reconstituted Yugoslavia, into an abyss of international isolation and condemnation. 'Far before the sanctions of the UN, the ruling (Socialist) politicians had excluded us from Europe. our economy has collapsed and unemployment has soared. They have created an atmosphere of national hysteria in Serbia,' Mr Draskovic said. The crowd shouted 'We want the king' and 'Slobo, get out'. The call to restore the king may find a groundswell of support in Serbian society, where backing for the monarchy has deep roots among the peasantry. In his halting Serbian, Prince Aleksandar at the weekend told students, in their third week of anti-government protests, that he was 'here to stay'. But the return of the heir to the throne may revive divisions in Serbia between royalists and republicans. Royalists Chetniks fought against Communist partisans during the Second World War in Serbia. Prince Aleksandar yesterday pinned his future to the opposition, criticising the warlike policies of the ruling Socialists (former communists). But the prince's open support for the opposition may backfire. His inability to speak Serbian weakens his appeal to the masses and may strengthen government claims that the opposition are agents of the CIA, the Vatican or Germany. Editorial Comment, Page 12</p>

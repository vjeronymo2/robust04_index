			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberta Jansen] </F>   [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 12 Jun (AE) -- Aeronautics Minister  Lelio Viana Lobo today said that the low salaries paid to the  military "are undermining the foundations of the institution"  and are causing "uneasiness" in the barracks. "Love for the  Fatherland maintains our discipline," he said, repeating the  words of Navy Minister Admiral Ivan Serpa. Lobo attended the  commemoration of the 63d anniversary of the National Air Mail  Service at Campo dos Afonsos, in northern Rio de Janeiro, where  he attended a mass and air shows.    "For a long time now we have been trying to show to the  government and to the people the distressing situation we are  experiencing," the minister said. Lobo, one of the designers of  the bill that provides for an average 35 percent salary  increase, hopes that President Itamar Franco will immediately  sign the provisional measure on the new law for military  salaries. "It is unfeasible to continue to earn a salary with  which we cannot live even a modest life," he claimed. "We know  the entire country is going through difficulties, but it is  important to solve this matter as soon as possible," he added.    The minister recalled that all military demands have been  made with due respect for the institution's hierarchy and  discipline. "We have no union, and we hold no marches," he said.  Brigadier Armando Arquimedes, chief of the Social  Communications Center of the Aeronautics Ministry, who was  accompanying Lobo, denied that the mistakes in the playing of  the national anthem last Friday, during a ceremony attended by  President Franco and the Navy minister, were meant to protest  the low salaries. "We do not protest that way. It was a  protocol mistake," Arquimedes said.    Concerning the proposal by PT [Workers Party] presidential  candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to create a defense ministry  gathering the three military ministries, Lobo said that the idea  must be carefully studied. "We have worked with a spirit of  cooperation for more than 50 years," he said, hinting that it is  not necessary to unite the three forces. The minister said that  if asked -- as has been promised by some of the candidates for  governor in the state -- the Air Force will cooperate in the  fight against violence in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

Kurdish leader Massud Barzani told AFP the Iraqi blockade  was  causing the region "a very serious problem."    Fuel prices tripled when the stoppage went into effect  Saturday, with the price of one litre rising from two dinar to  six dinar. Stocks rapidly ran out, with queues forming at every  petrol station.    Public transport was forced off the road by lack of fuel,  and  the streets were deserted.    Barzani, speaking at the headquarters of his Kurdistan  Democractic Party (KDP) in Salahuddin, said Baghdad was venting  its anger at Friday's UN decision by hitting the Kurds, because  it was "not powerful enough to do anything against the UN."    The UN Security Council renewed Friday an oil and trade  embargo imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in  August 1990, despite a split among council members on whether or  not to publically acknowledge Iraq's acceptance of UN demands.    The split, the first since the Security Council imposed the  embargo, meant the embargo was automatically renewed.    Barzani said the UN embargo was also causing Iraqi Kurdistan  economic difficulties, and called for finanical aid for the area.    Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control for the past  three years, after it was set up with the assistance of the  allied forces at the end of the Gulf war in February 1991.    Barzani added he was willing, if asked, to play a role in  helping to solve the problem of the Kurds living in Turkey.    A solution in Turkey "must include the Kurdish people and  cannot ignore them," he said</p>

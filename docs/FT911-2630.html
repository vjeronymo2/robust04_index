			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: Noranda in asset sale worth CDollars 500m NORANDA, Canada's biggest resource group, is selling assets worth nearly CDollars 500m to keep its consolidated long-term debts of CDollars 4.4bn (USDollars 3.8bn) under control, says chairman Mr Alfred Powis. Some sales have been negotiated, including disposal of Noranda's wire and cable subsidiary, with a book value of CDollars 220m, to Alcatel Cable, he said after the annual meeting in Toronto. He would not reveal the price being paid by Alcatel, but said it would be above book value. The total also includes about Dollars 100m of natural gas properties; half Noranda's holding in Cognos; a successful software company; and a 34 per cent interest in a western oil and gas exploration holding, with some smaller holdings. 'We don't need to sell anything else,' Mr Powis said. Noranda made a profit of CDollars 15m on sales of Dollars 2.13bn in the first quarter. Nothing was attributable to the common stock after payment of preferred dividends. A year earlier it turned in profit of Dollars 59m on sales of Dollars 2.4bn. The decline was due to a slump in the forest products subsidiaries and a strike at Noranda's zinc mining operations in New Brunswick. Royal Trustco, one of Canada's two biggest trust companies, returned to profit in the first quarter with earnings of CDollars 39m, or 15 cents a share, against CDollars 72m, or 40 cents, a year earlier. In the final quarter of 1990, it posted a loss of CDollars 251m, or CDollars 2.17 a share, following write-downs on its European operations and portfolio investments. Royal Trustco is the main financial services arm of the Toronto-based Brascan group. It said 1991 would be difficult, with a high level of non-performing loans, which totalled CDollars 180m at March 31. The Federal government has moved to wind up Standard Trustco and sell its trust assets. The Canada Deposit Insurance Corp will then pay out CDollars 1.5bn owed to more than 100,000 depositors. A hearing into the winding-up application is due tomorrow in Ontario Supreme Court. The Federal government seized the trust company's assets on 18 April and closed all 37 branches.</p>

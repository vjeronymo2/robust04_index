Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> GOETZ SENTENCE EXTENDED 2 WEEKS  </P> <P> Corrections officials have given subway gunman Bernhard Goetz two extra weeks  in jail for failing to return a disposable razor, a violation of jailhouse  rules, according to a published report today.  </P> <P> The Daily News said Goetz refused to return the razor because he wanted to have  one that only he would use.  </P> <P> Goetz, 41, has said he believed prison officials gave him used razors that may  infect him with the deadly AIDS virus. Prison officials maintain that all  inmates get a new razor blade each time they shave.  </P> <P> Goetz was scheduled to be released Sept. 6, but now is slated to be freed Sept.  20, the newspaper said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Congress of South African Trade Unions, COSATU, Press </F> Statement on President Mandela's Speech issued on the SAPA PR  Wire Service]    [Text] President Mandela's opening speech in Parliament  today sent an electric wave of hope around South Africa. It was  truly the speech of a people's president, reflecting his concern  first and foremost for the ordinary people of this land. In  particular it will be greeted with enormous enthusiasm by  working people.    The speech placed the Reconstruction and Development  Programme [RDP] firmly on the agenda as the cornerstone of  government policy over the next five years. COSATU pledges its  wholehearted support and undivided energy in ensuring the  success of this programme, and believes that the overwhelming  majority of South Africans want it to succeed. Indeed it was  extremely encouraging to hear that the entire cabinet of  national unity have come out in support of the RDP.    COSATU was also encouraged by the president's undertaking to  immediately put in place certain short-term measures which will  within the year begin to make an impact on the lives of working  people. These include the implementation of public works  programmes, the building of houses and infrastructure, health  programmes, training and education, and reorganisation of the  public service. The emphasis on job creation, together with the  fight against inflation and consumer protection will be welcomed  by working people who have been economically battered for so  many years.    COSATU welcomes the undertaking to bring South Africa in  line  with international standards, particularly in relation to  reforming and harmonising our labour legislation. The  president's speech also encouraged the development of strong  organisations of civil society, both at trade union and  community level.    His comments on the economy and financing the RDP were  imbued  with a vision of economic development which serves people. It is  clear that the government of national unity aims to reorient  priorities, and allocation of resources, to primarily address  the need to attack poverty, and ensure sustainable economic  development.    We are hopeful that President Mandela's comments on  unleashing the economic potential of all our countries people  will help to lay the basis for a new relationship between  employers and workers. The spirit of his comments are that  democratisation of the economy are as important as political  democratisation. This approach can only help to reinforce the  need for more effective worker participation in decisions on  issues affecting their daily lives.</p>

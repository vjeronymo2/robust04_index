			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Whitehall 'could save Pounds 15m on telecom bill' POTENTIAL SAVINGS of Pounds 15m a year are at risk because Whitehall is failing adequately to monitor its expenditure on telecommunications, the National Audit Office says today. The government's spending watchdog complains in a report that four years after it first recommended measures to improve the management of telecommunications in government departments, which could save up to 5 per cent of total expenditure a year, progress has been 'slow and piecemeal'. 'No department could provide a profile of telecommunications expenditure by location and type since 1989 or could identify the full scale of savings achieved,' the NAO says. While there were specific cases where departments had managed to cut costs, often by substantial amounts, there had been no systematic attempt to check telephone bills or take full advantage of modern technological safeguards including call-logging and call-barring. Whitehall spends more than Pounds 300m a year on telecommunications for day-to-day administration. The NAO investigated the Crown Prosecution Service, the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the Ministry of Agriculture. Together they account for about Pounds 22m of the total. Where modern technology had been used, there had been considerable savings. Call-logging equipment installed in one Home Office building revealed that 78 of the 130 exchange lines to the site could be withdrawn without affecting the quality of service at a saving of Pounds 12,500 a year. Detailed monitoring of telephone usage revealed overcharging on rental at the Ministry of Agriculture's office in Guildford, Surrey, extending over four years. Some Pounds 175,000 was subsequently recovered by the department. The NAO says, however, that it was concerned to find that departments did not know what savings, if any, they had achieved since the earlier report. 'In particular, departments and agencies need to be alive to the advantages on offer from continued technological developments and from the growth of competition,' it argues. Its recommendations include the allocation of telephone management responsibilities and bill monitoring. Management of Telephone Services. HMSO 931. Pounds 5.45.</p>

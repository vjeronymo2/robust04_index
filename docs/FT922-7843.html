			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cambridge Group advances 11% CAMBRIDGE GROUP, the Dublin-based leasing and financial services group, has reported a 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the year to February 29 from IPounds 4.53m to IPounds 5.02m (Pounds 4.6m). Turnover rose 42 per cent to IPounds 42.4m, against IPounds 29.8m. The group has also announced a placing of IPounds 10m of convertible loan stock with Electra Kingsway, an investment group. The stock is convertible to ordinary shares after three years within a price range of 50-55p. Full conversion at 50p would result in the issue of 20m shares, representing 23.6% of the enlarged capital. The proceeds will be used to strengthen the capital base. The book of lease payments, advances and hire purchase receivables grew by 32 per cent to IPounds 74.7m (IPounds 56.4m) which has been financed largely through a 42 per cent increase in bank loans and overdrafts to IPounds 68m. The Irish division saw growth and the UK operations performed satisfactorily. The collapse of the Europa group during the period gave rise to the company's largest single bad debt and problems were encountered in business through its Preston office. Full provisions were taken. The profit for the year included a IPounds 1.16m contribution from the Xtra-vision associate. Earnings per share were 6.31p (6.25p). A final dividend of 0.55p is recommended for a 1p (0.9p) total.</p>

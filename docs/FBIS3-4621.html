			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ipoh, Malaysia Feb. 26 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia's  Transport Minister Dr Ling Liong Sik said Saturday British media  reports of allegations that Malaysian leaders were corrupt must  be addressed first above the question of whether the new Kuala  Lumpur international airport in Sepang would be completed in  time.    He said: The question of the RM8 billion [Malaysian  currency]  (RM2.7; U.S.$1) airport is irrelevant. Whether it will be ready  in time is not the issue because the reports were very damaging  to the nation and its leaders.    It is a very serious issue, especially when it involved  leaders, including the prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed.    Dr Ling commenting on the cabinet decision Friday to stop  giving new contracts to British companies, particularly those  involving government aid or assistance.    Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who announced the  decision, said that all agreements with British companies that  had been signed would be honoured.    Dr Ling said it was very disappointing that the media in  Britain acted in such an irresponsible manner towards the  leaders of a friendly trading nation with which it had  historical ties.    He said the government was right in imposing the sanction  against British companies, especially when the reports were  disgusting and untrue.    Asked about the future of the Anglo-Japanese airport  consortium (AJAC) involved in the construction of the airport,  he said: The A (Anglo) might be out while the J (Japanese) will  remain.    The modern airport, equipped with the latest facilities, was  scheduled for completion in 1997.    Dr Ling also noted that as far as his ministry was concerned  British companies would not be offered projects.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS -- The 5th congress of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), which opened here on  Saturday [2 April], has vested party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky  with virtually dictatorial intra-party powers.    At the leader's request, the delegates unanimously voted for  an extension of his powers at this post "until April 2, 2004".    The delegates also adopted amendments to the party rules.    According to the amendments, from now on LDPR congresses are  to be held once in three years, not annually. They will elect  only a chairman enabling him to appoint a supreme council of the  party and other leading bodies, change their composition at any  moment at his own discretion. [sentence as received]    For the interim between congresses, all their powers are  automatically transferred to the LDPR leader.    The delegates also reaffirmed that in the event of a  presidential election in Russia, Zhirinovsky still remains the  party's candidate for the presidency.    The congress also adopted a resolution on the founding of a  party television and radio network "Sokol Zhirinovskogo"  [Zhirinovskiy's Falcon] which is called upon to disseminate "the  truth about the party" under conditions of a "total news  blackout".</p>

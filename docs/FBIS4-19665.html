			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mariann Nordstrom report: "Poll: Iceland Takes More </F> Positive View of EU"]    [Text] For the first time Icelanders take a positive view  of EU [European Union] membership.    Europe is changing, and the Icelanders are worried. This is  now being reflected in the fact that a majority now takes a less  negative view than before of the possibility of EU membership.  A recent opinion poll shows that a majority want Iceland to  begin membership negotiations.    The opinion poll was carried out between 22 March and 3  April, and Gallup Iceland asked the question: Do you think that  Iceland should start membership negotiations with the EU?    Of those interviewed, 69.2 percent want negotiations to  start, while 30.8 percent said "no."    Past opinion polls -- the last one was just before Christmas  -- have never produced any results like this. The most positive  pro-EU result has been 50-50 support for the EEA [European  Economic Area] agreement. A year ago support for membership  negotiations was between 20 and 30 percent.    The head of Gallup Iceland's international section,  Hafsteinn  Mar Einarsson, said that 64.2 percent of the men interviewed  said "yes" to membership negotiations, while a total of 76.5  percent of the women were in favor.    The largest amount of support among those interviewed was to  be found among supporters of Prime Minister David Oddsson's  Independence Party and Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin  Hannibalsson's Social Democrats -- both at 75 percent. "But  regardless of party affiliations the majority were for  membership negotiations," Einarsson said.    The reason is, he believes, that now that most of Iceland's  partners in EFTA [European Free Trade Association] are moving  toward the EU, Icelanders have grown anxious about becoming  isolated.    "We Icelanders feel we belong to the Nordic area. Now that  the rest of the Nordic area could become part of the European  Union, Icelanders are voicing the view that the possibility of  following should be investigated," he said, stressing that no  one has interpreted the poll to mean the Icelanders have now  said "yes" to membership, only to the possibility of reaching a  decision on the result of possible future negotiations, he said.    A total of 1,200 people were approached and 71 percent  responded.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life declines to Pounds 305.5m LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life assurance group, yesterday announced profits before tax of Pounds 305.5m for 1991, a 4.2 per cent drop compared with the previous year. The share price fell 11p to 379p on the news, mainly in reaction to the company's decision not to increase its final dividend. The total for the year is 17.3p, up from 17p last time. The company pointed out that pre-tax profits in its insurance businesses rose from Pounds 263.5m to Pounds 294m, and it was optimistic that its core strategy of selling life assurance and pensions to the customers of Lloyds Bank would continue to succeed. However, Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, admitted: 'Our non-insurance businesses have once again been severely affected by the recession, with bad debts in Lloyds Bowmaker continuing at a high level and the deeply depressed property market further reducing profits in the residential business of Black Horse Agencies.' Within its insurance businesses, Black Horse Financial Services, which sells life products to customers of Lloyds Bank, saw pre-tax profits increase by 34 per cent from Pounds 67m to Pounds 89.5m, and Lloyds Bank Insurance Services, selling general insurance, advanced 12.1 per cent from Pounds 48.7m to Pounds 54.6m. However, Abbey Life barely improved its position, increasing pre-tax profits by only 0.4 per cent from Pounds 142.3m to Pounds 142.9m. On the non-insurance side, pre-tax profits at Lloyds Bowmaker dropped 55 per cent from Pounds 50m to Pounds 22.3m, while Black Horse Agencies incurred a loss of Pounds 1.4m. Mr Roman Cizdyn, an analyst at Smith New Court, pointed out that from the point of view of the dividend the profits had been made in all the wrong areas of Lloyds Abbey's business. He said: 'A lot of the profit is not distributable because it is embedded in the life business.' However, Mr Roger Harvey, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the dividend had always been a 'finely balanced decision'. He said it reflected a prudent approach by the new chairman to the recession, and had not been forced on the company by any unforeseen circumstances. See Lex</p>

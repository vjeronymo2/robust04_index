			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (3): The loan rangers - Martin Dickson meets the region's bankers WHEN you visit the Atlanta office of Mr EP 'Bud' Gould, chairman of the Trust Company of Georgia, you are likely to be offered a drink of Coca-Cola. Not coffee; not tea nor any other beverage. Mr Gould is quite particular about his Coca-Cola, which is proferred to you in a bright red container bearing the drink company's logo. The gesture is a small but significant pointer to the long-standing ties between Georgia's largest banks and local industry. For the Trust Bank, part of the SunTrust regional bank holding company, underwrote the first issue of Coca-Cola stock back in 1919. It still owns Coke shares, now worth some Dollars 1bn, which it acquired in lieu of a commission for the flotation. Tradition alone, however, will not get you very far in today's intensely competitive Georgian banking business, which has undergone a radical change in the past decade as the banking industry of the American southeast has consolidated and as Atlanta's commercial success has attracted a substantial number of foreign banks to the city. Moreover, while Atlanta has long been the banking capital of the southeastern region - which is a large net importer of capital - that title is now being challenged by North Carolina, because two of Georgia's biggest banks have merged with institutions which have their headquarters in that state. That said, much of the region's commercial business remains in Atlanta - as indeed does the region's Federal Reserve Bank. One of most distinctive features of Georgia's main banks is their financial strength - at a time when much of the US banking industry has seen its balance sheet ratios hit hard by recession and a bust in the commercial property market. Two of the three - Suntrust and Wachovia - rank among the best 10 super-regional banks in the nation in terms of return on equity and non-performing asset ratios. The third, the aggressively expansive Nationsbank, is not too far behind in these areas; it now ranks as the fourth largest bank in the nation, with assets of Dollars 110bn. (That compares with Suntrust's Dollars 34bn and Wachovia's Dollars 33bn.) This strength stems in considerable part from Atlanta's banking traumas in the mid-1970s, when a property crash produced severe losses. Mr Raymond Riddle, president of Wachovia Bank of Georgia says: 'The banks learned a very difficult and painful lesson. Our real estate philosophy since then has been to select the very best developers, and limit ourselves to people we knew and understood.' Atlanta's banks were therefore very cautious lenders during the city's 1980s property boom, unlike some insurance companies and banks from New York and abroad, which are now nursing painful losses from Georgia's real estate slump of the past few years. This history goes some way to justify the Atlanta banks against the criticism that some of them have been persistently overcautious in their lending patterns, and remain so. Certainly, the strength of the banking system ought to help the city as it emerges from recession. Nevertheless, Mr Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, says: 'The banks are acting in their lending activities almost as if they went bust. They are very tough.' Mr Ratajczak also points out that Georgia's current tax system is a substantial disincentive to the growth of a investment portfolio management industry in Atlanta. If the system were to be changed, he says, it could give a significant kick to the relatively small local insurance industry. The banking industry began to assume its current shape after 1977, when a law was passed which allowed Georgian banks to expand outside their home county and buy up other Georgian banks. The result was a wave of consolidation within the state. In 1984 a much more significant takeover wave rolled forward when 11 southeastern states agreed among themselves to permit banking takeovers across state lines. This rapidly resulted in the emergence of some of America's first so-called super-regional banks. Trust Bank acquired businesses in Florida and Tennessee and became Suntrust. North Carolina-based First Wachovia and First National Bank of Atlanta agreed to merge, and later acquired South Carolina National. In 1989 the North Carolina-based NCNB made an unsuccessful hostile bid for the Atlanta-based Citizens &amp; Southern - the largest bank in Georgia - which merged instead with Virginia-based Sovran Financial. However, troubles with Sovran's property portfolio so weakened C&amp;S/Sovran that NCNB was able to launch a second, successful bid in 1991. It renamed the entire group NationsBank, a symbol of its wide ambitions. All this has left SunTrust the only one of the Big Three Georgian banks with headquarters in the state. The bank tries to exploit this, as an attraction for business. Banking competition in Georgia has been increased by the chartering of some 150 new small banks in the state since the early 1980s, and the arrival of more than two dozen foreign banks. The foreigners have been allowed to operate in Georgia since 1976, but are forbidden from taking deposits or offering retail services. Specialising in large loans to corporate customers, they offer companies an alternative to the regional banks and, for deals above local banks' lending limits, to the large New York money centre banks. (Less conventional were the lending practices which in 1989 led to a scandal which enveloped the Atlanta office of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. It was revealed to have funnelled billions of dollars in unauthorised credit to Iraq, which bought arms with them.) The foreign banks have keen rates and large sums of money to offer the Atlanta business community, but some of them have found it so hard to make a reasonable return in the southeast, given the competition and overheads, that they have left the market. Mr Gould, at Suntrust, says: 'Everyone has to price differently, compete harder, grow a little less rapidly than they'd like to because of the heightened competition.'</p>

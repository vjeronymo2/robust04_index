			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] By accepting the Dunkel proposals, India has  finished off its economic respectability. Now India does not  consider it an insult to have an East India company come in and  call the shots. Now East India companies are surrounding us on  all sides. We have taken the position that even if we do not  accept the proposals, foreign powers will attack us on the  economic front. In the eyes of the world, this would be  appropriate. Provisions were made in the Dunkel draft for this  contingency. We expressed our consent. Parliamentary  investigatory committee's Bhagwan Shankar Ravat has made this  claim. He is worried that the government is viewing their stance  as neutral, while in fact, the results will not bear this out.  The budget will suffer and our economic losses will be great.  Just when we were making strides in deficit reduction. Shri  Ravat is also worried about that Indian industry will not get a  boost under the Dunkel proposals. Of course, industry has thus  far been under the protection of the government. After the  implementation of the Dunkel proposals, Indian industry will be  under the thumb of foreign governments and the multinational  companies. India is sooner or later certain to find itself in  this situation. Protection of foodstuffs will end. Farmers all  over the country will be laboring for the multinationals. Small  and marginal farmers will be reduced to penary. Ayurvedic  medicine, along with the whole range of medicines, will no  longer be affordable to the comman man. Indian brains will think  for foreigners. Indian scientists and researchers will be in a  similar position. Shri Ravat thinks the proposals will have an  adverse affect on national unity as well. Center-State relations  will be pushed off a precipice. Tensions will skyrocket.    Shri Ravat regards acceptance of the Dunkel proposals as  unconstitutional. The Indian government does not have the right  to barter away economic sovereignty. Secondly, the Indian system  of punishment will be dealt a severe blow. Now, the accused  stands innocent until proven guilty. Guilt has to be proven. The  Dunkel proposals assume guilt, requiring innocence to be proven.    Shri Ravat says that developed nations are not really  signing  on to Dunkel out of free choice, but under the paternalism of  the U.S. U.S. imperialism is on the rise and requires the  economic surrender of every nation. Balkrishnan Jutshi, India's  representative at the treaty talks, has falsely said that the  proposals do not threaten the nation. He claims we are a  developed country and have the same interests as Western  countries.    Shri Ravat says the government has not taken into  consideration what effect the proposals will have on the  country. They have not researched the issues involved or  considered the details in the proposals. The government,  instead, has already made the decision to sign before sitting  down at the table. Shri Ravat says that the government is  deceiving people regarding the imminent shortage of seeds,  agricultural incentives, ration shopsa and medicines. Assurances  on the part of the government are a mere smokescreen. The truth  is that the policy is one of reverting to economic slavery. The  engine of international economics is run by multinational  companies. They have long ago signed on to the Dunkel proposals.  They get 15 percent equity forgiven.    Why did India find itself all alone on the international  stage? Shri Ravat feels that India lost its role as leader of  the third world which Nehru had established. Developing  countries, for their own reasons, followed separate patterns of  development. Each system has different problems. India's lack of  leadership over this time has pigeon-holed us. Foreign policy is  done on a wing and a prayer. Swadeshi products, self-reliance  and self-respect were abandoned by the present government. They  give liitle importance to gaining the respect and trust of other  countries. They know they don't deserve it.</p>

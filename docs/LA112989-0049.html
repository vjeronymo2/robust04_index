			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DAMEWORTH'S 3RD STATE TITLE A CINCH  </P> <P> He used a tremendous finishing sprint to win the inaugural state Division I  cross-country championship in 1987.  </P> <P> Last year, he fended off Thousand Oaks High's Mike Williamson and Jimmy  Rodriguez of Santa Ana Valley in a thrilling stretch duel for a second Division  I title.  </P> <P> On Saturday, though, things were different for Agoura's Bryan Dameworth.  </P> <P> There was no last-second surge toward the finish line. No rival runner  breathing down his neck. And there certainly was no doubt that the soloist was  on a Division I record pace en route to his third consecutive state title.  </P> <P> Dameworth toured the 5,000-meter (3.1-mile) course at Woodward Park in Fresno  in a personal-best 14 minutes, 45 seconds. He also lowered his previous  Division I mark of 15:03, which he set in last year's state championship. His  previous best on the Woodward Park course was a 14:58 clocking in the 1988  Kinney West regional.  </P> <P> Dameworth's closest competition Saturday was Arroyo Grande junior Louie  Quintana, who finished second in 14:59. Dameworth built a 100-meter lead over  Quintana in the final three-quarters of a mile after the two runners passed two  miles in 9:32.  </P> <P> "I really expected Quintana to be there (in the end)," said Dameworth, who said  that he felt sluggish during the race because of a cold.  </P> <P> Dameworth might have entered the race carrying the expectations that accompany  a two-time state champion, but an undefeated season and clutch performances in  the major races this fall have bolstered his confidence.  </P> <P> That confidence primarily stemmed from the 2-A Division championships Nov. 18  when Dameworth clocked 14:36 on the challenging Mt. San Antonio College course  to win the individual title. Only Burbank's Jeff Nelson, who ran 14:32 in 1978,  has run faster. "I guess I impressed myself," Dameworth said. "I didn't think  I'd run that fast."  </P> <P> Dameworth might have been surprised with his mark in the 2-A final, but Agoura  Coach Bill Duley, who is also Dameworth's stepfather, wasn't taken aback with  his protege's performance Saturday.  </P> <P> "I figured he'd be down in that range because he's been pretty consistent all  year long," he said.  </P> <P> Even though Dameworth has won three state titles in cross-country, he has yet  to claim one on the track. He finished seventh in the 3,200-meter final in the  state track and field championships as a freshman and was second last year in a  personal-best 9:00.27.  </P> <P> "I'd definitely like to win one in track," he said. "I'll take them both (the  1,600 and 3,200) pretty seriously. Maybe I'll run in both."  </P> <P> Dameworth prefers the Woodward Park course, but he still has some unfinished  business there. He placed second in the Kinney West regional last year and said  that he would like to move up a notch this season. Nothing would please him  more than an undefeated season.  </P> <P> "I'd love to win (the Kinney National title) and finish the season totally  undefeated," he said. "I'm not going to take it lightly because I'm not sure  what other people can do."  </P></p>

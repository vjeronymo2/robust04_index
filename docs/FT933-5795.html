			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Vacancies at CFTC threaten loss of regulatory power THE DELAY in Washington in naming appointments to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has led to speculation that the Clinton administration intends to use the agency for political purposes. The five-member commission is now reduced to just two commissioners. Mrs Wendy Gramm, the Bush administration stalwart who guided the agency through a difficult 1992, left the chairmanship in January along with another commissioner, Mr Fowler West. Last month, Mr William Albrecht, the agency's acting chairman, departed to return to the University of Iowa. The CFTC, which oversees futures and options trading in the US, and which was recently granted regulatory powers over the Dollars 4,000bn derivatives industry, can manage routine business with two commissioners, but is not expected to move forward on any significant decisions until new appointments are made. One of the more controversial issues before the CFTC is the application by the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for exemptions for professional traders from many of the agency's rules. The CFTC issued similar exemptions to over-the-counter derivatives traders earlier this year. Born out of the agricultural industry, the CFTC's regulatory duties now focus on increasingly complex banking issues. Derivatives trading dominates the global foreign exchange and interest rate markets, and also touches on equity business, leading to cross-regulatory commitments with the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. The CFTC risks losing its momentum in these regulatory co-operations the longer it goes without a chairman, agency personnel say. The vacant chairs will also weaken the agency's international presence. World derivatives regulators gather in Bergenstock, Switzerland, for their annual meeting early next month. The CFTC, which is generally the most important voice at the meeting, risks not having a chief executive present. Mr Hal Hanson, chairman of the Futures Industry Association, says the delay in making CFTC appointments demonstrates the agency's low priority on the administration's agenda. While Mr Clinton has appointed a high-profile executive to the SEC, 'the CFTC has not shown brightly on the administration's radar screen,' says Mr Hanson. Many high-level industry people once in the running for the top CFTC post now appear to have dropped out, lending credence to talk of political appointments, says Mr Hanson. The futures industry, usually well-connected in Washington, is in danger of being left out of the due election process. Mr Glenn English, chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, voiced the concern of many in the futures industry in a letter to the president dated July 27. He wrote: 'Your administration has the opportunity to name three new CFTC commissioners to fill existing vacancies. I am not writing on behalf of any particular candidate, but rather out of concern that the relatively small size and specialised nature of the Commission will lead your advisers, as in previous administrations, to recommend individuals that do not meet the high standards of experience and demonstrated knowledge that the CFTC must have to function as an efficient regulator. 'I urge you to make sure that your appointments to the CFTC are not only good people but also highly respected and recognised experts in their field,' he added. Members of Mr English's staff said that even if the president names a CFTC chairman soon, the background check and confirmation process could leave the agency without a chief executive at least until early October.</p>

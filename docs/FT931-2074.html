			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Test for franc THE FOCUS in foreign exchange markets this week will be on the French franc, and whether it moves nearer to its floor against the D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. Last week's decision by the Bundesbank's policy-making council to reduce its discount rate by 50 basis points triggered this latest bout of weakness for the French currency. The results of yesterday's first round in the French parliamentary election could also have a significant impact on the franc in the next few days. According to Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, the market was disappointed that the Lombard rate, which sets the effective ceiling for German rates, was not reduced by the Bundesbank on Thursday. However, he believes that foreign exchange dealers had not appreciated that a cut in the Lombard rate would have been technically difficult because of the high level of call money, which, on Friday, was at 8.58 per cent. The recent changes in minimum reserve requirements have temporarily kept the cost of call money high. Mr Chertkow believes that the pressure on the franc will be alleviated if the Bundebank cuts the rate at which it offers funds to commercial banks by 25 basis points to 8.00 per cent tomorrow. 'If they cut rates now, we will clearly have seen in the course of this year the establishment of an accommodative posture by the Bundesbank,' he said. Even if the Bundesbank does ease the repo rate again, there will still be concerns that a new right-wing french government might abandon the franc fort policy. The market may be anxious to see that an easing in German rates is followed by a fall in French ones.</p>

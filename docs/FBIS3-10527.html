			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Political Panorama" column by Tereza Cruvinel] </F>   [Text] Leaving the Finance Ministry and the administration  of the economic plan is no longer a problem for the candidacy of  Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Everyone seems to agree on this.  When Cardoso promises to reflect on the subject before deciding  (even if he has already done so), he and his allies are  demonstrating that they are now mainly concerned over political  and electoral subjects pertaining his candidacy.    The first variable is the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party]. Cautious PSDB leader Jose Serra has said that two  thirds of the party want Cardoso to be a candidate. On 8 March,  during a meeting with PSDB bloc members, Cardoso will hear  claims in favor of his candidacy. But it is one thing to run as  an autonomous candidate, and something else to discuss an  alliance with other parties. That is what holds back the  remaining third of the PSDB.    If on the one hand the policy of alliances disturbs the  PSDB,  on the other Cardoso and the PSDB leaders know that the power of  his candidacy is directly related to his ability to obtain  support. The non-orthodox wing of the Workers Party [PT] has  said that Lula [PT leader Luis Inacio da Silva] is desperate  because he is unable to make more alliances. Cardoso rules out  any alliance with the left. The field that lies before him  ranges from the center to the right, and that is where the  dilemmas begin.    According to one PSDB leader, a possible alliance with the  PFL [Liberal Front Party] should be evaluated with extreme care.  If on the one hand an alliance will bring PSDB electoral  advantages -- like a presence in northeastern Brazil and  heavyweight allies, beside the approval of the elites -- on the  other hand it will chase away Bahia politicians like Waldir  Pires, who would never stand on the platform beside [Bahia  Governor and PFL leader] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. But the  problem not only lies in Bahia. In Santa Catarina, PSDB  candidate for governor Jaison Barreto is endorsed by the PT, his  candidacy was launched by Lula, and he is running against PFL  President Jorge Bornhausen. But the greatest problem is in Sao  Paulo where [PSDB Senator] Mario Covas cannot be simply trampled  into the dirt.    PSDB leaders do not overlook the fact that Cardoso is not a  purebred PSDB member, and as such he could obtain broader  support than just from the PFL. It would not be very  troublesome for the PP [Popular Party] of Alvaro Dias to join  the PSDB (once the disagreements in Parana State between Dias  and PSDB Senator Jose Richa are overcome). To further stress  the center-right leaning, it would be essential to obtain the  support of the PMDB [Brazilian Social Democratic Party] wing  that will not support Orestes Quercia if he wins the party  convention. PMDB dissidents, especially those from Rio Grande  do Sul -- whose spokesman is [PMDB Senator] Pedro Simon --  dislike the idea of a possible coalition with the PFL. Their  alternative, for regional considerations, is to support the PDT  [Democratic Labor Party].    All this must be considered and discussed during the next  three weeks.</p>

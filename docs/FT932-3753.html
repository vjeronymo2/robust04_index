			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Big spenders bite the dust: The current fashion for frugality in Japan Price-cutting is the latest craze to sweep Tokyo, a city of fads and fashions. The Japanese capital, where oranges often cost more than Pounds 1 each and a plot of land for a small house will cost at least Y20m (Pounds 123,800), has long been one of the most expensive places in the world. But, temporarily at least, it is becoming a shopper's paradise. In a land that adores foreign brand names, from Louis Vuitton and Chanel, to BMW and Dr Marten shoes, consumers are turning away from the designer goods popular during the late 1980s, when the economy was booming. Instead, they are going back to basics, influenced by old-fashioned notions like value for money which suit their straitened circumstances. Take as an example the elegant avenue of Omote Sando, one of Tokyo's most fashionable shopping areas, home to the main retail outlets for leading Japanese clothes designers such as Issey Miyake and Comme des Garcons. In the past year these shops have become ever more like modern art galleries, frequented by a tiny group of dedicated collectors. The sales staff usually outnumber the customers by a factor of two. In a nearby shop owned by Yohji Yamamoto, another leading designer, a shop assistant said: 'We have just closed our shop in London because we weren't selling anything, but frankly we aren't selling anything here either.' The subdued atmosphere of Omote Sando is a far cry from the scene at the main outlet of what has become the hottest property in Japanese clothes retailing, Aoyama. Its shop off Tokyo's main shopping street, the increasingly tawdry Ginza, is usually crowded with hungry consumers. The reason: discounts of up to 90 per cent on suits made in China, which are selling for as little at Y2,500 (Pounds 15), the price of a pair of socks at Comme des Garcons. Aoyama, whose discounts have been lauded by government ministers and senior bureaucrats, is the boldest pace setter in a price-cutting war. Economists say discounting has become so widespread that the official measure of inflation - which is based on official list prices - is inaccurate. It shows inflation running at about 1.6 per cent a year. Once discounting is taken into account, prices could be falling by about 3 per cent a year, according to Mr Jesper Koll, economist at S G Warburg, the securities house. Prices are not being cut across the board. A round-trip ticket for the three-hour bullet train journey between Tokyo and Kyoto costs about Y28,000, the price of a cheap return flight to Seoul, the South Korean capital. But washing machines, for example, are selling on average for 30 per cent less than their average list price of Y210,000. Toyota Corollas are being offered at a discount of at least 15 per cent. And a Toyota dealer admitted: 'We can start negotiating after that.' The recent strength of the yen, which has risen from about Y125 to the dollar at the turn of the year to about Y106, has exacerbated the price pressure on some industries by making imports cheaper. Compaq and Dell, the US personal computer makers, took advantage of the yen's strength and their cheap manufacturing bases in south-east Asia to launch an assault on the Japanese personal computer market. Their machines are half the price of comparable Japanese-made models. However, price-cutting has failed to reignite consumer spending. Consumer expenditure rose by 0.9 per cent last year, down from 5.1 per cent in 1988. The central bank's quarterly report on the economy, published yesterday, said consumer spending was still sluggish. This is owing to a complex mix of factors. The prolonged downturn in Japanese stock and land prices has eaten into household wealth. In response, households have increased their savings - from 13.5 per cent of household income in 1990 to about 15.25 per cent this year - to rebuild their balance sheets. These savings have come from incomes which are growing more slowly, by 3.2 per cent last year compared with 8.3 per cent in 1990. Consumer caution has been reinforced by job cuts at Japanese companies. In the next year consumer spending may start to recover. A rise in share prices, and signs that the fall in land prices is bottoming out, are making people feel wealthier, and so more willing to stop saving. Yet even if there is a revival in spending, it will be modest and differ markedly from the late 1980s boom. This is for two main reasons. First, some industries, particularly consumer electronics, may be facing a more prolonged fall in demand. The Japanese market for video records, camcorders and audio equipment is saturated. The main manufacturers, Sony and Matsushita, have failed to come up with new products to revive demand. In Tokyo's Akihabara district, home to most of its electronics shops, compact disc players are selling at discounts of up to 34 per cent. The second factor is cultural. A shift in values is under way in the wake of the speculation and conspicuous consumption of the late 1980s. Consumer goods manufacturers say people want simpler, more functional products, with the stress on utility rather than design. Department stores such as Tobu are shifting staff from their deserted jewellery and fine art counters into departments which sell their own-brand goods, with the stress on value for money. A recent sales campaign by Isetan, one of the most fashionable department stores among young people, summed up the mood with the slogan: Back to Basics. Indeed, one of the most successful products of the past few months is a book that captures the mood of the times, the best-selling novel The Noble Philosophy of Poverty.</p>

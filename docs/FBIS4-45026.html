			<p>CSO     [Text] A research group at [?Tsukuba University] in Tokyo  announced that more than 60 percent of the Iranians who went to  Japan looking for work are facing some kind of discrimination in  that country, and they complain that there is a kind of  prejudgement of them in the minds of the people of Japan.    Professor Hiroshi [?Kumai], chief of this research group,  said: Studies have begun on the situation with Iranian workers  in Japan, and it is hoped that the results will help solve the  problems faced by foreigners living in Japan, especially  Iranians.    Last summer the research group circulated a questionnaire in  Persian among 245 Iranian workers living in Tokyo and the  surrounding cities to permit them to write about their lives and  their problems.    According to Professor Hiroshi Kumai, 70 percent of the  people questioned were between 20 and 30 years of age and each  has been living in Japan for an average of 25 years [as  published]. Most are working as simple laborers in construction  or factories, and 20 percent were unemployed.    In this questionnaire the Iranian workers were asked what  their motivation was for coming to Japan. One in two answered  that he wanted to increase his work abilities. A number also  wrote that they had traveled to this country to earn money, find  work, and to save some money.    Sixty percent of the Iranians questioned said they had faced  some kind of discrimination during their stay in Japan. Some of  the Iranian workers also believed that technological advances in  Japanese society have caused the disappearance of humane issues  and that Japanese employers exploit Iranians as cheap laborers.    Professor Kumai concludes from the research that: The  conditions of Iranian workers in Japan are the worst in  comparison with the workers from other countries.    He advises Japanese officials that discrimination against  Iranians must be stopped and that attention must be given to  their demands. Based on statistics the Islamic Republic of Iran  has published, there are now close to 20,000 Iranians living in  Japan without valid visas, and most of them have been hired  illegally in various centers.    Since Farvardin 1371 [21 March-20 April 1992], following a  wave of young unemployed Iranians going to Japan, regulations  voiding visas between the countries have been cancelled.  Currently Iranian youths seeking employment make their way to  Japan through unconventional and difficult routes. For example,  they will go to Vladivostok in Siberia and from there they get  to Japan by bribing local officials and boat operators.</p>

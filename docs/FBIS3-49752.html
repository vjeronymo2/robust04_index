			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratunac, Jan 13 (TANJUG) -- The Moslems Thursday  [13 January] fired on Serb positions from the Jusuf Dzonlic  barracks in Sarajevo which also house some of the UN  peacekeepers, in an obviously attempt to have the Serbs blamed  for an attack on UNPROFOR if they answer back, Serb military  sources report.    All Serb suburbs and Serb positions in the Sarajevo area  were  shelled by Moslems, the same sources state. Moslem forces in  the region of the Moslem enclave Gorazde (eastern Bosnia)  continue provocations with anti-aircraft and infantry weapons in  the direction of the Serb positions, mainly in the direction of  Foca.    Moslem artillery also shelled Serb positions and civilian  targets in the region of Doboj (north Bosnia) in the region of  Srbobran and Gradacac (central Bosnia) on the Bihac-Krupa line  (northern Bosnia), and around Kladanj and Olovo (central  Bosnia). In the four-day clashes near Olovo the Serb forces  Thursday afternoon succeeded in repulsing the Moslem forces who  were heading towards the town itself.</p>

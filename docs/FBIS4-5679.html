			<p>BFN     [Text] Kyoto, April 10 KYODO -- Incumbent Teiichi Aramaki  easily won Sunday's [10 April] Kyoto gubernatorial election for  a third consecutive four-year term, backed by the main  opposition party and seven ruling coalition parties, prefectural  election commission officials said.    Aramaki, 62, who ran as an independent, defeated independent  contender Mampei Kimura, 70, by a wide margin.    Aramaki was supported by the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party and all seven ruling parties -- the Social Democratic  Party, foreign minister Tsutomu Hata's Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party), Komeito, prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New  Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura's new party Sakigake and the United Social  Democratic Party.    Kimura was supported by the Japanese Communist Party,  another  opposition party.    Aramaki won 421,583 votes, while Kimura garnered 225,688  with  78 percent of ballots counted as of 8:30 P.M.    Voter turnout stood at a record low of 43.02 percent, down  0.72 percentage point from 43.74 percent four years ago.    The governorship race, which came on the heels of Hosokawa's  resignation announcement Friday, did not receive much attention  from voters because it was virtually a replay of the previous  election, fought between the same two people.</p>

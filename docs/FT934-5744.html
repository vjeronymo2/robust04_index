			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Budget plan for sale of 70,000 defence homes Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, plans to sell off nearly 70,000 houses occupied by armed forces personnel to offset the deep cuts imposed by the Treasury in the Pounds 23bn defence budget. The scheme, due to be announced as part of the Budget tomorrow, is expected to raise about Pounds 500m in the financial year beginning April 1995 and will go into current spending on the defence budget. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is expected by City economists to increase taxes by up to Pounds 2bn from next April, on top of the Pounds 6.7bn already announced. He may also announce cuts of Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn in the Treasury's previously published Pounds 254bn control total for public spending in 1994-95. The chancellor's main preoccupation will be to reduce the Pounds 50bn fiscal deficit without jeopardising signs of economic recovery. The services housing sales are seen by ministers as a crucial element in attempts to fight off a threatened rebellion by backbench Tory MPs over the scale of forthcoming defence cuts. The scheme also marks the start of a wave of new asset sales planned by Whitehall departments to square the circle of the sharpest squeeze for a decade on public spending with commitments to preserve crucial budgets. But the Treasury's approval for Mr Rifkind's plan to plough back the receipts into current spending on the defence budget has sparked resentment among other senior ministers. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has protested that local authorities which transfer their housing stock to private sector housing associations are not given similar freedom to spend the receipts. Mr Rifkind's scheme centres on nearly 70,000 'married quarters' properties in Britain occupied by defence personnel. More than half - around 35,000 - are owned by the army, with the air force accounting for about 25,000 and the navy about 10,000. Under the proposals, the properties will be transferred via a non-profit trust to housing associations, building societies and other interested groups. Purchasers will be granted a long lease, probably 99 years, on the properties, which will be occupied by service families at rents determined by the Armed Services Pay Review Body. Potential buyers will be able to finance the relatively cheap leases through guaranteed rents from reliable tenants. Separately the defence ministry is selling off housing left vacant by the run-down in the size of the armed forces. Over 4,000 properties have been sold outright under that scheme.

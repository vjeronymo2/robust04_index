			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Charles Pellegrini, former head of the </F> Central Criminal Repression Agency, by Christophe Gautier; place  and date not given: "Charles Pellegrini: `The Islamic  Salvation Front Has No Formal Structure and Operates Through  Zones of Influence'" -- first paragraph is LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS  introduction]    [Text] Charles Pellegrini, former head of the OCRB [Central  Criminal Repression Agency] and a major expert on issues  relating to the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], believes that the  fundamentalist threat is "the worst enemy France has ever had to  fight."    Gautier: Is France the FIS' backline base?    Pellegrini: It obviously is. All Western  countries close to Algeria, especially Spain, France, and Italy,  may be considered as FIS backline bases.    Gautier: How has the FIS established itself in  France?    Pellegrini: The FIS relies on various  organizations, usually mosques and associations. Today, the FIS  enjoys strong support networks made up of first-generation  immigrants, but also second- or third-generation ones. The FIS  has three funding sources. First of all, black market that is  going on on both sides of the Mediterranean. Second, we have  drug dealing. Whole families peddle drugs in suburban housing  developments. Part of the considerable amounts of money  involved flows to the FIS. Last, fundamentalists fund their  activities through a "revolutionary tax," a well organized  racket scheme.    Gautier: Has the FIS a formal structure in France?    Pellegrini: No, it has no such structure, it has  no such thing as a clandestine leader who would control all its  actions. The way the FIS tends to operate is through zones of  influence. We are faced with small and independent groups which  support small groups in Algeria.    Gautier: What can happen with the FIS established  in France?    Pellegrini: I am very pessimistic about it.  Affairs such as that of the arms smuggler arrested on Friday,  or that of Lille, where 1,000 forged administrative documents  were found, indicate that there may actually be logistical bases  on the national territory. This is not a good sign. I think  two kinds of violent acts may start spreading: to begin with,  attacks against French interests, and then, of course, a real  guerilla war between FIS supporters and opponents.    Gautier: Is there a danger for France?    Pellegrini: The Interior Ministry has correctly  evaluated the problem. However, I remain convinced that we need  to step up measures against the FIS in France. The FIS is very  dangerous for us because these people are fanatics, they are  very close to us geographically, and they are quite numerous.</p>

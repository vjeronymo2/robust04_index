			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CRIME MOUNTS AND ONE MAN SAYS, 'NO MORE';  </P> <P> ARGENTINA: VICTIM OF AUTO BURGLARY GIVES CHASE, KILLS TWO THIEVES. HE IS FREED  AS 'NON-INDICTABLE' BECAUSE HE ACTED WHILE IN A STATE OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.  </P> <P> Crime has tripled, muggers walk free, anger grows in tandem with fear, and  Horacio Santos, who chased down and killed two thieves because he couldn't take  any more, has become the symbol of it all.  </P> <P> The Santos case jarred many of the 10 million people in Buenos Aires, who felt  safe in their city until the last few years.  </P> <P> Historians, sociologists, judges, police, government officials, newspaper  vendors and nearly everyone else express opinions about the case at cocktail  parties, in letters to editors, on street corners and radio talk shows.  </P> <P> One Saturday morning in June, Santos, a 42-year-old engineer, heard glass  breaking outside his home and recognized the sound of his car alarm. He rushed  to a window and saw two men, laughing, walk off to their own car with his tape  deck.  </P> <P> Santos' home had been burglarized twice and thieves had broken into his car 14  times. Overwhelmed by anger, he gave chase.  </P> <P> When Santos caught up to the thieves on the road, he shot one in the head and  the other in the throat. Two bullets, two men dead.  </P> <P> He was arrested on homicide charges and confined in a hospital for psychiatric  tests. His wife, Norma, said: "I can't believe what happened. Horacio can't  either. This is a nightmare."  </P> <P> Soon thereafter, Judge Luis Cevasco ruled that Santos was "non-indictable"  because he acted while in a state of emotional distress.  </P> <P> The men Santos killed were not career criminals. One was a 31-year-old bus  driver and the other, 29, worked in a butcher shop. Both had wives and  children.  </P> <P> As Argentina's economic recession has shrunk real wages and increased  unemployment, more people have turned to crime.  </P> <P> Did Horacio Santos do the right thing?  </P> <P> "I would have done the same, may God forgive me," said Bernardo Neustadt,  Argentina's most popular news commentator.  </P> <P> Mariano Grondona, host of the television program "Key Hour," said: "About 99%  of the calls to my program were in favor of Santos' reaction."  </P> <P> Jorge Luis Passero, chief of the federal police, said Santos "can't be taken as  an example" for others because "that would be going back to the law of the  jungle."  </P> <P> Robbery and assault have become commonplace in Buenos Aires. Crimes such as  rape and murder are relatively rare, but some highly publicized cases of  violence make people feel vulnerable.  </P> <P> In mid-June, two days before the Santos shooting, a businessman who had  identified a mugger in a police lineup was shot and killed after the alleged  assailant was released.  </P> <P> Two months ago, men brandishing a machine gun tried to force investment broker  Esteban Reynal off the main highway north of the city as he drove to his  weekend home. He accelerated and outran them.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, a judge's home was bombed and gunmen shot up the car of  another. The second magistrate, Luis Cevasco, blamed "parapolice groups" that  were trying to influence cases.  </P> <P> "The worst thing is that it's not just criminals, but also the forces of  security" who commit crimes, said Reynal, who recognized one of his assailants  in the police station where he reported the shooting. The provincial policeman  was arrested.  </P> <P> In July, three policemen who offered to free a jailed person in exchange for a  computer were sentenced to jail. A judge has been accused of trying to extort  $500,000 from a medical clinic in return for dropping charges the clinic claims  the judge fabricated.  </P> <P> Corruption is a serious problem among police officers, who are paid the  equivalent of only $100 a month and usually have second jobs.  </P> <P> According to official statistics, the number of crimes in Buenos Aires province  was 122,000 last year, compared to 47,000 in 1985. Argentines are increasingly  careful about what they wear, where they go and how they get there.  </P> <P> Months ago, Santos and his neighbors organized teams to watch homes and cars.  Private security guards patrol wealthy communities.  </P> <P> Residents in the zone of weekend homes and country clubs along Rio de la Plata  are buying guard dogs, electric gates and handguns, and chipping in to provide  the police with better cars and equipment.  </P> <P> Buenos Aires province has announced plans to transfer more officers to street  duty and hire 2,000 new ones.  </P> <P> Police acknowledge that crime is increasing but claim it isn't out of control.  Most of the offenses are muggings and thefts from cars and homes. Street gangs  and drug peddling, like major violent crimes, are uncommon.  </P> <P> Chief Passero said that the conviction rate is low because of reforms in the  penal code made in 1984, when civilian democracy returned after nearly eight  years of military dictatorship.  </P> <P> Each 100 arrests result in only 2.6 convictions and half of those get off  without jail terms, he said.  </P></p>

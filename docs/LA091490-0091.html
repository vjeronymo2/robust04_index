			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> 2 ELEMENTS PIVOTAL IN CUTTING RAIDER DEAL  </P> <P> In the tortuous process by which Raiders owner Al Davis eventually signed a  contract to keep his football team in Los Angeles, two elements stand out.  </P> <P> First, the city had certain natural advantages in the bidding war with Oakland,  Sacramento and Irwindale. The expected sales value alone of planned luxury  boxes in the Los Angeles Coliseum could reach $12 million a year, and millions  more could be realized in a renovated stadium by selling elite club seating.  The prices that could be charged would be considerably higher than in smaller  cities with fewer corporate headquarters or wealthy individuals.  </P> <P> Even without accounting for the eventual pay television potential, the  long-term opportunities for profit in Los Angeles are greater by far. The city,  a world entertainment center, is also a much more prestigious place for any  team to play.  </P> <P> Was there ever a real chance, for instance, that Davis would give up all that  to take a flyer on Sacramento? No less a Sacramento civic booster than Gregg  Lukenbill, chief arranger of the Sacramento bid, in the end came to feel that  the answer was no.  </P> <P> But the second element that stands out is that with all these advantages, Los  Angeles had to overcome considerable handicaps as well.  </P> <P> The 67-year-old Coliseum was the only playing site the city could offer, and in  its existing form it had neither luxury boxes nor club seats, making it  positively antiquated by modern National Football League standards. Moreover,  it was administered by a faction-ridden commission representing three levels of  government.  </P> <P> Three years ago, when the bidding war for the Raiders began, the Coliseum  Commission was led by developer Alexander Haagen, who was not even on speaking  terms with Davis.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the commission had few financial assets of its own, and its  ability to secure assistance from the city, the county and the state  simultaneously, as would have been required, was next to nil. Even had the  commission been unified, which it wasn't, it would have been at a disadvantage.  As it was, most of its members did not even like football.  </P> <P> In retrospect, things did not begin to come together for Los Angeles until  local politicians, including Mayor Tom Bradley, City Council President John  Ferraro and City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, had the idea to privatize the  facility.  </P> <P> This, they reasoned, would put the responsibility for coming up with renovation  plans and the money to finance them, as well as the large cash payments Davis  was demanding, on a private business team that had the wherewithal to bring  together what the commission could not.  </P> <P> Oakland, Sacramento and Irwindale all came to rely substantially on public  money in making their bids. Los Angeles, using private business as it did  during the 1984 Olympic effort, would avoid that necessity, and much of the  political controversy that went with it. Even the faces of the negotiators  would change.  </P> <P> In actuality, it proved more difficult than expected to secure a capable  private bidder. Months passed before the Coliseum Commission was willing to  grant the businessmen independent authority to make a bid. After this was done,  one of the original partners, MCA Inc., quit the partnership. The other,  Spectacor Management Group, had to overcome internal divisions before it was  able to make a serious offer.  </P> <P> As these problems arose, Bradley become more involved. Dissatisfied with the  efforts of his appointees on the Coliseum Commission, the mayor brought back a  former commissioner, labor leader William R. Robertson, and made him and Deputy  Mayor Mark Fabiani his point men.  </P> <P> Their job, assisted at key moments by the mayor himself, was to push the  parties together as best they could, cajole the Spectacor executives into  making ever more substantial offers, and encourage Davis to reach a decision.  </P> <P> By then, as the summer wound toward a close, the timing was right. Irwindale  and Sacramento had long since fallen by the wayside. The second Oakland bid was  much less substantial than the first, and Oakland authorities were having  trouble settling on the terms of that smaller offer. The private Los Angeles  bid ended up higher than Oakland's.  </P> <P> And Davis, facing a new season with the Los Angeles fans turned off by the long  uncertainty, wanted to decide.  </P> <P> The agreement that has been reached faces obstacles. There are complicated  environmental and preservation requirements to be met before work on the  revamped Coliseum can begin. Financing must be obtained. Further interventions  by the mayor and his point men may be necessary to be sure Spectacor can  perform, and it is possible additional partners may yet have to be brought in.  </P> <P> But for the time being, Los Angeles has secured the Raiders.  </P></p>

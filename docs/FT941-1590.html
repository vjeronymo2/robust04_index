			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Michael Page bolstered by second half recovery Michael Page Group, recruitment and executive selection consultancy, staged a sharp recovery in the second half of 1993 pushing pre-tax profits up from a restated Pounds 1.86m to Pounds 3.84m. The shares gained 1p to 77p yesterday. Mr Terry Benson, who has been appointed chief executive, said the profits reflect the recovery in the UK and Australia. In the UK the employment market was at its most active for three years. Permanent recruitment, adversely affected by the recession, showed a good increase in revenue, said Mr Benson. However, recession created difficult market conditions for all operations in continental Europe. France and the Netherlands maintained profits but there was a small loss in Germany. The dividend is raised from 1.8p to 2.1p, with a final of 1.5p. Turnover rose from Pounds 43.64m to Pounds 51.2m and earnings per share were 4.01p (2.04p).</p>

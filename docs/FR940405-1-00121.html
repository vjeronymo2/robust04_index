			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Transfer air must enter the designated smoking room to make-up the volumetric flowrate differential between supply and exhaust air. It may be necessary to provide a tight architectural enclosure so as to achieve negative pressure and containment. Leakage through a lay-in ceiling tile system may occur if there is a return air plenum above it. Negative pressure will induce airflow into the room through the entrance door undercut. Containment may be checked by using smoke-trails at the door undercut to verify direction of airflow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contaminated exhaust air from a designated smoking room must be transported to the outside through exhaust ducts under negative pressure to avoid duct leakage into nonsmoking areas that the duct passes through.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions regarding posting of signs are intended to prevent inadvertent entry into smoking areas, and inadvertent smoking in areas other than designated smoking areas. To prevent involuntary exposure, designated smoking areas cannot be areas where employees perform normal work activities. For the same reason, smoking is not permitted in smoking areas during performance of work activities such as cleaning and maintenance of the designated smoking area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision will have special impact on establishments such as bars and restaurants. OSHA invites comments on feasibility considerations relative to such establishments and suggestions for alternative ways to assure that nonsmoking workers will not be exposed to tobacco smoke there.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (e)(2) establishes requirements dealing with outdoor air pollutants and contaminants emitted locally within workspaces. This paragraph proposes to require the employer to implement measures to restrict the entry of outdoor air pollutants into the building and to control local indoor sources of air contaminant emissions by employing other control measures like substitution or local source capture exhaust ventilation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (e)(3) proposes to require the control of microbial contamination by routinely inspecting for and repairing water leaks that can promote growth of biologic agents, by promptly drying, replacing, removing, or cleaning damp or wet materials; and by taking measures to remove visible microbial contamination in ductwork, humidifiers, other HVAC system components, or on other building surfaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (e)(4) addresses the use of cleaning and maintenance chemicals, pesticides and other hazardous chemicals. Pesticides must be used according to manufacturers' recommendations, and where chemicals are to be used, employees in those areas affected are to be informed, at least within 24 hours prior to use, of the type of chemical to be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions proposed under (e)(2) are intended to ensure that indoor air quality is not degraded as a result of entry of outdoor contaminants, such as vehicle exhaust, or by circulation of contaminants generated within the building. The Agency believes that, where necessary, entry of outdoor air pollutants can be restricted by eliminating or repositioning entry points into the building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indoor local contaminant emissions can be minimized where necessary, through application of control measures such as source substitution and engineering controls that may include local source capture exhaust ventilation. Collection of contaminants at their source of emission through engineering controls is an accepted basic principle of industrial hygiene. Equipment and processes which are located or take place in areas that may lead to contamination of other areas should be provided with engineering controls, where necessary and feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions proposed in paragraph (e)(3) are intended to limit the opportunity for microbiological contamination of building systems and structures. Although individual microbes are not visible to the naked eye, colonies of microbes are. Moisture can lead to microbiological growth in indoor spaces, within HVAC systems, or within building structures, and thus to a variety of detrimental health effects. The employer therefore, is required to take preventive and corrective actions to minimize microbiological growth. Preventive action includes routine inspection for biological growth, with required corrective actions such as repairing water leaks, drying, replacing, or cleaning wet materials, and removal of visible microbiological growth (Exs. 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;502).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions proposed in paragraph (e)(4) are intended to restrict indoor exposure to hazardous substances such as pesticides and chemicals used for cleaning and maintenance purposes. The Agency believes that proper use of such substances is important to limit incidental exposures to those performing cleaning and maintenance as well as to other employees who might be incidentally exposed. Manufacturers recommendations for use of these products often address aspects of ventilation, employee protection, occupancy limitations, and other protective measures. Thus, the Agency has proposed to require that chemicals covered under this paragraph must be used in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. To further limit the potential for incidental exposures to these chemicals the standard proposes to require that employees in areas to be treated by such chemicals are to be notified within at least 24 hours prior to their application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Air Quality During Renovation and Remodeling: Paragraph (f)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f)(1) proposes to require implementation of specific procedures to minimize degradation of air quality during renovation and remodeling activities (Exs. 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;444B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f)(2) proposes to require development and implementation of a work plan to restrict entry of air contaminants into other work areas during remodeling, renovation, and similar activities (Ex. 3&hyph;444b). Where appropriate, elements of the workplan to be considered are requirements of this standard, implementation of means to assure that HVAC systems continue to function effectively during remodeling and renovation activities, isolation or containment of work areas and appropriate negative pressure containment, air contaminant suppression controls or auxiliary air filtration, and controls to prevent air contaminant entry into HVAC systems. Finally, paragraph (e)(3), proposes to require 24 hour advance notification of employees, or promptly in emergency situations, of work to be performed on the building that may introduce air contaminants into their work area. Such notification must include anticipated adverse impacts on indoor air quality or workplace conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions under proposed paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) are intended to ensure that renovation, remodeling and similar activities are performed in a manner that will reduce the potential for air contaminants generated during those activities from entering other areas of the building. Such activities which may involve demolition, sanding, surface refinishing, component removal and replacement, etc. can result in hazardous substance emission from solvents, paints, carpets, etc. and can also produce high levels of particulate contamination. To control such emissions, the standard proposes to require employers to develop a workplan for the implementation of appropriate work procedures and controls such as exhaust ventilation, isolation, containment, or use of wet methods during renovation and remodeling activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, paragraph (f)(3) proposes to require notification of employees in the vicinity of renovation and remodeling activities who may be subject to incidental exposure to emissions produced during such activities (Ex. 3&hyph;444B). This notification must also apprise affected employees of the potential adverse impact on air quality. Informing employees of potential workplace hazards is felt by the Agency to be imperative for the success of any safety and health program. OSHA believes that employees can do much to protect themselves if they are informed of the nature of the hazards to which they are exposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Employee Information and Training:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

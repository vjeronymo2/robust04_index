			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Finance Ministry source has disclosed that there  are four major issues likely to cause the failure of the  Thai-U.S. negotiations on avoiding double taxation, scheduled to  begin today.    He said the first obstacle is whether or not the definition  of royalties should cover intellectual property rights and other  rights, as well as fixing appropriate tax rates.    Second is whether or not the definition of air and sea  transportation services covers other activities, such as sea and  air charters, as well as determining their tax exemption.    Third is what types of activities should be included in  the definition of a "permanent establishment."    Fourth is the problem of fixing an appropriate tax rate  for interest earnings. There is a wide gap between the two  countries' tax rates. Thailand collects 15 percent of the  interest earnings of banks, while the United States charges 30  percent.    Revenue Department Director General M.R. Chatumongkhon  Sonakun has disclosed that 19 issues will be brought up for  discussion during the negotiations. He anticipates encountering  more difficulties in these negotiations than with the other  countries that want to amend their treaties with Thailand on  avoiding double taxation. This is because there are many  interest groups involved, and they are openly lobbying their  government. The director general said: "The major obstacle to  the Thai-U.S. negotiations, which have been dragging on for many  years, is that many lobbyists have been pressuring the  politicians. If this round of negotiations is unsuccessful, it  will be postponed until next year. Still, I am not sure that  the two sides will be able to reach any agreement."    The director general noted that Thailand is at a  disadvantage  in this round of negotiations because it is a smaller country  and its exports to the United States account for 25 percent of  its total exports. In addition, the United States imposes a  mere 1 percent tax on Thai imports, which is minimal when  compared with other countries. For this reason, the United  States may show leniency toward some of the Thai side's requests.    The director general stressed that the government attaches  great significance to this round of negotiations. Everyone  hopes that it will succeed and be equitable and fair to both  sides. He said: "That is why the talks will take three full  days -- from today until 10 February. This is longer than  similar talks we have held with other countries."</p>

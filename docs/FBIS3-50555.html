After that meeting, Rojas read before local and  foreign media representatives a three-page communique admitting  that there is a significant social and ancestral  underdevelopment in Chiapas State.    He assured that this state occupied first place in the  government's social investment over the past five years. Rojas  said that the secretariat under his responsibility--that is, the  Social Development Secretariat--by order of President Salinas  will continue its dialogue with various social organizations of  the jungle area, the Chiapas border area, Catholic Church  bishops, and members of other churches to continue projects that  have been carried out in the past few years. These projects  were defined by the authorities mainly with the participation of  regional social groups. Let's listen to a portion of the  communique that Secretary Rojas read this afternoon at Los Pinos:    [Begin Rojas recording] Due to the violent incidents that  occurred on 1 January, the government of the Republic reaffirms  its willingness to establish new means to settle the problems of  the jungle area and border areas of that state; in this regard,  President Carlos Salinas has instructed us to make additional  efforts to reach this goal.    A group of officials will visit Chiapas State to establish a  discussion table, along with Governor (Elmar Checher), to  address the regional social problems, to review, along with the  various social organizations, the progress made by the agreed  upon works, to review technical files, to (?discuss) production  works and projects that will be carried out, and to define new  actions for this year, as was agreed upon previously with  regional groups.    I would like to point out that for the Federal Government  Chiapas State is top priority. We know of the ancestral social  underdevelopment affecting it, and this is why it occupies first  place in social investment of the national Solidarity Program.  During the past five years of the current administration,  Chiapas received 8 percent of the total national investment.  Social investment grew by more than 1,000 percent during this  period. [end recording]    Secretary Rojas mentioned some figures reflecting the  magnitude of the efforts made in the past years. Eighty  first-rate centers and rural medical units and hospitals in  Huitzla and Mapastepec were built. More than 4,000 schools were  incorporated into the (Digna) school program, and 1,900 school  rooms and 108 laboratories were built. About 3,000 km of roads  and highways were built. More than 1,200 communities and  low-income settlements have electricity today. Five hundred  water and drainage systems were built and rehabilitated in 65  municipalities. More than 90,000 peasants received credits  without collateral [credito a la palabra] to cultivate 150,000  hectares. The 110 town councils of the state have municipality  funds from the Solidarity Program to meet the people's most  urgent needs. Nineteen regional Indian funds were established  to support the production projects of the ethnic groups.    Carlos Rojas added that to face the drop in the  international  price of coffee--a problem that has worsened economic problems  in the Chiapas highlands--the government has supported 60,000  growers who face this difficult situation. The secretary said  that in Chiapas there has been a willingness to hold talks and  conciliatory efforts; he added that this has led to the solution  of agrarian problems such as those in Venustiano Carranza,  Simojovel, and (Huiztiupan).    Rojas said that there was progress in the efforts to reach a  consensus with the groups residing near the jungle and its  original inhabitants. This unprecedented effort, according to  Carlos Rojas, has reduced the number of landless peasants in  Chiapas State. Let's continue to listen to Secretary Rojas:    [Begin Rojas recording] Despite the great efforts made by  the state and federal governments and by the state social  groups, there are areas where demographic growth and the  deterioration of natural resources have worsened social  problems. [end recording]    Secretary Rojas read the document and left the Venustiano  Carranza Room with no other comment.</p>

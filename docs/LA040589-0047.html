			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York will soon house a new photography  collection, thanks to a $1.8-million gift from the Ford Motor Co. The amount is  said to be the largest corporate gift ever received by the museum for the  acquisition of art. The Ford Motor Company Photography Collection consists of  500 photographs from the period between the two World Wars. Represented is the  work of 180 American and European photographers including Man Ray, Laszlo  Moholy-Nagy, Edward Steichen and Charles Sheeler. The company also will sponsor  a five-city exhibition of selected photographs from the collection. The  exhibition, which will be part of an international commemoration of the 150th  anniversary of the invention of photography, is scheduled to reach Los Angeles  in May, 1990.

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Major masks fury with US: Sinn Fein leader's visit to New York sours relationship with Clinton Mr John Major yesterday launched a concerted attempt to paper over deep cracks in the Anglo-American relationship in the wake of Mr Gerry Adams' visit to New York. As Mr Major - who is to visit Washington this month - moved, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to British interests caused by the almost unchallenged access to the US media which the Sinn Fein president enjoyed for 48 hours. But the government was unable to conceal its dismay at President Bill Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams. Publicly, Downing Street put on a brave face. A senior official said the Anglo-US relationship was 'alive and well and extremely vigorous'. In private ministers and senior officials were bitterly disappointed at President Clinton's decision to overrule his most senior advisers. One senior minister said the president appeared to have put UK/US relations and the future of the Northern Ireland peace initiative at risk to placate the US's vocal Irish-American lobby. The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic coverage given to Mr Adams by the US media, and by the lack of balancing comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. A Downing Street official said: 'Douglas Hurd worked his arse off to get himself on American television screens. He has been pushed off the networks by programmers who have decided that Gerry Adams is more interesting.' The mood in Downing Street is unlikely to be improved by a broad hint from Mr Raymond Seitz, the US ambassador to London, that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr Adams into the US. Officials disclosed that Mr Seitz was called to Downing Street for talks on Tuesday as part of a diplomatic drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein. 'There was a big tussle in my government about this,' Mr Seitz added. He hoped Mr Adams' experience in the US would 'act as an encouragement for him to renounce violence and condemn it when it occurs. We will have to wait and see'. The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by Sir Robin Renwick, British ambassador to Washington. Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity bore fruit in Mr Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the Anglo/Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned the idea of a US 'peace envoy' to Belfast.</p>

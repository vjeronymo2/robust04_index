			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: Toys 'R' Us has a better Christmas than expected Toys 'R' Us, the US children's retailing chain, yesterday announced that sales in the crucial Christmas shopping period were slightly better than expected. The company also said that its founder and chairman, Mr Charles Lazarus, was relinquishing some of his responsibilities in what he described as 'an integral part of our succession planning process'. In his place, Mr Michael Goldstein, vice-chairman, will take over as chief executive, responsible for overall corporate strategy, while Mr Robert Nakasone will assume the duties of chief operating officer, in charge of the company's day-to-day activities. Sales for US stores opened at least a year were up 7.4 per cent in the eight weeks ended December 25, while title revenues showed a 14.9 per cent improvement to Dollars 3.4bn. Year-to-date sales climbed 10.8 per cent to Dollars 7.46bn. International sales were not as buoyant, particularly in Germany, Japan and Spain, where economic conditions were sluggish. Toys 'R' Us attributed the overall improvement to its 'everyday low pricing' policy as well as several merchandising initiatives. A 70-page catalogue mailed to 52m homes this autumn was especially effective in boosting sales. The announcement ended the company's traditional year-end blackout on news related to its performance in the Christmas season, when most toy retailers are anxious to feed the market sales data. As a result, its stock is often volatile in the first half of January. In the event, Toys 'R' US not only beat the forecasts of most analysts, but turned in an admirable showing 'if viewed in the context of what anyone would describe as challenging Christmas environment this year,' said Ms Maureen McGrath, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson in New York. Nevertheless, Wall Street responded to the news by marking the stock down Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 40. Ms McGrath said the stock's decline reflected disappointment with the executive changes, even though Mr Goldstein, 52, and Mr Nakasone, 46, were well respected by the investment community. 'Anytime a machine is working and there is a change, the market will react negatively.' Mr Lazarus, 70, is expected to maintain an active role in the company, concentrating on its aggressive international expansion programme.</p>

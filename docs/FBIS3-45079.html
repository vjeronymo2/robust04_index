			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Keping (0205 0668 1627): "Tentative Views on </F> Declining Authority of Government"]    [Text] A mayor once ordered relevant departments to clean,  within a definite time, a polluted brook in the city proper  which stank to high heaven. However, the time limit was reached  and the brook remained as stinking as before. Though a certain  industrial and commercial inspection department makes great  efforts in carrying out struggles against illegal hawkers, the  latter continue to engage in swindling, cheating, and bullying.  In the face of court decisions that have already taken effect,  some plaintiffs still refuse to act accordingly. Though a ban  has been explicitly imposed on businesses run by government  organs, "renamed companies" still enjoy a flourishing business.  Many departments follow the practice by which "policies are  issued at higher levels while countermeasures are adopted at  lower levels," and that "local policies and private treasuries  can be found everywhere." All these are, in the terms of  political science, different expressions of the loss of  government authority.    In today's China, the loss of government authority has posed  a serious threat to the smooth progress of reform, opening up,  and modernization drive. To counter such a situation, some  leading comrades of local governments believe that safeguarding  government authority, especially the authority of the central  government, has become an urgent task at the present stage.    Generally speaking, the loss of government authority takes  the following three forms. The first form is refusal to act in  accordance with the law. Law is a concentrated expression of  government authority, and violations of the law mean a direct  disregard of government authority. Punishment handed down to  lawbreakers is a remedial measure to stop the loss of authority;  yet if no punishment was given to violators of the law, or if  the punishment is not heavy enough to prevent the reoccurrence  of lawbreaking activities, government authority will suffer a  net loss. The second form is failure to strictly enforce orders  and prohibitions, which means that government policies cannot be  carried out in an effective way. Policies of the government are  an expression of the will of the government. Any deliberate  delay, evasion, perfunctoriness, conclusion with nothing  definite, ignorance, and intentional antagonism all mean  violations and disrespect for government authority. The third  form is the misrepresentation of government policies during the  course of implementation. People who are in charge of  implementation purposely distort the original meaning of  government policies and make them more favorable to partial or  individual interests. Under such circumstances, either  government authority is retained in name but lost in reality, or  part of government authority is retained while the rest is lost.    The loss of government authority is a common political  disease which is, in essence, refusal to act in accordance with  the law and failure to strictly enforce orders and prohibitions.  The consequences of this disease are more disastrous than the  aftermath of having no policies and rules to follow. This is  because this disease will dampen the efficiency of the  administration; intensify contradictions between the government  and citizens; weaken the ruling foundation of the government and  the political recognition of the people; and finally lead to  political splits, integration of the political power, and  political turbulences in the society. Under such circumstances,  what should we do to effectively check a huge loss of government  authority? To answer this question, we should first find out  the root causes leading to the loss of government authority.  The source of loss of government authority, in the final  analysis, can be traced along the following three lines:    First, the deterrent force of decision makers. Whether or  not government policies can be carried out is, to a great  extent, determined by the deterrent force possessed by  decisionmaking organs. It is from the following two aspects  that such a deterrent is generated: The first aspect is the  legal mandatory means adopted by government organs. This means  that appropriate punishment should be handed down on those who  refuse to show proper obedience. If decisionmaking organs fail  to give appropriate punishment to those who refuse to show  obedience, its deterrence force will disappear gradually. The  second aspect is the legality of decision makers or, in other  words, recognition of decision makers by those who are asked to  show obedience. If people who are asked to show obedience do  not consider the decision maker as the right person to represent  their interest, the former will become rebellious and estranged  from the latter; and when the right moment comes, they will  disobey or violate the rules and regulations of the government.    Second, the calculation of "cost-interest" by those who are  asked to show obedience. During the course of implementing the  policies and rules of the government, those who take political  action generally have a sense for "cost-interest." If one is  not punished for his disobedience of rules and regulations, or  if his interests loss resulted from punishment for his  disobedience is smaller than the interest he gains from his  disobedience, he will tend to choose disobedience. On the  contrary, if his interest loss resulted from punishment for his  disobedience is bigger than what he gains from his disobedience  of rules and regulations, he will often choose obedience.    Third, the quality of policies. The quality of policies has  a great bearing on whether or not policies can be implemented  effectively. Generally speaking, we will find it hard to  effectively carry out policies, rules, and regulations under the  following four situations: 1) Incorrect policies. These  incorrect policies will, beyond any doubt, cause damage to the  interest of the whole. Therefore, though incorrect policies may  be forced through, the results will be nothing but temporary.  2) Different policies drawn up by different decisionmaking  departments. Facing different policies, rules, and regulations  put forward by different organs on a same issue, subordinate  organs will often find it hard to make a choice, for fear that  they may follow one policy and lose sight of another. 3) The  unpredictable changes in policies. If decisionmaking  departments issue an order in the morning and rescind it in the  evening, its subordinate organs will adopt a wait-and-see  attitude instead of carrying the order through vigorously and  speedily. 4) Conflicting policies. When policies, rules, and  regulations are contradictory or inconsistent, subordinate  organs will be at a loss as to what to do.    A fundamental way of checking the loss of government  authority is to enhance the legality and deterrent force of  government departments through political structural reform and  the building of clean administration, improve the quality of  policies through democratization and scientification of policy  decisions, and heighten the political recognition of citizens  through effective political socialization.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Press Service of the Georgian </F> Defense Ministry on 11 May]    [Text] The Georgian Defense Ministry Press Service made the  following statement: Russia's Ostankino television program,  Novosti, based on Abkhaz sources, on 10 May, in effect,  broadcast misinformation alleging the entry of Georgian armed  groups into the Gali rayon. The same source asserts that 250  armed Georgian fighters are operating in the Gali rayon.    The Press Service of the Georgian Defense Ministry is  authorized to state that this news does not correspond to the  truth. Similar information, based on Abkhaz sources, has been  broadcast many times before. In this particular case, it aims  at a specific target -- to separate or wreck Georgian-Abkhaz  talks on peaceful settlement that started today in Moscow.</p>

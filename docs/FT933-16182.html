			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Dreaming of a perfect summit: America Daddy, why are the world's leaders going to Prague for an economic summit?' 'It's a tradition - an excuse for a pleasant vacation. The leaders converge on one of the richest capitals and talk about anything under the sun. Usually they go to Asia but Prague is now as chic as Beijing.' 'But why is it called an economic summit? Politicians don't have anything to do with economics - do they?' 'Of course they don't. But when these summits began in the late 1970s - that would be well over half a century ago - governments intervened in nearly all aspects of economic life. They also quarrelled a lot about economic issues. The summits were meant to reduce friction and enhance 'global co-operation'. 'What did they quarrel about most?' 'Trade. I know this sounds crazy but in those days every country used to impose tariffs (that is, taxes) on imports from trading partners. These were often very high. They also imposed quotas - a specific limit on the volume of goods or share of a market that a competitor could have.' 'You mean we would have had to pay extra for our Chinese hover car?' 'Exactly. These restrictions were illogical. Nobody would have dreamed of imposing them on trade between regions of their own country. In their hearts the politicians knew they made everybody poorer but, selfishly, they still put the short-run interests of their own countries first. They were worried that rising imports would create unemployment.' 'What is that? I know some people get their incomes topped up out of taxes but unemployment is a contradiction in terms - wages would always fall to whatever level is needed to employ everybody.' 'They didn't then because people would not accept that the value of different jobs is always varying. Wages were not allowed to fall because people thought the world 'owed them' a certain living standard.' 'What else was discussed at these summits?' 'Fiscal policy was always a contentious issue. By the 1980s economists were agreed that policy lags and the unpredictability of business cycles meant it was useless to try to fine-tune economies by deliberately running budget deficits or surpluses. But politicians (especially Americans) still used to demand that other countries provide a stimulus by loosening fiscal policy. And most countries routinely spent more than they raised in taxes, thus shifting financial burdens onto future generations who didn't have a vote.' 'You're joking. That would be unethical. You mean there wasn't a balanced budget law?' 'Your economic history is lousy. You should know that didn't happen until the early years of this century. Monetary policy was also a chronic source of friction. At the summits, politicians were always complaining that somebody else's interest rates were too high or too low.' 'Now you're really pulling my leg. Governments don't control interest rates. The creation of money, and the management of its purchasing power, is a private-sector function.' 'What a parade of ignorance. In the 20th century national institutions called central banks enjoyed monopoly rights to print money. A few were nominally independent but most had to obey the politicians who invariably wanted more rather than less of it. That's why there was so much inflation in those years - for your information inflation means a steady rise in the overall level of prices.' 'What a strange idea. You mean your income would have to rise every year just to keep pace with prices? But since even in those days most countries had faith in markets, why on earth did they think private agencies were incapable of managing money creation? Why did they think people would be more responsible if they wore public-sector hats? 'It's a long story. One worry was that, if a private bank was allowed to produce its own money, it would overdo it and create terrible inflation. That was a stupid argument, of course, because nobody would want to hold money that loses value. As we have discovered in the last few decades of 'free banking', the market monitors the purchasing power of different private monies closely. As soon as one shows any signs of losing its value, it is threatened with bankruptcy.' 'You mean like Greenback Inc that had to be taken over by that Korean company?' 'Yes. But compared with the instability of the 20th century, we've had only minor hiccoughs with competing private monies. The price level has barely moved in 30 years. That's hardly surprising; the scientific challenge of stabilising the purchasing power of money is not really so great. The tough problem was persuading governments to surrender a power they relished.' 'Wow, those 20th century guys were dumb.' 'They were, but then they never really grasped the character of a market system. We see it as a spontaneous self-ordering mechanism and let it do virtually everything for us. But they saw it more like a bit of defective physical machinery with levers that had to be pulled and pushed. Ironically, the ex-communists provided the impetus for reform. With the enthusiasm of the religious convert they pushed for a truly unhampered market system. Once we got over the shock, we never looked back.'</p>

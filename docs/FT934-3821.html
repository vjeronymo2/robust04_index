			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Moody's lowers debt ratings of Daiwa Bank Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, has lowered the debt ratings of Daiwa Bank, a Japanese commercial bank, due to prospects of deteriorating profits from its acquisition of Cosmo Securities and its loan exposure to the collapsed Muramoto Construction. The agency lowered Daiwa's long-term rating to A3 from A1 and its short-term rating to Prime 2 from Prime 1. Daiwa became the first Japanese bank to acquire a brokerage subsidiary when it bailed out Cosmo, a financially troubled second-tier stockbroker, last August. Moody's said while the controversial purchase would provide the bank with a competitive advantage in entering the securities business on the long run, the cost of the debt-funded acquisition would be a burden in the intermediate term. Daiwa was one of the leading creditors of Muramoto, which filed for court protection with debts of up to Y590bn (Dollars 5.51bn) last month. Moody's said Daiwa has 'considerable exposure to Muramoto' and expects the cost of carrying significant non-performing assets, coupled with the additional provision and write-off requirements, will continue to depress the bank's earnings. The problems come as Daiwa's earnings are being squeezed by the growing use of high-cost funds from trust accounts to maintain competitive yields on its trust products leading to lower net interest margins. In addition, its commission-based profits from discretionary asset management services and real estate brokerage remain vulnerable to volatile market conditions.</p>

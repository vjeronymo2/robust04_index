Last year we conscientiously implemented central plans on  strengthening macroregulation and control, centralized actions,  worked concertedly, and achieved positive results in solving  outstanding contradictions and problems caused by rapid economic  development. For this year, strengthening macroregulation and  control over fixed-assets investment and strictly controlling  the scale of infrastructure projects will be the two most  important areas of work in service of the overall endeavor.    Judging from last year, when excessively rapid growth in  investment resulted in credit and monetary crunches, shortages  of transport, energy, and raw materials, and triggered off new  debt deferrals and defaults, if the growth of fixed-assets  investment is not put under strict control this year, all  sectors will be stretched to their limits, which will lead  eventually to drastic fluctuations in the national economy. If  that happens, this will work against the smooth implementation  of many reformist measures this year, healthy economic  development, the effort to curb inflation, and expanding opening  up, and will cause us to lose the historic opportunity we often  talk about. We can say that strict controls over the scale of  fixed-assets investment is the key to the smooth implementation  of this year's reforms, healthy economic development, social  stability, and curbing inflation.    Strengthening macroregulation and control does not mean  halting development and doing away with the market economy. It  is wrong to set macroregulation and control against the market  economy or economic development. We must not think that  strengthening macroregulation and control necessarily means a  slowing down of economic development, or vice versa. Only under  effective state macroregulation and control can the market  economy properly play its vital role of allocating resources and  ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy. No market economy in any country in the world  today is not under government regulation and control. Under the  new pattern of multiple investment bodies and diversified  financing, it is highly necessary to not only promptly  strengthen macroregulation and control, but also to exercise  macroregulation and control over investment with economic,  legal, and essential administrative means.    To establish a restraining and risk mechanism for  fixed-assets investment, the central authorities have decided  that, as of this year, the scale of loans for infrastructure  facilities and key industrial infrastructure projects will be  put under the centralized arrangements of the newly established  State Development Bank. This is an important reform, but it is  not possible to immediately put the scale of investment under  control with the new mechanism. Therefore, in view of the  present situation, it is still necessary to adopt multiple  methods simultaneously: First, the focus of work must be  genuinely shifted to structural adjustment and raising  efficiency. It is absolutely impermissible to again make the  same mistake of single-mindedly competing for investment,  launching projects, and expanding the scale in defiance of  objective conditions. Localities and departments must all adopt  effective measures to strengthen macroregulation and control  over investment and to concentrate their financial powers and  materials on key projects. Second, reprioritize projects under  construction to ensure that key projects are completed.  Projects completed and key operational support projects,  infrastructure facilities, and infrastructure industrial  projects must also obey state centralized planning and rational  layout, observe the principle of high rates of efficiency and  working within one's ability, concentrate on one single project  at a time, and avoid blind and repetitive projects. Third,  prevent continued expansion of the scale of construction,  strictly scrutinize new projects, and hold the units and leaders  concerned accountable for construction work launched without  authorization. Fourth, strengthen controls over the supply of  funds. Tighten the management of credit for fixed-assets  investment. The banking sector must strictly enforce the  investment loan plan, and financial institutions are forbidden  from lending for fixed-assets investment with funds obtained  from bank discounts. Fifth, strengthen the standardized  management of the capital market. The scale of bond issues and  the scope of joint-stock experiments cannot be expanded without  proper authorization. Sixth, tighten the management of property  developments and development zones, incorporating investment in  and loans for property development and construction into the  state fixed-assets investment and loan plan. Also, we must  strengthen guidance and standardized management of projects  funded by direct foreign investment, and genuinely strengthen  leadership over macroregulation and control over investment.    Reform and development this year has a heavy agenda. It is  highly significant to pursue this year's economic work well.  Therefore, we must comprehensively and correctly analyze the  times and the situation and exploit them, be clear-headed, good  at promptly identifying and solving new problems caused by  progress, particularly prevent an expansion of investments,  genuinely strengthen macroregulation and control over  investment, and create even more favorable conditions for  reform, development, and stability.</p>

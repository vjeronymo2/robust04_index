			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Order out of chaos I WAS sitting at my screen this week, fossicking through the message basket, when one of the corporate elders stole up behind me and hovered at my elbow. I could tell he was an elder because he wore a grey suit and tie and a pair of black spectacles. His expression was churchly. He said he had something for me, and handed me an envelope that contained a copy of a new book, the Financial Times Style Guide. He said: This is the new style book. You are the first person to receive one because you are in the vanguard, as it were, or possibly the van, of our core target audience, if you will pardon the solecism. I said: What is a solecism? He said: Oh, very funny. Seriously, Michael, there are those of us who feel that if we can get you to read it, to look upon it fondly, not, perhaps, follow it down all of its tributaries but at least meander through it, when commitments permit, then our struggle is half-won. Your help is essential pour encourager les autres. I said: Les enfants? He said: Exactly. Junior members of staff. The raw and the impressionable. They must read Hawks &amp; Handsaws sometimes and wonder, style-wise, whether they are in topsy-turvy land. Wilfulness and wickedness. Fantasy and worse. Sentences starting And. Sentences without verbs. Sentences and paragraphs without anything whatsoever. Tricksy experimentalism, at least in FT terms. I said: How will the Style Guide help me? He said: By creating order out of chaos. It is on the side of writers. It states, at the outset, as a caution to sub-editors: 'One result of the paperless office . . . is that it is all too easy to force stories into a sort of uniformity of style, removing any individuality and elegance they might have possessed. Good writing should be recognised - and left as it is.' Beyond that, Michael, it seeks to encourage writers to write accurately and clearly. It highlights recurring errors and contains glossaries of financial, scientific and technical terms. It is a useful and powerful tool. Clarity is essential. Let me give you an example. Under betting odds, it says that in a sentence such as odds were quoted of 2-1 on John Smith becoming the next leader of the Labour party, the on can cause confusion. Odds of 2-1 on are really 1-2, ie you place a bet of Pounds 2 and get back Pounds 1 plus the stake if you win. With odds of 2-1 (against), your Pounds 2 bet will recoup Pounds 4 plus the stake. It is therefore important to make the precise odds clear: 1-2 (on) or 2-1 (against). I said: I am afraid that isn't true. You have forgotten betting tax, which is 10 per cent of winnings and stake. At 1-2 you would pay 30p tax and get back Pounds 2.70; at 2-1 you would pay 60p tax and get back Pounds 5.40. He said: Do not quibble. More important than betting odds is our campaign against cliches and tired language. We sampled a year's issues of the FT and found seven villains of the piece, nine people who patched together a compromise, 45 who hammered out something, 20 who put something up for grabs, 28 who found it crystal clear, 95 who went back to square one, 161 who played a key role, 86 appearances at this moment in time, 145 who saw a green light, 135 who were beleaguered, and 33 who sent shock waves through something; 31 were tight-lipped, 27 events surprised the City though only four shocked it, and 20 people had played a waiting game, as 45 were quick to point out. Further analysis turned up 97 bonanzas, 910 booms, 223 bottom lines, 418 breakthroughs, 87 clampdowns, 6,472 crises, 293 crackdowns, 148 cutbacks, 269 elites, 852 giants, 1,889 run-ups and 5,122 problems. All we are asking you to do, Michael, is read it. And then he whispered away, his grey form merging into the grey corporate decor. So I read it. And enjoyed it. It is a considerably useful tool. You can buy it from the FT for Pounds 11, (p&amp;p included). Here are four snippets: Plane is used to shave wood; what you fly in is an aircraft, jet, airliner, helicopter, etc. Eponymous. Many readers will not know what it means. Avoid it. Expletives. The FT has no strict policy. However, gratuitous use is discouraged. The word wanker has appeared only once in the FT; it was a misprint for banker. Blobs. An average issue of the FT contains 30-40 blobs . . . Think carefully about whether the blob has any useful function.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finland sets out farm support shopping list for EC entry FINLAND HAS unveiled proposals for supporting its Arctic and sub-Arctic agriculture within the European Community - seen as the most difficult issue in the country's membership talks, reports Reuter from Helsinki. 'Unless we get some so-called Nordic agricultural support we cannot continue agriculture in this country,' Mr Pertti Salolainen, the foreign trade minister, told a news conference here yesterday. Mr Heikki Haavisto, the foreign minister, said the measures Finland would propose in the talks would cost between FM6bn and FM9bn (Pounds 693m and Pounds 1.04bn) a year. He said Finland's goal was for the EC to contribute FM3bn to FM3.5bn a year. A package of measures outlining Finland's position includes the following: Average support of up to FM2,970 per hectare; Livestock support of up to FM4,800 per animal; Milk, beef and mutton production subsidies for the two most northern regions; Transport support for milk, meat and eggs (excluding the most southern parts of Finland); Animal feed support in the three most northern regions. Finland would also aim at a 12-year transition period to restructure its farming. The government said price and support levels within the EC's common agricultural policy were not enough for Finland to achieve the agricultural policy objectives of the community. Finland has a growing season of 180 days or less compared with 220-230 days in Denmark and more in southern Europe. The package is to be sent to the EC in September to form a basis for further negotiations. The present round of talks started in February. The country aims to become a member of the community in 1995.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> TRUMBULL UNPLUGS SAN PEDRO POWER, 6-3  </P> <P> Trumbull, Conn., took advantage of five errors and five walks Thursday to  defeat the Eastview All-Stars of San Pedro, 6-3, in the Little League World  Series.  </P> <P> Connecticut will face Taiwan, a 13-0 winner over Venezuela, in the championship  game Saturday.  </P> <P> A crowd of 19,800 watched San Pedro take a 2-0 lead in the first inning on back  to back home runs by Tim Harper and Gary Sloan.  </P> <P> But Connecticut sent 11 batters to the plate in the bottom half of the inning  and scored five runs on three San Pedro errors and four walks by two Eastview  pitchers. The last man in the batting order, Dave Galla, got the only run  batted in and the only hit of the inning on a soft liner to center field.  </P> <P> Joe Sulentor opened the second inning with a home run for San Pedro but that  was all the West champions could muster against Trumbull pitcher Andy Paul.  </P> <P> Connecticut scored its final run in the third inning on two San Pedro errors.  </P> <P> After allowing the three homers on fastballs, Paul turned to an off-speed pitch  he calls "the dart" to keep San Pedro's power-hitting lineup in check.  </P> <P> San Pedro averaged 12 runs in 18 previous games.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 7 (AFP)--A journalist working for an  opposition fundamentalist newspaper went on trial in a military  court near Cairo Thursday for writing an article on US arms  sales to Egypt, sources at the newspaper said.    'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn, a journalist with the AL-SHA'B  newspaper, was accused of "revealing military secrets and  publishing information liable to provoke unrest."    The sources said Abu-Husayn was summoned by the military  prosecutor Monday and questioned by military intelligence  officers without lawyers or union representatives being present.    He was held at the Haikstep military base 30 kilometres (19  miles) north of Cairo and appeared before a military court there  Thursday.    The prosecutor said an article written by Abu-Husayn on  March  22 was based on US press allegations that retired Egyptian  generals received millions of dollars' worth of commissions from  US companies in exchange for arms contracts.    Citing US newspaper reports, Abu-Husayn said one of the  generals, 'Ali Mansur "has close links with President Husni  Mubarak."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The mediator's document on the implementation of  modalities for national reconciliation has already been  presented to the negotiating teams of the government and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].  Today, the teams examined the document that provides for  UNITA's participation in the government of national unity.  There was no session today, which was nevertheless  characterized by intense diplomatic activity.    Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN  secretary general in Angola and mediator in the peace talks, was  today received by Zambian head of state Frederick Chiluba, whom  he briefed on the present situation of the peace talks and  requested political and moral assistance with a view to finding  a quick solution for the peace talks.    The extra-parliamentary group led by Miguel Mwendo was today  received by the government negotiating team and Alioune Blondin  Beye. The group, led by the leader of the National Union for  the Beacon of Democracy and Development of Angola, includes the  president and deputy president of the Angolan Socialist Party.  It has already been received by Ambassador (Rocha Pares),  representing the troika of observers in the Angolan peace  process, and they gave him a proposal for the establishment of  peace in Angola.    Not until tomorrow will we know whether the negotiating  teams  of the government and UNITA will discuss Jonas Savimbi's special  status, within the framework of national reconciliation. The  government and UNITA were expected to discuss this issue  tomorrow. According to some political observers, it is extremely  risky to accept UNITA's request, but it is only though talking  that men can understand each other. The government and UNITA  know what they are doing to reestablish peace in Angola.</p>

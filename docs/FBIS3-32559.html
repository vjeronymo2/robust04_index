The lawmakers were thus authorized to assumed their posts on  11 March.    Tricel President Enrique Zurita Camps, who is also a Supreme  Court member, delivered to the presidents of the Senate and the  Chamber of Deputies, Gabriel Valdes and Jorge Molina,  respectively, the official document with the proclamation of the  citizens who were elected congressmen.    Zurita Camps reported that neither of the two appeals filed  on the election of senators or any of the 42 appeals filed on  the election of deputies were granted. Consequently, the figures  released by the Interior Ministry after the elections have not  been substantially changed. [passage omitted]</p>

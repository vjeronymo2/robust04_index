			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: A WELCOME LETTER FROM DISTANT PAST  </P> <P> We are all instinctively collectors, and the temptation to hang onto anything  that has been even minutely significant to us is overpowering. And so,  periodically, when there is no longer any room to store things, we clean out  the accumulation -- and then start all over again.  </P> <P> When I decide to clean out, I usually take no prisoners. Everything goes. The  alternative is to find oneself sitting and reading and dreaming over each scrap  of paper and faded picture until they become precious all over again and simply  can't be destroyed. But there's also an enormous risk in tossing out  indiscriminately. For example, it has occurred to me frequently in recent  months that if I had kept my baseball card collection, alone, I'd be  independently wealthy.  </P> <P> But that thought became downright frivolous a few days ago when I almost threw  away something of priceless value. I was going rapidly through a box of old  clippings and magazines and documents, preparatory to throwing them out, when  from the folds of a dog-eared magazine fell a tiny, faded blue notebook that I  recognized instantly. It was my grandfather's Civil War diary that my mother  had given me many years ago and that I had somehow misplaced and feared I had  lost.  </P> <P> I clutched it with enormous gratitude and sat down instantly to leaf through  it. It covers a rather brief period in 1864 when my grandfather was fighting  with Gen. Sherman in Georgia and is written in a tiny, fading script difficult  to read. So I was feeling rather than reading it, taking it in through my skin,  riffling the pages, when I made another glorious discovery. The first page of a  yellowed letter fell out of the book into my lap. I had never seen it before.  </P> <P> It was headed, "U.S.A. General Hospital No. 3, Lookout Mt. Tennessee," and it  was dated "April the 7th, 1865." It was addressed to "Sophia Beery," the maiden  name of my maternal grandmother. And it was a love letter. A tender and  poignant love letter.  </P> <P> "It has been a long time," wrote my grandfather, "since I heard from you. I  expect you didn't get my last letter. If you had, I think I should have heard  from you some time ago. . . . When I get a letter from you, it brings back to  memory the happy hours I spent with you last Fall and it brightens my mind with  a new hope that I may have the privilege of spending a few more happy hours in  the future with the one I admire.  </P> <P> "Oh how my heart would beat with joy if I knew you loved me as I love you. You  must excuse me for writing so plain on this subject. I wouldn't be so bold if I  thought anyone else would see my letters but you. I believe you have more  respect for me than to show my letters to anyone.  </P> <P> "Sophia, if it should be the case that you are tired of corresponding with  someone who loves you, for my sake show no person my letters. Not that I care  who knows I love you for I am certain it is no disgrace to love as good and  nice a girl as you are. It would be an honor, if anything. Sophia, do not look  on this as mere flattery, for I am sincere in what I write you.  </P> <P> With good intentions on my mind,  </P> <P>  You will in me a true friend find;  </P> <P>  And when you find one kind and true,  </P> <P>  Don't change an old one for a new.  </P> <P> "I received a letter from Sarah Stephenson a few days ago, and she told me you  and her had a good time. . . ."  </P> <P> And there the page ended, and there were no others. Only one page, written on  both sides in a beautiful script that looked almost like calligraphy. I  wondered if my grandfather had written the letter himself or if some angel of  mercy, helping the wounded soldiers, had written it for him. I think he wrote  it himself. I don't believe he would have entrusted it to someone else.  </P> <P> My grandfather, Robert Patterson, married Sophia Beery two years after he  returned from the Civil War. They had seven children, two boys who died in  infancy and five girls they raised in Decatur, Ind., where my grandfather was  the town miller. My mother was his youngest daughter, and she was only 7 when  her mother died. Her father lived to a ripe old age, but not long enough for me  to know him. He died 10 years before I was born.  </P> <P> So my only portrait of him -- before I found this letter -- comes from my  parents. And mostly from my father. I used to love to listen when my father and  my uncles got together and talked about the old man, in nominal charge of five  beautiful young women, each of whom was a catch for the young men in Decatur.  My grandfather had been a captain in the Union Army, the survivor of many  battles as Sherman fought his way through the South. He had been wounded and  decorated and had come home to be a pillar of his community.  </P> <P> But the picture that my father and my uncles always painted was of a crusty old  man sitting in a rocker on his front porch telling war stories. The young men  in Decatur would come courting, and my grandfather -- probably to his  daughters' great embarrassment -- would regale the swain with war stories,  stories that got better with each telling.  </P> <P> That's the only picture I carried of my grandfather, and the picture of my  grandmother was even more amorphous. My father had never known her, and when my  mother talked about her, it was in almost saintly terms. I have stood many  times at my grandparents' graves and wished I might have known them.  </P> <P> Then, suddenly and unexpectedly, a frayed letter drops out of a diary and they  become people to me. A lovesick young man dreaming and hoping in a battlefield  hospital. And a beautiful and desirable young woman, distant and unattainable,  but beginning to look in his direction. I loved the crusty old man with his war  stories and the saintly woman who died long before her time. But I love these  two people even more. They paid me a visit the other day, and now I can bring  them back whenever I choose. And I may very well never throw anything away  again.  </P></p>

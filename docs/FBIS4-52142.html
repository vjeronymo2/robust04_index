			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand has mapped out plans for the use of water  from the Salween River as stated in the treaty concerning  watershed for international rivers. Minister to the Prime  Minister's Office Sawit Phothiwihok and Director General of the  Department of Energy Affairs Prathet Sutabut explained the plans  to Myanmar [Burma] authorities during their visit to Myanmar.    The Thai delegation has made it clear to the Myanmar side  that the treaty made between Thailand and Britain on demarcation  line between Thailand and then-Burma stated that both countries  have equal claim over water flow in the Salween River. The Thai  authorities told their Myanmar counterpart that Thailand's  project to divert water from the Salween River to the Phumiphon  Dam in Tak Province will be within Thailand's legitimate claim  over water use. They have informed the Myanmar side that the  Department of Energy Affairs and the Electricity Generating  Authority of Thailand will jointly implement the project which  will first take three months to plan as a comprehensive water  management plan involving five tributaries of the Salween River.  They explained that the oversupply of water in the Salween and  its tributaries will only flow out to the sea without benefiting  anyone on its (?path).</p>

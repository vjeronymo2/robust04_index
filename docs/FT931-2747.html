			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: BES axe bites into current schemes THE CHANCELLOR'S decision to abolish expansion schemes connected to loans from midnight before the budget has left the tax avoidance market in turmoil. At least two schemes, aimed at raising more than Pounds 23m for Bristol University and for Oriel College, Oxford, had not allotted shares by the deadline, and so the schemes will not be eligible for tax relief. Decisions on other schemes will rest on the judgment of local tax inspectors. Oriel Residences, which attempted to raise Pounds 13.75m for Oriel College, Oxford with loans provided by the Co-operative Bank, allotted shares to shareholders immediately before the budget speech on Tuesday afternoon. The scheme opened for subscriptions at 9.00am on Tuesday. Mr Nick Lewis, of Downing Corporate Finance, which sponsored the issue, said that about Pounds 3m had been taken. The directors of the companies said they were 'seeking to put into place arrangements for the return to investors of 100 per cent of their subscription monies'. Downing Corporate Finance intends to launch a new BES issue immediately in conjunction with Oriel College. Downing is still taking legal advice on how the money can be repaid. This new scheme would not involve loans. The administrative costs of returning the shares will be paid by Downing. Bristol Residences attempted to raise Pounds 9.6m for new buildings at Bristol University, with the offer of a loan after six months from Barclays Bank. Mr Allan Hodgson, a director of the company, said that 'some million' had been collected, but that shares had never been allotted. All the money would be returned 'shortly'. Hodgson Martin, the sponsor of the issue, also intends to launch a new company, without a loan, in time for the end of the tax year.</p>

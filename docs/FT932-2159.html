			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Private View: A voice for the victims - Pierre Sane, head of Amnesty International, discusses the modern meaning of human rights WHILE London was basking in the 2,500th anniversary celebrations of the birth of Greek democracy, Vienna this week was witnessing a struggle over the modern meaning of human rights. On Tuesday the Dalai Lama was at a meeting arranged by Amnesty International in the Austrian capital. China had refused to allow the spiritual leader of the Tibetans to address 5,000 delegates at the biggest United Nations conference on human rights for 25 years. The communist leaders in Peking, together with the governments of Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and other developing countries, are complaining that the West interferes when it imposes its own definition of human rights upon them, that it hampers their trade and weakens their competitiveness. Amnesty International, which fights for prisoners of conscience and victims of torture, is a western foundation with headquarters in London. But its new secretary general, Pierre Sane, was born and brought up in Dakar, Senegal. I went to Vienna and asked him: You come from a developing country. Do you not sympathise with what these Asian countries say? 'Nobody disagrees when some Asian and African countries talk about the right to development and about an unequal economic system,' he replied. 'But even if true that still doesn't give you the right to torture a political opponent. 'Asians have the right to industrialise but not to crush their own people. Does it mean that to be competitive in the world today you have to sweat and oppress your people? If their workers say they want an eight-hour day, then those workers should not be tortured or jailed because they are organising in order to get it.' Do you agree with using trade as a sanction? 'No, not really. I don't think you can impose human rights by force from the outside. When you impose sanctions you may be punishing people in the country. More important, you will plant the idea among them that the solution to their problem will come from outside. And I think the solution will come from inside. In China, it will be for the Chinese themselves . . . ' Pierre Sane is an accountant who went to business school. Practising in Senegal would have meant helping state or foreign companies maximise their profits and minimise their tax, he said. 'I found morally I could not do it.' So he went into development aid, studying at the London School of Economics and Carlton University, Ottawa. You could have made a lot of money as an accountant. Why did you revolt? 'Because I would have made the money at the expense of my people.' It hasn't stopped others, I said. Where did this revulsion come from? 'I guess from my education and upbringing.' He grew up in a Christian household but is not religious, unlike his mother, a teacher, and father, who was a journalist. 'I suppose they gave us these values of equality and justice and the idea you can achieve things peacefully by the force of conviction. 'I cannot stand injustice. And I suppose being black and being from a continent that has suffered 400 years of unequal relationship with the world you grow up with this kind of view. Not all Africans do, as you say, because they used to sell to the slave trade - and some still oppress their own people.' The fact you are black could be interpreted as tokenism, I said. Why did Amnesty choose you? 'There were 1,200 candidates and the executive committee did not start by wanting a black one. The fact I was black was the icing on the cake.' He smiled. 'But by appointing me Amnesty is sending a message to the Third World about universality, multiculturalism.' Sane wants to broaden Amnesty's analysis of the economic background to human rights violations without diffusing its campaign on behalf of individual victims. His scrutiny will include not only nation states but terrorist groups, multinational companies and institutions like the World Bank and IMF. 'We have to change the image of Amnesty as being a western organisation. Even if it is western it is the bearer of universal values - and being western does not necessarily mean it is bad.' I referred to the Asian plea of cultural difference and a collective right of development. 'But that's not the issue. The issue is whether a collective has the right to torture people in their own collective. If you had a culture which practised anthropophagy (cannibalism), and argued 'this is our culture' we will tell them 'even if it's your culture it's not acceptable. So stop it]'' But are you telling them they cannot employ cheap labour in sweatshops? 'I suppose we are telling them that civilised progress makes it unacceptable today to reach the objective of economic development at the expense of human dignity. We say 'You will not repeat history.' We have to find a new model of development that is centred on man. 'Some governments, even though their economy is modern or modernising, even though their political system is a formal democracy, still behave like in a feudal system where political dissent is considered an attempt to undermine the government. They really continue to behave as if their power is coming from God.' The UN's 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights covers not only the right to life, liberty, fair trial and freedom of speech but also a right to work, marry freely, own property, vote in elections, claim social security, join a trade union and get a free primary education. I suggested to Sane that it was Utopian, politically unrealistic. 'I don't think so. It's not just an ideal, it's also a yardstick. It is the minimum that makes an individual a real human being, If by 'unrealistic' you mean we don't have the means, then I don't think so. The means exist.' You and I can agree that people should have these things, I said, but as rights where do they come from? 'They are won through struggle.' They are not given to us by God, or come from our souls? 'For some people they are: they say we are born with all of this. For others it is the conquest of belief and social struggle.' Who says where the list of rights should end? 'I think the list is never finished. Once those are achieved for part or all of humanity we should push it further.' He suggested, for example, that the right of asylum for victims of political persecution should eventually be extended to refugees from economic deprivation. The premise is that human rights are not only universal but indivisible and interdependent. I asked Sane what that meant. 'It means that you cannot just be free to starve. It means you are entitled to food, that the conditions for making you a human being and not an animal are met. 'Indivisible' means you are not just free from state violence or state interference in your private affairs. 'Interdependence' means that in order to satisfy one you have to have the other. If you are poor, you are powerless. In order to move out of poverty you have to have political power in your own society.' Amnesty has been a thorn in the side of democracies as well as dictatorships: it pursues European states for their treatment of conscientious objectors and refugees, the US for its use of the electric chair. I asked Sane to comment on Britain's proposed Pounds 1.5bn sale of military trainer aircraft to Indonesia in spite of that country's human rights record in East Timor. Like all such sales, he said, it could prove counter-productive in the end, generating a wave of migrants fleeing persecution made possible by the purchase of arms. There are 183 countries in the UN and 110 of them still torture prisoners, according to Amnesty. I asked Sane whether, worldwide, things were getting better or worse. 'I think better because of the focus of the media, on Bosnia, on Somalia, on Angola. Throughout the world there is development of moral consciousness - because of television. You see what is going on, you are affected and you want it to stop. We forget that the whole of Latin America has come out of the rule of dictatorship. We forget that even in China economic transformation is putting pressure on the political system to open up. 'Twenty-five years ago governments could torture in secret, kill in the dark and we would not be informed. Today, with the network of human rights organisations, the presence of the media, any act of state violence in one place is reported throughout the world. The governments are exposed, and governments do not like to be exposed, especially when they are breaking their own laws. 'Those who are still putting forward arguments of cultural relativism are on the defensive. And they are on the defensive because while they are here arguing about it they are forcing it down the throats of their own people. The debate is not with us. It is with their own people.'</p>

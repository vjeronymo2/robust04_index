			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of European finance and investment, Overview (3): Utopian vision is still blurred - The effects of a single market IT IS arguable whether the buying habits of the European consumer will change fundamentally at midnight on New Year's eve. The formal opening of a single European market in 1993 seems unlikely to prompt an upsurge in the number of penny-pinching Danes driving to Portugal to buy cheap fridges, or cheeseparing Germans flying to Greece for bargain replacement batteries for their BMWs. But in the field of investment and financial services, the single market should make a huge difference: capital should move freely across borders; banks, insurance companies and securities firms should be able to set up and trade in any member state. Direct competition across borders should flourish and the consumer - whether professional or private - should enjoy an unrivalled choice of cheap insurance policies, banking facilities and brokers' fees, all available by telephone. But practical, psychological and legislative obstacles remain before this Utopian vision can be realised. First the good news. Legislation to establish a single market in banking services is all but complete. A series of EC measures - including the cornerstone second banking directive adopted in 1989 - has made it possible for banks to hold a single 'passport' after 1992. In essence, this means banks will be able to operate anywhere in the EC, either through branches in third countries or by offering cross-border services, from January 1, 1993. Supervision will be carried out by regulators in the bank's home country. Forward-thinking banks have already responded to the challenges thrown up by the single market with a series of cross-border takeovers and alliances, but the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) - Luxembourg-based with branches throughout the EC - has made some observers anxious about the safety of such financial spiders' webs. Brussels is backing up the initial thrust of its legislation with further measures aimed at harmonising specific minimum prudential standards throughout the Community, including directives on supervision and deposit insurance. The Commission is also working with missionary zeal on a part of the single market - payment systems - which was almost forgotten in the rush to create the single passport. The volume of payments across frontiers is likely to increase substantially from there are few direct cross-border links between banks, making transfers and settlements time-consuming and unnecessarily costly. The Commission expects to put pressure on banks to set up a more efficient system, perhaps with linked automated clearing houses in each country, by the end of this year. If they fail, Brussels will legislate in this area too. Progress has also been swift in the insurance market. From mid-1994, non-life insurance policies will be available to consumers from companies anywhere in the EC, and work is under way to reach agreement on the equivalent legislation opening up the life assurance market. Two more insurance directives were adopted at the end of last year, which should ensure the comparability of insurance company accounts across the Community and setting up a committee to supervise implementation of EC insurance legislation. In theory, the benefits to the consumer should be great. According to a survey by the main European consumers' association earlier this year, fixed term life assurance can cost eight times as much in Portugal as it does in the UK. But the same survey also pointed out the practical and psychological difficulties facing consumers who want to buy across borders. Linguistic difficulties, lack of information, inconsistent consumer protection rules and sheer lack of Euro-enthusiasm on the part of some companies were likely to hamper the project, said the association. The biggest disappointment for Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner responsible for financial services, has been in the securities field, perhaps the area where the single market's largest consumers - investors and corporate predators - buy and sell. The investment services directive, which would allow securities firms to operate anywhere in the Community, has been a priority item on the agenda of ministers' meetings since June 1990. For three successive EC presidencies - Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - high-level working groups have thrashed out the issues, but never reached agreement. The British lead a group of countries pressing for more liberal regulation of stock markets, particularly in the key area of transparency - that is, the speed and method by which stock market trades are made public. In the vanguard of the opposing group is France, which would like there to be tight control over markets. Recent developments have kept hopes of an agreement alive - just. Having been bogged down for months, the related capital adequacy directive - which would establish common capital standards for European securities operations  -has begun to gain momentum, nudged along by international agreement between feuding bank and securities regulators in January. Success with capital adequacy rules could improve the chances of the investment services directive. Some national officials in Brussels also believe that the British camp is beginning to break up, which would make a majority compromise possible. But to the disgust of advocates of the directive, the UK itself - led by corporate affairs minister Mr John Redwood - shows no signs of cracking. Indeed, Mr Redwood indicated in February that the offending measure might be dropped from the single market programme during the British presidency, which begins in July, if an acceptable agreement could not be reached. It is now almost impossible for EC members to harmonise their securities markets before the 1993 deadline, but in this as in other areas of financial services evolution will not come to a halt next year. The demise of the current investment services directive might not greatly upset the City of London's market-makers, who would be threatened by a French-style regulatory system. But Commission officials grimly point out that another presidency and another commissioner could always table a new investment services directive at a later date - one which might be even less to the UK's liking.</p>

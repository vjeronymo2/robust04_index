			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / City where the dead are lucky: UN aid group describes the 'living hell' of Gorazde Even as Nato diplomats in Brussels mapped out plans to step up the use of air power over Gorazde, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said its premises in the city was coming under artillery fire. To judge from the picture painted by UNHCR, the 'living hell' of Gorazde amounted to the greatest concentration of civilian suffering in a single space seen during two years of war in Bosnia. UNHCR volunteers in the enclave said they had lost contact with the town hospital, where about 30 people have been killed and all surgical equipment destroyed in artillery attacks by Serb forces, who say the building is being used for military purposes. The building was shrouded in smoke and the upper storeys largely ruined, but people were still sheltering in the basement, according to UNHCR officials. In the latest attacks, the UNHCR building took several hits from shells, and three people were killed by a shell that landed nearby. At least 97 people were killed on Thursday - the highest casualty figure for a single day - bringing the known casualties in this month's battle for Gorazde to 535 dead and 1,740 injured, according to a UNHCR statement. In an unusual move, the UN agency made public the full text of a message received yesterday morning from an Irish doctor in the town, Dr Mary McLaughlin. It reads in part: 'Greetings from a city where only the dead are lucky. The last two days have been a living hell. . . Both residents and refugees are crowded into crumbling buildings waiting for the next shell. When it hits, many are killed as there are such crowds in each building. 'The wounded lie for hours in the debris as it is suicidal to try to bring them to the hospital. One UNHCR local worker said he could hear the cries of the wounded in the houses in his journey to our cellar yesterday. (In the hospital) shells batter down the walls and machine gun fire rakes the wards. . . The Serb excuse for targeting it is that it is a military institution. I've been in all parts of the hospital 100 times in the last month and can assure the outside world that it's a lie. 'The dead are hastily buried at night by covering them with a thin layer of sand. If it ever gets hot here, there will be epidemics. . . ' A convoy of 147 UN soldiers and medical personnel destined for Gorazde was ordered to remain in Rogatica, a Serb-held town nearby, after Serb women blocked its route.</p>

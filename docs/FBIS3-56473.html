Among politicians  experiencing a feeling of profound satisfaction from the results  of the 12 December voting is apparently Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    Back in November, when few doubted the success of Russia's  Choice, representatives of this bloc were complaining to  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' correspondent about the constant  counteraction on the part of the head of the Council of  Ministers which, according to them, went as far as telegrams  with direct instructions to sink the Gaydarites. Naturally  there was no doubt that in the event of Choice's victory (the  convincing victory on which it was counting at the time) the  premises of the head of the Russian Government could have  received a new occupant.    In order not to fall out with Viktor Stepanovich completely,  Russia's Choice made a statement about supporting his candidacy,  specifying that the ongoing reform course must remain unchanged.  On the other hand, Shakhray's Party of Russian Unity and Accord  from the very start of the campaign was far more definitive in  its statements: "coalition," "a compromise figure," "the  premier must stay on," and "Gaydar has no chances," which evoked  strong sympathies on Chernomyrdin's part.    However, the current head of the Council of Ministers is  looking for friends not only among the more or less decent  Shakhray followers. Russia's Choice, having refused to  participate in preliminary "consultations," cited among its  reasons the "fickleness" of its interlocutors, who are  constantly changing earlier approved candidacies. On 4 January  Zhirinovskiy said that the Liberal Democratic Party would  propose for this post 61-year-old Vladimir Gusev, former first  secretary of Saratov Obkom and former deputy chairman of the  USSR Council of Ministers, who is currently listed on the  Liberal Democratic Party slate (although not a member of this  party) as vice president of the Promyshlennik corporation.  According to information at MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' disposal,  Chernomyrdin has asked Zhirinovskiy to propose his candidate for  the post of speaker.    Viktor Stepanovich also has another trump up his sleeve:  Under the constitution, he may perform the president's  functions for four months, should the president resign. And  then? It is silly to make guesses, but the mass media are being  very actively placed under government control (meaning its  apparatus-"economic" half). Consider the fact that they have  their own press minister (head of the Council of Ministers press  service); the recent attempts to take control of the former  Parliament Hour program; a certain list of a dozen papers worthy  of generous state subsidizing; and the actually revived State TV  and Radio Committee, directed according to the government  concept. It should be noted that some mass media organizations  are already confidently calling Chernomyrdin not only the number  two man in the state (which corresponds to his post) but also as  catching up with the president in the charisma of a "nationwide  leader." "Master," "real man" [muzhik], "our man," "tough,"  "laconic" (therefore intelligent), "a strong hand," and so  forth: the image being created is very impressive indeed.    The former head of Gazprom received his high post 13 months  ago as a "compromise figure." "A sound economic manager" was  how he was described: It is thanks to him that our homes are  still warm. A world-level manager; our gas workers have outdone  Ruhrgaz and included lucrative contracts (according to experts,  Ruhrgaz has already recovered and is again picking up). It is  difficult, however, to enter big-time politics and stay "a mere  specialist." For instance, Gaydar, who in November 1991 was a  little-known cabinet theoretician, by the time of his second  coming to the government had Russia's Choice and the Association  of Private and Privatized Enterprises to his credit. There is  no doubt that Viktor Stepanovich too has had enough time to  acquire numerous political, economic, and commercial contacts  presupposing certain obligations.    Chernomyrdin promised to make public his ideas about the  personal composition of the Council of Ministers on 17 January.  So far it is only known that in response to the supposition  that Gaydar and Soskovets will be first vice premiers and Yarov  and Zaveryukha plain vice premiers, he said: "You nearly got  it." And also that he has invited Shokhin to stay in the  government. Boris Fedorov, on the contrary, will apparently be  shown the door. Nonetheless, Yeltsin's decision to leave  Chubays as vice premier no matter what has added optimism to the  Russia's Choice part of the cabinet. Which after the latest  events (the decision to build a new parliament complex and the  "ill-advised and destructive" agreement with Belarus on the  exchange of its currency for the ruble at a 1:1 rate) has  started talking about the need "to distance itself" from the  mistakes of the government, and it may be ready to distance  itself too far.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER 52 YEARS, HERB CAEN IS FOLDING HIS SUNDAY COLUMN  </P> <P> After most of 52 years, Herb Caen announced that this weekend's effort was his  last Sunday column, the weekly nostalgic fixture about his favorite city.  </P> <P> "I never did get a handle on the Sunday column," he wrote with a touch of  cynicism, noting that he is taking advantage of his contract with the San  Francisco Chronicle to cut back to five columns a week.  </P> <P> "Talking about how great old San Francisco was exposed me as the crank and  grump I was becoming . . . the Baghdad-by-the-Bay stuff . . . wore thin as the  city changed," he said, concluding: "So, farewell, faithful Sunday readers . .  . there's a plan afoot to run old Caen columns in this space, and I'll read  them with great interest, wondering how I got away with it."  </P></p>

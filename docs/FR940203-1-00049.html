This proposed amendment is necessary to implement a decision of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the authority granted by the Agent Orange Act of 1991 that there is a positive association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and the subsequent development of multiple myeloma and respiratory cancers. The intended effect of this proposed amendment is to establish presumptive service connection for those conditions based on herbicide exposure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before March 7, 1994.

All written comments received will be available for public inspection only in the Veterans Services Unit, room 170, at the above address between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday (except holidays).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  John Bisset, Jr., Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, (202) 233&hyph;3005.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 2(a)(1) of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;4, 105 Stat. 11 (1991), added 38 U.S.C. 1116 which established presumptive service connection for veterans with service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era who subsequently develop, to a degree of 10 percent or more, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma (subject to specified statutory exceptions), and chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne (within one year of the last date of active service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era), even though there is no record of that disease during military service. Final regulations implementing this statutory provision were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 19, 1993 (See 58 FR 29107&hyph;09).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3 of Public Law 102&hyph;4 directed the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review the scientific evidence concerning the association between exposure to herbicides used in support of military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and each disease suspected to be associated with such exposure. Congress mandated that NAS determine, to the extent possible: (1) Whether there is a statistical association between the suspect diseases and herbicide exposure, taking into account the strength of the scientific evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to detect the association; (2) the increased risk of disease among individuals exposed to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era; and (3) whether there is a plausible biological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship between herbicide exposure and the suspect disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1116(b) of 38 U.S.C. provides that whenever the Secretary determines, based on sound medical and scientific evidence, that a positive association exists between exposure of humans to an herbicide agent (i.e., a chemical in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era) and a disease, the Secretary will publish regulations establishing presumptive service connection for that disease. An association is considered ``positive'' if the credible evidence for the association is equal to or outweighs the credible evidence against the association. In making that determination, the Secretary is to consider reports received from NAS as well as other available sound medical and scientific evidence and analyses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

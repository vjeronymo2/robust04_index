			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> POLICE RAID 2 HOMES AND ARREST 5 PEOPLE  </P> <P> A team of 20 police officers raided two homes over the weekend, arresting five  people on a variety of charges, including possession of cocaine for sale and  possession of stolen property, authorities said Sunday.  </P> <P> The raids, which began at 8:15 p.m. Friday, were in a north San Clemente  neighborhood that police said has been the scene of several disturbances over  the past few weeks.  </P> <P> "A team of 20 officers served a search warrant on an apartment . . . where  undercover officers had bought cocaine and marijuana while doing an  investigation of criminal activity in the neighborhood," Sgt. Richard E.  Downing said.  </P> <P> Arrested for possession of half an ounce of cocaine was Mario Hurtato, 25, who  lives at the apartment in the 100 block of West Escalones. Also arrested at the  scene for outstanding misdemeanor warrants were Lorenzo Hurtato, 20, and  Francisco Cazares, 30, Downing said.  </P> <P> One hour later, police went to a home on the 800 block of Calle Puente, behind  West Escalones, and arrested two men on suspicion of having stolen property,  believed to have been taken from a local dentist's office two weeks earlier,  Downing said. Joel Gonzales, 18, and Juan Nejorado, 20, both of San Clemente,  remain in custody.  </P> <P> Councilman Brian J. Rice said the arrests indicate the city's proactive stance  on stomping out minor criminal activities before they escalate.  </P> <P> "Sending 20 officers out there makes a statement that the city is going to  accentuate that area," Rice said. "We have not had anything of a tremendous  concern happen, but the same problems keep cropping up in the same area, so the  city is coming from a very proactive angle to prevent things from getting out  of hand."

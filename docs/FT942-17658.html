			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / US-Singapore caning row Singapore yesterday expressed regret that the US embassy had again questioned the judgment of local courts in the case of an American teenager sentenced to be lashed for vandalism. After an appeal against the youth's sentence failed on Thursday, the acting US ambassador described the penalty as excessive 'for a youthful non-violent offender who pleaded guilty'. In dismissing the appeal Chief Justice Yong Pung How said that 18-year-old Michael P. Fay committed acts of vandalism 'relentlessly and wilfully'. He pleaded guilty on March 3 to two charges of vandalism, which involved spraying paint and tossing eggs at private cars last September. Three strokes of a bamboo cane across the bare buttocks are mandatory under Singapore law for each vandalism charge.</p>

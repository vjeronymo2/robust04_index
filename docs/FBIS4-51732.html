			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The North Korean Ambassador to Thailand, Yi  To-sop, yesterday said the United States' arms build-up on the  Korean Peninsula was a main reason for North Korea's call for a  new peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice agreement.    In an interview with THE NATION, Yi accused the United  States  of "openly" violating the ceasefire agreement by sending Patriot  missiles to the peninsula in addition to several other previous  "covert" violations. "This is considered paralyzing the  agreement," said Yi.    The armistice was signed between the US command, a US-led  coalition of troops from 16 Western allies, and North Korea in  1953 to halt the 1950-1953 Korean War. The two Koreas are  technically still at war in the absence of a peace treaty.    In reaffirming the North Korean Foreign Ministry's April 28  statement, the ambassador said a new peace treaty was necessary  to establish a new peace security system and to prevent an arms  build- up and the recurrence of war.    Pyongyang on Thursday also proposed direct negotiations with  Washington on a new treaty. The proposal was rejected by both  Washington and Seoul, which said it was a tactic to divert the  world's attention from nuclear tension caused by North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons program.    US officials said the peace accord was a matter between  North  and South Korea, not the United States and was a separate matter  from the nuclear row. They said the settlement of the nuclear  issue was an imperative.    Yi also accused Washington of meddling in an inspection in  March by an International Atomic Energy Agency team by  presenting unacceptable conditions.    The ambassador said there should be no conditions for future  international nuclear inspections of North Korean nuclear  facilities.    Yi said the whole thing was a US ploy to pressure North  Korea  to open up the country and its market. This was much the same  as the way the United States used human rights issues to coax  China to free up its market to US products, he said. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Four universities in project for Pounds 60m Docklands campus Four universities have joined the London Docklands Development Corporation in a consortium to build a Pounds 60m university campus in east London's disused Royal Albert Docks. The group, which also includes London East Training and Enterprise Council and the Labour-controlled Newham council, has made a formal bid for Pounds 10m from the government's new single regeneration budget, which brings together the urban regeneration budgets of a number of government departments. This is, the consortium says, its first and 'potentially most critical' request for funds. If built, the project would provide a big impetus to government plans for a development corridor east of London. The corporation has already committed Pounds 4.1m to the project and is in discussions with the Treasury over raising further funds via the private finance initiative. London First, the co-ordinating body for private-sector investment in London, is supporting the project. Up to 5,000 students would be catered for by the campus, which would be owned jointly by the Queen Mary and Westfield College, the University of East London, City University and London Guildhall University. A new science and technology park would adjoin the campus. Up to 2,000 jobs would be created. The University of East London said it hoped to start admitting students to the new campus in 1996 or 1997, when it is hoped the first phase of teaching facilities will be ready. Mr Bob Pringle, an executive director of the corporation, said: 'The institute will specialise in industry-related applied science and technology, attracting hi-tech, high-value industries which will change the economic profile of this part of Docklands and aid the regeneration of the east Thames corridor.' Once completed, the campus will be funded by the Department for Education, although it hopes to raise private sector income. Picture, Page 14</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Parties agree on technology plans THE LABOUR and Conservative parties put forward similar proposals yesterday to 'bridge the gap between academia and industry' by creating a national network of technology development centres. The government scheme was announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary. They said that it would start in the next academic year with a Pounds 2m pilot project involving five partnerships between higher education institutions and industrial research organisations. Students would acquire degrees while working on industrial research. The scheme would expand later into a network of 'centres of excellence in particular technologies' - probably to be called Faraday Centres - which would play a bridging role similar to the much-admired Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany. Labour's plan, announced by Mr Jeremy Bray, science spokesman, and Mr Lewis Mooney, technology spokesman, calls for the creation of a national network of Newton Institutes, each specialising in a branch of science or engineering. Although their proposed names honour different scientists, the Newton Institutes and Faraday Centres seem virtually identical in conception. Both are based on ideas from the Working Group on Innovation chaired by Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Centre for Exploitation of Science and Technology in London. Mr Neil Johnston of the centre said: 'It is encouraging that, whoever wins the election, action will be taken to bridge the gap between higher education and industry.' Labour also proposed yesterday the creation of 'a new national focus for science, in a permanent 'expo' of what science is today, how it is being applied and where it is going'.</p>

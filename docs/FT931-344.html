			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Salesmen can still give value for money - Provision of expert advice is a way for representatives to win friends and business I HAVE always had some sympathy with the farmer who erected the sign at his gate saying: 'We shoot every third salesman. The second has just left.' It was, of course, a humorous way of informing representatives passing by that the farmer had no wish to talk to casual callers who would merely waste his valuable time. It implied that there was no chance of a stranger drumming up new business because committed relationships with existing suppliers were already in place. Another sign which can still be seen on many farm gates reads: 'Representatives by appointment only'. In practice, these days not many try the cold call approach. Their more professional attitude is without doubt one of the results of the decline in farm profitability and, with it, harder times for those who supply the industry's requisites. There are far fewer people trying to sell to the farming industry than there were. Each of them has to plan his or her activities more carefully. It has been estimated that there are 9,000-10,000 agricultural representatives on the road at present - about half the number 20 years ago and one-third of those 30 years ago. Nevertheless, their cost to the industry, including pensions and cars, is put at Pounds 350m a year. One way or another, this ultimately has to come out of farmers' pockets. Not all salesmen are a drain on agriculture. The best and most successful have always helped and advised their clients. Moreover, if a person trying to sell animal feed were unable to give sound nutritional advice, or an agricultural chemical representative could not recognise weeds and plant diseases before recommending products to deal with them effectively, they would make few sales. A salesman must add value as well as shift product. There is, however, no widely recognised assessment of competence nor a generally accepted training procedure. Achievements are normally measured only by the quantity of sales made which, on the face of it, is the most important measurement of performance in the short term. Those salesmen who are particularly successful can usually only progress through their company's hierarchy and salary scale by leaving the job they are probably best at and going into management. All too often companies lose a good salesmen and gain a mediocre manager. With 350 salespeople on the road, Dalgety, the UK's biggest independent supplier of the complete range of farmers' requirements, is more aware than most companies of the inadequacies of traditional management and motivation of sales forces. It has, therefore, decided to develop its own training and certification scheme for salespeople. To increase the value and significance of the scheme Dalgety approached Oxford Assessment, an independent department of the University of Oxford, to help produce appropriate training and appraisal procedures for each sector of their business. Dalgety and Oxford Assessment believe that this is the first UK agricultural supply company to develop standards for its sales force and have them independently evaluated. Fifty Dalgety representatives are so far reported to have embarked on the scheme, encouraged no doubt by the promise of higher salaries and bigger perks on successful completion. But the benefits do not stop there, according to Mr Don Phillips, the company's sales and marketing director, He claims that his salespeople are showing signs of greater job satisfaction because their competence is being recognised by factors other than just sales turnover. He is convinced this will lead to better penetration of the market and bigger sales for Dalgety - both of which he regards as are vital to his company's future prosperity. Mr Phillips predicts that British agriculture will soon be unable to support even the present depleted number of salesmen serving it and that half the jobs which exist today will disappear over the next few years. Free advice for farmers is becoming a rarity as even the government's previously complementary advisory service goes commercial and the Dalgety initiative is therefore timely. Many farmers are having to do an increasing amount of the physical work on their holdings themselves, often single-handedly, and simply do not have the time or the energy to keep fully up to date with the mass of EC regulations and new technical information affecting their livelihood. Any salesman who can short circuit and interpret some of the paperwork helping his customers to stay the right side of both the law and the subsidy maze of the Common Agriculture Policy, while producing better crops or livestock will be welcome on many farms. Supplies purchased from the same salesmen will cost a little extra. But I would be surprised if other supply companies did not think it worthwhile to follow Dalgety's lead. As farmers' lives become steadily more complicated and specialised knowledge becomes more vital, as other sources of information dry up, many farmers are looking for expert advice. The fact that help from a supplier may not always be entirely independent will be overlooked if the quality of the counsel is basically sound. Even farmers know there is no such thing as a free lunch.</p>

Minister  Qian also heads the Preliminary Working Committee of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region.    In the meeting, the foreign minister said there is no  question that the policy of having two systems in one nation  will prove valid for Hong Kong. He predicted all targets  provided in the Basic Law on the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region will be achieved by all means, and Hong  Kong after 1997 will be more prosperous and developed than it is  now.    Foreign Minister Qian said the sessions of the NPC and the  CPPCC this year were held in an amicable atmosphere as a result  of the fact that China's reform and open-door policy has been  very effective in boosting the national economy and in  stabilizing society and the people's lives. The day before the  opening of the second session of the Eighth NPC, the UK  authorities in Hong Kong turned over the second part of Governor  General Patten's so-called Political Reform Bill to the  Legislative Council for deliberations. This is another UK action  aimed at breaking up PRC-UK cooperation. The UK likes to mouth  the word cooperation, but what the country is doing with respect  to the Hong Kong issue goes completely against what it says. He  said, therefore, China will not entertain itself with  unrealistic illusions any more.    Minister Qian said that with the PRC-UK talks forthcoming  China had foreseen this. He recalls when he met with Douglas  Hurd, UK secretary of state for foreign and Commonwealth  affairs, in New York last October, he told the latter that at  the PRC-UK talks there can come to only one of the two choices  -- one is to come up with an agreement at the talks that will  enable the political structural framework, which is born from  elections conducted from 1994 to 1995, to continue after 1997;  and the other is to fail to arrive at an agreement and the  political structural framework created unilaterally by elections  conducted by the Hong Kong authorities will be terminated on 30  June 1997.    He added that China should secure the orderly transfer and  long-lasting prosperity of Hong Kong in cooperation with many  Hong Kong residents who love the fatherland and Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Turbulence plagues Air France rescue plan: Subsidy bid becomes test of French lobbying power in Brussels Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, has won support from his 40,000-strong workforce for his rescue plan. Now comes the hard part: how to coax the European Commission into approving a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.32bn) capital injection for the loss-making national carrier. The Air France rescue plan is one of several billion dollar French state aid cases before the Commission this year, including Groupe Bull, the computer group, and Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned banking group. All provide a test of France's lobbying power in Brussels. France has long enjoyed a reputation for being able to make the Commission bureaucracy dance to its own tune. French diplomats have occupied strategic posts ever since the foundation of the European Community. France can also draw on a network of skilled operators inserted during the 10-year rule of Mr Jacques Delors, the French-born president of the European Commission, which is now drawing to a close. Yet high-powered French lobbying is often used to compensate for French political weaknesses at home. The Air France case fits this pattern. What makes it so important is that it has become a symbol of Mr Edouard Balladur's reluctance to reform the public sector when confronted with protests from trade unions and other pressure groups. Put simply, this is a foreign battle which is too important for Mr Balladur to lose. The government's climbdown at Air France last October in the face of violent strikes set a precedent which was repeated in a fishermen's dispute in February. Mr Balladur compounded the impression of vacillation by retreating over plans to cut the minimum wage for apprentices below the age of 26 - a move aimed at pricing young people into work which foundered on student protests. The campaign on behalf of Air France is a mixture of charm, bluff and, some say, political blackmail. As an opening shot, Paris has presented the rescue plan as a victory for common sense, a triumph for Mr Blanc's gamble on a company-wide referendum. The implicit argument is that the Commission would risk serious labour unrest if it were unwise enough to reject the plan. The French used the same argument to extract concessions in the Gatt trade talks last December, repeating the point with equal effect last February when it persuaded Brussels to extend minimum import prices for fish. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, reinforced the message by threatening to block Norway's entry into the European Union unless the Commission took action. More specifically, the French insist that the proposed capital increase for Air France will be the last time it dips into the public coffers for the national carrier. This sentiment is in line with the recommendation of the Commission-sponsored 'wise men's' report on European airlines; but private carriers such as British Airways treat the claim warily in the light of the four capital injections, amounting to FFr8.5bn, which Air France has received since June 1991. Moreover, the French government remains philosophically opposed to the 'wise men's' recommendations for further airline deregulation. 'The report is a brilliant intellectual exercise but forgets reality,' said Mr Bernard Bosson, French transport minister. Last week France flatly refused to accept a Commission report calling for an opening of Orly airport to private competition such as TAT, which is 49 per cent owned by British Airways. French officials say, however, that they are encouraged by the European Commission's favourable response to a request for FFr7bn in state aid for Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer company; but serious hurdles remain to the capital injection. Mr Abel Matutes, the outgoing EU transport commissioner, has linked approval to the plan to increased access to the French airline market. British Airways and other carriers in favour of more liberalisation argue that the FFr20bn capital injection will allow Air France to maintain operations in unprofitable routes and reduce access to rivals. BA has told the Commission that the restructuring plan is thin on credibility. The 5,000 job cuts and the three-year salary and promotion freeze appear, at best, a bare minimum - a contrast with the steps taken in the early 1980s to prepare BA for privatisation: the abandonment of 16 international routes, disposal of property and aircraft, and the reduction of staff from 50,000 in 1980 to 39,000 in 1986. Unlike the cases of other French state-owned groups, the opposition of foreign rivals is a serious obstacle. Moreover Air France cannot rely on Commission goodwill linked to future privatisation plans - an argument which helped Groupe Bull. 'The privatisation of Air France is not the order of the day,' said Mr Bosson. Despite these obstacles, industry observers believe the capital injection will be approved - albeit in scaled-down form, with conditions attached. Industry observers believe the Commission set an important precedent with its recent decision to attach conditions to approval of state aid to Aer Lingus, the Irish national carrier. 'These could be built on with Air France,' says one expert in Brussels. A Commission decision is expected in the late summer. Approval of the Air France plan would be a victory for Mr Balladur, a triumph of political expediency; but it would not be proof that France always wins the day in Brussels, argues a senior Commission official. 'France often receives less than first meets the eye,' he says. Thus, in the Gatt trade talks, French demands for revision of the Blair House accord limiting farm export subsidies was largely cosmetic; in the ERM crisis last August, French requests for the D-Mark to leave the system were rejected, and the final solution of 15 per cent fluctuation bands with no more intervention obligations for the Bundesbank was a victory for Germany. The French realise too late that what they regard as an obvious truth is not shared by anybody else, and so they find themselves in a minority, says the senior official. Yet the French somehow always manage to extricate themselves from the hole which they have dug for themselves. By contrast, the British take an almost perverse delight in being isolated, as shown during the recent row over EU voting rights. A British opponent of the Air France state aid request notes ruefully that the UK could learn some lessons from the French government in the Brussels power-game.</p>

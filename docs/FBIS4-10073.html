			<p>BFN     [Text] After lengthy talks, government officials and coca  growers leaders at 2230 last night signed a five-point agreement  to end the wave of violence that affected the Cochabamba  tropical region as a result of the forceful eradication of coca  plantations.    Signing the agreement for the government were Foreign  Minister Antonio Aranibar, Government Minister German Quiroga,  Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters, and Sustainable Development  Minister Jose Guillermo Justiniano. The other side was  represented by leaders of peasant organizations and coca growers  led by the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB). The agreement was  signed after lengthy talks that were at one time almost broken  due to the intransigence of both sides.    The agreement, which was described as successful by the  peasant leaders, begins by stating that government and labor  leaders are committed to jointly fighting the drug trade.    The second point focuses on the government's commitment to  refrain from further forced eradication of coca plantations and,  to this effect, agrees to issue within 15 days a ministerial  resolution containing pertinent instructions to the appropriate  organizations.    The next point recognizes the government's commitment to  continue "to search for and to destroy maceration pits and/or  laboratories, without destroying adjacent coca plantations."    The fourth point caused the most conflict, to the point of  having threatened to cause an impasse in the talks. It states:  "The government and coca grower leaders will participate in the  implementation of the provisions of Articles 10, 14, and 24 of  Law 1008. The government vows to implement the Alternative  Development Program jointly with coca growers leaders."    The fifth and final point provides for the creation of joint  commissions to address all problems concerning production,  marketing, processing, alternative development, and the legal  and institutional aspects concerning coca production.    Following the signing of the agreement, government officials  and leaders of peasant organizations expressed their  satisfaction over the outcome of their talks. Foreign Minister  Aranibar announced that the government yielded on the  controversial fourth point "to safeguard social peace and  because the fight against the drug trade must be waged within a  framework of respect for the people and for the country."    Evo Morales, leader of the coca growers, described the  agreement as "a major step forward" in the defense of coca,  which is the only source of income for the peasants of  Cochabamba and said that the task remaining now is to implement  alternative development as a condition for replacing the surplus  coca production.</p>

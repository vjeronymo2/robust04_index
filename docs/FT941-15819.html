			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Car groups gamble on playing the right card - Ford and GM's latest financial ventures may just be the first step Last month's launch of the Ford Barclaycard was a direct response to the arrival of the GM Card from Vauxhall in October: both bear witness to the fiercely competitive nature of the world car market. Overcapacity is forcing manufacturers to concentrate on how to retain the loyalty of existing customers, while seeking to add whatever incremental sales they can. The initiatives are of interest beyond the car industry not least because they offer contrasting perspectives on branding. The Ford Barclaycard, for instance, brings together two of the best-known brands in the UK. Ford is the market leader for new cars and its share of the UK car registrations market was 21.7 per cent for the first 11 months of 1993. Similarly, Barclaycard is the market leader in the UK credit card market with some 8.9m cards on issue out of a total of 27m bank and building society credit cards in the country. By contrast, the GM Card from Vauxhall, issued by HFC Bank, brings together two lesser-known brands, one indeed largely unfamiliar to UK consumers. General Motors' branding policy has run counter to Ford in that, outside the US, it has employed sub-brands reflecting its approach to different markets. Examples include Vauxhall in the UK, Opel in Germany and Holden in Australia. To build upon the success of the card in the US, while trading on the local brand, the GM Card from Vauxhall attempts to promote both brands, as well as laying the groundwork for future ventures such as perhaps a GM Card from Opel. In the US, GM's card was issued by Household International, whose subsidiary in the UK is known as HFC Bank. In spite of its 150 personal banking centres HFC is not a well-known financial services brand, and hence most of the advertising has prominently featured the GM brand and played down HFC's involvement. Of course, it could be argued that, in the GM and HFC case at least, both partners know who is calling the shots and whose brand will prevail, while for Ford and Barclaycard it is more a battle of the giants to see who gets top billing. It could yet end in tears. For both cards, heavy promotional activity is essential. If they do not get their critical mass of cardholders in the first year, it is unlikely that they will do so subsequently. Switching between credit card issuers is not common among UK consumers, with most credit cards perceived as part of the package of financial services that individuals take from their primary account, be that a bank or building society. With 27m cards on issue already and credit scoring procedures rigorous in the attempt to combat fraud, the UK credit card market is already pretty saturated. The GM Card is available from mid-January and the Ford Barclaycard from April 1 1994. GM's target is thought to be at least half a million cards while the Ford Barclaycard is designed to add a quarter of a million cards to the existing portfolio. Other car manufacturers - Audi, Peugeot Citroen and Rover, for instance - are unlikely to allow these card schemes to take business from them, and other goods and services suppliers may also enter the added-value credit card market. There is only room in the market for limited numbers of rebate-based credit cards, as the very fact that the rebates are based on usage encourages the cardholder to concentrate spending on one card only. How, then, will those who choose not to enter this market (or who fail in their attempt) seek to compete with the rebates being built up by cardholders seemingly loyal to their chosen credit card sponsor? Will any of them be bold enough to follow the example of some of the grocery multiples such as Tesco and accept for redemption the coupons (rebates) offered by competitors? In such a scenario, proof of rebate earned could be accepted in some proportion by a competitor and used as a spoiling tactic against those relying on card-based loyalty. Such tactics would, however, not necessarily invalidate the strategy behind the new added-value credit cards. What GM and Ford are doing is coming to terms with the three Rs of survival in the 1990s: Retention of existing customers, Recruitment wherever possible of new customers, and Relationship-building with all customers. The new credit cards will aid retention and recruitment, but equally importantly they provide the means to circumvent the independent dealer network and hence build relationships between manufacturer and customer. A credit card application is a perfect opportunity for the card sponsor to understand more about the potential customer. to understand more about each other. In addition, the car manufacturers will presumably want to go beyond selling their products to financing the sale and supplying insurance and warranty products. In this way, not only are GM and Ford after the profitability that comes from a credit card, but they are seeking to gain ground from the more traditional financial institutions.

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Bank treasurer says he saw no sign of dishonesty THE treasurer of NatWest Investment Bank saw nothing fraudulent in County NatWest and Phillips &amp; Drew buying Blue Arrow shares in the 1987 rights issue, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday, writes John Mason. Mr John Owen, a prosecution witness, said he had seen no evidence of any dishonesty in County NatWest and P&amp;D buying shares in the Pounds 837m rights issue. He agreed with Mr Jeremy Roberts, QC for Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County chief executive and one of the defendants, that he believed full legal advice had been taken. Cross-examined by Mr Roy Amlot, QC for Mr Alan Keat of Travers Smith Braithwaite, the firm of solicitors which advised County, Mr Owen agreed nobody had told him the legal advice given was of a general nature and had been taken before the issue, not at the time of its closure. Later, he told Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, prosecuting, that the markets would not have expected holdings of that nature. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the issue. The trial continues today.

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / UK Company News: Consultants take helm at Queens Moat QUEENS MOAT HOUSES has appointed two senior consultants to help run the embattled hotel group. They will take over the main duties of the deputy chairman and finance director, both of whom were suspended two weeks ago as part of the inquiry into the group's finances. The appointments, made at the behest of the group's bankers, will reinforce calls from Queens Moat's creditors and shareholders for a new management team to be appointed before trading resumes in the company's shares. The listing was suspended on March 31. The two consultants, whose names are not yet being revealed, will strengthen the investigating team, which is headed by accountants Grant Thornton and was sent in by bank lenders to ascertain the state of the company's finances. They will make a preliminary report within the next few weeks. A deterioration in Queens Moat's fortunes is believed to have reduced an expected Pounds 80m profit for 1992 to losses of up to Pounds 80m. The consultants, specialists in rescuing companies in difficulty, will not sit on the board but will fill the gap while a new chief executive is sought. The suspension of Mr Martin Marcus, the deputy chairman, and Mr David Hersey, the finance director, came two days after the shares were suspended on the London Stock Exchange. Mr Marcus sold half his shares to fulfil personal obligations on the day prior to its closed period. An inquiry into Queens Moat's share dealings has recently been completed by the London Stock Exchange, but no decision has yet been taken on further action. Meanwhile, reports over the weekend of a row between UK and German banks over the holding of Queens Moat deposits were being played down by both the company and leading UK banks.</p>

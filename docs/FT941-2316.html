			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Talks consider protection for Arabs Talks continued late yesterday between Palestinian and Israeli officials about measures to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories, but Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said they expected the discussions to adjourn without a solution to the row which has stalled resumption of full peace talks between the two sides. Mr Dennis Ross, the US Middle East peace envoy, arrived in Tunis for the second time in a week to join the talks. He described only as 'useful' an early session with Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. Mr Ross is expected to continue his shuttle with stops today in Jordan and Egypt - where he will meet President Hosni Mubarak. However, PLO officials in Tunis said they did not expect Mr Ross to be carrying a solution to the dispute about protection of Palestinians in the occupied territories which has stalled resumption of full PLO-Israeli talks since the Hebron massacre more than three weeks ago. The PLO has insisted that Israel must toughen its control of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories and accept the UN call, made in resolution 904 last week, to install an international presence to safeguard Palestinian security in the occupied territories. The PLO leadership has said it cannot otherwise resume full peace talks with Israel. PLO officials said the Israeli delegation in Tunis, led by Mr Uri Savir, had rejected a call to remove Jewish settlers from the centre of Hebron and had instead proposed gathering all the settlers together in Hebron as a means of increasing control over them. This suggestion was dismissed by one PLO official as 'unacceptable'. PLO officials in Tunis said both sides were nevertheless exchanging ideas, but that 'nothing has crystalised yet'. The officials said they did not expect the Tunis talks to continue into today. 'We have a long way to go before we can resolve this,' said one.</p>

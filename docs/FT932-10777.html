			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Business failures fall sharply FURTHER EVIDENCE of a fall in business failures emerged yesterday with the publication of figures showing that the number of receiverships and administration orders dropped substantially last month. Receivers or administrators were appointed at 255 companies in April compared with 409 in March, according to the London and Edinburgh Gazettes, the court publications, analysed by accountants Touche Ross. The figure is the lowest since the 325 reported in December 1989 and compares with 389 in April last year, providing further evidence that the worst of the recession may be over. Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross, said he was optimistic that the trend would be maintained. He said he was surprised at the decline, as conventional wisdom suggests that the number of failures does not start to decline until about 18 months after the the beginning of recovery. The delay is explained in particular by the tendency for companies to 'over-trade' by taking new orders without sufficient cash to finance their debts. Banks are also traditionally reluctant to grant new loans. Mr Morris said the decline might reflect an unexpected healthiness in the state of British business. So far this year most regions have reported similar rates of receivership and administration appointments to the levels in the same period last year. Most property lenders do not believe that the insolvency profession provides value for money, according to a survey by Chesterton, the chartered surveyors. Almost two thirds of the 60 financial institutions questioned said they had not received good value from the insolvency industry. Some lenders were also dissatisfied with the service provided by receivers and administrators. Just over one in five respondents described the service from insolvency practioners as poor, while 44 per cent described it as fair and 30 per cent as good.</p>

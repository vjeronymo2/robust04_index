			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Thames Water hit by Pounds 25m charge THAMES Water yesterday surprised the market with lower than expected interim profits, depressed by Pounds 25m of charges to cover two long-standing contractual disputes. The group, which had brought the announcement forward by a week, reported a 10 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 112m for the six months to September 30. Excluding the provisions, profits were 10 per cent up on sales of Pounds 539m, a 7 per cent advance. While the market was surprised by the charges, marking the shares down 13p to 561p, analysts warned against taking them out of context in a company with sales of Pounds 539m. 'The core business is excellent,' said one analyst. 'Today's shenanigans have masked that.' Next week's review of pricing in the water sector by Ofwat, the industry regulator, would be more crucial for the market. The charges, a small proportion of which applied to restructuring in the US, are believed to cover two water treatment plants in Egypt. Thames acquired the contracts when it purchased PWT in 1989 as part of its diversification away from regulated utilities. Mr Mike Hoffman, chief executive, admitted that PWT's contract management had been deficient. About six employees had since left the company. Mr Hoffman was unapologetic about Thames's diversification strategy, on which it had spent some Pounds 120m. 'If we had sat back and stayed with utilities we would be heroes,' he said, 'but there would be no growth. This is for the longer term.' During the half-year, Thames cut Pounds 2m in staff costs helping utilities show an 18 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 159m, on sales 9 per cent higher at Pounds 432m. However, the non-regulated activities were less buoyant. Contracting and international businesses incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 29m, after the Pounds 25m charge, partly due to tough trading in Germany and the US. Products and services slid to a Pounds 1.8m loss from a Pounds 400,000 profit, while environmental services lost Pounds 300,000. Property and insurance profits rose from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.8m. Earnings per share fell 11 per cent to 26.8p. The dividend was increased 7 per cent to 7.4p. Lex, Page 18</p>

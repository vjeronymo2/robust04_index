			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Competition): When small means Fledgling - Next month sees the launch of a new FT-SE-A share price index The new FT-SE Actuaries Fledgling index, to be launched on January 3, has been established because of increasing interest by fund managers and individual investors in the very small companies sector. It will cover companies too small to be included in the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share index, the main benchmark for assessing UK portfolio performance. This, from the start of January, will cover around 920 of the largest and most actively-traded British stocks, each with a minimum market capitalisation of Pounds 40m. The All-Share covers roughly 98.2 per cent of the UK equity market by value. The Fledgling index will encompass 800 companies, both with full listings on the London Stock Exchange and on the Unlisted Securities Market, but will cover just 1.8 per cent of the UK market, including investment trusts. Investor interest in very small companies has been underlined by the recent launch of two other indices covering this end of the market, both devised by two professors at the London Business School, Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh. One is the Hoare Govett 1,000 index, which started formally in August although it was calculated from January 1993. This contains the bottom 2.5 per cent of the UK equity market, including investment trusts. At the start of this year, none of its 1,000 constituents had a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 51m. The other is Gartmore's MicroCap index, unveiled last month, which covers the smallest 1 per cent of the market and gave its 676 constituents a maximum market capitalisation of Pounds 28.7m at the start of this year. It excludes investment trusts; the Fledgling and HG 1,000 are calculated both with and without trusts. Hoare Govett and Gartmore recently launched investment trusts which aim to track the performance of their indices. The Gartmore new issue offer closes on Tuesday. Other fund managers may decide to establish products based on the FT-SE-A Fledgling. So, why is there increased interest in this segment of the market? What are the investment hazards? And what distinguishes the various indices? The vogue for the sector stems in no small part from statistical research into the so-called 'back history' of small stock indices. This reconstructs their performance over the past few decades (assuming they existed then). It indicates that, over long periods, these indices have outperformed the larger UK equity market substantially. The HG 1,000 produced an annualised return of more than 21 per cent from 1955 to 1993 (assuming re-investment of gross income) compared with 14.5 per cent for the FT-SE-A All Share, while Gartmore's MicroCap produced 22 per cent. This year, too, the sector has produced better returns than the wider market. The MicroCap, for example, returned about 4.7 per cent in the first 11 months of the year, outperforming the All-Share by around 11 per cent. There have, however, been periods - often around recessions - when small cap stocks have underperformed the wider market, such as in the early 1980s and between 1989 and 1993 (see chart). Moreover, whatever the past performance of these indices, history is no sure guide to future success and investment in the very small company sector carries some significant risks. For while the indices will include some fast-growing stock market stars of tomorrow, they will also be home to many burnt-out cases. The danger of insolvency is higher at this end of the market. Small company share prices are also particularly volatile, due partly to a lack of liquidity in these stocks: there are not many shares in issue and many tend to be held in very few hands. It is not easy to buy or sell significant amounts of stock without moving the price against yourself. The Fledgling index differs from others covering small companies in two main ways. One is the percentage of the market covered. The other is its treatment of liquidity. Unlike the HG 1,000 and the MicroCap, it employs a screen to exclude stocks with poor liquidity. First, at least 25 per cent of a company's shares in issue must be available publicly for investment. That percentage is also a requirement for a company to get a full stock exchange listing, but the USM insists on only 10 per cent. This means some USM stocks will be omitted from the FT-SE-A index. Second, for inclusion in the Fledgling, a company's stock must have traded on at least 50 business days in the previous 12 months. Some investors are likely to be attracted by the Fledgling's use of liquidity screens, while others may prefer the more inclusive form of bottom-fishing offered by other indices.</p>

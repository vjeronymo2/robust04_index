Early this morning, President Castro spoke for four hours  with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio who arrived in Cuba  on an official visit. Castro said that trade relations with  Colombia are at their best level, adding: Our foreign minister  reiterated that President Cesar Gaviria's government is willing  to sell Cuba the oil it needs, as long as negotiations meet the  demands of Colombian oil authorities.    Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who accompanied  Colombian Foreign Minister Sanin de Rubio, emphasized the  changes made in Cuba's economy and said that the government will  encourage the necessary changes, as long as they respect its  autonomy, which, he said, is not negotiable.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Arab world opens arms for investment - The Emerging Investor For the emerging market investor looking for something slightly off-beat, a new country fund is due to be launched this week which, for the first time, will allow foreign equity investment in the Gulf. The Dollars 50m Oryx Fund in Oman is jointly managed by London-based Blakeney Management and the Oman National Insurance company in Muscat. It will have exclusive six month access to the Muscat securities market, which has 62 listed stocks, a market capitalisation of some Dollars 1.5bn and an annual turnover of about Dollars 200m. The fund will be listed in both Muscat and London, and while 51 per cent of the capital will be raised domestically in Oman through the Al Ahlia Portfolio company, the rest will be open to international investors through Baring Securities in the UK. Managers hope eventually to see the foreign portion of the fund raised and its scope expanded to include other markets in the region, such as Bahrain. The Arab world has been largely excluded from the wave of foreign funds flowing into stock markets of developing countries. Out of an estimated Dollars 52bn of cross border equity flows invested in emerging markets worldwide in 1993, the small bourses of the Middle East, north Africa, and the Gulf states attracted less than 2 per cent, according to Barings, compared to more than 38 per cent invested in Latin America and 58 per cent in the Pacific Rim. This, however, is set to change as projects like the Oryx Fund put the region under increasing scrutiny by emerging market investors. Spurred by favourable developments in the Middle East peace process and an increasing acceptance among Arab governments that barriers to foreign investment must be removed, international securities houses are showing considerable enthusiasm for the region's prospects. The market which has attracted most attention so far is Morocco. Having co-operated closely with the International Monetary Fund, the kingdom is virtually free of its debt burden and is undergoing rapid economic growth accompanied by low inflation. Last month Solomon Brothers Asset Management of the US launched the first Morocco country fund, worth Dollars 60m, in conjunction with Omnium Nord Africa, the Moroccan conglomerate. The fund is aimed at equity investments in listed stocks on the Casablanca exchange, which has a market capitalisation of about Dollars 4.4bn, 68 listed companies, and an average monthly turnover of Dollars 65m. It is well placed to take advantage of the kingdom's privatisation programme which began last summer and is by far the fastest in the region. The government aims to divest Dollars 2bn worth of state assets by the end of 1995, and so far all offerings in more than 50 companies have been oversubscribed by both local and international investors. Also in north Africa, Tunisia and Egypt are seen as offering similar opportunities to Morocco with a government commitment to IMF-guided liberalisation policies and a desire, albeit cautious, to attract foreign capital through privatisation. Currently their tiny stock markets are at pre-emerging, rather than emerging stages, with little in the way of scrip to be traded. Tunisia has a market capitalisation of only Dollars 1.2bn and 19 listed companies, while Egypt, misleadingly, has 674 stocks of which only about 15 are actively traded. However, capital market reforms have recently been put in place in both countries and international investors are waiting in anticipation for state assets to come up for sale. Further east, one of the most sophisticated and liquid capital markets in the region is Jordan. The Amman financial market is attracting a surprising level of outside interest despite the lack of any firm commitment from the government towards privatisation. It has a strong domestic base with about 100,000 local investors, far more than any other market in the region, and is well regulated. Buoyed by two successive years of strong real economic growth, sustained government commitment to IMF reforms and high domestic liquidity, the market peaked last year and has since levelled out. Average monthly turnover in 1994 is about Dollars 60m, compared to Dollars 110m in 1993. The exchange has 100 listed stocks and a market capitalisation of some Dollars 5.2bn. Elsewhere in the Middle East, the equity culture has yet to catch on, although it may only be a matter of time before it does so. Syria's government has been toying with the idea of a stock market as part of its self-administered economic reforms and a draft bill for its establishment is awaiting submission to the People's Assembly. The Palestinians, having only been granted limited self-rule this month, are now talking of establishing a bourse in the West Bank; and Lebanon's plans to re-open the Beirut stock exchange, which was closed in 1983 at the peak of its civil war, are finally ready for implementation. The successful Dollars 650m Arab-only share offering in Solidere, the company established to rebuild downtown Beirut, has created the basis upon which the Lebanese government will restart what many international brokers consider likely to be the Middle East's most promising market. Andersen Consultants in London has completed work on creating a secondary market in the Dollars 1.8bn company's shares and official trading is due to begin in June. Although shares in Solidere are closed to non-Arab investors, other private companies which are expected to come to the market will be totally open to foreigners. In anticipation of this, IFC - a Washington-based arm of the World Bank - is already talking of an investment fund for Lebanon which will be used for equity participation in small and medium-sized companies which will eventually be listed. And a number of leading international securities houses are already positioning themselves for business in Beirut. In the Gulf, Oman stands alone in allowing foreign investors access to its stock exchange, although Bahrain is currently looking at ways of easing its restrictions. The substantial stock market in Saudi Arabia, with a capitalisation of Dollars 50bn, along with the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, however, remain closed for the time being. But many analysts believe that depressed oil prices, diminishing state revenues and the need to attract foreign capital into non-oil industrial ventures will eventually spur an opening up. The World Bank forecasts regional economic growth in the Arab world over the next 10 years to be higher than at any time since the 1970s oil boom. In the period 1994-2003, real regional GDP will grow by a yearly average of 3.8 per cent, compared to only 0.4 per cent in the 1980s. Add to this the large sums of money held by Arabs outside the region which will be attracted home as stock markets develop - more than Dollars 350bn according to one analyst at the IFC - and the Arab world looks like an emerging market waiting to happen.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Friday   Week on week change Stock                         Country     close    Dollars      %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Banco Bradesco (Pfd)           Brazil    0.0148    0.0035     31.55 Petrobras (Pfd)                Brazil    0.0947    0.0198     26.36 Kordosa                        Turkey    0.2085    0.0335     19.16 Telecom Argentina           Argentina    6.6126    1.0370     18.60 Unggul Indah Corporation    Indonesia    3.1436    0.4725     17.69 Banco Galicia               Argentina    9.7185    1.4602     17.68 Banco Frances               Argentina   10.5701    1.5611     17.33 Sadia Concordia                Brazil    0.8393    0.1223     17.06 Kalba Farma                 Indonesia    7.3043    1.0600     16.98 Aracruz Celulose (Pfd)         Brazil    1.9183    0.2758     16.79  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

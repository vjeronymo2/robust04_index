			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- The majority of South  Koreans give a favorable assessment of President Kim Yong-sam's  first year in office, but his approval rating has still slumped  to around 50 percent from over 80 percent on the 100th day of  his presidency last June, according to polls conducted Thursday  by major vernacular newspapers to mark Kim's first anniversary.    A plurality say that Kim's top accomplishments were the  implementation of the real-name financial system and his reform  campaign, while criticizing his failure to stabilize prices and  hammer out appropriate agricultural measures in the wake of the  Uruguay Round accord. A large number believe Kim's  determination to achieve reform has weakened from his early days  in office.    Compared with 80.8 percent last June, just 50.1 percent  applauded Kim's management of state affairs over the past year  with 12.5 percent saying he did very well, according to a  telephone poll by the TONG-A ILBO. His greatest achievement was  hailed as the real-name system (70.5 percent), followed by the  anti-corruption and discipline campaign (54.9 percent), military  reform (54 percent) and improvement of public services (43  percent).    Price stability was widely cited as Kim's top failure (87.6  percent), trailed by agriculture policy (59.5 percent),  revitalization of the economy (51.6 percent), environmental  protection (38.4 percent) and anti-crime measures (37.5  percent), according to the TONG-A poll. Some 69 percent say  they hope to see the Kim administration do better in improving  the economy, with 49.1 percent calling for price stability.    In the same vein, 40.4 percent think the economy has  worsened, four times the 10.1 percent of last June.    Assessing Kim's determination to carry out reform, 44.7  percent said it has weakened while 49 percent said the president  remained equally steadfast.    Kim claimed a better approval rating of 62.3 percent in the  poll by the CHUNGANG daily news, but that was still below the  83.6 percent recorded last June. While a plurality voiced  satisfaction with Kim's first year, 44 percent answered  negatively in assessing the accomplishments of his reform  policy, compared with a 42.6-percent positive response.    Kim's government failed again at attaining price stability  (59.2 percent) in CHUNGANG's telephone poll, while a majority  said the attitude of politicans and public servants had  improved. But most were disappointed in the economy and  inter-Korean relations.    Some 38 percent felt the president did well during his first  year in office, while 16 percent said the opposite in a poll of  1,200 men and women across the nation conducted by the  KYONGHYANG daily news. However, 46 percent answered that Kim did  just so-so. His greatest feat was implementation of the  real-name system (51.3 percent) followed by revision of the  public servants' ethics law (21.6 percent). Spiraling prices  again ranked as Kim's worst failure, followed by the decision to  open the rice market (23.8 percent) and the economy's lack of  improvement (12.1 percent).    Meanwhile, 39.7 percent said Kim's reform policy did little  to improve their everyday lives while 17.4 percent thought the  opposite. A total of 46.8 percent said the economy was no  better than last year while 25.8 percent said it has grown worse.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> PUBLIC HAD ITS CHANCE TO NAME CENTER  </P> <P> A man stood to speak at the second public forum of the Martin Luther King  Tribute Advisory Board. His demeanor and dress were forbidding. He had a slight  resemblance to Adolf Hitler, or maybe Charlie Chaplin, but, judging from his  intense glare, he wasn't here to entertain us with pratfalls.  </P> <P> King was a womanizer, he told us. He was also a Communist. The speaker had no  whit of reliable evidence to support his claims, and he could barely conceal  his hatred for blacks as he spoke. King did not deserve to be honored, he said;  King was a disgrace to the United States of America.  </P> <P> I haven't been able to forget that man. I thought of him during all the  subsequent meetings the board held.  </P> <P> As the attendance at the eight public meetings dwindled, I wondered about the  viability of our task. We had to recommend a suitable tribute for the Rev. Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr., a man who, even after death, engenders passions of  antipathy and reverence. But the city seemed stricken by a civic anemia: Even  after the bitter fight over Market Street/King Way, few people came forward to  offer a better idea.  </P> <P> Where, I wondered, were all the people who said: "I'm not a racist. King  deserves to be honored, but the City Council tried to sneak the street name  change past us"? Where were these people who, a few months before, were so  eager to participate in finding a tribute for the martyred civil rights leader?  </P> <P> I thought of that angry man, and I wondered if there was any difference between  him and the people who vehemently opposed King Way. Their absence from our  meetings seemed to lend credence to claims that their opposition was motivated  by racism.  </P> <P> I wondered how these people, or people like them, would respond to our final  recommendation? The brilliance of our tribute decision, I hoped, would outshine  the glare of any opposition lit by ignorance.  </P> <P> I was naive.  </P> <P> Ignorance can design sly ways to disguise itself as wisdom.  </P> <P> Some people have said the convention center already has a name and that  changing it would go against the tribute advisory board's own stated goals;  some people claim that affixing King's name to the convention center will  lessen San Diego's identity with the building; other people say that naming the  convention center in honor of King will make it harder to market the building  worldwide. And, most ludicrous of all, a few people allege that the citizens of  San Diego haven't had a chance to give their input.  </P> <P> The last argument against the tribute relates nicely to the first one. What  citizen input was there in the first place when the name San Diego Convention  Center was selected? I don't remember any. Maybe there was, but it wasn't  publicized sufficiently. That is one of the same arguments the pro-Market  Street people used, isn't it? At best, San Diego Convention Center is only a  working title.  </P> <P> The most insulting arguments against the San Diego Martin Luther King  Convention Center dwell in the gritty world of economics. What are people  telling us about themselves, about their prejudices, when they say King's name  will drive away business? (As if money is more important than a community's  dignity.)  </P> <P> King's name on the building will not obscure San Diego. His name will  illuminate it. It saddens me to hear our business leaders whine about the  horrible injustice they will suffer if King's name is emblazoned on the  convention center. How will the name of a man who preached against violence and  hatred hurt business?  </P> <P> By naming the convention center after the Martin Luther King, we are telling  the world that we are a community of peace, love and equality. The name will  advertise to all who come here for their car shows and sales meetings that we  believe in the values espoused by King. When people in Singapore talk about  that wonderful city in California, somebody in the group will comment that he  or she "felt marvelously welcome in San Diego." The spirit of the man will  radiate throughout the building -- if we allow it, if we welcome it.  </P> <P> The San Diego Unified Port District should not let this opportunity slip away.  The commissioners should ignore the plaintive cries of those who had a chance  to express their opinions to the advisory board but chose to remain silent, and  name the convention center for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. By doing so, not  only do they honor King, they honor San Diego.  </P></p>

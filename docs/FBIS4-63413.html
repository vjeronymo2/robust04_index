			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BIZNES-TASS report: "Ministry of Foreign Economic </F> Relations May Merge With Ministry of the Economy"]    [Text] All economic policy should be coordinated from one  center, which could be the Russian Federation Ministry of the  Economy. So said Yevgeniy Yasin, leader of the Russian  Federation Presidential Staff Analysis Center, in an exclusive  interview for a BIZNES-TASS correspondent.    What would the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations do,  given that there are no state foreign economic associations? It  would be expected to work out customs tarrifs, foreign economic  regulation, and so on. But these instruments also constitute  highly important instruments of structural policy.    "So it is that, from my viewpoint, the concentration of  forces in the Ministry of the Economy is the sensible option for  the purposes of hammering out a uniform economic policy. There  are a number of new people right now who think rationally and  who are capable of taking decisions which would be useful to the  country," Yevgeniy Yasin concluded.</p>

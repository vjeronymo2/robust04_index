			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB TO BE UPGRADED  </P> <P> The Hueneme school board has hired an Agoura electronics firm to upgrade the  computerized teaching laboratory at Larsen School, making it the most  sophisticated of the learning labs in its nine elementary schools.  </P> <P> At its Monday night meeting, the board awarded Sota Electronics a $295,519  contract to improve the elementary school's computerized learning center, known  as the World Institute for Computer Assisted Teaching lab.  </P> <P> Don Cody, administrative assistant for the school district, said the  improvements should be completed this fall. The cost of the computer upgrade  will be picked up by funds from the state lottery.  </P> <P> Computer equipment at the 719-student Larsen School is the oldest of the  district's elementary schools, Cody said. The computer lab is slated for  upgrade to a first-generation Smart Classroom, a watered-down version of the  technology-based education labs operating at the district's two junior high  schools.  </P> <P> "Obviously our staff is excited," Principal Cruz Earls said. "We don't want to  be just a computer lab. We want to go beyond to where we facilitate the  children's imagination."  </P> <P> Cody said the district is scheduled to enter into an agreement immediately so  Sota can get to work updating the 8-year-old computer equipment. The new lab  will feature color monitors, faster software programs and a management system  able to handle more students at one time while keeping track of their scores  and lessons.

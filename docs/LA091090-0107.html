			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HISTORICAL HILARITY IN 'CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA';  </P> <P> THE LAGUNA PLAYHOUSE KICKS OFF ITS 71ST SEASON WITH GEORGE BERNARD SHAW'S  COMEDY.  </P> <P> Though George Bernard Shaw did not intend "Caesar and Cleopatra" to be played  as a historical comedy bordering on a Hollywood sendup, he certainly knew how  to write a running gag worthy of the Borscht Belt.  </P> <P> The gag has to do with Caesar's inability to pronounce the name of Cleopatra's  royal nurse, Ftatateeta, a tongue twister not unsuited to her nature. Shaw has  Caesar calling her everything from Totateeta to Tfatafeeta and -- in an insult  reflecting both his lingual exasperation and the wish to deflate her sinister  self-importance -- just plain Tota.  </P> <P> At the Moulton Theatre, where "Caesar and Cleopatra" opened the Laguna  Playhouse's 71st season over the weekend, Douglas Rowe, as Caesar, certainly  knows how to milk that gag. In the finest Jack Benny tradition, Rowe commands  the royal nurse to do his bidding with silly names like Tototitty, Tittytata  and -- in the most cutting deadpan of all -- Toto, an apt irony refering to  Dorothy's innocent little dog in "The Wizard of Oz."  </P> <P> Shaw might have cringed at the liberties taken with his text, but that is not  the point. The point is that this lavishly mounted, warmly lit, handsomely  costumed Laguna production treats the play from beginning to end with a certain  lightness of touch that can be suggestively illuminating. The  sometimes-very-funny results have a salubrious effect perhaps not as distant  from Shaw's original intent as might be presumed.  </P> <P> After all, "Caesar and Cleopatra" was meant to bring the title characters back  to earth from the pretentious heights of what Shaw called Sardoodledom and  Bardolatry, to which they'd been elevated by a 19th-Century theatrical  tradition that he abhored. Both Caesar and Cleopatra land on the Moulton stage  without benefit of parachutes, but also without archaic conceits that might  have crippled the revival of a 91-year-old play.  </P> <P> The 19th-Century tradition Shaw sought to demolish -- now long since forgotten,  in great part because of his success -- had thrived on pomp and ceremony fueled  by the artificial melodramas of fashionable playwrights such as Victorien  Sardou -- who drew overblown stage portraits of historical figures from  Napoleon to Cleopatra -- and by an abundance of worshipful Shakespearean  pageants, including such favorites as "Julius Caesar" and "Antony and  Cleopatra."  </P> <P> As an antidote, Shaw chose to write history as comedy. He exalted a  middle-aged, common-sense Caesar whose greatness resides in pragmatic  experience modified, but not stymied, by moral compunctions. He is a man of  honor, nonetheless, who confounds even his closest aides with ideas of  clemency. The greatest of Shaw's early dramatic portraits, this Caesar is an  incipient "superman" representing intellectual achievement translated into  effective action.  </P> <P> As for Cleopatra, she is depicted as a gullible teen-ager whose bid for the  Egyptian throne is transformed from petulant wish to subtler calculation under  Caesar's tutelage. Not that Caesar ever manages to instill in her any of his  moral principles. Nor does he ever come to trust her. In Shaw's scheme of  things, even an incomplete version of the "new woman" must be given wide berth  by a man who epitomizes the height of human achievement.  </P> <P> But Caesar does find Cleopatra useful. And amusing. Though she frequently  wounds his masculine vanity with another of the play's running jokes -- this  one about Caesar's middle-aged decrepitude -- he winks toward future history  like an indulgent father and promises to send Mark Antony to Egypt to satisfy  her youthful craving for a Roman general with muscles.  </P> <P> The play eschews the slightest hint of a romantic relationship between Caesar  and Cleopatra, a point that Shaw insisted upon. Yet if any single moment can be  said to encapsulate the comic concept of this production, it is the instant  when they bid each other farewell with a passionate kiss that leaves Caesar  weak-kneed and wobbly.  </P> <P> Rowe, who has chosen to play Caesar with so little inflection as to seem  colorless most of the time, here tosses off the priceless gesture of a man  conked over the head. You can almost see the stars. In fact, it makes you wish  the rest of Rowe's down-to-earth performance had an injection of the very sort  of heightened theatricality that he apparently has gone out of his way to  avoid.  </P> <P> Lillian Helm plays Cleopatra with a lusty simplicity. As for the rest of the  large cast, they acquit themselves nicely. The best supporting performance is  turned in by David William Carr, who gives a very natural account of  Apollodorus. Others worth noting are Jerry Newman's Pothinus, Josephine Black's  Ftatateeta, John Huntington's Britannus, Bryan Burnes' Rufio and Anthony  Ramirez's Lucius Achillas.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the physical production meets the playhouse's usually high standard.  Robert L. Smith has devised a lavish Egyptian setting that simulates rough-hewn  marble and bathes it in lambent lighting. Karen J. Weller's costumes are an  equivalent eyeful. And David Edwards' sound design is better than usual.  </P> <P> 'CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA'  </P> <P> A Laguna Playhouse production. Written by George Bernard Shaw. Directed by  Marthella Randall.

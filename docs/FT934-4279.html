			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Barclays acquire Southend Property stake The Barclay brothers, the reclusive property developers and publishing entrepreneurs, have taken a 12.4 per cent stake in Southend Property in part payment for one of their investment vehicles. Twins Mr Frederick and Mr David Barclay have agreed to sell Trenport Properties, a wholly-owned subsidiary of their Ellerman Investments company, to Southend for Pounds 31m. Southend said yesterday that the Barclays were taking 13.3m new ordinary shares of 5p each, while the remainder of the purchase price would be met with Pounds 12m in cash and Pounds 7m from the issue of Pounds 6.19m of convertible unsecured loan stock. Mr Michael Hickey of Paribas, the brokers overseeing the transaction, said negotiations with the Monaco-based Barclays began last summer in the south of France, where Southend chairman Mr Malcolm Dagul owns a property. The Barclays are thought to have been seeking a buyer for some time for Trenport, which they bought for an undisclosed sum in 1988 from Bond Corporation, the former vehicle of bankrupt Australian businessman Mr Alan Bond. Welcoming the Barclays' shareholding, Mr Dagul said the brothers had undertaken to retain their stake as a medium-term investment and he was hopeful of 'other deals' with them. He said that the addition of Trenport's three properties in Birmingham, London and Godalming would increase the size of Southend's portfolio by 15 per cent. Together the properties - totalling 250,000 sq ft of office and leisure space - are expected to generate rental income of Pounds 2.9m next year. 'We see a lot of potential in these properties and this transaction could lead to further acquisitions,' he said. Southend was able to seek new acquisitions because it had built up cash balances of Pounds 40m from property sales and a loan stock issue in June, he added. The company, meanwhile, also announced an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 1.78m for the six months to September 30. The results were achieved on reduced turnover of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 18.2m). Earnings increased to 1.23p (0.67p), while the interim dividend is reduced from 1.52p to 0.8p.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia astonishes market with uranium profit claim AN ASTONISHING claim that Russia is exporting uranium at a profit, although prices are below the cost of production at most western uranium mines, was made yesterday by Mr Viktor Mikhailov, the Russian Federation's Minister for Nuclear Energy. His remarks provoked a sharp response by other delegates at the Uranium Institute's annual symposium in London. Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economic adviser to the RTZ Corporation of the UK, one of the world's biggest uranium producers, said: 'Most of his arguments are plain nonsense. The Russians and their partners in the US are getting away with murder and the western industry should stand up to them.' Russia faces uranium dumping allegations in the US and, in an oblique reference to this, Mr Mikhailov said in the English version of his text: 'The high technical level of our production processes makes it possible to export profitably, even under the conditions of extremely low prices which exist in the world uranium market today. 'We believe that efforts to limit or reduce our exports are unfair and unfortunate.' He said Russia's present production allowed for the export of 3,500 tonnes of uranium a year and an increase to 5,000 tonnes a year was possible. Money from these exports would be used to buy food, equipment, materials and technology from the west to the benefit of parts of the western economy. 'The world community must realise the necessity of actively supporting the irreversible reforms in Russia at this historic moment,' he added. Mr Mikhailov suggested that some of Russia's 'substantial' uranium stockpile might be moved to the west, partly to give assurance of supply to western consumers and partly to be held as collateral for loans to his country. He claimed Russia's share of the uranium market was about 6 per cent and 'we believe that it could be as high as 20 to 25 per cent in a market free of artificial restrictions'. Mr Crowson, in a paper to be delivered at the symposium today, suggests that to talk of production costs and the relative efficiencies of the western and Russian industries is 'unrealistic,' given that the Russian currency is not fully convertible and that 'Russian costs of energy and labour are greatly subsidised'. He adds: 'That labour costs (in the CIS) and environmental standards are well below western levels is a competitive fact of life, however regrettable. That said, there will be inexorable levelling up tendencies to CIS costs and it is highly doubtful whether the CIS producers could maintain their present output at prices close to present spot market levels.' Mr Crowson dismisses Mr Mikhailov's suggestion that Russia is not winning its proper share of the market. He points out that the Uranium Institute estimates that the CIS produced 10,500 tonnes of uranium in 1991 or 19.3 per cent of the world's total reactor requirements of 54,280 tonnes. 'To ignore domestic CIS and east European reactor requirements in looking at relative market shares seems rather extraordinary.' He makes these remarks in the context of a warning to uranium consumers that the present apparent abundance of the material - used solely to produce nuclear energy - 'is more apparent than real'. He suggests that 'market conditions can change very quickly and unexpectedly. When they do, the inevitable scramble for cover will exacerbate any turnaround'.</p>

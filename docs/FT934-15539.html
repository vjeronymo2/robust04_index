			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (9): Orders shift towards Asian market - How the forestry machinery companies have been coping THE COLLAPSE in pulp and paper prices is being felt beyond the Finnish forestry groups which it directly affects: the supporting industry, from forest machinery groups to power plant companies to chemicals suppliers, has also suffered from the downturn. Finland's forest machinery companies have seen orders fall sharply from the levels of three or four years ago, because pulp and paper companies worldwide have slashed investment in the face of huge losses and overcapacity in many market sectors. The position may not change much in the next year or two, with few expectations of a significant improvement before 1995. There is also something of a hangover effect. Huge investments in the late 1980s and early 1990s were based on the assumption that pulp and paper demand would go on rising. That simply did not happen. However, it has meant that the companies which invested heavily then, including the big Finnish groups, now boast modern equipment which they will not need to replace for many years. 'There is overcapacity. We as machine suppliers have been too successful,' says Mr Krister Ahlstrom, president of the Ahlstrom group, a leading supplier of pulping equipment. Factors which have helped Finland's machinery manufacturers survive the crisis have been strong market positions, technical innovation, rationalisation and the development of new markets and services. Such moves have enabled Valmet, one of the world's three largest producers of paper machinery with a 30 per cent market share, to keep its paper machinery operations profitable in 1991 and 1992, while the group as a whole has suffered heavy losses. A noticeable trend has been the enforced shift away from the European market, which has traditionally been the mainstay of companies' order books, towards markets in other parts of the world. Significantly, Asia now makes up the largest segment in the orders of Kone Wood, which supplies wood handling equipment to pulp mills, after the company's success in winning two orders in Indonesia and one in Iran. At Valmet, Asia accounted for 9.2 per cent of sales last year, but 18.6 per cent of orders. Valmet is also giving greater emphasis to rebuilding and servicing existing machinery to compensate for reduced orders for new equipment. Mr Matti Sundberg, its chief executive, says: 'Rebuilds are becoming more important, particularly for smaller companies which cannot afford to buy new machinery.' Niche positions have also helped. Kemira, the state-owned chemicals group, has been able to increase sales of hydrogen peroxide, a chemical used in pulp bleaching, thanks to greater environmental concern among forestry groups. The company estimates hydrogen peroxide sales will grow 10 per cent in Europe and 35 per cent in the Nordic region during 1993. Ahlstrom has also benefited from the environmental trend, which has pushed up sales of chlorine-free pulp bleaching technology. 'Most new orders are environmentally driven. Modernisations and upgrades to solve environmental problems or eliminate production bottlenecks have become the guiding factors for investments,' it noted in its 1992 annual report. For many of Finland's machinery groups, it is a question of sitting out the downturn until market conditions improve in the second half of the decade, when they are hoping there will be a significant increase in orders for new machinery and rebuilds. That is why they are so reluctant to reduce spending on research and development, despite the current financial squeeze. However, it is still far from clear when the upturn will come. Mr Ahlstrom says pulp prices need to rise 'at least Dollars 100 a tonne before customers start loosening their purse strings' (the current level is Dollars 400 a tonne) and orders for pulping equipment are back to more normal levels. Mr Sundberg is also cautious but he notes that worldwide demand for paper has continued to rise in spite of the recession. 'Within two years there is likely to be a relatively good balance in most paper grades. Companies will have to start talking to machine suppliers quite soon if they want to be well ahead in the second half of the 1990s,' he states.</p>

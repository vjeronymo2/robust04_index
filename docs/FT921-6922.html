			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Investors show caution as Dow edges to new high Wall Street ALTHOUGH US stock markets lacked a firm direction yesterday in the absence of fresh economic news, the Dow blue chip indicator edged ahead to an all-time high, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.23 at 3,282.42, just eclipsing last Thursday's record of 3,280.64. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.81 firmer at 412.27, but the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, still under pressure from profit-taking, slipped 4.82 to 624.93. Turnover on the New York SE was light at 181m shares. Although the Dow has reached new highs in recent days, the energy behind the market's rally from mid-December to mid-January appears to have dissipated. Investors are now picking their stocks more carefully, sector rotation remains a dominant theme, and analysts predict that the market will probably not make further strides until it has evidence of an improvement in corporate earnings. Among individual stocks, General Motors dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 after reporting a Dollars 4.5bn loss in the full year of 1991. Although the losses and the plant closures had been expected, they underlined how hard the recession has hit the US manufacturing base. Ford and Chrysler eased in sympathy, by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 and Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 16 7/8 respectively. RJR Nabisco rose early on but ended unchanged at Dollars 10 1/8 in active trading after the company announced that it had bought back Dollars 1bn of high-cost debt in a private transaction. This will result in a first-quarter after-tax charge of about Dollars 160m. Bank of Boston fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 18 1/4 as investors reacted to last Friday's news that the banking group had filed to offer 8m common shares. Eljer Industries weakened Dollars 1 to Dollars 9 1/8 after the company said that it would take special reserves, write-offs and adjustments totalling Dollars 30m in the fourth quarter of the 1991 year. Texas Instruments eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 on news that the computer chip manufacturer is in talks to buy the rights of Chips &amp; Technologies' integrated circuits that imitate Intel's 386 microprocessor. Intel, quoted on Nasdaq, dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 . Elsewhere on the Nasdaq market, Zenith Laboratories jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 23 3/4 on reports that a US district court had ruled that Zenith's Cefadroxil drug does not infringe a Bristol-Myers Squibb patent. Canada TORONTO stocks closed a narrowly traded day on an uptick, ending a string of nine straight sessions of losses. Today's Federal Budget kept traders cautious, although most said they were expecting no major changes. The composite index was finally 6.6 firmer at 3,543.2, while advances edged ahead of declines by 297 to 290 after a volume of 26.7m shares valued at CDollars 237m.</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Private View: Heir to the sins of the fatherland Last week he was in Paris with Chancellor Kohl to celebrate Bastille Day and watch Panzer tanks crawl down the Champs Elysees for the first time since the Nazi occupation of the French capital. This week he was star speaker in London at the German embassy's 50th anniversary 'commemoration' of the bomb plot against Hitler. Manfred Rommel is much in demand these days. As mayor of Stuttgart he represents the prosperous liberal democracy of post-war Germany. As son of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the Desert Fox, he is a reminder that even the Nazi dictatorship had its decent face. As peacemaker he has struck up a friendship with David, Viscount Montgomery, son of his father's conqueror at Alamein. Manfred was 15 and at home with his father when two generals came from Hitler in October, 1944, to offer the field marshal the opportunity of committing suicide by poison. The Desert Fox accepted but not because he was part of the bomb plot. Although he knew some of the conspirators, said his son, he never believed they would - or could - act. He took the poison because from the end of 1943 he had been telling Hitler the war was lost, and Hitler discovered Rommel was prepared to surrender to the Allies if they were victorious in France. I asked his son if he felt absolved by his father's sacrifice. 'No, I don't want to say that because my father died by order of Hitler he's a good German and the others who did not die by order were bad Germans. That would be wrong. The people in general were not responsible. A simple German, what should he do? Or even a colonel or divisional commander? He was almost helpless.' He could resign his command, I said. 'Of course. On the other hand he had responsibility for his troops, for others.' What about your father? 'He lived at a time when it was very difficult for a German to remain honest. Today, it's really difficult not to be honest.' Do you feel you should apologise for him? 'Yes, of course, I try to explain. I have to admit that in Germany we had anti-semitism and that Jews were expropriated, ill-treated, discriminated against. No doubt about that. If it was not accepted it was tolerated. 'And the Army said 'It's not our problem. It's up to the politicians.' And that was wrong of course. Of course I cannot deny that my father was fighting for Hitler and was also made field marshal by Hitler, not by Emperor William II. He also had a special political responsibility.' Are you ashamed of his attitude, or proud of him as a soldier? 'I'm proud of him as a person. Because I don't know what I would have done in his place. I would be ashamed of my father if I were absolutely certain that I in his place would have followed a better way. 'I see him in his time. He tried in Africa to be fair - as far as war can be fair. He never pursued any Jewish people in Africa and did not carry out orders from Hitler.' He ignored, for example, an order to kill prisoners of the British Eighth Army who had been German citizens. What about yourself? Do you feel at all ashamed that you were in the Hitler Youth and aspired to the SS? 'No, I don't feel ashamed I was in the Hitler Youth but I feel ashamed and surprised that there was so little concern in Germany when minorities were persecuted, and people did not feel solidarity but were attracted by propaganda and said 'It's none of our business.' 'Many things they didn't know, but many things they did know. This is a lesson we have to learn about dictatorship. 'And of course I feel ashamed that in the name of Germany millions of people were killed, that we went to war against Poland and Russia and so on.' Manfred Rommel ended the war as an anti-aircraft gunner, a 16-year-old Luftwaffenoberhelfer. Now 65, he has been Christian Democrat mayor of Stuttgart, the capital of Baden-Wurttemberg, for 20 years. He said he has tried to work simultaneously for the integration and cultural protection of the quarter of the city's population who are non-nationals: Greeks, Yugoslavs and Turks. 'What we have to learn from the time of Hitler is to fight for the interests of minorities and see them as part of the whole society.' Do you feel a special responsibility because of Hitler's theories? 'Not because of Hitler. I am clean of Hitler. I feel a special responsibility because I think it is necessary for the future of Europe  - especially for a continental country with many frontiers - to be open to minorities.' He also thinks it wrong to ignore - as Chancellor Kohl is being accused of doing - communist survivors of the German resistance movement. 'In Stuttgart we have many communist families who have lost grandparents in the concentration camps. I think it would not be decent to exclude them. Their idea was not to support Stalin, but to fight Hitler.' Rommel has also been preaching the virtues of forgiveness to colleagues in former east Germany. There the victims of communist exploitation find his message hard to swallow, he said. 'But without the tolerance shown by the German resistance to those who fought with Hitler, German society after the war would have exploded.' Do you see dangers in the neo-Nazi movement or even in Germany's economic success? Will Germany become again dominant and assertive in Europe? 'No, I don't think so. There is no danger from the Nazi movement. We have some criminals who attack asylum-seekers, and so on. This is true. But this is no danger for democracy. We will put them in prison. As for ambition, I don't think so. Germany is almost suffering from the fact that it has become bigger. It may want everything else, but not to be dominant in Europe.' Does not unity itself foster a kind of nationalism that could be dangerous one day? 'I don't think so. Nationalism is almost a little bit discriminated against because the elder generation is full of distrust. 'And we have a lot of problems. It is not easy to incorporate a former communist country in a market economy and free democracy. The east saw us as providing dishwashers and red wine and fruit and holidays in Spain. But now they see us as we really are and they are very much disappointed by the lack of solidarity.' Your generation, I said, is old enough to remember the horrors but too young to have participated in them. Are you afraid that the younger generation will not learn the lessons? 'I would ask: what are the lessons? Some lessons are not learned. But never again will there be National Socialism or anything like that in Germany. Never. 'What is dangerous is that many people don't see the values of democracy. They don't accept our kind of democracy or say it's not good enough for them. This is dangerous because we will have to face many economic and social problems if we produce more and more with less and less manpower. We need democracy also in critical times.' We have another year of anniversaries before the end of the war in Europe, I said. Will it be a relief when it's over? 'Yes, it will be a relief. We won't stop talking about National Socialism and the Third Reich because it's really important to draw the lesson from them. But I hope that there will be less talk about war.' Are you tired of the responsibility of being your father's son? 'No, I'm not tired. I'm not only my father's son. I have made a career in administration, in politics. Of course I always felt obliged to argue for my father. 'We have to face the future but the past is important to learn from. We cannot change it. But we can interpret it.' The bomb plot, Page IX</p>

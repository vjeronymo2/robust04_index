			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa expressed his desire Tuesday to quit as head of  government after about eight months in office, two lawmakers  said.    The premier made the remark at a dinner meeting with Kiyoshi  Nishikawa and Yasushi Shimomura, both of the Niin Club, a tiny  political grouping in the House of Councillors, the two  legislators told reporters. However, an aide to Hosokawa denied  the reported remark, saying, "the premier is saying he did not  state such a thing."    During the two-hour meeting Hosokawa remarked with a  straight  face that he wants to quit as premier, Shimomura said.    Shimomura said he told the premier to step down if he wishes  to. Nishikawa, however, said he took the remark as a joke. "It  is unthinkable for a person in such a responsible position to  make such a careless comment," Nishikawa said.    Hosokawa's reported resignation remark comes at a time when  the Diet's budget negotiations remain paralyzed due to a gulf  between the ruling coalition parties and the opposition camp  over Hosokawa's questionable personal finances. Dismissing  allegations about his 100 million yen loan from Tokyo Sagawa  Kyubin Co., a scandal-torn delivery firm, Hosokawa has spurned  demands by the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to  summon a former aide who was in charge of his finances.    The LDP, toppled from government last summer after nearly  four decades of rule, has refused to participate in Diet  deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994, which started last  Friday. While the deposed party suspects the loan was an  undeclared political donation, Hosokawa insists he repaid the  money in full, with interest, by January 31, 1991.    Political sources said the chances for an early start on the  key budget debate are slim, predicting the stalemate to last  through next week.    After returning to his official residence, Hosokawa told  reporters his talks with the two legislators were a joy and did  not touch on his alleged remark.    Hosokawa is scheduled to meet reporters at his official  residence at around 12:20 A.M. Wednesday, officials said. The  prime minister is expected to deny reports that he expressed his  desire Tuesday to quit as prime minister, political sources said.</p>

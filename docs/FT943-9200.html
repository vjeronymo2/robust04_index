			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Fyffes buys into Germany Fyffes, the Dublin-based fruit and vegetable distributor, has succeeded in establishing its first foothold in the German banana market with the acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in JA Kahl for about IPounds 8m (Pounds 7.9m). Kahl, which Fyffes said was expected to have sales of IPounds 60m in the year to December 1994, is based in Munich, where it has a modern distribution and banana ripening centre. It is one of the main fruit and vegetable distributors in the Bavarian region. Mr Carl McCann, group finance director, said the acquisition represented an 'important step' in the group's expansion into continental Europe and its modern facilities, with a direct link to the German rail network, created 'good prospects to grow the business'. The German market is particularly important for Fyffes' European expansion as per capita consumption levels of bananas there are among the highest in Europe. This is Fyffes' second acquisition in Europe this year, having spent IPounds 15.9m last month in acquiring a 50 per cent stake in Velleman &amp; Tas, a leading banana and fresh fruit distributor in the Netherlands. Earlier this year, Mr McCann said he expected to spend about half of the group's IPounds 80m cash on acquisitions during 1994, and he confirmed yesterday that that remained his goal. Some IPounds 12m was spent on acquisitions in Spain and Denmark last year. Mr McCann said the combined annual turnover of the four acquisitions amounted to IPounds 350m, and the total outlay, including deferred payments, amounted to IPounds 40m. Fyffes has set itself a target of selling 26m boxes of bananas in Europe this year, up from 18m in 1993. In the medium term, the group hopes to source a large part of this increase from a 9,000 acre plantation development in Guatemala which it helped to finance.</p>

How  energy-efficient is stress-skin panel construction? Is it reasonably-priced,  and can I do some of the construction work myself?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Stress-skin panel construction is probably the most energy-efficient  and cost-effective building method available today.  </P> <P> With super-high insulation levels and airtightness, a stress-skin panel house  should have extremely low heating and cooling costs. A reduction of 50% on  utility bills as compared to a typically constructed house is reasonable.  </P> <P> Stress-skin panels, made to your building plan, are delivered to your building  site. You can also select from many standard house design packages to reduce  the costs.  </P> <P> This construction method is simple and you should be able to do much of the  work yourself. Most panel manufacturers will rent you any necessary tools. Once  the foundation or basement is poured, It should only take a few days to close  in a house (walls and roof).  </P> <P> You can purchase the panels with the openings for windows and doors already cut  and framed. You just slip them in. If you want to add a window at a later time,  you just saw a rectangular hole through the wall. Then rout out a little foam,  frame the opening and set in the window.  </P> <P> A typical structural (no supporting frame needed) stress-skin panel is made of  thick, rigid foam insulation (insulating R-values up to R-40). A 7/16-inch  thick sheet of exterior-grade plywood or wafer board is bonded to each side of  the insulation forming the panel.  </P> <P> You can attach siding, stucco, brick, etc. to the outdoor surface and drywall  or paneling to the indoor surface.  </P> <P> The foam insulation is routed out to accept standard lumber at the top and  bottom. Once your foundation is complete and the sill lumber is in place, tilt  up the free-standing panels and the routed-out bottom fits and seals over the  sill.  </P> <P> Nail the panels to the sill. Each panel is joined vertically and sealed along  the joints with 2-by-4 or insulated splines.  </P> <P> Work your way around the foundation until all of the walls are up and properly  positioned. The corners are nailed together through studs that are in the  routed-out ends of the corner panels. This forms an extremely strong and rigid  house.  </P> <P> Electrical wiring chases are provided in the insulation behind the indoor wafer  skin. It makes wiring easy with no air leaks or insulation voids as with  studded-wall construction.  </P> <P> Since a stress-skin panel house is so efficient and airtight, you should  install an air-to-air heat exchanger ventilation system. This gives you  complete control over the ventilation in your house. Outdoor noise, dust,  pollens, etc. are almost totally eliminated.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 374 showing a list of  stress-skin panel manufacturers, typical panel specifications, and a floor plan  layout and exterior diagram of a typical stress-skin panel house. Please  include $1 and a self-addressed, stamped business-size envelope.

Will that effect the operation of my  central air conditioner and furnace?  </P> <P> A: It can definitely affect the temperature calibration. Most standard wall  thermostats have a liquid mercury switch in them. As the bimetallic strip  inside reacts to temperature changes, the mercury flows back and forth to  control heating and cooling. It must be level to be accurate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clothes Dryer Takes Longer to Do Job  </P> <P> Q: Our clothes dryer seems to get hot, but it is taking longer to dry our  clothes. I keep the lint filter clean. What could be the problem?  </P> <P> A: A clothes dryer uses a lot of energy, and the extra running time can get  expensive. If your dryer is still getting hot, then your problem probably is  inadequate air flow. One cause may be the vent duct has become clogged with  lint. Pull the duct loose from the back of the dryer and run a rag on a coat  hanger through it. Another possible cause is that the flapper on the outside  vent is sticking closed. Make sure it swings freely.  </P> <P> Letters and questions to Dulley, a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant, may  be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,  Ohio 45244.  </P> <P> </P></p>

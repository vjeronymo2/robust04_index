			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa confirmed Monday [21 March] that he had told Chinese  Premier Li Peng that "it is not sensible for Western countries  to impose their own values of democracy upon other countries."    Hosokawa, talking with reporters on a flight back from  China,  said he only spoke generally about Japan's position. He denied  any intention of criticizing the United States which links  improvement of China's human rights record with the renewal in  June of its most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status.    Japanese officials, briefing reporters about talks between  the Japanese and Chinese leaders at a banquet in Beijing on  Saturday, said Hosokawa urged China to improve its human rights  record. The officials quoted Hosokawa as saying that the  international community recognizes human rights as a universal  value.    But China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin offered a  different version of Hosokawa's comment, saying the Japanese  leader "expressed his view that it is not sensible for Western  countries to impose their own values of democracy upon other  countries."    "He also pointed out that various countries in the world  should make joint efforts to realize the principles and spirit  enshrined in the Declaration (on Human Rights)," Wu quoted  Hosokawa as saying.</p>

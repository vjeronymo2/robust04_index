			<p>Potential   Threats at Once   <F P=102> 94WS0331E Paris AFP SCIENCES in French 14 Apr 94 pp 15, 16 </F> <F P=103> 94WS0331E </F> <F P=104>  Paris AFP SCIENCES </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO     [Text] Toulon--"Every navy in the world, including the  American, already envies us the Charles-de-Gaulle's combat  system. It will enable the French aircraft carrier to track  1,000 leads (or potential threats) simultaneously, identify  them, and respond as needed," assert electronic engineers of the  Directorate of Naval Shipbuilding (DCN).    At the tip of the Saint-Mandrier peninsula in Toulon, the  system's designers have installed a life-size mockup of the  future aircraft carrier's mast, which rises 74 m in height (10  more than on the ship). Over the months, they will use it to  fine-tune integration of the different radar, radio, and  electronic systems that make up the "eyes and ears" of the  Charles de Gaulle, in a real marine environment.    Real tests employing aircraft and ships will provide  step-by-step verification of work quality, software, computers,  consoles--and the whole lot's compatibility. Laboratories will  continue ergonomic studies to design the 24 consoles that make  up the heart of the Naval Tactical Information System (SENIT-8),  which operators will work in four-hour shifts.    Everything must be ready in January 1988, when France's  first  nuclear aircraft carrier will begin its official, 15-month  testing period. Until then, there is plenty of work to be done  in Toulon, and in the some 200 French and European companies  acting as subcontractors.    An unusual feature of the system is that its components were  purchased on the commercial market, then "hardened" for military  needs. This approach will enable engineers to upgrade all or  part of the on-board electronics every four years, as technology  changes. It also saved money from the outset: of the 17 billion  French francs [Fr] the Charles-de-Gaulle will cost, Fr10 to 12  billion are earmarked for the ship itself, and 25 to 30 percent  for the combat system.    The latter must manage all the information transmitted by  its  six radars, the radars of the naval group's other ships, early  warning planes (AWACS or Hawkeye), and the data supplied by the  three satellite systems, Inmarsat, Fleetsatcom, and Syracuse.  The combat system must control the launch of defensive weapons  (aircraft, missiles, helicopters, decoys, etc.), and keep the  carrier in uninterrupted contact with the Navy general staff,  its base, any land commandos in operation, its aircraft, the  French president, and the ship's internal communication system.    Consequently, the Charles-de-Gaulle--whose hull will be  launched 7 May in Brest--will be packed with electronics. In  addition to its radars, it will boast 80 different antennas,  each able to carry four to five transmissions. To avoid  interference, engineers are experimenting with different  placement patterns on a copper mockup 1/50th the actual size of  the ship.    Color symbols for each type of threat appear on the consoles  of the operations center. The system's eight computers will  identify and track them, rating them on a scale of rising  danger. Once the threats' fate is sealed, the decision to  destroy them, whether they are aircraft, missiles, ships, or  torpedoes, is made and implemented. The naval group plays a role  in protecting the aircraft carrier.    The area surrounding the Charles-de-Gaulle is broken down  into four zones. At a distance of over 100 nautical miles,  pursuit is guided by an on-board early warning Hawkeye plane  (the ship will carry three) or a destroyer. Between 50 and 100  nautical miles, the aircraft carrier's planes (Rafale or Super  Etendard, etc.) or the nearby aerial defense support ships will  take over. Between 15 and 50 miles, fighters and medium-range  missiles will engage the threat. Finally, in the first zone of  15 miles or under, the aircraft carrier's on-board defense  weaponry will respond. Naturally, the carrier's weapons must  avoid shooting down friendly aircraft. "On 6 June 1944," says  destroyer captain Guillot, "90 percent of air losses were caused  by the allies themselves, due to lack of coordination."    Since the Charles-de-Gaulle will often be traveling in  international waters--as the Foch is, off the coast of  Yugoslavia--all communication systems have been made compatible  with those of our allies. Hence the visits of experts from other  navies and their enthusiastic comments, which the DCN plans to  use to "sell" the SENIT-8's "forerunner"--the SENIT-6 which  equips the anti-aircraft destroyers Jean-Bart and Cassard--on  the international market. Yet the SENIT-6 can only monitor 240  potential threats at one time....</p>

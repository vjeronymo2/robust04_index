			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SECRETARY OF STATE: EU  </P> <P> California's secretary of state interprets and enforces election laws. The  state's chief elections officer also handles the filing of numerous corporate  documents. Secretary of State March Fong Eu has handled all of these diverse  responsibilities well enough that she should be returned to office.  </P> <P> Eu and her capable staff are especially knowledgeable about voter registration  and have worked to make the process more convenient. Under her leadership,  California became one of the first states to adopt registration by mail. Eu  also advocated, although unsuccessfully, automatic registration at the offices  of the Department of Motor Vehicles and state agencies. She remains committed  to accessible voter registration.  </P> <P> As overseer of the California State Archives, Eu persevered to finally persuade  the Legislature and governor to replace the leaky, old storage area with a new  state archives building to house irreplaceable documents.  </P> <P> Despite these accomplishments, there is room for improvement and more vigorous  leadership. Eu's most prominent challenger, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan  Milke Flores, has pointed out that Eu has relaxed most of the fines assessed  for late campaign reports. Most fines have been levied against novices and  third-party candidates who do not file late intentionally. The fines have been  relaxed across the board; in fact, one of Eu's challengers got a fine reduced  from $100 to $10. In spite of the broad reductions, Eu's office has collected  $400,000 in fines during her tenure but the office could -- and should --  collect more.  </P> <P> There is also the troubling matter of fines assessed against Eu's own campaign.  As Eu has admitted, there is simply no excuse for late filings from a secretary  of state. There is the even more troubling reduction of Eu's penalties. To  avoid a possible conflict, Eu's chief deputy has refrained from ruling on those  fines; a civil servant has made those decisions. To avoid even the appearance  of a conflict, Eu's campaign should pay full freight on all future fines.  </P> <P> On balance, March Fong Eu has done a credible job since she was elected to the  post in 1974. We recommend Eu for another term.  </P></p>

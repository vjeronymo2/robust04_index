			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riyadh (DPA) -- German Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt is positive that trade with Saudi Arabia can be expanded  and that mutual investment can be extended. It is in the  interest of both sides to reactivate their trade, which dropped  by just over 20 percent in the first half of 1993, Rexrodt said  in Riyadh today at the end of his two-day working visit. He was  accompanied by 35 representatives of German industry. Primarily  Saudi Arabia wants to export more oil and petrochemical products.    Rexrodt sees great opportunities for expanding economic  relations in joint ventures. So far there are only 70 joint  ventures, mainly in the area of sales. However, there is German  business interest in many areas, especially telecommunications,  the sale of Airbus aircraft, ship building, power stations, sea  water desalination plants, cement works and petrochemistry.  Details of specific projects were not discussed.    In order to encourage investment Rexrodt thinks it necessary  to improve conditions for this. An agreement on investment  protection, due to be concluded in May, will make a considerable  contribution to this. It will be the first investment  protection agreement between Saudi Arabia and another country.  The availability of information about the Saudi legal system  should also be improved.    In connection with concern expressed by German businesses  about the deterioration in Saudi payment morale, the German  economics minister said he had raised this issue in his talks  with the Saudi ministers for finance and economy, defense and  aviation, industry, oil and trade.    Another issue discussed at the talks was the planned  European  Union energy tax, Rexrodt said. Like other oil-producing  countries, Saudi Arabia fears that this may cause a decrease in  oil imports. Rexrodt stressed that demand would not be reduced  by a higher mineral oil tax or higher energy taxes. He also  pointed out that a CO2 energy tax would subject German coal to a  much greater burden than oil. In 1992, German exports to Saudi  Arabia reached a value of 4.2 billion German marks [DM], while  imports from Saudi Arabia, mainly of crude oil, reached DM 2  billion.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Private plans for child secure units attacked GOVERNMENT proposals to contract out secure accommodation for children yesterday met a negative response across the private and voluntary sectors. Group 4 Securitas, the security company which runs the Wolds prison on Humberside for the government, said it was 'highly unlikely' to enter the market, while leading charities in the field, including National Children's Home, Barnardo's, and the Salvation Army, attacked the proposals and called for their withdrawal. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, published a consultation paper calling for secure accommodation for children placed in care or remanded by the courts to be opened to providers other than local authorities. Mrs Bottomley said local authorities would continue to have an 'essential' role as providers, but that demand for the service was rising. She added that the children involved, some with criminal records and others with 'severe emotional problems', were 'the most difficult to help in the care system'. Group Four said: 'This work is particularly focused on an area where we are not able to put forward any better expertise than that which the local authorities have.' Mr Tom White, chief executive of National Children's Home, said: 'NCH continues to be strongly opposed to the introduction of secure training centres and under no circumstances would NCH be prepared to bid to run such centres.' He added: 'NCH believes that the government's preoccupation with secure accommodation is inappropriate, and that imprisoning young people reinforces criminal behaviour.' Any secure provision should be organised to ensure 'there can be no incentive to any organisation to see an increase in provision'. Mr Mike Jarman, director of childcare for Barnardo's, supported this view. He said: 'We consider this a statutory-sector responsibility, and not a charitable task. We doubt whether the necessary competence exists within the private sector to provide such accommodation.' The Associations of County Councils and Metropolitan Authorities, both Labour-controlled, criticised the proposals. Mr Jack Bury, of the ACC's social services committee, said; 'Local authorities are in the business of providing total care for these young people, which is as much about rehabilitation as containment. If profit is a priority, it is difficult to see how the private sector could offer anything more than the latter.' Labour described the proposals as 'a blatant bid to cover up Conservative failure on crime'.</p>

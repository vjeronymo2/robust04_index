			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Unitech declines 11% to Pounds 7.8m UNITECH, the international electronics group, yesterday halved its dividend to 2.1p as it announced an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 7.8m in the half year to end-November. The group blamed the decline on the harsh trading conditions experienced in all its markets. Sales increased from Pounds 126.1m to Pounds 130.8m. After tax of Pounds 3.59m (Pounds 3.68m) and minorities of Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 1.32m) earnings per share came out at 4p (5.6p). The group said slowdowns in the previously strong Japanese and German markets adversely affected profits, while market conditions showed no improvement in North America, the UK or France. Minority interests reflected the reduction of the group's holding in Nemic-Lambda KK, its Japanese power supply subsidiary, following last year's flotation. Unitech's holding was reduced from 64 per cent to 50.6 per cent. Exchange rate movements, particularly the strengthening of the Yen, benefited profit by Pounds 500,000. During the past three years Unitech has earned an increasing part of its profits outside the UK. If this trend continues additional tax outlays could be incurred due to unrecovered advance corporation tax. Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said the cut in the dividend reflected the group's difficulty in being a UK based group with an international business. 'We wanted to address the situation rather than just make artificial changes by acquiring a UK company with good profits or rearranging our debt' he said.</p>

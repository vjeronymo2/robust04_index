			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese license French high-tech FIVE Japanese companies have signed a technology licensing agreement with Bull, the French state-owned computer group, that will allow them to use Bull's patented technologies for IC (integrated circuit) card technology. Toshiba, Hitachi, Oki Electric, Toppan Printing and Kyodo Printing have agreed to pay a fee to license technology owned by Bull's integrated circuit card company, Bull CP8, covering 500 areas related to IC cards and reader/writer machines. The value of the licensing deals is not revealed. Bull already has agreements with Toshiba, Hitachi, NEC, Sharp and Oki Electric to license its self-programmable one-chip microcomputer (SPOM) patent which covers technology for single-chip microcomputers used in IC cards. The deals represent an unusual example of high technology flowing from France to Japan, rather than vice versa. SPOM technology enables memory, microprocessors and programmes to be put on a single chip, thereby reducing significantly the cost of manufacturing integrated circuit cards. The IC card market in Japan is expected to grow to between Y1,000bn (Pounds 5.8bn) and Y2,000bn (Pounds 11.7bn) as IC cards are used increasingly to replace keys in intelligent buildings, to record personal medical information and eventually as a replacement for money.</p>

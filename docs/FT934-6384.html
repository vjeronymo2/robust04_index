			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Variations on a corporate theme: Maggie Urry asks if shareholders in Queens Moat Houses should have seen trouble ahead As Queens Moat Houses shareholders gather on Monday for the annual meeting to discuss the parlous state of their company's affairs, they might reflect on previous corporate horror stories that held clues for their own predicament. If they had cared to look, recent corporate history offers parallels. QMH joins names such as Tiphook, also in talks with its bankers; Brent Walker, Control Securities, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and WPP - which have gone to the brink and been rescued; and Polly Peck, Maxwell Communication Corporation, Coloroll and British &amp; Commonwealth - all of which have gone into receivership or administration in the 1990s. All these companies were, or are, run by an entrepreneurial boss, often 1980s stock market 'darlings'. They have been highly acquisitive, needing repeated injections of cash from shareholders and banks. In the late 1980s they usually demonstrated a better than average profit record, but found themselves caught on a profit treadmill, constantly having to improve results through fear of disappointing shareholders and bankers. The treadmill became more exacting as recession bit. And many have over-borrowed to invest in assets which have since fallen sharply in value. QMH shareholders could have learned a lesson from the others. Judging by the fall in QMH's shares in the year to March, when they were suspended, some investors did indeed heed the warning signs: The entrepreneurial boss The 1980s economic expansion was a time when entrepreneurial zeal was easy to convert into results that convinced bankers and financial markets. But too frequently the performance could not be sustained when recession began. One corporate financier with experience of restructurings says, of those who came unstuck: 'They were able to demonstrate a record and the accounts appeared to show asset and earnings growth.' A director at a UK clearing bank, says: 'They all traded by reputation rather than substance. There's the avuncular type, and the bullying type, but they all relied on being powerful and were often secretive about the business.' A common theme, as in QMH and Brent Walker, was a lack of proper management accounts. The entrepreneurial boss had often built the business from scratch. Mr John Bairstow, former chairman at QMH opened his first hotel in his house, a partly mock-tudor residence in Essex. Mr Robert Montague, chairman of Tiphook, and Mr George Walker, ex-chairman of Brent Walker, also founded their business empires. Typically they have a great belief in their own abilities, bolstered by City adulation. 'If you are told you have the Midas touch, you believe it,' the banker explains. Many appear to regard the company as their own private fiefdom. They are prepared 'to bet the business' - regarded by many financiers as a sign of bad management; they take excessive risks - such as hanging on to assets in the hope that values will rise. If things go wrong, they blame bad luck. 'Good managers implement strategies appropriate to circumstances. In recession they rationalise, retrench, consolidate. Good management is about exercising options in a timely way and keeping exit routes open,' says one lender. It is rare to find in one person the combination of skills to manage a business in both expansionary and recessionary phases. But, he says, it is difficult for others to tell a company founder: 'Now we're in recession we need different people.' It is not surprising that rule one in the banker's manual, says a corporate rescuer, is to get rid of the boss. The acquisitive company Doing deals is the entrepreneur's great love. But were companies that have since failed building on sand? A corporate financier says: 'They were built on doing transactions where there is no room for error. You must assume continued economic growth because they can't take any downside.' Deal making for its own sake can prove a recipe for disaster. 'The problem with acquisitions is that synergies are not achieved,' says one banker whose fingers have been burnt. 'You just get a bigger entity with bigger profits. Just because you can ride a bike it doesn't mean you can fly a jumbo jet.' An example of a 'deal too far' is Brent Walker's Pounds 685m purchase of Grand Metropolitan's betting shops in 1989. The high price paid and debt incurred proved to be the final straw for an already over-stretched company as the economy moved into recession. With hindsight the company might have acted differently - but critics say the signs were there at the time. The profit treadmill A succession of profit figures that seem to defy gravity is not all good news. In the 1980s, the entrepreneur could often point to a phenomenal profit record to justify more deals, borrowings and share issues. But in recession, even keeping profits on a rising trend is difficult. And once on the treadmill, the City can be unforgiving of companies that fall off. 'The boss would promise the City 20 per cent a year earnings per share growth, and then tell the finance director to find it,' says one corporate financier. Rising asset values help since costs can be capitalised - taking them out of the profit and loss account and including them in the balance sheet value. 'Say you buy a property for Pounds 100m and then revalue it at Pounds 150m. That gives you scope to capitalise Pounds 50m of costs against it - like a helicopter,' the financier suggests. Another way of making use of rising asset values is to pass assets between subsidiaries, crystallising gains and taking them into profits. Other methods are to 'front-end' profits, taking profits which directors expect but which have not yet been made. QMH, for instance, used its incentive schemes, where hotel managers promised to meet certain financial targets over the next year but could keep any excess. QMH simply included the amounts promised in profits on day one. The late Mr Robert Maxwell was notorious for padding out his profits with, for instance, foreign exchange gains and profits on disposals. Unsecured lending During the 1980s banks were keen to lend in a drive for market share. The corporate financier says banks were lending against assets without taking security over them: 'The most junior analyst could see there was no cashflow.' Without cashflow to pay the interest and with asset values slumping in recession, the loans could not be serviced or repaid. 'I've been through two recessions. After the first I thought, 'we've learnt our lesson, we won't do it again' but we did,' says a clearing banker. He is cynical about the future, believing that banks will again succumb to competitive pressures when the economy next starts to expand rapidly. 'The mood of the moment will dominate,' he says. Another quotes the banker's maxim: 'Lending money is easy. It's getting it back that's the problem.' At QMH, the banks, which are together owed Pounds 1.2bn, are discussing a financial restructuring of the company which should save at least part of their money. The shareholders, who rank last in the list of creditors, could be forgiven for asking how they were supposed to know the depths of QMH's troubles. The answer is that they might not have been able to judge the full extent of its difficulties; but there were enough warning bells ringing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Postal Companies Act Against Warning </F> Strikes"]    [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main, 17 Jun -- Negotiations in  connection with the conflict over wages for postal employees  continued in Cologne on Friday [17 June] at noon. According to  the German Post Trade Union, the issue to be discussed in  Cologne primarily was the adjustment of income and old-age  pensions for postal employees in eastern Germany. The talks  were accompanied by mutual accusations of the parties to the  wage negotiations and by warning strikes of the employees in  many cities.    On Friday morning about 8,000 employees went on strike in 63  post offices and 44 telephone offices. As a result, the postal  companies applied for injunctions against the warning strikes.  Mr. Goerts, the chief negotiator of the employers, issued a  statement saying that, by doing this, the postal companies are  acting in the interests of their customers. "In particular now,  during the vacations, thousands of applications for visas,  airplane tickets, and other documents are stuck at the post  offices."    In a letter to Mr. Van Haaren, the chairman of the Post  Trade  Union, Post Minister Boetsch pointed out on Wednesday that the  backlogs created by the strikes in the postal services have  risen to 63 million letters. The trade union strikes have  reached a scope that cannot be described with the term "warning  strike" anymore. He, Boetsch, and "other people not directly  involved" get the impression that the Post Trade Union is  pursuing the wage negotiations "not in the usual way, that is,  not oriented toward results and goals." Boetsch met with Van  Haaren in Berlin late Thursday evening.    Goerts announced that the companies have suffered damage  running into three-digit million sums. Many customers are  defecting to the private competition. Goerts accused the Post  Trade Union of continuing its "political strikes" despite the  latest rapprochement. Over the past days good results have been  achieved regarding the integration and the protection of east  German employees against dismissal.    Mr. Heidorn, the chief negotiator of the Post Trade Union,  accused the employers in Cologne of pursuing "political  negotiations." By delaying and protracting the negotiations  they want to postpone the talks until the planned decision about  the postal reform in the Bundestag on 29 June. The trade union  will think about extending the warning strikes. The prospects  for coming to an agreement at the negotiations in Cologne on the  weekend are "zero," Heidorn added.

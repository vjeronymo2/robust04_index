			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Markets: Proof of truth in an old wives' tale - Serious Money Here is some good news for anyone cringing at their new tax burden. April is the best month of the year for buying shares. It is a particularly good month for oil shares. But you ought to be thinking of ditching your cyclicals over the next couple of months. And then, in June or July, you can start nibbling at consumer shares again. There is just one little catch before you pull out your wallet. These exhortations are based on typical stock market behaviour since the second world war. But these trends do not always hold true, and this year could always be one of those exceptions that prove the rule. Certainly, February and March have been atypically bad for shares. You have been warned. Now, back to the seasonal theory. The best known popular tag about the stock market is probably 'Sell in May, and go away'. Sophisticates scoff at such old wives' tales. But Nick Glydon of Credit Lyonnais Laing, who has spent years researching post-war investment trends, has produced what looks like solid proof that this particular tale has more than a kernel of truth. The basic seasonal pattern is remarkably similar regardless of the period chosen: 48 years, 20 years or just the past 10. Share prices start the year strongly, top out in May, either fall or mark time during the summer, and pick up strongly again in November/December. The new year surge has been even more pronounced recently, with even flatter summer doldrums and a sharper pick-up at the end of the year. What makes the tenacity of the seasonal pattern all the odder is that the fundamental explanation for it has ceased to exist. Once, it could be rationalised by looking at a farming calendar. After the harvest, farmers were rich and flooded the cities with cash, so interest rates fell and stock prices rose. In summer, they needed to borrow until they could harvest their crops and sell their animals, so interest rates rose and stock prices fell. None of that remains relevant. What is more, the seasonal effect appears to manifest itself in most of the other major world stock markets: Wall Street, Tokyo, Frankfurt and Paris. There are slight variations. The US, for instance, tops out slightly later than Britain, but only by a few weeks. The only relatively sizeable markets that break the mould are New Zealand, which is a bit freakish, and Mexico, which currently stays strong in all seasons. So, should you rush out and fill your boots with oil shares? Only if you have other reasons for doing so. Even the men who research these seasonal investment trends caution investors against following them blindly. They are an additional prop for investment decision-making, not a self contained investment system. ***** From old wives' tales to the spicy modern world of derivatives. Financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdowne is launching its first unit trust. Not one to skulk in the shallow end, it is starting its new incarnation as a unit trust manager with a warrant fund. The firm's 30-year-old investment director, Michael Scott, reckons he knows more about warrants than most people. Warrants give you the right to buy a security at a particular price over a certain period. The warrant is, intrinsically, parasitic: it has value only if it enables you to buy the security at less than its market price. If the market price of the underlying security rises, the market price of the warrant rises even more steeply. If it falls, the warrant falls faster. And if you fail to use your right to buy before the end of the warrant's life, it expires valueless. In the right conditions, you can make a lot of money from warrants if you get it right - and vice-versa. Until the market fell back earlier this year, the climate had been ideal for warrants: almost anyone who owned them made money just by sitting tight as a rising market made them steadily more valuable. The climate could well be less propitious over the next few years. If you want to make money in a static or falling market, you need to trade actively and catch companies on the turn. This is a challenging but essentially risky game. Is this a good time to be buying units in such an unusually speculative trust from a novice unit trust management group? It is impossible to give a definitive answer yet. But it is possible to state categorically that the only investors who should even consider such a fund are those rich enough to be able to afford to write off most of this investment if it comes to the worst. The promotional literature describes the fund as being 'only for the adventurous'. Unfortunately that kind of 'warning' often tempts precisely the kind of investor it should deter. ***** Another tax regime, another tax trap. Most systems for collecting tax seem to penalise certain types of taxpayer almost accidentally. Our tax checklist on page III is drawn, deliberately, with a very broad brush. But it is still possible to see something nasty happening to people who get the married couple's allowance and have incomes between Pounds 27,145 and Pounds 28,865. The increase in the tax bill rises almost vertically at that point. Another, lesser, jump blights people earning between Pounds 21,840 and Pounds 22,360.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Business Travel: City of moneymakers / Explaining how to cope with - or even escape - the industrial sprawl of Osaka Because of the many rivers and canals running through the downtown area, the people of Osaka like to call the city the 'Venice of Japan'. Yet most of the waterways are now little more than open sewers, and the grey industrial sprawl - home to leading electronics manufacturers and textiles companies - may remind visitors of Birmingham in the UK or Cleveland, Ohio, rather than the Italian lagoon city. This is not to say that the spirit of the old mercantile town has been entirely lost. Many Osakan businessmen still greet each other by asking 'Mo kari makka?' - which translates as 'Making any money?' The people remain down-to-earth, and Osakans pride themselves on their distinct dialect. With the opening of a new international airport in September, however, Osaka is trying to promote itself as a refined international city. New high-rise office and shopping complexes are sprouting in the city centre, while local store owners and merchants are encouraged to start English lessons. The Kansai International Airport will be Japan's first 24-hour airport, offering flights to 44 countries - four times as many as at Osaka's current Itami Airport. Passengers can also travel on to 22 Japanese cities via domestic flights, which also have access to the new airport. This is a convenient change from the current principal international airport, Narita International, which is three hours away from the nearest domestic airport. Visitors can also take trains from the airport to Namba, Osaka and Kyoto stations, while a sea ferry is available to Kobe. Once in Osaka, it is best to travel around by train and subway. If you have the time and yen, you may choose to travel by taxi, but many drivers do not speak English and come from the provinces, so a simple map of your destination will make the journey easier and faster. While Osaka offers a variety of places to eat, shop and play, there are no historical sights to see. Instead, you could spend your spare time exploring the ancient cities of Nara and Kyoto, which are both only half an hour away by train from Osaka. In the past few years, downtown Kyoto has turned into a drab regional city, with an urban skyline of office buildings, condominiums and department stores. But many of the 1,000 temples and 400 shrines nestling at the foot of the mountains, which border the city on three sides, provide pleasant retreats. Unlike Tokyo or Osaka, Kyoto does not have an efficient intra-city transport system, so the most effective mode of travel is taxi. The spring and autumn months are the best times to visit Kyoto, but they are unfortunately the most crowded. High-school students and groups of elderly people descend on the main sites by the bus load. Nara, Japan's first imperial capital, is green and spacious, and offers a pleasant alternative to the urban bustle of Kyoto. Half of the city is parkland, where you can roam around, and you can feed the tame deer which inhabit the commons of Nara Park. Nara offers a greater variety of historical sites than Kyoto, and it still has the atmosphere of an ancient city, rather than a centre for property development like Kyoto. If on business in Osaka, it is convenient to stay in the central business area of Umeda. Umeda station is one stop from the terminal for the Shinkansen (bullet train), which links Osaka with Tokyo. The Hilton, Westin and Hankyu International hotels, which all have shuttle bus services from Umeda station, offer packages that include a night's accommodation and breakfast for about Y20,000 (Pounds 130). If accompanied by your spouse or family, you could stay in Kyoto or Nara, which are within commuting distance of Osaka. Both cities have a range of accommodation: from low-cost business hotels for the budget traveller suffering from the rise in the yen, to some of Japan's most traditional and expensive ryokan inns, which offer guests a zen-like atmosphere of serenity.</p>

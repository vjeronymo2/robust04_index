			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Togo has slipped back into violence just two weeks  before the holding of parliamentary elections. Seven people died  following an attack on the Inter-Arms Regiment camp in Lome on 5  January.    [Unidentified correspondent] A curfew has been imposed in  Lome. Olabire da Cruz has the details:    [Begin recording] Sporadic gunshots were heard again this  morning at 0600, especially near the military camp and the  airport. The Army and the Gendarmerie, who seem to have the  situation under control, have erected barricades all over to  dislodge the attackers, who, according to a government  communique, came from Ghana. The government has asked the  people in Lome and its environs to remain calm and stay at home  today to enable the security forces to deal with the situation.  Thus, public and private sector workers are not going to work  today. A curfew was imposed from 1800 to 0600 on 5 January.  The aim of the attack was reportedly to surround the Inter-Arms  Regiment camp, the residence of President Eyadema, who was not  there at the time.    It all began around 1830 GMT when gunshots from automatic  weapons punctuated by explosions were heard for two hours at  various areas in Lome, especially near the military camp. The  security forces' reaction enabled them to kill seven of the  attackers. Some of them allegedly managed to flee to Ghana,  from where they reportedly came. An active search has been  mounted for the others. It must be noted that the attack  occurred just a few hours after the arrival of the French  military observers in Lome and had virtually the same  characteristics as that of 25 March 1993, during which 23 people  died, including four senior officers. [end recording]    Mr. (Jean-Pierre Fabre), spokesman for the Union of Forces  of  Change [UFC] -- Mr. Gilchrist Olympio's party -- has given his  reaction. He is refuting allegations that the 5 January attack  on the Inter-Arms Regiment camp was the opposition's doing. He  spoke to Raphael Mbadinga a few minutes ago.    [Begin recording] [(Fabre)] Last night a reporter alleged  that the attack was from the opposition wing which refused to  take part in the parliamentary elections. Of course, I strongly  protest these unfounded statements. The UFC has always said  that conditions of security and fairness have not been met for  holding parliamentary elections. In our view, the minimum  requirements we laid down have not been met; therefore, we said  that if they were not met we would not take part in the  elections. I think the facts confirm our analysis that there  has been a recurrence of violence in Lome, which began around  1830 on 5 January. Shots are still being fired now.    [Mbadinga] No, no it ended at 2130....    [(Fabre), interrupting] No, no, I live in a suburb near the  Aflao border and at 0600 this morning there were still shots.    [Mbadinga] You say that the opposition has nothing to do  with this violence. Does the opposition suspect there is a lead  on that?    [(Fabre)] I would not like to comment on that, but I am  inclined to think there is a mutiny at the military camp. I am  inclined to favor that theory. [end recording]</p>

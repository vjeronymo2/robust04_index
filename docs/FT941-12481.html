			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: News in brief Halifax building society is making its fixed and capped rate mortgages portable from Tuesday. But existing customers may have to pay a transfer fee of Pounds 75 when they move their mortgage to a new home. Halifax's fixed rates include 6.2 per cent (6.6 APR) until April 30 1996; 6.7 per cent (7.1 APR) to the end of April 1997; 7.2 per cent (7.7 APR) to April 30 1999; and 7.99 per cent (8.6 APR) until April 30 2004. Application fees are between Pounds 150-250 and there are early redemption penalties. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has issued a new rate of 5.5 per cent (5.7 APR) fixed for two years for a Pounds 250 application fee. The early redemption penalty is four months' interest; the mortgage is portable. C&amp;G's five-year fixed rate at 6.99 per cent is still available. The society has introduced a discount of 3 percentage points on its standard variable rate of 7.64 per cent in the first year of the mortgage to those with a deposit of 20 per cent. This brings down the variable rate to 4.64 per cent (7.7 APR). Applicants with a smaller deposit of 5 per cent or more are still being offered a discount of 2 percentage points on the standard rate for the first year. The Woolwich has replaced its 7.75 per cent seven-year fix with one of 7.5 per cent (8.1 APR if the mortgage is repayment, or 7.9 APR if an endowment). The application fee is Pounds 295 and there is an early redemption penalty of six months' interest. Chelsea building society has issued two new fixed rates. The first is 5.99 per cent (6.4 APR) fixed until June 30 1997 for loans of up to 90 per cent of the value of the property. The second is a 6.99 per cent (7.6 APR) until June 30 1999. The administration fee is Pounds 245 and the borrower must take out the society's buildings and contents insurance for the whole of the fixed-rate period. The mortgages are portable. While there are plenty of fixed rates on the market, capped rates are harder to find. These fix a ceiling on the interest rate and allow the borrower to benefit from lower rates if interest rates fall below the ceiling. Yorkshire building society has a number of capped rates. These are 6.10 per cent until the beginning of January 1996; 6.55 per cent until January 1 1997; and 6.95 per cent capped until January 1 1998. The arrangement fee is Pounds 250 and early redemption penalties are between three to four months' loss of interest. The society's buildings and contents insurance has to be taken out for the first year. The maximum loan is Pounds 150,000 and the capped rates are all portable. Lloyds Bank Stockbrokers is launching a telephone share-dealing service with a free advisory service. Sharedeal Direct will offer instant dealing facilities from 8am to 5pm on business days. Commission on UK equity transactions will be 1.5 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 18.50. The service is open to the public and calls to Sharedeal Direct will be charged at local rates.</p>

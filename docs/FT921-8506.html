			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Business optimism 'declines' FEWER small and medium-sized companies are optimistic about commercial prospects than three months ago, according to a survey by 3i, the venture capital group, Peter Marsh writes. The study supports indications that business confidence has fallen recently, although it says the ingredients for a recovery are in place. According to the survey of 1,000 companies in which 3i has a financial stake, 45 per cent expect sales to improve over the next three months. The proportion was 49 per cent in the autumn survey. Confidence appears to be higher in the south and Midlands than in the north, with service companies having a rosier view than those in manufacturing. Staniland Hall, a business research company, forecasts a 1.9 per cent increase in consumer spending this year, exactly balancing the fall last year. It says it is 'cautiously confident' of a general economic upturn.</p>

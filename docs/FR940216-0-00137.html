			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One foreign refiner commenter to the 1992 SNPRM objected to this baseline-setting scheme on the grounds that some domestic refiners may receive baselines dirtier than the statutory baseline due to their ability to use actual or inferred 1990 production values, while most importers, and therefore foreign refiners, would be subject to the statutory baseline and would not enjoy an opportunity to use an individual baseline dirtier than the statutory baseline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 69 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This would occur because it is unlikely that domestic importers that do not own foreign refineries maintained records of 1990 imported gasoline characteristics adequate to establish an individual baseline. The commenter recommended that foreign refiners be permitted to establish individual baselines using Methods 1, 2 and/or 3 to establish their baselines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 69 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  This issue is primarily of concern to foreign refiners whose actual 1990 production characteristics exceed the statutory baseline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA gave serious consideration to this comment, and in the 1993 SNPRM described the concerns raised by the comment and the alternatives suggested by the commenter, and invited comment on the issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the 1993 SNPRM several commenters objected to providing foreign refineries with individual baselines on the grounds that such baselines would promote gaming of the system, thereby reducing the air quality benefits sought under the Act, and would provide foreign refiners with a competitive advantage. Because foreign refiners do not have to comply with the reformulated gasoline program's anti-dumping provisions for conventional gasoline sold outside of the U.S., the commenters alleged that foreign refiners can produce reformulated gasoline at lower overall cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other comments were received that supported the granting of foreign refinery baselines, on the grounds that such baselines would enhance competition among gasoline suppliers within domestic US markets, to the advantage of the public generally. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes the comments related to any competitive consequences of baselines are irrelevant. As a result, EPA has rejected all comments relating to competitive concerns, and EPA's decisions regarding the manner in which baselines are set are not influenced by such considerations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant comments on this issue, EPA has determined to implement the baseline provisions described above. The detriment to the U.S. environment associated with the potential establishment of inaccurate refinery baselines by current and possibly future foreign sources of imported gasoline, along with the difficulties associated with monitoring compliance with the anti-dumping and reformulated gasoline programs, compel the Agency to require that domestic importers establish individual baselines using Method 1 or that they comply with the anti-dumping statutory baseline, and to not establish individual baselines for foreign refiners. This scheme is consistent with the scheme of requiring refiners, domestic or foreign, to measure compliance against an accurate and verifiable baseline that is based on adequate and reliable data. The approach is also consistent with EPA's intent to avoid the creation of options within the baseline setting scheme that would allow gaming by the regulated community. Further, the scheme is consistent with EPA's compliance monitoring and enforcement capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. U.S. Energy Security <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that requiring foreign refiners to produce to the statutory baseline would result in a shortfall of imported gasolines to the U.S. EPA's analysis indicates that gasoline supplies will be unaffected by implementation of the proposed baseline requirements. This conclusion is based on the likelihood that the baseline proposal would at most result in a small change in gasoline imports in limited markets, combined with the excess domestic refining capacity, and the expansion of gasoline volume that will result from the oxygenate use mandated for domestic gasoline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA concludes that the baseline provisions adopted today pose no significant problem for U.S. energy security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

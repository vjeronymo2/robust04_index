			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMBAT IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> 'AS LONG AS IT TAKES' -- PRESIDENTIAL EXCERPTS  </P> <P> Excerpts from President Bush's news conference Thursday.  </P> <P> On Noriega  </P> <P> Q: Mr. President, one of your major objectives was to get Noriega. Are you  frustrated that he got away? How long will you keep on chasing him? And are you  confident that you'll get him?  </P> <P> A: I've been frustrated that he's been in power this long -- extraordinarily  frustrated. The good news: He's out of power. The bad news: He has not yet been  brought to justice. So I'd have to say . . . there is a certain level of  frustration on that account. The good news, though, is that the government's  beginning to function, and the man controls no forces, and he's out. But, yes,  I won't be satisfied until we see him come to justice.  </P> <P> Q: How long will you keep up your full-scale pursuit?  </P> <P> A: As long as it takes.  </P> <P> On Noriega Bounty  </P> <P> Q: What led you to approve of the decision to have a bounty on Noriega . . . ?  </P> <P> A: His picture will be in every post office in town, that's the way it works.  He is a fugitive drug dealer and we want to see him brought to justice. And if  that helps, if there is some incentive for some Panamanian to turn him in,  that's a very -- a million bucks that I would be very happy to sign the check  for.  </P> <P> On Casualties  </P> <P> Q: Did you expect (the casualties) to be so high on both sides? And also was it  really worth it to send people to their death for this? To get Noriega?  </P> <P> A: We had some estimates on the casualties ahead of time, but not in numbers. I  mean, it was more general -- that, "Look, Mr. President, no way can you do an  operation this large and not have American casualties." So the Defense  Department was very up front with us about that. And every human life is  precious, and yet I have to answer, yes, it has been worth it.  </P> <P> Q: What can you tell us about civilian casualties, specifically Panamanian  civilian casualties down there?  </P> <P> A: Our numbers are almost nonexistent, and I heard some reports from a  hospital, and we've not been able to confirm those numbers, that some civilians  were killed.  </P> <P> On Use of Force  </P> <P> Q: A few months ago, you said your complaint was not with the PDF (Panama  Defense Forces), not with the Panamanian people, but with Noriega only. You  also said . . . that you didn't think it would be prudent to launch a  large-scale military operation. What changed your mind, and particularly why  did you opt for the maximum use of force in this situation?  </P> <P> A: I think what changed my mind was the events that I cited in briefing the  American people on this yesterday: the death of the Marine, the brutalizing,  really obscene torture of the Navy lieutenant, and the threat of sexual abuse  and the terror inflicted on that Navy lieutenant's wife, the declaration of war  by Noriega, the fact that our people down there felt that they didn't know  where this was going and they weren't sure what all that meant and whether that  meant we could guarantee the safety of Americans there. And so I made a  decision to move and to move with enough force -- this was the recommendation  of the Pentagon -- to be sure that we minimized the loss of life on both sides.  . . .  </P> <P> On the Hostages  </P> <P> Q: Mr. President, what do you know about Americans held against their will, and  what are you doing now to free them?  </P> <P> A: I'm looking for help on that because we don't have a count. And if there are  a lot of them, we don't know about it. But, I just had a briefing -- I don't  know whether Cheney's still here.  </P> <P> Q: Well, the Pentagon said, sir, there were 12 open cases.  </P> <P> A: Well, I'll tell you, that included probably those Smithsonian people who  have now been released, and I think there may have been 9 or 10 of those. So --  but, I'd just have to get Marlin to get back to you.  </P> <P> Q: Well, does that indicate that that's not a priority in the reporting to you  --  </P> <P> A: No. It indicates to me that it's very hard to know what's going on when  there's a fire fight and a battle. . . .  </P></p>

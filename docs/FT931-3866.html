			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: British Gas uncertainty behind Victaulic fall UNCERTAINTY over the future of British Gas was behind Victaulic's 5.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year end to December 31. Profits at the pipes and fitting maker fell from Pounds 14.32m to Pounds 13.55m on reduced sales of Pounds 101.2m (Pounds 114.8m). The company's main market with British Gas has suffered from the uncertainty over the future structure and ownership of the pipeline network. Mr David Stewart, managing director, said British Gas had cut back on all discretionary spending on the network unless there was a pay-back within a year. 'There has also been a squeeze on costs because of the pricing formula on domestic gas.' Mr Stewart believes the uncertainty will continue after publication of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the future of British Gas. 'I do not think we will see any benefits until 1994' said Mr Stewart. In the group's other main market, there was a reduction in the level of refurbishing distribution mains in the water industry. However, the company benefited from the increased penetration of the market by polyethylene pipe. Lindapter International, which sells and designs specialised construction products, was bought from the receiver of Henry Barrett Group for Pounds 4.8m. The group still ended the year with net cash of Pounds 6.2m. Earnings per share fell to 20.3p (21.25p). The final dividend is increased to 5.3p (5p) giving a total of 7.8p (7.35p).</p>

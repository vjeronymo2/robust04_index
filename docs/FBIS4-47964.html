			<p>BFN     [Text] In Zaire, the political debate is deadlocked. In  spite of two meetings this week, the High Council of the  Republic-Transitional Parliament has not reached a consensus on  the appointment of a prime minister. The radical opposition,  which has distanced itself from the interim parliament, has not  changed its position at all and asserts its support for Etienne  Tshisekedi. This is what (Christian Badibangi), the vice  minister of external relations in the Tshisekedi government,  explains to our reporter Francois-Luc Moukouangui.    [Begin (Badibangi) recording] One has the impression that  the  Sovereign National Conference [SNC] has been forgotten. Our  people have been forgotten. We are trying to demonstrate that  the people are tired and that it is a matter for Mobutu and the  Union for Democracy and Social Progress.    The Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies,  composed of several political parties and civil organizations,  asserts that Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi is the elected candidate of  the SNC. The promulgated law, our Constitution, recognizes that  this legal decision is not the responsibility of the opposition,  a political family distinct from that of the head of state which  cannot present a candidate for prime minister.

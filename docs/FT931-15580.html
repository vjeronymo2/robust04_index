			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard slips 13% to Pounds 6.5m ELLIS &amp; Everard, the chemicals distributor, announced a 13 per cent fall in interim profits as recession continued to affect its main markets in the UK and US. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 6.5m in the six months to October 31, in line with market expectations. Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said business remained difficult and chemical prices had continued to slip in the US. 'But we've held our own in our major markets,' he said. Turnover fell from Pounds 198m to Pounds 190.1m reflecting disposals and lower average dollar exchange rates. US sales increased 8 per cent in volume terms but after the effects of price decreases and sterling conversion, the US contribution was 4 per cent lower. The UK performed well and recorded volume gains and slight price increases, Mr Wood said. But the swimming pool chemicals division, which made a promising start to the period, tailed off badly and saw profits dive to about Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 700,000). Preymer, the company's 70 per cent-owned Spanish subsidiary, remained in the red. Rationalisation in the swimming pools division cost about Pounds 150,000. Mr Michael Marshall, the former executive chairman who resigned in July, received compensation of Pounds 350,000. Mr Wood said the company hoped to announce a replacement for Mr Marshall before releasing full year results in July. Net borrowings almost doubled to Pounds 18m, taking gearing to 27 per cent compared to 14.3 per cent at the year end. The increase was due to currency translation changes and seasonal factors; interest costs fell to Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 1m) due to lower borrowing levels. Earnings fell to 5.5p (6.7p) per share. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.25p. COMMENT Times remain tough for Ellis &amp; Everard and, despite a glimmer of hope in the US, it is difficult to see much recovery flowing through to the results until well into next financial year. Meanwhile, the swimming pools and European operations remain disappointing, especially after the company highlighted pools' strong performance last year. This suggests full year profits will remain flat with analysts pencilling in Pounds 12.5m. Despite yesterday's 7p fall to 188p, the shares are on an expensive multiple of 18. After a strong run since November - along with other second line chemicals companies - the market may need further signs of recovery before allowing the shares to go higher.</p>

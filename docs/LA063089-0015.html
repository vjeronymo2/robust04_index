			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESSMAN BEILENSON  </P> <P> Our experience with Rep. Tony Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) has been the exact  opposite of the impression created by your article ("Beilenson: An Appetite for  the Big Issues," Part I, June 12).  </P> <P> Tony Beilenson is indeed an intelligent, thoughtful legislator. This explains  why he has won some tough assignments in Congress as a chair of the House  Intelligence Committee, a member of the House Budget Committee, and a leader in  efforts to reform the budgetary process. At the same time, he has shown a deep  and abiding interest in the issues affecting the Los Angeles lesbian and gay  community which is a sizeable part of his constituency, and our major concern.  </P> <P> Tony has taken time to focus on many of the legislative issues affecting  federal AIDS policies, and he has been totally responsive to our community in  working to make funding and treatments available. He also has a 100% voting  record on issues related to ending discrimination based upon sexual  orientation.  </P> <P> Tony has been a truly responsive, concerned and committed congressional  representative. He has always made himself available to meet with our  organization to discuss issues before Congress.  </P> <P> Rep. Beilenson is cherished because he places principle before politics.  </P> <P> BEVAN DUFTY  </P> <P> Co-Chair  </P> <P> JACKIE GELFAND  </P> <P> Co-Chair  </P> <P> Municipal Elections Committee  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

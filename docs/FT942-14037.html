			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Italian business empire seized The L2,000bn (Pounds 833m) grain and property empire of Mr Pasquale Casillo was yesterday seized by magistrates after the Foggia-based businessman was arrested on charges of links with organised crime and defrauding the European Union. Mr Casillo, chairman of Foggia football club, is alleged to have cheated the EU of some L300bn. This is believed to be the biggest single charge brought against an individual for such an offence. His arrest apparently followed information supplied by members of the Camorra, the Naples Mafia, which earlier this week led to the arrest of the former head of the Naples police and other senior policemen.</p>

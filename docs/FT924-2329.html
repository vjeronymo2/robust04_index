			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Books: Politician without a permanent address - Robert Blake discusses a neglected aspect of Churchill's career CHURCHILL ON THE HOME FRONT: 1900-1955 by Paul Addison Jonathan Cape Pounds 20.00, 493 pages IN 1975 Paul Addison published a brilliant and original study of British domestic policy in the Second World War The Road to 1945. Now he has written a most illuminating book on a neglected aspect of the career of the most remarkable statesman of the 20th century. I do not know whether or not Paul Addison originally intended to write a comprehensive biography of Churchill but, he has in the event concentrated on his role in social and economic affairs rather than in war and foreign policy. This is a sensible decision and fills a significant gap. There have been studies of aspects of Churchill's domestic role, notably in Anthony Seldon's Churchill's Indian Summer, an account of his last government. But no one hitherto has told the whole story. Churchill's political career which lasted 55 years brought him as much in contact with home affairs as military and imperial. President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, Minister of Munitions, largely concerned with industrial and labour problems, and finally Chancellor of the Exchequer 1924 to 1929. And, although his great premiership was mainly concerned with war, no prime minister can entirely ignore what is happening inside his country. Churchill's attitude to social and economic problems was a curious mixture of the radical and the reactionary. As President of the Board of Trade 1908-10 he, along with Lloyd George, can claim much of the credit for inaugurating what came to be known after the second world war as the 'welfare state'. Liberalism he declared in October 1906 was 'the cause of the left-out millions'. Churchill's genuine radicalism was designed to make the capitalist system more humane and more acceptable. He never thought for a moment in terms of replacing it by something quite different. All his life, one full of inconsistencies, he had a consistent antipathy - socialism. He described it in a speech in October 1906 as 'a monstrous and imbecile conception which can find no real foothold in the brains and hearts of sensible people'. Most Conservatives would agree, and dislike of socialism does not in itself brand him as reactionary. But there were attitudes which do. His intense aversion to Indian self-government in the 1930s was one and he certainly did his best to block Beveridge and the Coalition plans for post-war reconstruction in 1943-45. For most of his political life Churchill was simply not trusted. This was partly because of his somewhat dubious 'court', Birkenhead, Beaverbrook, Boothby, Bracken etc, but it was also because - particularly in home affairs  -he refused to think in party terms. He changed parties twice and seldom stayed long on the same stance within the party to which he had moved. Churchill, as Addison puts it, 'was a politician without a permanent address'. Not the least valuable service performed by this fascinating book is to show how and why the greatest political figure of his time found himself in this ambivalent position until the events of 1940 transformed the whole situation and made him a national hero.</p>

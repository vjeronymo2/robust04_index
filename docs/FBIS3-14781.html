			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 27/2/1994 -- This morning  President Mircea Snegur and his wife voted, between the first  ten electors, at section No. 2 at Russian general school No. 37  of Chisinau. Asked to comment on his critical attitude towards  the opposition, expressed yesterday on television, Snegur  replied: "Critical attitude? Have you understood that the  critical attitude at yesterday's broadcast was addressed to the  opposition? Very well." Asked "can there be any free elections  while Dniester is occupied by the 14th Army," the president said  "it is a real situation we have at this moment. However, we  believe that in the Republic of Moldova elections take place for  the first time on the basis of democracy and pluripartitism. In  what regards Dniester, the executive took a series of measures  to allow citizens in this part of the republic take part in the  voting. Nevertheless, if we would be thinking only of this, I  mean wait first for the final solution of the Dniester problem  and only after that run the elections, we would halt other  urgent measures. It is necessary first of all to have a  parliament that would contribute to the most urgent solution of  Dniester's problem." Snegur declared that yesterday's release  of persons who organized the October rebellion in Moscow "is an  internal problem of Russians and they will manage without us."  Inquired if it is significant that he voted in a Russian  school, President Snegur said "with us, electoral sectors, like  the lodging place, are not established on ethnic principles. I  live in the immediate vicinity of this voting section." Asked  by the BASAPRESS reporter about how will things evolve in case  there will be no prevailing majority in parliament, Snegur  estimated that "it is hard to suppose, but I believe a new hard  process will start, with attempts of conciliation and  cooperation firstly between parliament factions, then between  parliament and presidency. It would be good, however, if we had  a majority faction in parliament." Asked why he voted so early  and if, in his opinion, enough voters will follow his example,  Snegur said "elections will run in an organized manner and with  an active participation of electors, and the fact that I came to  vote in the very morning is due to my responsibility and because  my today's agenda includes many questions. On the other hand,  the most pleasant moment for me is meeting my nephew whom I can  see only on Sundays."</p>

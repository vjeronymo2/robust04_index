			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Arts: Philippe Genty's 'Forget Me Not' - Dance Is it too late for some kind statesman to insert into the Maastricht Treaty a clause banning all European programme blurb from this country? Please, please, please? And is it too much to ask anyone visiting the Compagnie Philippe Genty, now at Sadler's Wells for a fortnight, to refrain from reading the programme? Genty's show, Forget Me Not, has some enthralling episodes - enthralling till you read the poetic meanings Genty attaches to them. I quote: 'So who's falling? You, the reader, Or me, the scribbler? It all depends on which memory we're in. Mine. Or yours.' One (typical) biography tells us that Catherine Martin 'was a happy little girl amongst her twenty midget brothers and sisters. Enchanting music was always flowing in her head, her pretty little feet kept moving gracefully.' (Genty soon put a stop to that, by the way.) Genty is an illusionist. Watching his work is simple, and often pleasurable. When his illusions are at their best, they achieve far greater poetic eloquence than his blurb; and even when they are feeble, his spiel misses the mark. In Forget Me Not, he and his seven performers conjure up vision upon vision. Sometimes we see how the illusion is achieved, as when, early on, we discern that half the 14 people in evening dress are in fact life-size puppets; and then we laugh. Sometimes, as when one woman is suddenly replaced out of thin fabric by another, we do not know how it is done; and then we are amazed. Forget Me Not has three dominant metaphors: the connection between people and apes; that between people and puppets; and the emergence of people from base material. We see an ape in an evening dress watching all the rest of the spectacle, and we see figures in evening dresses suddenly acquiring ape heads. Genty means some Planet of the Apes idea here, but he seldom develops it interestingly. And the person/puppet theme is too thinly developed - despite marvellous incidents. Humans turn into dolls, and vice versa; or humans are confronted by lifelike, lifesize puppets, by Gargantuan teams, by Lilliputian replicas. But the show does become extraordinary - a Darwinian nightmare - in the scene when we see people locked like larvae into what look like lumps of clay. Gradually three women break free, like butterflies from chrysalis form. By then, however, we see that the clay lumps move, are animated; that they are in fact some kind of huge amorphous slugs. Then the slugs coalesce, to become a heavy, dull, five-legged creature with a huge body, which threatens to consume humans. Later, we see people trapped in other clay-like amoeba, meshed to it by horrid membrane and sucked back into the bowels. 'This is not just dance,' says Genty's programme stuff. Actually, this is just not dance - though it contains bits of social dance and acrobatic movement and is wordless. It is less like dance than Pilobolus (which it resembles or imitates), because it has no particular overall rhythmic coherence. It also lacks the dream logic to tie its metaphors into a fluent work of theatrical art. A pity. The eloquence of its best passages turns out to be just a passing effect. And the occasional cuteness of French humour is another problem. Forget Me Not is really just an absorbing circus trick. You cannot help wishing (like Genty) that it were something more. Sadler's Wells until March 13</p>

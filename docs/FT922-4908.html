			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ymos turns in DM200m loss YMOS, one of Europe's largest car components manufacturers, has reported losses of nearly DM200m (Dollars 124m) for 1991, mainly because of 'balance sheet fraud'. Speaking at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting in Frankfurt, Mr Gerhard Krischer, chief executive, explained how a review over recent months had produced evidence of sustained fraud. This will contribute DM110m to a total loss of DM196m for last year. Turnover was DM660m. Mr Krischer said that the losses, which have wiped out shareholders' equity, will necessitate a capital write-down and an injection of fresh funds. This will be backed by Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian company which took a majority stake in Ymos in February 1990. On top of the loss caused by the alleged fraud, operating losses last year were DM35m including restructuring costs; a reorganisation of the valuation process for tool subsidies led to a further DM44m loss; and losses of DM8.5m were brought forward from the previous year. According to the chief executive, the alleged fraud involved improper accounting for the ownership of tools; falsely obtained government subsidies; and asset manipulation involving double-counting of previously obtained subsidies. The alleged fraud took place before Cockerill Sambre bought its stake, the meeting was told. Without saying who was responsible,the company said it planned to press charges and seek damages. Investigations by accountancy firms had proved that over several years 'a false picture' of the company's business and financial position had been painted. This had shown either that the company had been making profits when in fact it had been making losses, or that losses were lower than they were in reality. 'This picture has now got to be corrected,' Mr Krischer said.</p>

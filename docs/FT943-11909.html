			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / British soldier killed in Bosnia Bosnian Serbs killed a British UN soldier yesterday in an attack on a UN convoy using a commercial route into Sarajevo which the Serbs had closed to put pressure on the United Nations and the Bosnian government in peace negotiations. The attack came as Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, warned of 'consequences' for the Serbs if they did not drop their opposition to the peace plan by Saturday. Bosnian Serbs opened fire on the convoy, wounding two British soldiers and one civilian and blowing up a fuel tanker. One of the soldiers was shot in the chest and died later of his wounds. UN sources said Nato warplanes were called in but did not fire because they could not identify a target. Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, said Serbs had mistook the white trucks and jeeps, bearing UN markings, for civilian vehicles but a British officer on the convoy said the UN had been directly targeted. Last night French forces, who went to recover British vehicles stranded in the attack, were fired on.</p>

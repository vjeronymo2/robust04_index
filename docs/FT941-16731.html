			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / South is given 133 flood warnings The National Rivers Authority has issued 133 flood warnings, including four red warnings - used when flood barriers are in danger of being breached - for areas in the south of England at high risk of serious property damage. The areas at most risk are: Salisbury on the river Avon. Chichester on the river Lavant. Aldershot on the river Blackwater. Newport Pagnall on the river Ouse. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, said yesterday the government would not compensate farmers and individuals suffering losses due to flooding. She said on BBC Radio: 'We don't have provision to compensate farmers or indeed individuals, and quite a lot of farmers do insure against severe weather conditions.' The National Farmers Union was surprised that Mrs Shephard ruled out compensation before the NFU had even formally requested government aid. It said that, although individual farmers had suffered serious losses, the flooding had not amounted to a 'national disaster' for farmers. Mr James Wiseman, group secretary for the Chichester branch of the NFU, said that most of the damage had been to crops and fields - which cannot be insured. The Association of British Insurers estimated that flooding over the past two weeks had caused damage of Pounds 30m-Pounds 60m. The storms of January 1990 caused Pounds 2.1bn of damage. High flood waters yesterday disrupted three British Rail lines in the south-west. Buses were in use between Didcot and Swindon on the route to Bristol and Wales, and on the Barnstaple to Exeter and Liskeard to Looe lines. Weather, Page 26</p>

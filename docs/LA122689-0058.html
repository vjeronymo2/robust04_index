			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: CHRISTMAS TIDINGS  </P> <P> East Berlin Encore: East Germans gave Leonard Bernstein a 10-minute standing  ovation after he conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on Christmas Day to  celebrate East Germany's peaceful revolution. The concert, which was broadcast  in the United States and other countries, followed a similar performance that  Bernstein had given the day before in West Berlin. The flamboyant American  composer-conductor was awarded a gold "star of friendship between peoples" by  East German Culture Minister Dietmar Keller, who hailed him as a political and  musical ambassador. "This is a historic moment for me, unlike any other in my  long, long life," Bernstein, 71, said with tears in his eyes as he accepted the  award. In a tribute to the opening of East Germany's borders and the crumbling  of Communist rule, Bernstein assembled an international orchestra and a choir  of both East and West German singers.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Turkey has formally asked the Belgian government  for information on the truth of the statements issued by the  Belgian interior minister and reflected in the press as though  the Turkish citizens are to blame for the incidents in Brussels.  Turkey announced that preventing the PKK [Kurdish Workers  Party] terrorist organization activities is above all the  requirement of international law.    A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry notes that  blaming  Turkish citizens is an unacceptable stand. The statement  further notes: We have no doubt that the Belgian authorities  are responsible for the incidents when they granted the PKK  supporters permission to hold a demonstration in an area heavily  populated by Turkish citizens, totally disregarding their  feelings. Belgian authorities prepared the groundwork for this  incident by not following Germany and France and banning the  PKK. Above all, preventing PKK terrorist activities is a  requirement of international law.    It was indicated in the statement that high-level  initiatives  were undertaken in Ankara and Brussels to communicate all the  above stated points to Belgian authorities.    The Foreign Ministry statement further expresses the wish  that Belgian authorities adopt a position which is in accord  with international regulations and in accord with the friendly  relations it has with Turkey.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Kasatyy, GUDOK correspondent: "Losses due to </F> Sub-Standard Performance -- 700 Million Rubles"]    [Text] An important reserve for increasing the  economic efficiency of railroad work is the elimination of  wrecks and accidents, and reduction of cases of sub-standard  performance in train and shunting operations.    Last year there were 799 cases of sub-standard performance,  4  wrecks and 3 accidents on the Volga Railroad.    Yu. Tsittel, chief of this railroad, reported at the  technical-economic council which took place, that the losses  from cases of sub-standard performance, accidents and wrecks in  1993 alone constituted over 700 million rubles [R]. Losses due  to late delivery of freight and commercial rejects were high.  Three wrecks out of four were because of track workers: labor  and technological discipline is low among fitters, brigade  leaders and even foremen.    As the speaker noted, according to last year's results,  because of the increase in sub-standard performance and the most  flagrant violations of safety rules, hardly a single road  management could be given a satisfactory evaluation. There are  almost twice as many absentees and drunks per thousand workers  on the Volga Railroad than on the average for Russian railroads.    Nearly always -- the established norms for repairing and  operating railcars and locomotives, STsB [Signalization,  Centralization and Blocking] and communication devices and other  transport-technical devices are violated.    "Our main trouble," said B. Ladyzhenskiy, first deputy chief  of the railroad, "is that we do not fulfill orders, but after  all, these documents formulate and define, with maximum  precision, the specific requirements for the workers carrying  out their duties, the directors of the lower subdivisions,  divisions, services and the road management.    "We have poor discipline and little sense of responsibility,  though. A railcar inspector goes out to process the trains with  a hook and an electric lantern, not having on him the necessary  gauges or measuring instruments, and thinks that this is normal.  By no means every road foreman knows how to use a track gauge  correctly.    "On two occasions recently I headed a road commission  checking the safety conditions on the Yershov Division," Boris  Timofeyevich went on, "Well? The Krasnyy Kut junction was a  disaster, because they work on the `take a chance' system there.  The inspectors pay calls there, but what use are these journeys:  they jot down various notes, as a matter of form, but take no  measures against safety violators. At the Pugachevsk Depot,  again on the Yershov Division, locomotives issued for passenger  trains are not inspected by a command staff, as the rules  require....    "The incompetence of those who are involved in train and  shunting operations has taken on a simply mass, threatening  nature. This example was given: at one depot, because of the  ignorance of the crew, it was not the electric traction motor of  a locomotive, which had got out of order, that was disconnected,  but -- the motor of one in good working order. In another case,  the engineer sent his assistant to shut off the distributor  valve on a rail car, but the assistant went and shut off the  brake end cocks and nearly deprived the train of the required  brake pressure. It was a good thing that the engineer noticed in  time and corrected the error, or they would have gone out onto  the section without any brakes."    These and numerous other examples of dense technical  incompetence attest to the fact that locomotive workers, railcar  workers, track workers, transport workers and other workers  involved in ensuring traffic safety have been very badly trained  everywhere. The ignorance and lack of skill of rank-and-file  people carrying out their duties very often leads to  sub-standard work and damage to locomotives en route.    The poor organization of training and raising qualifications  attests to the fact it is not those who just recently sat, let  us say, at a locomotive control panel, and not the novice  transport workers who violate the safety rules, but the  experienced workers. A first-class engineer drives a train with  false information about the brakes.    This means that training should be continuous, in order to  raise the vocational level of the workers.    As I. Tsinkerman, chief of the Signals, Communications and  Computer Technology Department, justifiably noted, the  competency of many commanders of various ranks is such that they  themselves must be taught the ABC's of the railroad business.  What kind of teachers are they, then, for their subordinates?    V. Nikitin, deputy chief of the railroad for Personnel and  Social Problems, expressed anxiety about the fact that the  number of engineers and technicians at the sites is being  sharply reduced. At the Astrakhan Division, one can literally  count on one's fingers the number of working railroad men who  are taking correspondence courses at transport VUZes [higher  educational institutions] and technical schools. Many positions  are held by practical workers whose technical knowledge is very  limited. It is clear that these people are not capable of  conducting technical training or directing production at today's  level. V. Nikitin noted that on the Pallasovka track  subdivision, they feel sorry for their drunken workers, and do  not fire them, but make drunkards of them and others. What kind  of safety can be ensured there from a track worker who is "under  the weather"?    Safety and finances are inseparable -- this was the essence  of the speech made by A. Korolkov, chief of the Financial  Department. Freight loading and shipment is now reduced by over  30 percent. This is where the large deficit in the road budget  comes from. Losses here due to sub-standard work, accidents and  wrecks constitute hundreds of millions of rubles.    Unfortunately, at the technical council, especially  dedicated  to safety, not a word was said about whether losses from  slip-shod workers are recovered. Later on I met with inspectors  and financiers, in order to get an answer to this question. It  turns out that damages can and must be recovered from those who  damaged rails, locomotives or railcars, in the railroad's favor,  in an amount not exceeding the monthly wage of the guilty person.    "Was much recovered from slip-shod workers during 1993?" I  expressed my interest to A. Korolkov, chief of the Financial  Department.    "So far, not all the amounts, since the materials on recent  accidents and cases of sub-standard work, and institution of  criminal proceedings against the guilty parties are at the stage  of investigation in the people's courts. Even if they decide  that the losses are to be recovered, quite a while will pass  before the money begins to come in.... And the prices for the  things will be different."    Nothing was said, either, about the public-spirited people,  or about the role of the assistant directors of the enterprises,  specially introduced to deal with safety. No evaluation was  given of the work of the inspector members of the staff for the  mainline and divisions. It is annoying that these topics,  important for safety, were omitted.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / A grown-up step into the baby food market: Sandoz sees its purchase of Gerber as a chance to balance its pharmaceuticals activities Executives of Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, were at pains yesterday to emphasise that splashing out Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.5bn) for a baby foods company did not mean that they were downgrading their commitment to drugs. 'If a good opportunity to take over a pharma company came along, we would do that too,' it said. But Sandoz's purchase of Gerber Food Products suggests it is not as confident as its Basle neighbour Roche in the future of the increasingly turbulent pharmaceuticals business. Roche made a Dollars 5.3bn offer for Syntex, a US drugs company, three weeks ago, and Mr Fritz Gerber, Roche chairman, reaffirmed his conviction that the research-based pharmaceutical business would continue to offer excellent profit potential. By contrast, Mr Marc Moret, Sandoz chairman, spoke of 'achieving a better balance of our activities,' at his group's annual meeting three weeks ago. Sandoz officials pointed out yesterday that the nutrition business, in contrast with drugs, was not capital intensive and was free from the sharp cyclical swings of the group's existing agricultural and industrial chemicals businesses. Assuming the acquisition goes through, the drugs arm's share of Sandoz sales will decline from 49 to 44 per cent while nutrition's share will rise from 11 to 20 per cent, surpassing the industrial chemicals division to become the group's second largest division. The nutrition business includes special diets and feeding systems for the ill and the aged, performance foods and drinks for athletes, and baby foods. Each product line has its own manufac-turing process and is likely to go through a different distribution channel. The only common factor is the perception of quality that enables suppliers to charge high prices. 'The important thing is to be in segments where you do not have to compete with the food giants,' says Mr Raymund Breu, Sandoz finance director. Sandoz got into nutrition in 1967 with the acquisition of Wander, the maker of Ovaltine. Today, about 40 per cent of the division's sales come from clinical nutrition and health foods, 22 per cent from Ovaltine and other food drinks, 26 per cent from baked goods and 5 per cent from sports drinks. Until last year, it looked as if the group was going to concentrate on the high specification 'nutriceutical' sectors, taking advantage of its pharmaceutical research and development skills. However, it then moved to build up consumer products, acquiring the Dutch Reforma group, Holland's largest producer of rice crackers and other cereal products with annual sales of Fl 42.4m (Pounds 15m). Sandoz also entered into a joint venture with Gazzoni, an Italian producer of health foods with annual sales equivalent to SFr180m (Pounds 85m). The Gerber takeover would be a giant step further in this direction, providing Sandoz with a strong US platform for its own nutrition products. However, as with Roche's bid for Syntex, questions will be asked about the 53 per cent premium over market value being offered for Gerber. Gerber commands more than 70 per cent of the US baby food market and usually achieves a very high return on its capital. Recently, however, it has been struggling to maintain sales. Yesterday it reported a decline in turnover from Dollars 1.27bn to Dollars 1.17bn for the year to March. Net profits fell from Dollars 132.8m to Dollars 113.6m. The company's main difficulty has been a decline in the number of American babies. Gerber has attempted to counter the impact of this trend by introducing products such as foods that bridge the gap between infant gruel and grown-up food. Its Gerber Graduates, introduced in 1991, are small microwave dishes such as chicken stew with noodles. It has also tried to target groups with higher birth rates. The Tropical line, for example - made with fruits such as papayas and mangoes - is aimed at Hispanics, who also tend to buy more ready-made baby food than other groups. Neither effort, however, has enjoyed much success and Gerber has had to contend with battles for US market share with its two main competitors, Ralston Purina's Beech-Nut division and HJ Heinz, leading to price cuts and higher marketing costs. To analysts like Mr Les Pugh of Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, it has long seemed that Gerber's best opportunities for growth lay in developing countries where birth rates are still high. Gerber itself has belatedly realised this, and now sells its products in at least 30 countries. But it has also realised that it would take many years to build up an adequate international distribution infrastructure. Both Gerber and Sandoz hope that the Swiss company will be able to provide that infrastructure quickly, and so restore growth. But existing suppliers in those markets, such as Nestle, are unlikely to give up their positions easily.</p>

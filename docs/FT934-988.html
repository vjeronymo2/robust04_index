			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Japan's bureaucrats find their citadel under siege Japan's bureaucrats, who believe they have run the country successfully for more than four decades, are suddenly under attack from a new coalition government that wants to weaken their grip on power. A dispute has arisen between Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister for international trade and industry, and his ministry, which likes to think it guided Japanese industry's remarkable rise from the wartime ashes. Mr Kumagai has demanded the resignation of one of the ministry's most senior officials, Mr Masahisa Naito, who is alleged to have unusually close ties to some companies and to have promoted unfairly another bureaucrat just before he left the ministry to stand as a candidate for the Liberal Democratic party. 'Enforcement of official discipline at administrative bodies is a big challenge for the government,' Mr Kumagai said. 'We have to correct these practices.' The issue of appointments is particularly sensitive for bureaucrats, who have traditionally arranged their own promotion ladder and sought soft landings in industry after retiring from the ministry. While claiming to be non-political, senior bureaucrats have often looked ahead to a second career as a politician, generally with the LDP. Mr Naito, director-general of the industrial policy bureau, denies having unusually close ties to industry and argues he should not resign for continuing the tradition of promoting a fellow bureaucrat leaving to become a politician. The idea is that a promotion, if in name only, would improve the candidate's chances of election, though it would also give an enduring sense of obligation to the ministry. Behind the row is an attempt by Mr Kumagai, a former Miti man himself, to strengthen the control of the Japan Renewal party over a bureaucracy sympathetic to the LDP. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the leader of a separate party, said he would let the minister solve the dispute, while LDP officials complained that the case was an 'unprecedented political intrusion into the bureaucracy'. Mr Hosokawa had promised to reduce the influence of Tokyo bureaucrats, but his inexperienced government has been accused of being even more dependent on them than the LDP. However, the government is attempting to cut bureaucratic collusion in awarding construction contracts and to reduce powers through deregulation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Thursday that deployment of  Patriot missiles is yet to be decided.    Seoul and Washington are looking into the military need for  deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea but have made no  decision, Han told reporters after a series of meetings with  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, Undersecretary of State  for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff and Assistant Secretary of  State for Political Affairs Robert Gallucci.    Han made a second stop in the U.S. capital on the last leg  of  a trip to North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) member  countries except Mexico to coordinate joint Seoul-Washington  measures on the North Korean nuclear problem.    His remark struck a different note from that of Defense  Secretary William Perry, who said he accepted a request for the  Patriot missiles by Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. Forces in  South Korea, and was currently discussing the timing and means  of transport with the Seoul Government.    The foreign minister said he expressed opposition to  Washington's move to reauthorize the much-feared Super 301 trade  legislation, which requires the USTR to identify and act against  nations that erect barriers to U.S. goods and services, in  retaliation for a broken trade agreement with Japan.    Kantor said that no action has been taken, with a decision  to  be made after watching developments in the Washington-Tokyo  trade framework negotiations, Han told reporters.    Han said Korea would likely be excluded from the priority  watch country list on intellectual property rights violations.  He added that he might meet President Bill Clinton on Friday  before boarding a flight to Seoul later in the day.    Predicting resumption of inter-Korean dialogue in "the near  future," Han reiterated that the third round of  Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks would be possible only  after full nuclear inspections and an exchange of envoys by the  two Koreas. However, he added that under certain conditions,  the date for the third round may be set and revealed earlier,  hinting that Washington could announce the date in advance once  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections begin and  inter-Korean contact resumes.</p>

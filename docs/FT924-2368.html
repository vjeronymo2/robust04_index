			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / As They Say in Europe: Swiss role gives food for thought IT IS NOT often that Switzerland provides a top story; in fact, it is rare even in Switzerland itself. But the referendum on the beautifully-named European Economic Area, and its resulting No, became a two-day wonder. As a result, the Swiss have now taken their place among that growing band of European editors' unloved nations. In neighbouring Bavaria, they had a good gloat. 'The economic crisis, growing unemployment, the feeling that Switzerland's golden years are over, all that provided fruitful soil for painting things black and false images which all were directed towards to recipes of the past,' wrote the Suddeutscher Zeitung. Vienna's Die Presse feared that the Swiss result might mean increased financial burdens for Austria, but more probably it would add to local negative feelings about the EC. And, I can reveal, in Liechtenstein the result has thrown domestic politics into total confusion. French papers argued that the Maastricht treaty was to blame - it had proved to be a calamity that probably would be underlined by this weekend's Edinburgh summit, especially since the British would be running it. But, noted La Tribune de l'Expansion in a rare moment of generosity, it was not all Britain's fault. For the first time in my lifetime, events in Switzerland have provoked intellectual rumination on a matter of importance. And perhaps the country has become interesting in its own right: German-speakers voted No, the French Yes. So the francopohone Journal de Geneve wrote the word 'Nein' into its headline. A Lausanne paper said there would be a dramatic worsening of relations between French and German speaking communities 'with possibly the ultimate emergence of a better-structured and more dynamic French entity.' The media have been coy in supplying reasons for the emergence of this new (yet another) European fault line. The fact is that the francophone minority quite likes the French. The German speakers cannot abide the Germans. The possibility of an outright revolt by the francophones against the majority group raises the spectre of Switzerland becoming another Belgium. Oh dear - and I had been arguing how interesting it was. But, as they say, one thing is clear: Europe is going wrong. All those bits and pieces that made up the vision of a united Europe are disappearing from sight. The single market arrives without fanfare; European and monetary union are no more than a distant dream to some and a fading nightmare to others. The endless amendments to the Maastricht proposals that the so-called Euro-sceptics are putting forward in the British parliament to scupper the bill on European union are a waste of time: the Battle of Britain is over. The paradoxes abound and the moves to create greater unity in Europe have led to increased national friction and bitterness. The man in the street becomes more and more confused: I heard someone talking about 'oilseed subsidiarity' the other day. Even readers of the Financial Times might think, at first glance, that this is a real topic and, if an interviewer pressed a politician on it, the reply would be comprehensive and lengthy. The British want a referendum on the treaty and the union, which is odd since they view it as Wonderland through the Looking Glass. I would sooner vote on transubstantiation. In a curious departure, le Figaro produced a perceptive and sensible editorial on what forces were at work: 'To think that the Swiss have been contaminated by the Maastricht syndrome] Like Denmark, which rejected the treaty, and France, which gave it a narrow Yes, they have shown their allergy to the dominant materialism. 'To the technocrats, notably those of Brussels, who argue that the Swiss have snuffed out history, they have replied by expressing values impossible to quantify because they come from the depths of ages past. The economic arguments were incontestable. But it was the reasons of the heart that won.' Here is the nub of the whole question: it was the Swiss, of all people, who voted for raisons du coeur and against their economic interests. Even in the canton of Zurich, the majority voted against a money-making enterprise. Can gnomes turn in graves? It is all part of the general move to Euro-atavism outlined here a couple of weeks ago. As the Neue Zurcher Zeitung put it: 'In even stronger numbers than in previous years the notably unfavourable economic conditions led to a general rejection . . . however well-founded the proposal.' It was talking about the other referendum in Zurich last Sunday when the voters - for the fourth time since 1973 - defeated overwhelmingly a plan to increase the car tax. The majority against was bigger than ever. James Morgan is diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

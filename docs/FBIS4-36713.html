			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, June 3 (HTC) [HINDUSTAN TIMES  correspondent] -- Customs officials this morning confiscated a  consignment of a foreign magazine, which reached the cargo  terminal's import division from USA, as "it had objectionable  photographs of Indian flags being burnt".    A consignment of about 300 copies of FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC  REVIEW was confiscated by a customs inspector under the  supervision of an Assistant Collector Bandana Deori.    According to sources in the customs, the weekly magazine  carried several photographs of mobs burning the Indian flag.  The decision to confiscate the magazine was taken then and  there as the magazine issue is a current one.    When contacted the customs chief Anand Bordia said there are  specific government notifications pertaining to a) news items or  photographs distorting the Indian map b) news or photographs  which may incite communal passion c) news items or insertions  which can threaten the country's security and d) obscene  literature. He said on these grounds the customs is empowered  to confiscate any literature which is incoming or outgoing.    Mr Bordia said whenever such `distortions' are noticed the  customs sends the matter for opinion to the Ministry of Home  Affairs [MHA]. In the case of the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW,  the possible explanation of a quick decision to confiscate it  was due to lack of time. He said the magazine is a current  issue and since `abberation' conformed to the GOI [Government of  India] notifications, the magazines were seized before sending  the matter to MHA.    Sources in the cargo division also informed that a huge  consignment of another foreign magazine INDIA ABROAD was  confiscated recently as it has objectionable news reports on the  situation of the Kashmir Valley. Similarly, a book on Kashmir,  published from United Kingdom, was also banned entry to India by  the customs because of alleged inflammatory insertions about  militant ravaged Valley.</p>

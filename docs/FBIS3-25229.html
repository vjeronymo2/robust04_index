The  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  wanted to steal them, or worse, to destroy them. This happened  when men in the pay of Jonas Savimbi attacked the food convoy at  Alto Capaca, between Cubal and Ganda in Benguela Province. The  23-truck convoy carried food provided by the Angolan Government  and nongovernment organizations. The Angolan Armed Forces quick  intervention repelled the attack. Two drivers and Cubal deputy  administrator Domingos Carlito were wounded in the attack.</p>

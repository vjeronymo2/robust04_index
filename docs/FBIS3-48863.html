			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been disclosed that at the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks on the auto and auto parts sectors, the  United States has presented a 12-point demand for improvement,  maintaining "the Japanese system on auto standards and  authorization constitutes an import barrier." Included in these  demands are: procedures for inspection of imported cars should  be simplified; regulations on standards for designating  car-inspection factories should be eased; and information on car  registrations should be made available. These are additional  demands to those the United States has made since 1992 when  (then) U.S. President Gorge Bush brought up a 14-point demand  for improvements during his visit to Japan. Japan intends to  have these problems settled at the consultations held between  experts from the two nations; however, since it will be  difficult for Japan to agree to certain demands, it is now faced  with another problem in addition to the issue of setting  "numerical targets."    Regarding the 14-point demand that President Bush made  during  his visit to Japan, consultations have continued at the talks  between Japanese and American experts specializing in auto  standards and authorization systems. So far, an accord has been  reached on accepting the U.S. system of testing brakes.  However, other problems such as the acceptance of U.S.  standards on exhaust emissions remain to be settled. Therefore,  in addition to these problems, the United States has brought up  other demands at the framework talks.    Concerning simplification of import procedures, the United  States demands that the PHP [expansion unknown] system which  gives special treatment to imported cars -- whereby import of a  small number of cars requires only documentary inspection -- be  further simplified. It was also demanded that the government's  inspection of each imported car be eliminated and, moreover,  that the number of facilities designated for car inspection be  increased. This is because the United States believes that once  the number of such facilities is increased, the market for  U.S.-made auto parts will be expanded. In concrete terms, the  United States demands that when applying for designation as a  car-inspection facility, each center should be required to have  at least one, but not necessarily two, qualified mechanics.    In addition, the United States demands that for the purpose  of recalls (of defective cars for free repair), information on  car registrations (individual registration data) under the  control of the Ministry of Transport [MOT] should be made  available; and that the MOT should take measures to publicize  use of U.S.-made parts among various garages.    With regard to these demands, Japan is rather puzzled  because  "many of these demands were brought up because of  misunderstanding on the part of the United States" (as stated by  an MOT source). For example, an inspection is, in principle,  required for every new car whether it is domestically  manufactured or imported. Moreover, when "the system of model  designation," based on which the MOT approves the system of  quality control for certain models, is adopted, manufacturers  can apply for inspection procedures on behalf of users.    With the issue of making individual registration data  available, the Japanese side maintains that "since the data are  made available to manufacturers for the purposes of analyzing  statistics or for recalls, there is no discrimination against  foreign manufacturers."</p>

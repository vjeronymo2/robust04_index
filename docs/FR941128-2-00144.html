			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Because the fair market value of the Property Interest is less than the Prior Plan Accounts' aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the Property Interest, the Property Interest will be sold by the Trust to Otter for the aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the Property which totaled $61,406. The rental income received by the Prior Plan Accounts covered any interest which might have reasonably accrued on the holding costs as well as any interest which was due but not received under the second deed of trust loan. However, the rental income is insufficient to fully cover the actual holding costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because the Prior Plan Accounts have received a complete return of capital with regard to their investment in the Limited Partnerships, the Trust will sell the Limited Partnership Interests to Otter at their combined fair market values of $400,508. Accordingly, the Trust will sell the Interests for an aggregate sales price of $461,914.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The rental income minus the Prior Plan Accounts' pro rata share of the interest which was due but never received under the second deed of trust loan minus the interest which reasonably would have accrued on the holding costs equals $8,689 ($36,349 ^$23,554 ^$4,106). Because the holding costs amount to $11,406, the remaining rental income of $8,689 is insufficient to cover these costs.

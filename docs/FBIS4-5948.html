			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 14 KYODO -- Defense Secretary  William Perry on Thursday [14 April] abruptly postponed a visit  to South Korea and Japan planned for next week following the  accidental downing of two U.S. helicopters by American jets over  northern Iraq.    A Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Steve Little, said he does not  know when Perry will be able to make the trip.    "We don't know yet how long it will be delayed. The  scheduling is definitely a problem," little told KYODO NEWS  SERVICE by phone.    The Pentagon issued a statement about the cancellation of  Perry's trip hours after a senior Defense Department official  briefed reporters on the upcoming visit, which would have been  Perry's first to the region since becoming defense chief in  early February.    "The decision (to postpone the trip) was made to allow  Secretary Perry time to ensure that the families of those who  were killed are fully supported, to guarantee a thorough  investigation, and also to review the existing procedures," the  Pentagon said.    Perry was originally scheduled to arrive in Seoul on Sunday  and travel on to Tokyo on Tuesday before returning home on  Thursday.</p>

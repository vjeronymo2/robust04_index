			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: ABB shares in Jakarta power station order A CONSORTIUM of ABB Power Plants and Japan's Marubeni Corporation has signed a letter of intent with the Indonesian Electricity Board to build a Dollars 700m (Pounds 391m) power station at Tanjung Priok, near Jakarta. The order, for a 1,170MW combined cycle oil/gas fired station, is further evidence of the importance of the Asian market for western power generating equipment companies. ABB's share of the order will be about Dollars 350m. The Swiss-Swedish engineering group will supply equipment including its latest GT 13 E gas turbines. By using combined cycle technology, the overall thermal efficiency of the plant will be 50 per cent. Manufacturing for the order is likely to be carried out in Switzerland and Germany. Plant construction is due to start in the spring with completion at the end of 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM-TASS correspondent Viktor Kovalenko] </F>   [Text] Kiev April 8 TASS -- A team of U.S. energetics  experts, led by Deputy Secretary William White, is exploring the  possibility of promoting American-Ukrainian cooperation in the  effective uses of the coal-burning, nuclear and other branches  of the power industry.    White noted on Thurday evening that the purpose of this work  was to render Ukrainian scientists broader scientific and  financial support. In his opinion, ways should be sought to  make up for the 17-19 megawatts that are still being generated  by the Chernobyl atomic power plant and which account for about  seven per cent of the total quantity of electricity generated in  Ukraine. White also pins hopes on cooperation between the  Ukrainian and American nuclear laboratories in ensuring the  safety of nuclear power plants, on exchanges of experience in  the use of alternative sources of electric power.    "Today we are thinking how to stop the still working power  units of the Chernobyl atomic power plant. The turning point  came when the United States joined our effort to resolve  Ukraine's power problems," Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valeriy  Shmarov said during a meeting with White.    Shmarov stressed that Ukrainian power engineering  specialists  had completed the needed calculations and were ready to hold  consultations with American colleagues on the commissioning of  new generating units at the Khmelnitsk and Rovno nuclear power  plants by 1998 in order to be able to close down the Chernobyl  plant without any losses. Ukraine also has some technologies  for raising the effectiveness of coal combustion at thermal  power plants, but lacks the necessary money to implement them.    The question of the exchange of Ukrainian nuclear warheads  for Russian nuclear fuel was also discussed during the meeting.  White said that the 60 million U.S. dollars, earmarked to pay  Ukraine for the nuclear weapons withdrawn to Russia, had already  been remitted to the corresponding bank account.    The sides have agreed to sign joint documents after the  American experts complete their work and to set up an expert  commission to draw up proposals for the thrifty use of electric  power and the needed investments, and a document on cooperation  in solving problems linked with the Chernobyl atomic power plant.</p>

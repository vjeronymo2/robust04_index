			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY CRITICIZED OVER SEAWATER INTRUSION;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: AN INDUSTRY GROUP SAYS MORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT  SEEPAGE INTO FRESH GROUND-WATER SUPPLIES.  </P> <P> An association of geologists and drilling contractors Friday accused the agency  in charge of managing the county's ground water of incompetency for failing to  prevent seawater intrusion in water supplies.  </P> <P> The Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency should have pursued methods to  reclaim treated waste water and found means to store more water during wet  years in preparation for periods of drought such as the past three years, an  industry spokesman said.  </P> <P> Joel Barbour, a member of the Ventura County and Los Angeles chapter of the  California Groundwater Assn., said inaction by the agency has allowed seawater  to continue to creep into fresh ground-water supplies, threatening drinking and  irrigation supplies.  </P> <P> "Correcting seawater intrusion was a job given to an agency that hasn't done  its job," Barbour said. "It's time somebody did something."  </P> <P> Supervisor John K. Flynn, a member of the board of the Groundwater Management  Agency, said the industry's accusation stems from a motive for financial gain  and ignorance of the agency's accomplishments.  </P> <P> Since its creation in 1982, the Groundwater Management Agency has drilled  deeper wells to abate further intrusion into shallow underground pools and has  helped the United Water Conservation District with its Freeman Diversion Dam,  which is intended to capture and store additional water during wet years.  </P> <P> Also, the agency is enacting ordinances to prevent pumpers from extracting more  water than rainfall can replace, Flynn said.  </P> <P> "We have made phenomenal progress," Flynn said. The industry group is afraid  that restrictions on pumping, and consequently on drilling jobs, will become a  statewide practice, he said.  </P> <P> "They are opposed to all ground-water management in California," he said of the  industry group.  </P> <P> The industry's accusation came as the Groundwater Management Agency extended an  emergency ordinance banning drilling of new wells for another six months. The  temporary ordinance, enacted in January, is expected to be permanent in six  months. It forbids new wells but allows for the replacement or repair of  existing wells.  </P> <P> The agency on Friday also set Aug. 9 for a hearing and adoption of a second,  more far-reaching ordinance that would cut well-water pumping by 25% by the  year 2010.  </P> <P> The ordinances are necessary to retard the advance of seawater into the shallow  Oxnard and Mugu underground water basins, called aquifers. Since the 1920s,  growers on the Oxnard Plain have pumped more water from the basins than  rainwater could recharge, a condition called overdrafting.  </P> <P> Tests late last year revealed that saltwater had moved into the edge of the  deep Fox Canyon Aquifer, previously believed to be uncontaminated by the sea.  </P> <P> The Groundwater Management Agency, led by a board of appointed directors and  staffed by county employees, was formed in 1982 as a policy-making agency to  manage the ground-water basin and prevent further seawater intrusion.  </P> <P> The agency's formation averted action by the State Water Resources Control  Board in 1981, which threatened to take over the United Water Conservation  District's efforts to stop seawater intrusion. Also, the agency's formation  enabled the county to receive $8 million in federal money to pass to United for  projects to stop the intrusion.  </P> <P> The United Water Conservation District is responsible for recharging  ground-water supplies and regulating pumping for wells in its jurisdiction.  That area includes the Oxnard Plain and the Santa Clara River Valley.  </P> <P> United was recently warned by the State Water Resources Control Board that the  district must show why it has failed to stop the seawater intrusion or face a  reinstatement of the 1981 state board action to appoint a judge, called an  adjudicator, to oversee the seawater abatement program.  </P> <P> United, however, said the board was only looking for an update on United  projects.  </P> <P> But Barbour said the state board's action validates the position of the  industry's association.  </P> <P> "Nothing is being done to remediate the problem," Barbour said.  </P></p>

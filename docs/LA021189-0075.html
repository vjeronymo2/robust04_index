			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOW-BIZ BENEFITS  </P> <P> Re "Raising Their Voices to Aid Armenian Orphans" by John Burman, Jan. 31:  </P> <P> Show-biz types have recorded songs to benefit Armenia's earthquake victims,  starving Ethiopians, American farm families, Bangladesh, AIDS patients and  other causes. However, no one has written or recorded a song to help the  victims of the greatest disaster the world has ever known, the Chernobyl  nuclear accident. This unprecedented nuclear disaster, which will result in  economic and agricultural harm for hundreds of years, has been swept under the  rug.  </P> <P> Obviously, the show-biz folk are selective about disaster support.  </P> <P> MARTINE C.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yacine Lahcene: "Arms Trafficking Hubs"] </F>   [Text] The dismantling of terrorist networks and quantities  of arms seized in their vicinity offer convincing evidence...    Arms trafficking was a booming business in Algeria in the  late 1980's. But it has increased to a dangerous extent in the  last two years, with proliferation of terrorist groups that are  the principal beneficiaries.    Transported to Algeria in a number of different ways, these  weapons, often in large quantities, have ended up at the same  drop points in almost every instance: Setif, Khenchela, M'Sila,  Medea, or (less frequently) Chlef and Batna. Witness the  numerous hauls made by the security services in the last two  years.    Undoubtedly most spectacular was the raid at Setif that led  to the dismantling, almost exactly a year ago, of the largest  clandestine network to appear since independence. No less than  100 individuals, including traffickers, "fences," artisanal  weapons (fabricators) were arrested and 842 weapons captured.  And this was but the tip of the iceberg, since security services  went on several days later to make other arrests, as the  trafficking ring had branches in many other wilayas.    Altogether more than 500 traffickers were apprehended.  Investigation disclosed that the majority were black-market  operators.    A second large arms trafficking network was dismantled in  Setif. Beretta and Perfecta automatic pistols were among the  weapons seized.    Earlier on, the National Gendarmerie had neutralized 32  persons involved in a network formed in the Khenchela and Batna  regions.    In Central province, more specifically in Medea, the  National  Gendarmerie made another spectacular haul, not only dismantling  the network and seizing the weapons but also discovering and  destroying a laboratory for gun modification and artisanal bomb  fabrication. This dismantling of an international networking for  trafficking in weapons of war was a triumph for security forces,  but one that also vividly illustrated the current of arms  trafficking. The main leaders of this ring, 10 in number, were  arrested and imprisoned.    A number of other networks were also dismantled during this  two-year period, including those at Mila and M'Sila. But that  certainly does not mean all the networks in Algeria have been  shut down. There are still many others to continue provisioning  the terrorist groups--with the complicity, naturally, of certain  foreign countries that are always ready to provide traffickers  with facilities and support in this domain.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fears of frost in Brazil push coffee up to Dollars 1,000 COFFEE PRICES surged ahead in London yesterday as buyers rushed to the market in fear that Brazil's crop would be affected by frosts this week. London's September futures contract rose by Dollars 48 to touch a peak of Dollars 1,016 a tonne. But it later dropped to close at Dollars 1,000 as the New York market became very volatile. One private weather forecaster has estimated that there is a 50 per cent chance of frost in Brazil's Parana coffee-growing areas late today or early tommorrow. Other forecasters are more sceptical and put the chances of frost at 20 per cent or 30 per cent. Nevertheless, coffee traders remember the devastating frosts of 1975 that almost wiped out the Brazilian coffee crop and led to a boom in prices. For that reason any hint of frost is enough to push prices higher. Since 1975 Brazil has concentrated its plantings further north in regions less susceptible to frost. In the south, Parana now accounts for only 10 per cent of the country's crop; it was once the main coffee-growing state. Brazil's share of the world coffee crop has also declined so the impact of a frost on world prices could be less dramatic than in the past. Coffee prices have been depressed by high stocks in consuming countries such as the US and Europe. Last week the price was boosted by meetings between producers over a retention scheme and the threat of a frost in Brazil last weekend. If the frosts fail to materialise, prices could drop swiftly, one analyst suggested. Exporters in Cameroon estimate that the country's 1992-93 robusta coffee production will be just over half last season's level at about 45,000 tonnes, Reuter reports from Yaounde. The Douala-based Conseil Interprofessionel du Cafe et du Cacao said 1991-92 production was 85,409 tonnes. That figure was less than the ministry of industry and commerce's estimate of 97,835 tonnes, but local industry officials said the ministry figure was subject to manipulation by exporters. The CICC's executive secretary, Enouga Ntsimi, said all the 1991-92 crop had now been sold and forecast 1993-94 output at about 70,000 tonnes. Cameroon cut the producer price for robusta coffee by a third at the start of this season after the government had to subsidise 1991-92 production with 8.2bn CFA francs (Pounds 19m) in payments. Mr Ntsimi said most of the fall was normal, reflecting cyclical variation of yields from the coffee trees. But he estimated that 20 per cent was a result of farmers cutting down their trees.</p>

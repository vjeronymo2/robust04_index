			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Books: Wading through the muck - Anthony Curtis finds this Indian novel loaded with repellent anatomical detail / Fiction THE LAST BURDEN by Upamanyu Chatterjee Faber Pounds 14.99, 303 pages ON THE first page of this novel, the hero Jamun, an unmarried Indian man, a Hindu who works in insurance and is highly sexed and highly educated, walks to his office. On the way there he notices in the road a crushed dog from which 'blood plays like an effluent'. A few pages later he sees 'four donkeys (mules?) fucking in the dead centre of the road'. They remind him of the cover of the Classics Illustrated Comics of Cyrano de Bergerac - 'The donkey's cocks are contoured like Cyrano's nose, only farcically longer, all but a foot'. Jamun is urgently trying to get on a flight to his parents' house halfway across the sub-continent. He has just received a telegram from his brother Burfi, a few years older and married, containing the news that their mother Urmila, now in her sixties, has been rushed into Intensive Care. In a letter preceding the telegram Burfi had explained that 'Ma might have rectal cancer. It sounds dreadful and is very likely much worse. Haldia (the physician) said this evening that a lump in the rectum at her age is 75 per cent cancer'. Our hero broods on his mother's likely fate: '. . . Haldia will take away her sphincter and perhaps hawk it to a snooty restaurant, where it might well be used for an hors d'oeuvre . . .' Had enough? There is more to come. Not only is this novel loaded with calculatedly repellent anatomical detail, the style in which it is written is also deliberately off-putting. We know from his earlier novel English, August (Faber Pounds 5.99) - described on this page when it appeared in 1988 as 'delightful' - that Upamanyu Chatterjee can write with graceful purity. This time he has chosen to impede the narrative-flow with continual analogies as Jamun free-associates between past and present in language that always opts for the recondite word when the simple one will do. When two enormous cockroaches are discovered in the sour curd Urmila has prepared for supper, Jamun and his father complain bitterly. There ensues a family row - one of a great many throughout the book. 'Urmila ebbs away into hushed, unintelligible moans, like the soughing of the sea on distal sands'. At first you think that 'distal' there is a mis-print for 'distant' (which is what it means), but a visit to the Dictionary reveals that it is a latinate word (like better-known 'dorsal') used in biology to mean the outermost point of a body or form. A more frequent affectation is the use of 'suffix' as an intransitive verb meaning to utter the last biting remark in a spat as you leave the room. Upamanyu Chatterjee's characters are constantly 'suffixing' one-liners as they slam the door in a huff. The Dictionary does not give its support this time. Hitherto 'suffix' as a verb has only existed to describe the morphology of certain words (when the syllable '-en' is 'suffixed' to the word 'short' you get the word 'shorten'). What's the betting that the Chatterjee use of suffix will get into the next edition of the OED? Examples of such stylistic affectation could be multiplied. They make this a difficult novel to read, but for those who are prepared to persist, and wade through all the muck, there are ultimate rewards in store. By the end we do have a memorably complete picture of one contemporary middle-class Indian family at the moment when, through the collapse of its great maternal pillar Urmila, its temple-like structure lies in ruins. Never can the bonds of love that bind a family together have been expressed through so much acrimony and ill-feeling. Shyamanand, Jamun's father, is a dour government official now in retirement who has suffered a massive stroke resulting in partial paralysis (all recounted in horrendous detail). He behaves abominably to Urmila and to the other female member of the family Joyce, his elder son's wife who is a Christian. She has borne him two naughty grandchildren whose well-described antics are the most human thing in the book. The theme of elderly, failing parents and the burden they place on their offspring, emotional, economic, practical, is a universal one losing nothing from being placed with such precision and understanding in an Indian setting. Vikram Seth covered a great deal more ground in A Suitable Boy and much more readably in spite of that novel's excessive length. Here, in The Last Burden, we remember its handful of figures almost as if they were people who have played a significant part in our own lives.</p>

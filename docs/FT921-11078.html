			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Parker Pen auction may raise up to Pounds 300m PARKER Pen, the writing instrument maker, is for sale in a global auction likely to raise up to Pounds 300m, its advisers said yesterday. After three previous attempts to sell the company, this is the first time the international group has been marketed throughout the world. Mr Gerry Grimstone, head of the disposals unit at Schroders, the UK merchant bank, which is handling the sale, has drawn up a list of potential buyers in Europe, America and Asia. Parker is expected to make operating profits of about Pounds 33m this year, after investing Pounds 1m in a new stationery line, on sales of around Pounds 180m. It has borrowings of Pounds 54m. The group's managers, who bought out the group in 1985, are likely to become millionaires following the sale. Parker failed twice to float itself on the stock exchange in the 1980s. It agreed a friendly takeover with Pentland in 1988, only to see the Pounds 180m deal fall apart when its institutional backers objected. Mr Jacques Margry, chief executive, was then quoted as saying: 'I do not want any more offers.' However, advisers to Parker said Mr Margry and his management now want to leave the group after seven years in which they have concentrated on brand promotion and taking the group's image up-market. A sale by flotation was rejected because Schroders expects to raise more through a trade sale. Parker's advisers stressed that at the time of the aborted Pentland deal the group was not marketed to any other company.</p>

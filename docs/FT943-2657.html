			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Books: The Sixties deconstructed - Peter Aspden on sex, drugs, rock and roll and the decline of western civilisation REVOLUTION IN THE HEAD: THE BEATLES' RECORDS AND THE SIXTIES by Ian MacDonald Fourth Estate Pounds 15, 373 pages FAITHFULL by Marianne Faithfull with David Dalton Michael Joseph Pounds 15.99, 333 pages X-RAY: THE UNAUTHORISED AUTOBIOGRAPHY by Ray Davies Viking Pounds 17.50, 419 pages It is the summer of 1966 and London, as pronounced by no less than Time magazine, is the city of the decade. Frank Sinatra is fighting a brave rearguard action in the singles' charts with 'Strangers in the Night', but his nocturnal ramblings belong to a different age. The talk everywhere is of light, sun, hope and glory. The lazy shuffle of the Kinks' 'Sunny Afternoon' knocks the mocking exuberance of the Beatles' 'Paperback Writer' off the top of the hit parade in the very week that Bobby Moore receives the glistening Jules Rimet Trophy from the Queen. The vibe spreads; in the US, 8,000 Vietnam protestors encircle the Pentagon in an attempt to levitate it. Nothing seems impossible. The Beatles take their demotion with good grace; they are preparing for the release of Revolver, an album so packed with ideas and innovation that they can afford to be magnanimous. Ian MacDonald, in his loving and superbly-argued analysis of the group's recorded legacy, is unoriginal in seeing this splendid moment as a cultural peak from which we have gradually been descending into mass-produced banality; his success is to show in the finest detail just what went into the seemingly effortless succession of masterpieces, and how the whole thing - the Beatles and the Sixties - came apart. The book's meticulous track-by-track examination is a fund of fresh insights into very familiar territory. To take just one example, MacDonald reveals that 'Michelle', commonly considered an irritatingly cloying piece of McCartney-esque whimsy, was in fact co-written by John Lennon, who stole a line from Nina Simone's 'I Put a Spell on You' for its middle section. Playfully ironic throughout ('I want you, I want you, I want you; I think you know by now'), the refined finishing touch was applied by McCartney's pain-staking bass line, which he described as 'a kind of Bizet thing' (referring to the habanera from Carmen). This was no throwaway nursery rhyme, yet what was envisaged as an album filler was good enough to take The Overlanders to number one for three weeks. The relationship between Lennon and McCartney unsurprisingly forms the human core of MacDonald's musings. Again, the story is hardly unfamiliar: the two friends who initially channel their competitiveness into their work, only to get bogged down in jealousy, rancour and law suits. But MacDonald reverses some of the more obvious stereotypes, emphasising Lennon's capacity for sentimental balladeering ('This Boy', 'If I Fell', 'Yes It Is') and McCartney's penchant for biting sarcasm (asked for a sleeve-note for Lennon and Yoko Ono's Two Virgins, he responded with: 'When two great Saints meet, it is a humbling experience'). By the time of Abbey Road, both the Beatles and the decade were falling into disrepute. MacDonald takes the bold step of identifying one song, Lennon's 'Come Together', as a turning point, 'embodying a pivotal moment when the free world's coming generation rejected established wisdom, knowledge, ethics and behaviour for a drug-inspired relativism which has since undermined the intellectual foundations of western culture.' Not that Marianne Faithfull would have noticed. Indeed, bearing in mind her aristocratic Austro-Hungarian heritage, it could be argued that decadence, gloom and deathliness coursed through her veins long before the various substances which she injected in celebration of and escape from sixties counter-culture. Just check out the references in her first chapter ('Childhood'): Sartre, Kafka, Virgil, Coltrane, Beethoven, Jung, Nietzsche; Faithfull had little to learn from a bunch of blues-loving upstarts like the Rolling Stones, but she managed to prostrate herself before their relentless ambition just the same. Faithfull is a humorous, self-effacing and eerily dispassionate account of a life lived in near-constant psycho-pharmaceutical turmoil, punctuated with sharp observations (describing 'As Tears Go By' as 'slightly existential, but with a dash of San Remo song festival') and sprinkled with a bewildering variety of sex, drugs and rock and roll stories. It is a winning autobiography - it is difficult to dislike a woman who, on hearing of Mick Jagger's wedding to Bianca, instantly fills herself with Valium, downs three vodka Martinis, lurches into an Indian restaurant, falls into a curry, spends the night in Paddington police station, signs autographs for the officers and, on leaving, quotes De Quincey to the grey London skies. Early in her musical career, Faithfull shared a tour with the Kinks, whom she found to be 'very gothic, creepy and silent'. Indeed, Ray Davies's 'unauthorised autobiography' (in which a fictitious 'journalist' gets Davies to open up to him) is much more down-beat than Faithfull's fruity epic, but then again Muswell Hill was no fin-de-siecle Vienna. The problem is that Davies, not having been semi-comatose for three-quarters of his life, experienced much more acutely the pains which fame inflicted on him, particularly the break-up of his marriage and the inevitable legal wrangles with his management. It is unlikely that the Kinks will represent more than a footnote to the great sixties saga, but Davies could certainly write a mean pop song. Which brings us back to MacDonald and his decline-of- civilisation thesis, expounded in a couple of essays which sandwich the main part of his book. This is a line of argument, of course, which more commonly comes from those who would date the 'turning point' at Elvis's first televised pelvic thrust, at the birth of rock and roll. MacDonald uses the Beatles' material to convince us otherwise. Is there any piece of music in this century which can match the joy and optimism of 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', or 'Eight Days a Week', or 'Penny Lane'? Today's pop music, sampled, flattened and homogenised or today's rock music, pompous and ponderous, provide plentiful evidence for MacDonald's conclusion, that 'something in the soul of Western culture began to die during the late Sixties'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Esko Aho has appealed to the  Center Party congress for a positive European Union [EU]  membership decision. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, the  former chairman of the MTK [Central Union of Agricultural  Producers] also leaned toward EU membership in his speech.  [passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto and Prime Minister Esko Aho  have dispelled the Center Party members' concern about security  policy. According to Haavisto, Finland must be able to be there  and influence the intergovernmental congress of the EU in 1996.  According to Prime Minister Aho, there is justification for a  national referendum if there are any considerable foreign and  security policy changes concerning Finland.    [Begin Aho recording] NATO membership is not in any way  directly connected to Finland's membership in the EU. My  starting point is that if the EU makes decisions that  fundamentally change the bases according to which accession is  now taking place, then of course, just like in other countries,  that must be separately ratified nationally. Surely, if  fundamental changes are made to the bases of our security  policy, then we will come to a situation where the use of a  national referendum is justified. [end recording]</p>

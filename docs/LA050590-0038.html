			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KNICKS FORCE GAME 5 WITH CELTICS  </P> <P> The Garden party continued for the home team in the opening-round playoff  series between the New York Knicks and Boston Celtics.  </P> <P> Patrick Ewing scored 44 points Friday night as New York forced a deciding Game  5 with a 135-108 victory at Madison Square Garden.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised at the margin of victory more than anything else," Coach Stu  Jackson said after the Knicks set playoff records for points in a game and a  half.  </P> <P> Game 5 will be Sunday at Boston Garden, where the Celtics won the first two  games of the series, including a 157-128 victory Saturday, and have beaten the  Knicks 26 consecutive times since Feb. 29, 1984.  </P> <P> "The only way to end their home-court advantage is to win the game," Jackson  said. "We hung our heads a little bit the last time we were in Boston. I don't  think that will happen Sunday."  </P> <P> Said Celtic Coach Jimmy Rodgers: "We had our turn at being embarrassed. We've  played great in Boston, and they rose to the challenge at New York. Now we have  to counterpunch at home."  </P> <P> Ewing was 18 of 24 from the field and fell two points short of Bernard King's  team single-game playoff scoring record.  </P> <P> "I thought that right from the opening tip we did a great job keeping the tempo  to our advantage," said Ewing, who also had 13 rebounds and a career-high seven  of New York's 18 steals. "We played excellent pressure defense."  </P> <P> That defense forced the Celtics into 26 turnovers, and the Knicks had 13,  giving New York a 47-19 turnover advantage in the two games at Madison Square  Garden.  </P> <P> Celtic forwards Larry Bird and Kevin McHale both said the turnovers were the  biggest factor in the game.  </P> <P> "We played very badly, not in sync at all," Bird said. "Our passes were thrown  one way when a guy was going the other. The margin of victory doesn't really  matter, only that you got beat. The home court usually means a lot in the NBA,  but if we turn the ball over like this again, we can lose again."  </P> <P> Said McHale: "If we stay this sloppy with the ball, anything can happen. We had  26 turnovers and they scored 46 points off those turnovers. It was not a banner  day for the Boston Celtics."  </P> <P> The Knicks led by eight points at halftime, then took control by starting the  third quarter with a 27-17 run for a 92-74 lead. The Celtics got no closer than  11 after that and trailed by as many as 37 in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> McHale scored 24 points, Reggie Lewis 23 and Bird 21 for Boston. Johnny Newman  had 24 points and Gerald Wilkins 20 for New York.  </P> <P> Ewing made his first eight shots and scored 20 points on nine-of-11 shooting in  the first quarter, carrying New York to a 36-30 lead. Ewing scored the Knicks'  first 10 points in the opening 2:33.  </P> <P> The Celtics held Ewing to four points in the second quarter. A 15-6 run gave  the Celtics the lead, 45-42, with 8:47 remaining in the half.  </P> <P> But Maurice Cheeks scored seven points and Newman had six during a 21-8 run  that gave the Knicks a 63-53 lead. New York led at halftime, 65-57.  </P> <P> The Knicks will try to become the third team to come back from a 2-0 deficit to  win a best-of-five series.  </P> <P> The Knicks' previous mark for points in a playoff game was 132.  </P></p>

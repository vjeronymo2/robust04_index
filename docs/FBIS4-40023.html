			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- "Any further aggravation of  the crisis around the North Korean nuclear programmes may lead  to the nuclearisation of the entire region" with nuclear weapons  appearing next in South Korea and Japan, which might eventually  lead to another "Chernobyl" in the Far east," Chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Parliament's lower  house Vladimir Lukin said at a press conference here today.    "I am in favour of the civilised approach to the situation  which has taken shape around the possible creation of nuclear  weapons in North Korea," Lukin said.    He explained that the approach in question stemmed from  "Russia's determination not to allow the appearance of nuclear  weapons close to its border. "It is not a question of our  attitude toward aspects of North Korea's domestic policy, but of  our vital interests which call for the non-proliferation of  nuclear arms," he said.    As concerns the North Korean angle, Lukin said that the  North  Korean regime was probably seeing "its hind [as received] to the  world community that it is able to create nuclear weapons inside  the country as the only lever to make others take it into  account". North Korea is averse to any intervention in its  internal affairs, lukin stressed.    In this context Lukin thinks it wise for all countries  concerned, i.e. Russia, the United States, South Korea, Japan  and China, to begin negotiations with North Korea on the  provision of guarantees of non-intervention in its domestic  affairs. These negotiations should aim to obtain North Korea's  agreement to inspection of its nuclear facilities.    All the countries concerned should resort to "collective  resolute sanctions" against North Korea only if they find out  that North Korea is using the negotiations in order to win time  for the development of the nuclear arms.    Lukin stressed that he regards as a mistake the statement by  the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Russia is ready to  fully or partially annul the treaty of friendship and  cooperation with North Korea two years before the expiration of  its term.</p>

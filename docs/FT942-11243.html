			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Barclays directors defended at AGM Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI and Zeneca, stepped into the breach to defend the chairman and chief executive of Barclays against attacks from hostile shareholders at the bank's annual general meeting yesterday. Sir Denys, a non-executive director of the UK's biggest bank and chairman of its remuneration committee, praised the performances of Mr Andrew Buxton and Mr Martin Taylor amid heated criticism of the bank's directors. Much of the antagonism at the two-and-a-half hour meeting came from members of a pressure group called the Struggle Against Financial Exploitation (Safe), founded by unhappy customers of Barclays who bought shares to attend. There was strong criticism of the bank for paying Mr David Band, chief executive of its BZW investment banking arm, Pounds 1.4m last year and for giving Mr Buxton a basic salary of Pounds 350,000 this year and Mr Taylor a package worth Pounds 737,500. 'We are talking very large telephone numbers, and I can understand why you might think they are excessive,' said Sir Denys, who led the group of non-executive directors who searched for a chief executive last year. Barclays had had to attract Mr Taylor, who became chief executive in January. 'Of course he has got to earn it now. We will be looking very carefully, and I have no doubt that he will fully repay our confidence in him,' said Sir Denys. Sir Denys told shareholders that Mr Buxton, who split the roles of chairman and chief executive after Barclays lost Pounds 242m in 1992 had faced 'a hell of a battering from people all over the place, and has done it with courtesy and grace'. One shareholder compared Barclays with a football team which had reponded to relegation by recruiting 'a synchronised swimming coach' in the form of Mr Taylor, a former chairman of Courtaulds Textiles, and Financial Times journalist. But Mr Buxton was praised by one shareholder, Mr Granville Whitehead, who told him he was 'by far the handsomest man on the platform'. Mr Whitehead said that he had spent the meeting sketching Mr Buxton and the 'ugly ducklings' around him.</p>

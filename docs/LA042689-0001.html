			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT ORDERS NEW SPY TRIAL FOR FBI AGENT  </P> <P> Richard W. Miller, the bumbling FBI agent whose love affair with a Russian spy  landed him in federal prison for two life terms, was granted a new trial  Tuesday by a federal appeals court that ruled that jurors were allowed to hear  too much testimony about his lie detector tests.  </P> <P> Reversing the conviction of the first FBI agent ever accused of espionage, the  U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that jurors had been exposed to  "overwhelming potential prejudice" when told repeatedly that Miller had failed  polygraph questions about whether he passed U.S. secrets to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Miller, 51, was convicted by a Los Angeles federal jury in June, 1986, for  passing FBI secrets to the Soviet KGB during an adulterous affair with Soviet  emigre Svetlana Ogorodnikova. The portly agent, Ogorodnikova and her husband  all are serving federal prison sentences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Setback for Government  </P> <P> The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling was a stinging setback for the  government and U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who presided over the  Miller case. It constituted the first reversal of a major espionage conviction  in a series of more than five dozen prosecutions since World War II.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors have already tried the 20-year veteran agent twice on the  charges. The first trial, which spanned three months during 1985, ended in a  mistrial when jurors deadlocked after three weeks of deliberations. The second  trial ran four months. Miller has already served 4 1/2 years of a sentence of  two life terms plus 50 years.  </P> <P> Prosecutors are likely to seek a rehearing before a full, 11-member en banc  panel of the court and could also appeal the reversal to the Supreme Court -- a  process that could take another 18 months. Defense lawyers said they will move  "very shortly" to have Miller released on bail pending any new trial.  </P> <P> But privately, many of those closest to the case wondered whether the  government would ever take the lengthy, complex and emotional case -- a major  drain on both the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI bureau in Los Angeles for  several years -- to a jury again.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner personally spent seven months in court prosecuting  Miller, the only case he has ever personally tried as the region's chief  federal prosecutor. Now, Bonner has been nominated to a federal judgeship and  will soon be leaving the office.  </P> <P> His co-prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Russell Hayman, is in the midst of a  major, billion-dollar money-laundering case and has told some associates that  he would consider leaving the office rather than prosecute Miller again.  </P> <P> The FBI chief who headed the Los Angeles office during Miller's tenure on the  Soviet counterintelligence squad has retired. One FBI source told The Times  that there is some sentiment within the bureau against tying up staff during  another lengthy trial.  </P> <P> Sources close to the case said it is likely the reversal will spawn a new round  of plea negotiations, under which Miller might agree to plead guilty to some  petty bribery and embezzlement charges in exchange for a reduced prison term.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Serious Charges  </P> <P> On the other hand, some sources said Tuesday that they doubt that the  government could accept such a plea bargain because of the far more serious  nature of the original charges against Miller and his position as a former FBI  agent accused of betraying his country.  </P> <P> "We are reviewing the opinion and will be considering a variety of options,"  including an appeal, Bonner said in a prepared statement. "We will in all  probability make a decision within the next several weeks. Ultimately, if  necessary, we intend to retry the case."  </P> <P> Miller's lawyers, Joel Levine and Stanley I. Greenberg, said they could not  discuss the opinion until they had read it. Both were jubilant about the  outcome.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy, and a little frustrated that we've had to wait this long with  a client in custody to receive a fair trial," Levine said.  </P> <P> Added Greenberg: "The fact that Miller's conviction was reversed should come as  absolutely no surprise to any fair and impartial observer of the Miller  proceedings. The prosecution brought to the proceedings an  end-justifies-the-means mentality that I have never witnessed in over 20 years  of practicing law."  </P> <P> Miller's lawyers were not optimistic, however, about the chances of a plea  bargain that might eliminate the need for a third trial. Levine said he expects  all parties involved will end up fighting the case again in U.S. District  Court.  </P> <P> "Why not?" Levine asked. "If you don't get it right the first two or three  times, you do it again. I'd like to think not, but I'm afraid that will be the  case. I'm sure a settlement needs to be explored, but I'm not sure to what  degree either side can really negotiate. I don't think there is that much of a  middle ground that we could agree on."  </P> <P> Miller, according to his lawyers, had expected the reversal and took the news  calmly when told about it by telephone at a small federal prison for  white-collar offenders in Minnesota, where he has been confined for most of his  prison term.  </P> <P> "I think he was prepared for this," Levine said. "He was happy about it, but  not wildly. He's an understated guy. He sort of takes convictions, reversals,  anything that happens to him the same way."  </P> <P> Miller, an excommunicated Mormon and father of eight who was constantly in  trouble as an agent, claimed his relations with Ogorodnikova and her husband,  Nikolai, were an attempt to become a secret double agent, penetrate a KGB spy  ring, come back to his superiors with the news in what he called "a blaze of  glory" and rescue his failing FBI career.  </P> <P> But the government claimed the 250-pound agent believed he was about to be  fired for obesity and agreed to pass a confidential U.S. intelligence  assessment to Ogorodnikova in exchange for sex, $65,000 in gold and cash and a  $675 Burberry trench coat.  </P> <P> Miller met the tempestuous emigre Ogorodnikova in 1984 when she contacted the  FBI and claimed to have valuable information. Almost immediately, they became  lovers. Shortly after returning from a trip to the Soviet Union, Ogorodnikova  asked Miller to provide her with classified documents. He, in turn, asked her  for $15,000 in cash and $50,000 in gold -- contending later that he solicited  the money only to "play along."  </P> <P> Both Ogorodnikova and her husband eventually pleaded guilty to espionage  charges. She was sentenced to 18 years in prison after admitting as part of a  sealed court record that Miller had indeed passed her a confidential  intelligence document. But in dramatic testimony at Miller's trial,  Ogorodnikova proclaimed Miller "is not a traitor of his country" and denied  getting any documents from her former lover.  </P> <P> The reversal, written by Judge Dorothy W. Nelson of Los Angeles, was not wholly  unexpected; at a hearing last July, the judges had asked extraordinarily  pointed questions about the polygraph evidence. Any other result would have  required two of the 9th Circuit's most liberal judges -- Nelson and Judge  Stephen Reinhardt of Los Angeles -- to create new law broadening the  government's ability to use polygraph evidence in criminal cases. Judge  Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain of Portland, Ore., a Reagan appointee, joined in the  opinion.  </P> <P> The key issue was evidence prosecutors presented that Miller, during five days  of intense interrogation by his FBI superiors, had failed several polygraph  tests. After he was informed of the results and demanded to speak with another  polygraph examiner, Miller made several damaging admissions.  </P> <P> Prosecutors did not attempt to introduce the polygraph tests until Miller's  lawyers challenged the reliability of his admissions, contending they were the  products of a distraught, tired man who had been pressured by his  interrogators. At that point, government lawyers argued, it was necessary to  introduce the lie detector tests to show the sequence of events in which Miller  ultimately made the admissions.  </P> <P> Miller's "most damaging admissions were made after he had been informed that he  had failed the polygraph tests," Hayman argued in his appeal brief. "That fact  is powerful evidence that these admissions were made in response to his failure  of the polygraph test, rather than due to any overbearing of his will by his  interviewers."  </P> <P> But during the trial, the appeals court noted, Judge Kenyon allowed agents to  testify in detail about the full battery of questions and answers recorded in  the lie detector tests -- not just the fact that Miller had failed them. And  this, they found, was a crucial overstep.  </P> <P> Noting that polygraph tests are rarely admissible in federal cases, the court  concluded: "Compared to the overwhelming potential prejudice, the marginal  probative value of this additional detailed testimony was slight indeed." It is  "more likely than not," the panel said, that the jury's verdict was affected by  the polygraph evidence despite the judge's instruction cautioning jurors about  the unreliability of polygraph results.  </P> <P> The court also sided with the defense's complaints about the testimony of John  Barron, an expert in KGB recruitment tactics who testified that the Soviets  typically target people who are socially isolated, frustrated in their careers,  dishonest or sexually promiscuous. The defense had argued that Barron's  testimony, offered as general description of KGB tactics, instead was tailored  to fit the Miller case.  </P> <P> The court held that the government "clearly invited" jurors to use Barron's  testimony as character evidence unfairly prejudicial to Miller.  </P> <P> The court also rejected the admission of evidence showing previous dishonesty  by Miller, specifically testimony that Miller had in 1982 secretly sold  Department of Motor Vehicles driver's license information to a private  investigator. Government lawyers argued that the past arrangement made it more  probable that he had a criminal intent in soliciting money from the Soviets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Wholly Dissimilar'  </P> <P> But the appellate judges said that while the evidence might be relevant to a  separate series of bribery counts, the intent involved in selling secrets to a  foreign government is "wholly dissimilar" from the intent involved in selling  driver's license information.  </P> <P> On at least nine other points challenged by the defense, the appeals court  upheld Kenyon's rulings.  </P> <P> Soon after Miller's arrest in 1984, Kenyon had agreed to sever eight bribery  and embezzlement counts against the ex-agent from the espionage case. Those  charges, including claims that Miller took money for selling FBI information  and that he embezzled funds from a partly blind FBI informant, can be  reinstated and used in negotiating any possible plea bargain.  </P> <P> The FBI had no official response to the reversal. Richard T. Bretzing, the  former special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office during much of  Miller's tenure, said only that he was "surprised" by the reversal.  </P> <P> "I don't know that there's anything to say," he said. "Obviously the Court of  Appeals has made its ruling. . . . I don't think I would say I was  disappointed. The wheels of justice have turned."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ronald L. Soble contributed to this report.  </P></p>

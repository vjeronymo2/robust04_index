			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / US spending row risks new agency shutdowns US government agencies are once again threatened with shutdown as President George Bush and Congress prepare for a confrontation over Washington's most sensitive issue - spending. Mr Bush promised his cheering supporters at last month's Republican convention that he would veto any spending bills passed by Congress that went above his budget requests. At least five, and possibly as many as seven, of the 13 appropriations bills which allot money to government agencies appear to be heading for a presidential veto, but Democratic leaders in Congress say they are in no mood to compromise. The government cannot continue to spend money after the new fiscal year begins on October 1 unless new appropriations legislation is passed. Several times in the 1980s, federal agencies had to send staff home for a few hours in symbolic confrontations between the White House and Congress. But usually a shutdown has been avoided by an omnibus bill to continue funding of agencies at current levels. The Democrats' congressional leadership says it has no interest in resorting to this kind of stop-gap bill. The president's veto strategy is designed to highlight his battle with Congress, and paint the Democratic-controlled legislature as relentless spendthrifts. The strategy is risky, however. Although several individual appropriations bills would spend more than Mr Bush asked for in his January budget request, others underbid him significantly. Bills covering the labour, health and human services, treasury, transportation and interior departments appear to exceed the president's budget requests, and the inclusion of funding for abortion counselling makes some other bills look like veto-bait. But bills covering defence, foreign aid and space come in well under budget and Congress has even cut its own operating budget below the president's request. Overall, the 13 appropriations bills would spend over Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.3bn) less than Mr Bush asked for. And on all the biggest battles to cut government outlays - the space station, the super-collider, the Strategic Defence Initiative - the administration has been on the side of increased spending. The only appropriations bill to pass Congress before the Republican convention, covering agriculture, exceeded the budget request but Mr Bush signed it with no visible qualms. The Office of Management and Budget is referring questions on the veto threat to the Bush-Quayle campaign headquarters.</p>

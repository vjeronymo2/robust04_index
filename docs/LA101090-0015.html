			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> Good news. The commentary by Stephen Moore ("A Potential Windfall Waits Outside  the Golden Door," Sept. 28) relates that almost two-thirds of all immigrants  are between the ages of 16 and 45 and create a net windfall to the government  in taxes paid.  </P> <P> Bad news. The other one-third of immigrants may create a bottomless pit in  their consumption of free health care, welfare, food stamps, public housing,  social, legal and penal services, education and other subsidized services.  </P> <P> Hold off any more legislation on immigration until the true social cost of the  10 million legal immigrants and more than 20 million illegal aliens who entered  the United States in the 1980s is known.  </P> <P> ANDRE MINUTH  </P> <P> Fresno  </P></p>

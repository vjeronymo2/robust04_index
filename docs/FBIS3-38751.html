			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Detmold (DPA) -- On Saturday [5 February], about  3,500 demonstrators protested against right-wing extremism in  Detmold. The participants, including about 400 members of  "autonomous groups," marched to the former party headquarters of  the Nationalist Front (NF), which has been banned. The largely  peaceful demonstration was accompanied by a heavy police  presence.    According to a police release on Sunday, 80 persons were  arrested before and during the rally. Thirty of them will be  reported for, among other things, violating the Arms Law and for  the ban on hiding one's face. The police officials seized  baseball bats, knives, tear gas, one ax, and a rubber hammer.    Before the rally, 49 members of the "rightist scene" were  arrested, because the police had received information about  planned acts of violence to be committed against the  demonstration. The men had stayed in the former NF party  headquarters.</p>

The decision of the  court was explained by the fact that the over 60-year-old  convict had already served one-third of his penalty. His health  condition and the good conduct while he was in prison were two  more reasons sustaining the decision.    Iulian Vlad, directly involved in the December 1989 events,  was sued in court on 3 August 1990, through the bill of  indictment of the Military Prosecutors' Department of Romania's  Prosecutor's Office. The bill of indictment listed his  participation in the meetings of the [Romanian Communist Party]  Executive Political Committee of 17 and 22 December 1989, when  "he agreed to the decision to use firearms against demonstrators  in Timisoara and other localities in the country."    On 28 April 1992 the Supreme Court of Justice, ruling on the  appeal filed by the Department of Military Prosecutor's Offices,  decided to change the indictment from abetting genocide to  instrumentality to aggravated attempted murder, sentencing  Iulian Vlad to 12 years of prison, 6 years of banned rights, and  military demotion.    Ex-General Vlad told daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI on his release:  "I think the Romanian justice has done is duty to the full, a  fact that allows me now to return to the society with the  feeling that I have expiated my sins."</p>

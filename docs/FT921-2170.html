			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Vinten moves ahead to record Pounds 9.2m Vinten, the broadcast and photographic systems and electro-optics company, increased pre-tax profits by 6 per cent, from Pounds 8.65m to a record Pounds 9.18m, in the year to December 31. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 63.3m. Mr Humphrey Wood, chairman, said that the performance reflected the anticipated recovery in profits from the surveillance systems division, which entered 1992 with a strong order book, and lower interest costs resulting from a further reduction in borrowing. Earnings per share were 20.5p (19.8p) and the dividend total is increased from 6.2p to 6.6p with a proposed final of 4.8p.</p>

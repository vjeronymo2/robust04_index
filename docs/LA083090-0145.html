			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PASSIONATE, STUNNING FINISH TO SUMMERFEST  </P> <P> SummerFest '90 artistic director Heiichiro Ohyama saved his best surprises for  the festival's final concert Tuesday night. The Colorado String Quartet offered  stunning performances of two rarely played pieces, Mozart's First String  Quartet, K. 80, and Alberto Ginastera's Second String Quartet. And violinist  Mark Peskanov made his only festival appearance in the Tchaikovsky Piano Trio  in A Minor.  </P> <P> Celebrity night it was not, but passionate music making took center stage.  </P> <P> Peskanov and cellist Gary Hoffman let out all the stops for the Tchaikovsky,  throwing themselves into a robust, Old World performance that ignored the  fashionable politesse of many current chamber music performances. When  Peskanov, for example, stretched a rubato out of one of his emotion-drenched  melodies, the motivation came from his inner depths.  </P> <P> Hoffman matched Peskanov's big, rosiny sound, although that timbre was 180  degrees removed from the pointed, supple tone he had produced the previous  evening in two Mozart piano quartets. Yet for all this muscle, when it came to  rapid figuration, each string player sailed through with lucid definition.  </P> <P> Pianist Andre-Michel Schub handled the bravura piano part with such commanding  facility, clarity and intelligence that it seems positively churlish to  complain that his effort nevertheless appeared deficient. But in the company of  these two string players, more sense of abandon and a deeper touch -- even some  old-fashioned heavy pedaling -- was required. On the other hand, perhaps  Schub's holding back was wise -- otherwise the Sherwood Auditorium stage might  have experienced a nuclear meltdown.  </P> <P> Tuesday's performance by the Colorado Quartet revealed just how far this  ensemble has grown since its local debut in 1986. The players brought buoyant  rhythms and polish to Mozart's effervescent early opus that proved all the more  impressive when followed by a gutsy reading of Ginastera's fiery 1958 opus. In  both style and form, the Ginastera Second String Quartet is one of the few  worthy heirs to Bartok's six-quartet canon. It even boasts a middle movement  bristling with those eerie special effects Bartok chose for his "night music"  passages.  </P> <P> The Colorado String Quartet demonstrated an uncommon equilibrium that allowed  the players to pummel Ginastera's driving ostinatos without impairing their  sonic unity or ensemble cohesion. Despite this admirable internal balance,  first violinist Julie Rosenfeld and violist Francesca Martin should be singled  out for their voluptuous, lyrical solo flights.  </P></p>

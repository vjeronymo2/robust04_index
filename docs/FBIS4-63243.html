			<p>BFN     [Text] Oleksandr Yemets, Ukraine's minister for  nationalities and migration, believes that Ukraine and Crimea  could find a "common language" were it not for the interference  of external forces. Speaking in an interview with  Interfax-Ukraine Thursday the minister, who is in Simferopol,  also said that it was impossible to predict the influence of  external forces on the Crimean leadership.    Yemets linked the activities of Russian politicians in  Crimea  with the fact that "certain Moscow groupings want to control the  privatization process in Crimea."    Yemets said that threats to the constitution and the  territorial integrity of Ukraine "will also cause us to react  firmly."    "No-one will solve Crimea's problem by political  adventurism," he said.    Yemets stressed that if Ukrainian property or Ukrainian  citizens in Crimea were threatened by any kind of force, then  "force will be answered by force."</p>

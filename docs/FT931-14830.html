			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Results give lift to TSB IMPROVED operating results for TSB and a return to profits at the pre-tax level gave cheer to the market. The shares rose 9 1/2 to 156p and were the most heavily traded of the day with more than 17m dealt. However, many analysts were not convinced and one described the results as 'appalling figures'. Mr Michael Lever of Smith New Court, historically a leading bear on the stock, said: 'The bottom line is that the profits before bad debt provisions were better than expected.' However, he added: 'They have presented the figures in a light which shows operating profits more generously than I would.' The bank has long been seen as a takeover target and that sentiment was also behind the share price strength yesterday. The bank returned to profits in 1992, with a result of Pounds 43m after a Pounds 597m charge for bad debts. This compared with last year's Pounds 47m loss. However, several banking experts argued that taking a Pounds 38m expenses charge below the line flattered the expenses figure, while the recovery was partly fuelled by a Pounds 22m gilts sale. NatWest Securities cut its forecast for 1993 by Pounds 60m to Pounds 190m. UB rights fears Rights issue fears swirled around United Biscuits after the Spanish food group Tabacalera was reported as saying that the UK company was interested in one of its subsidiaries, Grupo Royal Brands. The story, which appeared yesterday in the Spanish press, caused some consternation among London analysts anxious about the highly geared UB committing itself to a purchase in the region of Pounds 200m. However, UB was yesterday downplaying the reports and analysts later suggested that Tabacalera may be trying to initiate an auction, having already been offered a reported Esp17bn for a 50 per cent stake in Royal Brands by Nabisco. French group BSN is also said to have been approached by Tabacalera. While UB may only be sizing up Royal Brands' biscuit operations, analysts remained cautious about any further financial commitment from the group. Last week it bought the snack food interests of CCA Group in Australia for Pounds 47m, and paid Pounds 195.5m in November for the Bake-Line cookie group in the US. The latter deal was funded with an Pounds 80m share issue. Mr Carl Short at Nomura said: 'UB already has enough balls in the air, and with 90 per cent gearing it is not an easy juggling act.' UB declined 9 to 359p. US selling hits BP Oil issues were weak, reacting to continuing pressure on crude oil prices. BP was further affected by forecast downgrades. Dealers said US investment bank Goldman Sachs and UK merchant bank Kleinwort Benson had both followed the lead taken by Morgan Stanley on Wednesday. Also, Strauss Turnbull's Mr John Toalster, a BP super bear, sent out an oil review which argued that prices would remain under pressure in 1993. He added that there was up to 60p of downside in BP's share price. Mr Toalster said there was sizeable US selling but it was too early to pinpoint a full-scale change of heart among US investors, who are traditionally keen on BP. The shares fell 5 to 232 1/2 p. Enterprise Oil declined 4 to 405p. Shell Transport and Lasmo failed to benefit from the market strength, remaining unchanged at 529p and 146p respectively. Big turnover in MFI A large seller in MFI Furniture sent the shares falling and took turnover to 15m, prompting some nervous speculation over the group's results due at the end of the month. Smith New Court was said to have sold a block of 3m at 130p, with blocks of 2.7m at 131p and 1.7m at 131 1/2 p also being recorded on the Seaq ticker. MFI came to the market in July at 115p and had been a strong performer in December. However, recent talk that the revival in retail sales may be patchy, including the Boots warning over its DIY business, may have contributed to one investor's decision to take profits and jump ship. The shares closed 3 adrift at 132p. Bear raiders were out in force on Allied-Lyons as talk circulated that the drinks group would make a rights issue to fund an acquisition. This was followed by another rumour that the company would be shortly making a negative trading statement. Both were dismissed by analysts but not before the shares were sent into retreat, although they later rallied to close just a penny off at 605p. Turnover was an above-average 3.4m. Full-year results from Rank Organisation came in at the lower end of expectations and did nothing to dispel the caution surrounding the group's shares. The company said it expected flat UK sales, although trading in the US was picking up and this cheered some in the market. However, weak trading is expected from Xerox, Rank's part-owned subsidiary, and was the main factor in most analysts reducing their forecasts to a range of Pounds 250-Pounds 280m. The shares fell 9 to 695p. Hoare Govett and NatWest Securities were advising clients to switch into Thorn EMI, 9 better at 858p, with NatWest also preferring Ladbroke, ahead a penny at 189p. ICI recovered with some help from an upgrade by US stockbroker Paine Webber. The house analyst said he had a 'high level of confidence' that ICI's board would approve the spin-off of its Zeneca drug company, which would allow management to cut out 'unnecessary layers of costs.' ICI shares lifted 20 to 1093p. Industrial gases and healthcare group BOC were 16 higher in early trading following a recommendation by NatWest Securities ahead of the company's annual meeting. However, there was no significant good news at the meeting and the rise was trimmed to a net gain of 8 at 746p. Glaxo fell 10 to 714p as some technical analysts argued that the shares should head lower after breaking below support at 750p last week. Analysts project losses down to about 675p initially, with medium-term risk down to 637 to 624 pence. Wellcome was 27 up at one stage helped by a large buy order. There was also talk of an imminent article that would be positive for the drug group, but no details developed and the shares ticked back to close 13 higher at 924p. Royal Insurance fell a penny to 277p as US credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its claims paying ability on Royal. S&amp;P believes Royal's operating performance will remain weak in the short term due to mortgage indemnity losses and mediocre results at subsidiaries. Reports that British Aerospace would soon sign a joint venture deal with Taiwan Aerospace to manufacture and develop regional aircraft led to strong demand for the stock. The shares jumped 7 to 177p, in trade of 3.5m. Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite who made it his 'stock of the year' said: 'The joint venture will stem the black hole in regional aircraft activities and enable the company to redevelop some of the provisions elsewhere. The clashes in the Gulf led to demand for several defence related stocks, including Rolls-Royce which bounced 4 to 110p, while Vosper Thornycroft added 7 to 475p. Good buying from a regional broker helped boost Alvis and the shares firmed 4 to 23p. Plans to raise prices at British Steel saw the shares add 2 to 60p, with volume reaching 6.8m. A squeeze in Johnson Group caused the shares to jump 35 to 734p. In motors, profit-taking at GKN left the shares 7 lighter at 458p, but yield buyers were seen in T and N where the shares gained 5 to 173p. Bid speculation returned to Gestetner sending the shares climbing 10 to 152p. There was renewed strong support for Treatt, the USM-quoted aromatic oils manufacturer which announced an 8 per cent jump in preliminary profits earlier this week, with the shares closing a further 10 higher at 128p.

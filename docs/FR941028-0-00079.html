			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter representing a State regulatory authority criticized the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of the proposed regulation because such provisions would potentially allow a challenger of an ownership or control link to present evidence to a tribunal reviewing a decision of a regulatory authority which had not previously been presented to the regulatory authority. The commenter proposed a modification to the regulation such that any evidence presented on appeal by a challenger be limited to that which was presented to the regulatory authority at the time when the decision being reviewed was made. The commenter proposed that evidence which was not reasonably available to the challenger at the time of the regulatory authority's decision could, however, be presented for the consideration of the reviewing tribunal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM appreciates the commenter's proposal. One legitimate approach to the process of such challenges might be to limit the presentation of evidence on review to that which had been previously presented to the regulatory authority which made the decision which has been subjected to review. OSM believes, however, that the better approach is to allow the presentation of any evidence admissible under the rules of the reviewing tribunal, including evidence which was not previously presented to the regulatory authority. This will assure that the review of the decision with respect to the ownership or control link or the status of a violation is based upon the most complete evidence available to all parties participating in the review process. Such a review will help assure that all parties have the opportunity to present their complete proof with respect to their respective positions in what is, substantively, a de novo proceeding. Such complete evidence presentation and review may aid the legitimacy and acceptance of any final decision made incident to such review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, OSM disagrees with the view that such a process might encourage a challenger to withhold relevant evidence for surprise presentation at a subsequent review proceeding. A challenger will have sufficient incentive to overcome a presumed ownership or control link at the earliest possible time because he or she will want to avoid permit blocks or further litigation. Accordingly, he or she can be expected to present the best evidence available to make the case in favor of overcoming the presumed ownership or control link. Thus, OSM must reject the commenter's suggested modification to the proposed regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters criticized paragraph (c)(2) of the proposed regulation for allowing the use of affidavits in support of a challenge to an ownership or control link or to the status of a violation. The commenters asserted that such materials contain self-serving statements and are unreliable. The commenters further asserted that affidavits should not be the basis to overcome a presumption, in the absence of additional evidence supporting such affidavits. The commenters proposed various modifications to the proposed rule which would require the submission of additional information when affidavits are presented in support of a challenge to an ownership or control link. In this respect, one commenter proposed a ``best evidence'' rule which would not allow the presentation of affidavits when there was ``better'' documentary evidence available, such as official copies of corporate records previously filed with State corporation commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM appreciates the commenters' concern with respect to affidavits. Nevertheless, affidavits do have certain indicators of reliability. They are made under oath before a government official licensed to witness such oaths, a notary public. Further, affidavits are recognized as evidence sufficient to support a motion for summary judgment in civil litigation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, OSM continues to consider affidavits as appropriate evidence for a regulatory authority's review in the evaluation of a challenge to an ownership or control link. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, OSM agrees that, in most cases, an affidavit unsupported by other evidence may be insufficient to overcome a presumption of ownership or control. There could be rare circumstances, however, where an affidavit by itself could be the basis for rebuttal, given the totality of the circumstances involved. Such matters are appropriately addressed on a case by case basis, rather than through a rule. Under the proposed rule, challengers are encouraged to submit additional evidence along with affidavits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, OSM will not modify the proposed regulation to delete the use of affidavits or to require that affidavits only be allowed as proof if accompanied by other supporting evidence in every case. Also, while OSM agrees that State corporation commissions may be a good source of relevant ownership or control information, OSM declines to adopt a ``best evidence'' test which would prevent the submission of affidavits when documents have been filed with State corporation commissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter representing environmental advocacy groups criticized paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of proposed &sect;773.26 insofar as the provisions allowed for the submission of an opinion of counsel in support of a challenge with respect to an ownership or control link or with respect to the status of a violation. In substance, the commenter asserted that such opinions present no factual evidence for the regulatory authority. Such opinions of counsel represent legal opinions with respect to ownership or control and invade the province of the decisionmaker, the regulatory authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

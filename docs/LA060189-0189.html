			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHOSE LIFE IS IT ?;  </P> <P> PRO CHOICE  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this summer on a case that could  lead to a reversal of its decision 16 years ago legalizing abortion. As  abortion proponents and opponents spilled into the streets with protests and  marches this spring, it was obvious not all the voices were women's. To better  understand the men's view, Times staff writer Dana Parsons interviewed six who  have been active on one side or the other of the movement.  </P> <P> Jim Covial: Although he had always considered himself a pro-choice advocate,  Covial, 29, took part in his first demonstration this spring in Los Angeles. "I  think it really hit me that they could take (the right to an abortion) away,"  he said. "I saw that Operation Rescue was gathering a lot of people; it seemed  like they had momentum. Their voices were being heard. I wanted to help the  people who were pro-choice have their voices heard."  </P> <P> Covial, a Reseda bachelor, spends much of his time in Orange County, recruiting  for a package shipping company. He has also taken part in a demonstration at a  clinic in Cypress where abortions are performed.  </P> <P> "To me, it's a question of personal freedom and liberty," Covial said. "I don't  like abortion, and nobody does. I don't like the fact that somebody has to get  an abortion, but it's a woman's body, and once you allow the government to get  inside her body and tell her what to do, what's next? But in terms of being  pro-choice, I wanted people to be aware I'm not pro-abortion, and there is a  difference."  </P> <P> Covial's position is tinged by his sad conclusion that abortion represents "the  taking of a life. I'll grant that it's a living cell. The point is, it's still  the woman's decision to make. It's inside her body. . . . If she's thought it  through in her conscience, with her friends, parents or just herself, and if  she feels the best thing to do is not carry it to term, it's her choice and not  the government's."  </P> <P> Covial, who is black, said it's important that men support women in the  abortion controversy, just as whites supported blacks during the civil rights  movement.  </P> <P> "If you remember the March on Washington (in 1963), part of Martin Luther  King's speech was, 'We must not come to hate our white brothers because as  evidenced here today, they have come to realize their destiny is tied up with  our destiny.' I kind of analogize that for the men in this movement. Sure I'll  never get pregnant, but I do believe a woman's freedom is inextricably tied to  mine."  </P> <P> Covial is troubled by what he sees as the "hypocrisy" and "racist" agenda of  many in the pro-life movement. It is largely a white middle-class movement  whose members say the women should have the baby and then put the child up for  adoption, he said. But those people are unlikely to adopt babies who are  members of minority groups or born with handicaps, he said.  </P> <P> Bob Johnson: When he saw the unfair housing practices leveled against blacks in  the 1960s, Johnson was outraged. And in those days of the fledgling civil  rights movement, he became an activist.  </P> <P> Now 56, Johnson has cast his lot with the pro-choice advocates in the abortion  movement, taking part in his first public demonstration in April when he joined  other marchers in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> To Johnson, married for 33 years and the father of three grown children, the  fight for the right to an abortion represents another battle for civil rights.  And just as a white man speaking out for blacks 20 years ago, so now does  Johnson feel he must speak out for women.  </P> <P> "I had a great deal of empathy for (blacks who were discriminated against),"  Johnson said. "That's all I can say. I couldn't put myself in their shoes. I  couldn't say I understood. All I could say is, 'You know, I'm with you in  this.' Women now and historically have been treated much like blacks. That's  where I made the transition. I could see the relationship between those two  things."  </P> <P> Johnson, an electronics engineer with Rockwell International and a Tustin  resident, said he tries to look at issues from different sides. "I look at them  from the gut, the heart and the mind. It's easy to look at them from the mind  because I'm an engineer. Yet I learned from my wife and other people how to  feel more and look at things in that sense. I think it (the abortion question)  is a human rights issue, I think it's a women's rights issue, it's a  theological issue and medical issue. And all those have influenced me, some  more than others. And maybe most of all, it's a family issue."  </P> <P> Ultimately, Johnson said, he became convinced that there was no biblical  imperative against abortion.  </P> <P> "It becomes a question of my view of life," Johnson said. "My view of life is  that you do what is the most loving thing."  </P> <P> The reality of modern-day life, Johnson said, is that some people are not  capable of caring for a child. "When the mother-to-be does not want the child,  then my belief is that the child should not be born."  </P> <P> Tim Snyder: His wife decided last fall that she wanted to get involved in the  pro-choice movement. She began serving as an escort for young women seeking  abortions. His wife's involvement eventually led to Snyder's widened  participation in the movement. Snyder, 34, a truck driver from Orange and the  father of two young children, began clipping articles and becoming more  informed about the abortion controversy.  </P> <P> He found himself unable to accept the notion that a woman could be forced to  give birth.  </P> <P> "I label myself a liberal, whether that has anything to do with it or not,"  Snyder said. "I always felt people's rights are utmost. . . . If they reverse  this law, what's next? What are they going to take away next?"  </P> <P> Snyder said he had to grapple with the question of when life begins and whether  aborting a fetus is murder. He reached a difficult, but unwavering, conclusion,  he said.  </P> <P> "I would rather see a fetus aborted at an early stage than to see an unwanted  child brought into this world. There are too many out there now. Too many  abused, neglected children -- already thousands, if not millions. I don't agree  with forced motherhood. If I thought my own kids (ages 10 and 7) stood a chance  of being unwanted, neglected or abused, I would not want them brought into the  world to begin with."  </P> <P> While he was certain of the correctness of his position, Snyder is surprised at  how active he has become. "I was really shocked. I didn't expect to be getting  up at 5 in the morning and be going to the Orange clinic and standing my ground  for human rights and women's rights. I was probably as surprised as anyone that  I was out there because I'm normally introverted. I'm basically concerned about  my family, my kids, and that's usually as far as it goes. But I see it  affecting my wife and myself and my kids' future. So it's something that needs  to be done."  </P></p>

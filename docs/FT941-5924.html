			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Polls hand mid-term boost to Democrats The Republican party may find it hard to make expected gains in this year's mid-term elections, according to an opinion poll published yesterday by the Washington Post and ABC News. The survey also found President Bill Clinton's popularity rating holding up at 58 per cent positive and 38 per cent negative. Other polls, however, have shown slippage to the 50 per cent range. The main message of the survey was the extent to which Democrats have appropriated the issues of most concern to the American public. The party holds a sizeable edge in public confidence in its ability to manage the economy, the federal deficit, healthcare and crime. Only in defence and foreign policy was a Republican advantage apparent. But two thirds of those surveyed identified social issues as the most important, against 18 per cent who cited the economy. The mid-term election season opens this month with a batch of party primaries, of which the most widely watched is probably in Illinois, where Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the ways and means committee, faces a tough battle in his Chicago district because of impropriety allegations. The general rule of thumb had been that the Republicans could gain as many as 25 seats in the House - not enough to overturn the current 81-seat Democratic majority but a real problem for the Clinton administration. But a comprehensive poll of polls published last month by the New York Times and CBS News, covering over 250,000 respondents, has given the Democrats reason for encouragement. It found that for the first time since 1976 the Democrats were making significant gains over Republicans - 36 per cent identified themselves as Democrats, 28 per cent as Republicans and 30 per cent as independents. For the first time since 1984 more Americans in the 18-29 age bracket said they were Democrats than Republicans, by a 31-29 per cent margin, with independents at 33 per cent.</p>

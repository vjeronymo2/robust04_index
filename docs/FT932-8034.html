			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Molson declines to CDollars 113.7m MOLSON, the Canadian brewing and retailing group, recorded net profit of CDollars 113.7m (USDollars 89.3m), or CDollars 1.90 a share, in the year ended March, against CDollars 126.2m, or CDollars 2.25, in fiscal 1992. Sales and other revenues rose 6 per cent to CDollars 3.1bn, from CDollars 2.9bn. Including a special gain of CDollars 51m after tax from the sale of 20 per cent of its brewing subsidiary to Miller Brewing of the US, total profit for the year was CDollars 164.7m, or CDollars 2.76 a share. Molson's share of brewing profits rose 3.8 per cent to CDollars 167.6m. The recession and a poor summer season were offset by higher prices and more efficient production. Molson Breweries is now 40 per cent owned by Molson, 40 per cent by Foster's of Australia and 20 per cent by Miller. The link with Miller would raise sales of Molson brands significantly in the US, said Mr Marshall Cohen, president. Operating profit from Diversey, Molson's special chemical business, was up 39 per cent, but North American operations were affected by the recession and problems with absorbing an acquisition. Sales were flat at CDollars 1.3bn and operating profit fell 9 per cent to CDollars 70m. Hardware retailing was restructured and took a special CDollars 83m charge. The new Aikenhead warehouse store subsidiary reported a CDollars 9.9m operating loss, but should be profitable this year. Sports and entertainment had a CDollars 2.9m operating profit, against CDollars 8.3m.</p>

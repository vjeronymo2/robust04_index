			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Columbia Pictures executives are reportedly ecstatic over the opening weekend  grosses ($597,000, or $11,948 per screen) and exit poll responses of viewers to  "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen," which opened in 50 theaters in eight  cities on Friday. It had been rumored that a bad opening in those key markets,  which include Los Angeles and New York, would cause the studio to pull back  from a major national release pattern for the problem-plagued $40-million  fantasy adventure. A studio source said plans were being made Tuesday afternoon  for further expansion of the film into theaters nationwide. Columbia would not  release its exit poll data, but Ed Mintz, who runs the independent exit poll  firm Cinemascore, said "Munchausen" got very high marks from viewers leaving  screenings at the Cineplex-Odeon Theater in Century City. Mintz said the film  received an overall A- rating from viewers, but added that because 71% of the  viewers were attracted by director Terry Gilliam, the rating may have been  atypically high.  </P></p>

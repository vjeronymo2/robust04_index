			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> X-RATED PLAY?  </P> <P> Movies are rated as "G," "Parental discretion recommended" or "X," but I am  shocked to find that plays are not rated.  </P> <P> I took my mother out of a nursing home in a wheelchair to see "Minamata"  because we were told by a very skillful telemarketing person that this was a  play about Japan. I was further told by the ticket office that most people  loved it -- that there was lots of singing and dancing.  </P> <P> My mother, who is half-paralyzed from a stroke, almost had another stroke when  we saw on stage men having sex with women and men having sex with men. Many of  the scenes had naked performers.  </P> <P> Only with the greatest imagination could you believe this was a story about  Japan.  </P> <P> I was told this was the best play of the season. I have demanded my season  subscription of $132 be refunded. I was told: no, I might enjoy the rest of the  season!  </P> <P> CHERI SAKAI  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

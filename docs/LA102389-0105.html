			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NIXON'S FACT-FINDING VISIT TO CHINA RESET FOR LATE OCTOBER  </P> <P> Former President Richard M. Nixon is going to China to meet with government  leaders late this month on a visit delayed because of the deadly crackdown on  pro-democracy demonstrators last spring.  </P> <P> Nixon's spokesman, John H. Taylor, said the former President's meetings with  officials in Beijing will begin around Oct. 30. For security reasons, Taylor  said, his precise travel plans were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Taylor said Nixon had discussed his plans with President Bush and with Brent  Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser. "He will give his  assessment of the leaders, their policies and Chinese-American relations in  general in writing to President Bush upon his return," the aide said.  </P> <P> The trip will be Nixon's sixth to China since, before resigning the presidency  in disgrace, he reopened U.S. relations with mainland China in 1972. Taylor  described it as "solely a fact-finding trip" with no sightseeing or social  events. He said Nixon will be paying his own expenses and those of the one  security aide who will travel with him.  </P></p>

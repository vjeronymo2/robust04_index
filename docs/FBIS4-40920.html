			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Davydenko: "President Pleased with </F> Partizan Agrifirm"]    [Text] Amur Oblast -- At his final press conference in  Blagoveshchensk, Boris Yeltsin did not hide his disappointment  at what he had seen in Amur Oblast: "I did not expect the  oblast to have accumulated so many problems."    The president formed this impression after visiting the  shipbuilding plant at Blagoveshchensk and the oblast "exhibition  of achievements," dropping in unexpectedly at the first store en  route, and holding two meetings with the leaders of the Amur  region.    Boris Yeltsin also visited the village of Razdolnyy and the  Partizan Agrifirm. In contrast, he was pleased with the latter  visit. All the sectors in the firm are profitable. Last year  each cow yielded almost one-quarter of a tonne of milk here, and  12,000 tonnes of soybean and 15,000 tonnes of grain crops were  harvested. The firm has energetically set about building shops  to process its own produce.    But today's stable situation could have a downturn tomorrow,  the workers were told by the president. Following the very good  soybean harvest, it suddenly became apparent there was nowhere  to store it. Plants in Irkutsk and Khabarovsk took 1 billion  rublesworth of beans off the agrifirm, but have simply not paid  for it.    Regarding the soybean in Amur's silos, Russian Vice Premier  Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who was accompanying the president, said  that it will very soon be taken into state stocks. The  president advised them, however, to embark immediately on the  construction of a plant in the oblast capable of processing  300,000 tonnes of soybean per year. That is the priority task  today, as problems with the sale of soybeans will recur every  year. "Put all your efforts into constructing the plant, we  will provide the money," Boris Yeltsin assured them.    The peasants complained that they had been unable to  modernize their pool of combine harvesters for three years now.  First, they don't have the money; second, the only plant in  Russia producing tracked combine harvesters -- Dalselmash, in  the city of Birobidzhan -- is at a standstill.    The president met the peasants of the Far East half-way  here.  While still in Blagoveshchensk, he gave the Finance Ministry the  order to, as he put it, "unseal" Dalselmash, that is to say,  provide it with finance. And another gift, this time a personal  one, was bestowed by the president on Vladimir Byatets,  Partizan's best combine harvester operator. Boris Yeltsin met  with him and personally presented him with a Dalselmash tracked  combine harvester....</p>

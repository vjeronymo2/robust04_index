			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Property Trust in Pounds 12m Chinese joint venture deal Property Trust, of which the Cheng family of Hong Kong holds a stake of more than 45 per cent, plans to acquire a one third interest in a property joint venture in Guangzhou, China, in a deal worth Pounds 12m. The group plans to establish a new holding company in Bermuda which will take over the existing UK property portfolio as well as purchase the joint venture stake. Shareholders are being asked to exchange one share in Property Trust for one new share in the Bermuda-based company, Property Trust Holdings. The stake in the 182,000 sq m mixed development, Dong Xiao Garden Plaza, is to be acquired by the issue of B shares from Property Trust Holdings. The net assets of the enlarged group following the acquisition are expected to amount to about Pounds 21.7m, according to Mr Anthony Cheng, chairman. Property Trust's shares were suspended pending shareholder and court approval of the arrangements. The company also announced that pre-tax profits for the year to end-March had fallen from Pounds 626,000 to Pounds 450,000. It said the previous year's profits had benefited from property sales.</p>

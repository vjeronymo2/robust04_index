			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Arrest warrant issued for Nissan UK chairman THE Inland Revenue has issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr Octav Botnar, chairman and managing director of Nissan UK, the former importer/distributor of Nissan vehicles in Britain. Mr Botnar, 78, was named in Teesside magistrates' court, Middlesbrough, yesterday in charges brought against Mr Tore Arne Thorsen, manager of Scansiris AS, a Norwegian freight transport company, alleging a corporation tax fraud in which the pre-tax profits of NUK had been understated by Pounds 100m. Separately Mr Michael Hunt, NUK assistant managing director and a substantial personal shareholder in NUK, and Mr Frank Shannon, a former NUK finance director, appeared in Worthing magistrates' court yesterday also charged with alleged corporation tax fraud. Mr Hunt, who was also named along with Mr Botnar in the charges against Mr Thorsen, was charged in Worthing with alleged corporation tax frauds in which NUK pre-tax profits had been understated by a total of Pounds 150m over a period of 17 years. Mr Hunt, 58, was charged on two counts. The first alleged that he had 'cheated' the Inland Revenue of corporation tax between December 1 1982 and December 31 1991 'with intent to defraud'. The charge alleged that he had arranged 'dishonestly' for the preparation of 'falsely inflated' invoices by Scansiris showing sums for freight charges allegedly due from Nissan UK. The charge stated that the invoices were charged in the Nissan UK accounts for the years ended July 31 1983 to July 31 1992, causing pre-tax profits to be understated by about Pounds 100m. In the Middlesbrough magistrates' court the same detailed charge was made against Mr Thorsen that 'together with Octav Botnar and Michael Hunt' he had cheated the Inland Revenue with 'intent to defraud'. Mr Hunt was also charged along with Mr Shannon that they had 'cheated' the Inland Revenue of corporation tax between October 1 1975 and March 31 1983 'with intent to defraud'. The charges alleged that they had arranged 'dishonestly' for the preparation of 'falsely inflated' invoices by a Dutch company Autocontex BV showing sums for freight charges allegedly due from Datsun UK (now called Nissan UK). The charges stated that the invoices were charged in the Nissan UK accounts for the accounting periods ended December 31 1976 to July 31 1983 causing pre-tax profits to be understated by around Pounds 50m. Mr Hunt and Mr Shannon are to appear again in Worthing magistrates' court on February 25. Mr Thorsen from Grimstad, Norway, is to appear again in Teesside magistrates' court on March 26. All three were released on bail. Mr Hunt was released on bail totalling Pounds 175,000 and on condition that he surrendered his passport and resided at home. He gave an undertaking 'not to exert influence concerning the investigation of the prosecution on any witnesses or potential witnesses including persons who have connections with Nissan UK past or present'. Nissan UK said yesterday that Mr Botnar was on holiday in Switzerland. The Inland Revenue said: 'What we do in these cases is to approach the lawyers of the person and invite them to come back.' The Inland Revenue mounted a dawn raid against Nissan UK in June last year. Codenamed Operation Bluebird, it was the largest search undertaken by the Inland Revenue involving 135 of its officers. In all 13 locations were searched, including the Worthing headquarters of Nissan UK, the offices of some of its legal and financial advisers and the homes of some current and former directors. Late last year Mr Shannon, Mr Brian Laventure, a partner in the Portsmouth office of Grant Thornton, the personal and corporate tax adviser to Nissan UK, and Mr Gerald Compton, a partner in Kidsons Impey, the NUK auditor, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to cheat the Inland Revenue. They were charged in Worthing magistrates' court with conspiring to cheat the Inland Revenue by filing false stock relief claims for Datsun UK, the former name of Nissan UK, for the accounting periods ended July 31 1980 and the year ended July 31 1981 amounting to Pounds 9m and Pounds 5.5m. The charges claimed specifically that the three men conspired between March 19 1980 and July 14 1984 at Worthing and elsewhere: To bring forward the accounting date for Datsun UK from December 31 1980 to July 31 1980, 'falsely representing' that the change had been done for commercial reasons unconnected to any tax liability, whereas 'the sole or main benefit' of the change had been to increase Datsun's claim to stock relief, and Had caused the Inland Revenue to allow Datsun UK false stock relief claims for the two periods of around Pounds 9m and Pounds 5.5m respectively. They are due to appear again in Worthing magistrates' court on these charges in late February. Nissan UK lost the Nissan franchise in Britain from the start of this year, when Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest carmaker, set up its own operations following a protracted and bitter conflict between the two companies.

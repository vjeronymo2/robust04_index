			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD OFFICIALS PUSH SISTER CITY IN  SOUTH KOREA  </P> <P> In an effort to ease tensions between black residents of Inglewood and Korean  merchants, city officials have proposed a sister city relationship between  Inglewood and Kyongju in South Korea.  </P> <P> Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent met with Korean merchants earlier this year to  air complaints from residents who say the merchants often treat them with  disrespect.  </P> <P> Representatives of the Korean business community responded that cultural  differences and a fear of crime, not racism, caused problems between the two  groups.  </P> <P> "We're not enemies," said Bob Lee, an assistant to Vincent. "Inglewood  residents who go to Korea will meet Koreans and learn what they're like."  </P> <P> Kyongju has agreed to the sister city relationship, although the proposal has  not yet been presented to the Inglewood City Council or its Sister City  Committee, officials said.  </P></p>

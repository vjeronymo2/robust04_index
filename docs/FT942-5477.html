			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / 'Misery line' bids invited London Underground has invited four companies to bid to supply it with new rolling stock for its Northern Line. The contract will provide a test of the government's commitment to involving private-sector finance in public-sector transport projects. The four are ABB Transportation, a Swiss-Swedish company; Bombardier Eurorail, a Canadian company which is supplying trains to Eurotunnel; GEC Alsthom Metro-Cammell, a Franco-British group; and Siemens of Germany. They will be expected to file their bids by September. The contract will be awarded before the end of this year. The companies will have to frame their bids in a way which transfers sufficient risk to the private sector to meet tough Treasury guidelines. The guidelines are intended to ensure that financing deals involve more than simple staged payments by, in this case, London Underground, because funding could then be raised more cheaply by the government. It emerged in March that an initial proposal from ABB to lease trains to London Underground had fallen foul of the Treasury rules. Strong pressure from Tory MPs, business organisations and government advisers led to agreement to hold a bid competition. Rolling stock on the Northern Line - dubbed 'the misery line' - is 30 years old. The original ABB proposal was to supply 100 trains for Pounds 440m with a 20-year maintenance contract worth another Pounds 300m. London Underground said it expected that new bids would be substantially different. Delivery of the trains is to take place between one and three years. Apart from the Treasury guidelines, bids will have to provide benefits for travellers in the shape of extra capacity and speed. ABB has warned that failure to win the contract could result in the loss of 600 jobs at its Derby factory. It is, however, just completing the delivery of similar trains for the Underground's Central Line so would be spared the cost of establishing a new production line.</p>

This marked the end of  the prolonged conflict between NTV and Ostankino; the mutual  reproaches, the struggle for the president to sign and then  recall the edict on turning the channel over, and the backroom  games will go down in the history of domestic television. Now  the viewer can judge the work of the new television company: no  longer just one program a day but 60 hours a week. ARGUMENTY I  FAKTY correspondent Yuriy Zubtsov speaks with NTV president Igor  Malashenko.    [Zubtsov] Igor Yevgenyevich, do you not perceive a certain  irony of fate in your achievement of your desired goal? After  all, in a certain sense you are obliged to Zhirinovskiy: It is  thought that it was his victory that undermined the position of  the main opponents of turning Channel 4 over to you--Vyacheslav  Bragin and Mikhail Poltoranin.    [Malashenko] I would like to believe that even if the  elections did have an influence, it was somehow different, that,  possibly, some understanding emerged in the corridors of power:  If one is to be in command of television and not relate to it as  a sphere of professional activity, it will produce results  opposite from those expected. And a professional television  service, not one that is politically committed or subject to  anyone's beck and call, can make a much greater contribution to  the establishment of political stability than one that is  prepared to scold and praise on order. But perhaps these are  only my own daydreams and the real reasons were much more  transparent. But still, I would like to believe this.    [Zubtsov] How do you arrange your cooperation with the  programs left over from the previous Channel 4?    [Malashenko] At the present time all the main points have  been agreed upon and we are just about to sign an agreement with  the Association of Independent Television Producers, which  includes above all ATV, Ren-TV, and ViD. According to its  conditions we will acquire their output for six hours a week.  They have distributed this time among themselves as follows:  four hours for ATV and one hour each for Ren-TV and ViD. Let me  emphasize that we are purchasing their programs in the same way  as, for example, we buy artistic films in America.    [Zubtsov] And according to what principle do you select one  program or another, say, "Vremechko" or "Sunday with Dmitiriy  Dibrov"? Does their quality suit you?    [Malashenko] The viewer is the main one to evaluate the  programs. I am the manager and it is my business to make  financially justified decisions which coincide with the  interests of the audience. Tastes are always subjective. But the  viewer watches these programs and so they must be presented.  Moreover, we absolutely do not want to cut the old off at the  roots. On the contrary, a certain continuity is important to us.  Channel 4 has its own viewer who is accustomed to certain  programs and there is no point in rejecting them.    [Zubtsov] Even before the president's edict on turning the  channel over to you there were rumors going around Ostankino to  the effect that NTV was just about to gain a chunk of air time  through the courts. Now there are similar conversations  regarding the Russian channel with respect to "Russian  universities." Does the same lot await them?    [Malashenko] There can be no question of any kind of  expansion. But here is what we intend to do to expand the  network reached by the channel. Today it encompasses more than  40 million viewers and our investors are prepared to invest  money in the creation of new transmitters and expansion of this  network. I hope that by the end of the year this figure will  increase. But this kind of expansion will hardly encroach on  anyone's interests.    [Zubtsov] It is known that the sum Channel 4 was to have  paid  to the Ministry of Communications for air time last year was  about 360 million rubles, 50 of which was for December alone.  This year the rates for state television companies have been  increased approximately 1.5-fold. And how much will NTV be  paying?    [Malashenko] I cannot give you the precise figure, but these  rates are much higher for us than they are for Ostankino.    [Zubtsov] Incidentally, during the period of the struggle  for  the channel many of your opponents were asserting that NTV  investors were on the verge of financial ruin and that to obtain  Channel 4 and make advertising prices much higher than they are  in St. Petersburg was the only possibility of rectifying the  situation.    [Malashenko] I would like very much for that to be the case,  because if it were, we would soon become remarkably profitable.  But for now we are doomed to bear colossal costs, and along with  us--our investors as well. This is work for the long-range  future. And as for advertising, the rates for it will indeed be  high--relative to Russian prices and the prices of the former  Channel 4. We have a purely market situation here. I never tire  of repeating that state companies sell advertising time at  reduced rates. The services of the Ministry of Communications,  say, are paid for by the state to that same Ostankino, and this,  incidentally, makes up 80 percent of Ostankino's budget. Nobody  is paying for us. And while increasing the prices for  advertising we understand that we can attract the advertiser  only through the quality of our programs. Plus--through  expansion of the broadcasting network. Although our prices are  still, of course, lower than on Channel 1.    [Zubtsov] We have finally gotten around to the programs  themselves. One cannot but admit that NTV has made an impressive  start. What next? Do you plan to create new programs of your  own? Tell us, incidentally, about Konstantin Erist's transfer to  your team.    [Malashenko] I know nothing about Erist's transfer. We  simply  acquired for demonstration a large package of his "Matador"  programs like, incidentally, many other popular programs from  various years. The expansion of the team is proceeding but in  the direction of the information service--a correspondents'  network is being created throughout Russia and the first NTV  correspondents' points are being opened up abroad. And we intend  to produce only information programs, creating the first truly  high-quality and professional information service on domestic  TV. We shall buy everything else, which leaves a great deal of  room for maneuvering. If the ratings drop for, say, some program  on ATV or ViD--we will stop buying it and buy another one.  Large-scale production of our own programs involve a  dictatorship of the producer: we have invested money in the  program and we have to put it on the air regardless of how  interesting it has turned out to be. But for us everything is  determined by the viewer's interest. We are waiting impatiently  for the first ratings and sociological studies so that we can  find out how the interest is distributed between domestic and  foreign movies, old and new films, artistic programs and  programs from the past. We will plan our subsequent work on this  basis since we have the opportunity to do that.</p>

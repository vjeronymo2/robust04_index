			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 24 (CTK) -- Honorary chairman of  the emerging New Slovakia movement Rudolf Mosny, known among  other things as the owner of the Saris brewery, today spoke out  against the coupon method of privatization and the method in  which it had been applied so far in Slovakia.    In the transfer of state property it was enough for a bundle  of shares in privatized property to be transferred to whoever  won the competition to take over the state company, and leave  further gradual privatization to developments in the privatized  company, he said.    The present method of coupon privatization broke up the real  owner relationship into too great a number of shareholders, and  consequently companies' dependency on the results of economic  management was lost.    New Slovakia is against the privatization of strategic  industrial branches, such as energy, gas and telecommunications.  "The government has to retain control over these basic means of  influencing the country's economy," he explained.    The movement wants to stimulate the successful  transformation  of the Slovak economy by changes in tax policy and tax law.  These should provide foreign capital with suitable conditions.  New Slovakia representatives said they had already been  negotiating resources from unspecified countries in the Far East  and Western Europe.    Changes in tax policy would stimulate saving and investment,  they said. This could be achieved by abolishing savings taxes,  taxing only that part of incomes which was spent and tax relief  on investment in machinery and equipment.    Turning to the Czech Republic, the movement's economic  expert  Jaroslav Zapletal said that if the insolvency of state companies  was included in the state budget, as was normal in Western  European economies, the Czech budget would have had a deficit of  60 million crowns (2 million USD) last year.    "The economic results of the Czech Republic are good, but  they are camouflaged," Zapletal said. In the Czech and Slovak  Republics the insolvency of state companies was not funded from  the state budget, but the money had to come from the pockets of  their suppliers, he added. This was confirmed by inflation in  the Czech Republic. "There can be no inflation with a surplus of  four million crowns; if anything it causes deflation," he said.    Mosny said the success of economic reform in the Czech  Republic was the result of successful propaganda. The economic  results of companies privatized by the coupon method were worse  than before the 1989 revolution, he claimed.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Kvaerner hit by losses in shipping arm KVAERNER, the diversified Norwegian group with main interests in engineering, shipping and shipbuilding, registered a fall in 1992 pre-tax profit to NKr932m (Dollars 136.7m) from NKr1.12bn a year earlier. The group will lift its dividend payment to NK5 a share from NKr3. The weaker result was due to substantial losses by the group's mechanical engineering and shipping divisions. Shipping operations plunged into a NKr115m pre-tax loss last year from a NKr4m profit in 1991 while mechanical engineering widened pre-tax losses to NKr232m from NKr51m. Shipbuilding, which accounted for nearly 80 per cent of group profits, increased pre-tax profit by NKr204m to NKr735m last year. Group net revenue rose to NKr20bn from NKr18.7bn in 1991, but operating costs increased to NKr18.4bn from NKr16.9bn. Kvaerner forecast 1993 pretax profit to be on a par with last year's, despite an expected weaker shipbuilding market.</p>

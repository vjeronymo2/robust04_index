			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Companies hit by lawsuits over sackings A spate of employment discrimination lawsuits is hitting companies with US operations in the wake of widespread corporate 'downsizing'. While the hiring practices of US companies have long been scrutinised for bias, businesses increasingly face potential charges of violations of US fair employment laws for the manner in which they shed workers. Statistical analyses of the number of workers fired, according to their race, sex and age are now essential defensive moves, according to legal experts. Increasingly, US companies are also requiring employees to agree to settle any dispute they may have with their employer through arbitration. The latter move is aimed at avoiding potentially large damage awards such as the Dollars 89.5m award handed down last week by a Los Angeles jury against Hughes Aircraft, a General Motors subsidiary. In the case, which involves two former employees of Hughes - one white and one black - the company has been found to have violated fair employment laws. Hughes called the jury verdict 'irrational, irresponsible and outrageous'. The company said it would move to have the jury award reduced or overturned by the judge or by a higher court. Legal experts said that the award would almost certainly be substantially reduced. The case has, however, sent a chilling message to employers. The award comes amid a rash of discrimination and harassment suits. In another high profile case, the US Labor Department, which is supposed to be a watchdog against workplace discrimination, agreed to pay an estimated Dollars 4.9m to settle a suit that accused the agency of discrimination against its own black employees. Businesses complain that despite their efforts to eliminate bias in the workplace, increasingly restrictive laws make it very difficult to comply. US employment laws prohibit many practices that are common in Europe and Asia. When interviewing prospective employees, for example, US employers are precluded from seeking information about the age, health or national origin of the applicant. Since the Americans with Disabilities Act became law in mid-1992, requiring businesses to make provision for workers who are physically or mentally disabled, for example, some 27,000 claims have been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Lasmo makes Pounds 123m sale to PowerGen Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday gave its flagging balance sheet a boost by selling a Pounds 123m package of offshore assets to PowerGen, the electricity generator. The centrepiece of the deal is a 5 per cent stake in the Liverpool Bay gas field, which will supply PowerGen's planned power plant at Connah's Quay in Wales. Lasmo's interest in two North Sea gas fields, Ravenspurn and Johnston, are also in the package. Liverpool Bay - which constitutes about a fifth of Lasmo's UK assets - is one of the most promising development projects in the group's portfolio, most of which is heavily geared to volatile oil prices. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said the company could have sold more of its stake. But it did not want to see its share in the project fall below 25 per cent given the high quality of the asset and the fact that financing was in place. Analysts believe Lasmo received similar terms for Liverpool Bay to those achieved by Monument Resources last month when it sold a 3.9 per cent stake in the project to PowerGen. Monument achieved a 25 per cent premium for the reserves on a dollars per barrel basis. Lasmo shares closed yesterday at 114p, up 1p. Mr Darby said the sale would help the company through a period of heavy spending on development projects, which would reduce its vulnerability to oil prices. Without the sale, the company faced a rise in gearing from the present 70 per cent to 80-90 per cent at the end of 1994 - at current low oil prices. Mr Simon Flowers, an analyst at Natwest Markets, estimated that the cash injection, which should come through in April, would be supplemented by Pounds 58m in savings on Liverpool Bay capital costs over the next three years. That means Lasmo's gearing at the end of 1994 could be contained to about 75 per cent, although it is likely to continue rising through 1995 because of development spending. Additional asset sales, including the Markham gas field which straddles the UK and Dutch sectors of the North Sea, are still in the offing, according to Mr Darby. Talks with Wintershall, the German gas company, are continuing, but the conflicting tax positions of the two companies are a complication. PowerGen's second upstream purchase in as many months is in line with its aim of securing more of its own fuel reserves. Lex, Page 12; Background, Page 14</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Telecom alliance extended A NEW strand was added to the growing web of international telecommunication alliances yesterday when Japan's biggest telephone operator, Kokusai Denshin Denwa, signed a co-operation pact with Unisource, a three-way joint venture linking the telecommunications companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The latest partnership is aimed, in the first instance, at allowing Japanese-based multinationals to maintain data connections with their subsidiaries in Europe. Other global communications services may be added later. Mr Kazuo Yoshida, managing director of business communications at KDD, said the European deal was 'non-exclusive', meaning that it would not prevent the Japanese company from continuing to pursue the larger 'Worldsource' venture launched by AT&amp;T of the US in the spring. Besides AT&amp;T, other leading international telecommunications companies such as British Telecom are also seeking to provide 'one-stop' telecommunications services to multinational businesses. Unisource, a joint venture between PTT Telecom of the Netherlands, Telia of Sweden and Swiss Telecom, is designed to enable the telecommunications companies of these smaller European countries to compete with the industry giants.</p>

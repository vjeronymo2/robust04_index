			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PUBLIC ENEMY RAPS THE SYSTEM  </P> <P> Critics' choice. According to the Village Voice, the No. 1 album band in the  land.  </P> <P> Public Enemy, that is -- deejay Terminator-X, emcees Flavor Flav and Chuck D --  brought its hip-hop sounds to town Thursday night, and UCLA's Ackerman Ballroom  was the site, where black and white, college and street kids alike heard the  word that disturbs and distills all the anger and fear that a young black  person must feel on the street, in the schools and the jails when the System  fails to take heed of those people in need.  </P> <P>  "Murder is the No. 1 cause of death among black males under 25."  </P> <P>  -- Los Angeles Times, March 9  </P> <P> Boyeeee, this music is an outlet for the rage and the message of those denied  access to any other medium. It speaks to its audience in a way that is clear to  them about what a waste it is to freebase or watch television. About pride in  one's race and one's history. About media hype and economic self-sufficiency.  </P> <P>  "Nearly three of every four black children live in poverty, more than half in  single-parent homes."  </P> <P>  -- Los Angeles Times, March 9  </P> <P> Yo, the music is an angry, harsh, noisy bed, with razor-sharp cuts that go  upside your head where Flavor Flav's jokin' and Chuck D's stentorian delivery  merge with the urge to move your feet to the beat of the boots of the  Uzi-toting honor guard that accompanied the 90 minutes' worth of facts that  were rapidly rapped to a half-capacity crowd that was rapt and wowed by those  with the courage to say what's on black minds in 1989. Terminator-X, bring the  noise! DON WALLER  </P></p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Mr Kohl goes to Washington WHEN HELMUT Kohl goes to Washington in a couple of weeks, he will do so as leader of Europe's most powerful country, as chairman of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and, not least, as a politician who is not facing an imminent election. These assets will not make him more popular with his hosts. They will merely make them more demanding. Leading Washington columnists are now writing of Mr Kohl's country as 'economic enemy number 1', along with France. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, his economics minister, can readily tell Mr Kohl why. Many Americans believe that he has failed to deliver on promises of support for the Uruguay Round given at G7 summits. They complain that he places German farmers, his own obdurate farm minister, Mr Ignaz Kiechle, and, not least, his friend, the beleaguered Francois Mitterrand, above both his promises and his country's wider economic interests. Nobody expects constructive contributions from Mr Mitterrand's France; but they expect more from Mr Kohl's Germany. If Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt's director general, expected the Draft Final Act of the Uruguay Round proposed last December to bring about completion of the round by Easter, it now seems he will be disappointed. The complex negotiations over market access in manufactures, in agriculture and in services have many hurdles to jump. More important, matters of fundamental principle - largely in agriculture - need to be resolved. Like many before, the Easter deadline looks like being passed. US protectionists Some will ask whether this matters. The end of the Uruguay Round may, like the Italy sought by Virgil's hero Aeneas, disappear into the distance. Yet the world goes on. The American administration may even prefer not to put the final results to Congress before the election. Protectionists may not have swept the board in the presidential primaries, but congressmen will still stand up for local interests. So why not negotiate for a while longer? With the round bound to be caught up in the American election campaign, with frictions certain to grow in many areas of trade, the Uruguay round already looks a poor bet. The longer it continues the worse becomes the bet. A never-ending negotiation now looks as likely a fate for the Uruguay Round as eventual success. But breakdown looks more likely than either. Agricultural concessions What makes delay so depressing is that an agreement no longer seems impossible, even in agriculture. But the alternative notion, that agriculture can be put to one side, should be forgotten. Too many countries regard agricultural liberalisation as the main benefit of the round. They will not accept deals elsewhere without concessions on agriculture. At present, the ball is in the European Community's court. It is no use for the EC to complain about the grandiose American demands for complete liberalisation. These disappeared as soon as the EC came up with an offer, in the autumn of 1990. The problem now is that EC says it wants changes in the text presented by Mr Dunkel. But the EC has been unable to agree on the changes it wants. The failure to make these demands reflects the EC's stalemate over reform of the common agricultural policy. The obstacle, as always, is the farm ministers. It is ludicrous that the EC's position on a matter which vitally affects its own future and its relations with the rest of the world should be decided by agricultural backwoodsmen. What is needed, instead, is involvement by EC heads of government. Since another failure would damage both Mr Bush's domestic credibility and American attitudes to its main trading partners, a G7 summit would be too risky. The first step is, in any case, an EC agreement on the linked issues of CAP reform and the Uruguay Round. When Mr Kohl goes to Washington he should be able to tell his hosts that not only has a meeting of EC heads of government been called, but that he will put his formidable weight behind the outcome his hosts want and the world needs.</p>

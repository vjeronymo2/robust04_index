			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> REDGRAVE RISES IN 'ORPHEUS DESCENDING'  </P> <P> Vanessa Redgrave, unemployable on Broadway after her anti-Zionist remarks on  Oscar night 12 years ago, finally returned to Broadway last year in a revival  of Tennessee Williams' 1957 drama, "Orpheus Descending."  </P> <P> Thank God those Redgrave-baiters-and-haters dissipated their clout. The actress  and this neglected play were meant for each other. You can see the dynamics of  the union in Peter Hall's semi-operatic television adaptation of his Broadway  and London production today on cable's TNT (at 5 p.m., 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.).  </P> <P> This drama, quintessential early Williams, is set in a small, bigoted Southern  town and swirls around the relationship between a lyrical and sensual drifter  (the Southern-fried Orpheus of the title) and the town's eccentric women of  damnation, chiefly Redgrave's tormented, Italian immigrant storekeeper.  </P> <P> Like its purple plot, the play's history is full of bruises. It bombed as  Williams' first full-length production, under the title "Battle of Angels" in  1940, was maligned in its Broadway reincarnation in 1957 and failed as a Marlon  Brando-Anna Magnani-Sidney Lumet movie ("The Fugitive Kind," 1960).  </P> <P> But Hall's production takes the melodrama and Williams' obsessive violence and  sex -- the primary sources of critical carping -- and creates a churning,  theatrical, even at times comical hell on Earth. Except for substituting a blow  torch for ravenous killer hounds at the fadeout, the TV production is true to  the play, particularly its blend of recrimination, lust and religion.  </P> <P> The style is not naturalistic. The visual tone, with some montages, is  alternately garish and pastoral/dreamlike.  </P> <P> Williams' lost, victimized angels (the indelible Redgrave as a blond "wop"  among racist apes, and Kevin Anderson as the guitar-playing vagabond who moves  in with her) are scorchingly vulnerable. Redgrave, back to the camera, is naked  in one scene, which is an artful example of nurturing nudity.  </P> <P> Hall hasn't reined in this drama's excesses but has given them flight. The  vivid supporting characters are alternately gross (Sloane Shelton's florid  magpie), ravished (Anne Twomey's haunting, nympho-dipso temptress), or  heartbreaking (Miriam Margolyes' sweet visionary painter).  </P> <P> The narrative opening of two gossipy women superimposed against a wild car ride  in a downpour is stylistically crucial and hurtles you into the plot.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the musician drifter (who suggests a post-"Glass Menagerie" Tom  Wingfield) turns to the searching Redgrave heroine with the sardonic words:  "The make believe answer . . . love." You remember that irony at the KKK-hooded  ending, which will shock plenty of viewers. Even for those who know the play,  it's wrenching. RAY LOYND  </P></p>

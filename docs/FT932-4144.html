			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Japan's assurers still not investing abroad - Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo on the reluctance of life groups to diversify JAPAN'S life assurance companies have joined the list of financial institutions willing to expose some of the scars from the late 1980s, a time when even sober-minded fund managers were tempted to lend to speculators and developers who would normally be kept at arm's length. The industry's bad loans comprise a very small portion of loans outstanding, but the figures released by the companies, with Chiyoda Mutual topping the list at Y231.6bn (Dollars 2.2bn), do not tell the full story as they include loans on which interest rates have been greatly reduced to ease the squeeze on troubled clients. A modest stock of non-performing loans should encourage assurers to press for better returns on long-term shareholdings in Japanese companies, but there is little sign they have begun to act on their threat to pull-out of shares in companies with low dividends. The life companies had also indicated that they would increase their income by diversifying into foreign investments, but their holdings of foreign securities slipped 4 per cent in January, compared with the same month a year earlier, and the yen's rapid appreciation in recent weeks has made them even more wary of investing abroad. Mr Takayuki Kimura, manager of Chiyoda Mutual's international department, said the yen's erratic movement has made the eight leading companies particularly conscious of exchange rate risk: 'We have to be very careful about international investment.' He said Chiyoda Mutual has 'revised' its long-term shareholdings in Japanese companies and is altering its portfolio 'little by little' but has no intention of dumping the stocks of companies with low dividends. Facing a fourth year of falling profits, many listed Japanese companies are cutting their dividends or considering a cut, putting more pressure on the life assurers. 'We don't only look at dividends. We have to consider the future growth potential of the company, its long-term profitability, and the importance of cross-shareholdings,' Mr Kimura said. The prospect of life assurers running down their investment portfolios has prompted a debate over whether the country's corporate cross-holding system was coming apart at the seams. But the companies are holding on to most of the shares, even though the strategy appears to be bruising them, and their policy holders. A surge in Tokyo prices in the final weeks of the fiscal year to March bolstered the companies' latent profits on stocks at the close of accounts. But the combined total for the eight leading life companies - Y8,416bn - was still down almost 60 per cent from two years ago, reflecting the steep decline in share prices. To encourage the companies not to realise profits, which could have pushed share prices lower, the finance ministry allowed them to record appraisal profits on their holdings. Seven of the eight took advantage of the decision. The combined premium income of the eight expanded by only 4.4 per cent in 1992-93 while total assets were 9.1 per cent higher than a year earlier. Even with the appraisal profits on stocks, their return on assets ranged from only 3.8 per cent to 4.72 per cent. Nippon Life has by far the largest latent profits on stocks, Y3,183bn at the end of March, while Chiyoda had the smallest at Y169.6bn - some Y60bn less than its non-performing loans. Chiyoda's loan problems stem partly from its funding of Mr Hideki Yokoi, a share speculator. The company has launched a legal action against him in an attempt to raise funds from the sale of Tokyo property. Traditionally, Japanese life assurers were important providers of funds to the country's manufacturing companies, but these companies found funds easy to raise on the stock market during the late 1980s, prompting some to look beyond the old, trusted customers. Life assurers insist that they have limited exposure to the property market, the cause of Japanese banks' bad loan burden, and say they are again able to court conservative industrial companies, which are unable to raise funds on the Tokyo stock market. They say they have overhauled their risk assessment systems to ensure fewer lending mistakes. At the end of last year, the companies loans amounted to 37 per cent of the life assurers' assets, while securities holdings, domestic and foreign, comprised 43 per cent of that figure - domestic stocks accounted for about half of the total. The companies are hoping that loans as a percentage of funds employed, which fell from 68 per cent to 35 per cent from 1975 to 1989, will start to recover. They expect the percentage to improve to between 40 and 50 per cent over the next few years.  -------------------------------    LIFE COMPANIES' BAD LOANS  ------------------------------- Ybn Nippon Life       19.4 Dai-Ichi              63.7 Sumitomo              36.7 Meiji                 13.7 Asahi                 17.7 Mitsui                18.5 Yasuda                 4.2 Chiyoda              231.6  ------------------------------- Source: company accounts  -------------------------------</p>

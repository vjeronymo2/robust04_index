			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alcatel profits warning drives share price down Shares in Alcatel-Alsthom plunged more than 12 per cent yesterday after the French-based engineering, transport and telecommunications group warned of lower sales and net profits this year. The shares lost FFr110 to close at FFr792. The group said that barring an upturn in market conditions, net profits would be between 10 and 20 per cent lower than last year, which it said would be about the same as the FFr7.05bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in 1992. Sales this year are expected to fall by a smaller proportion than profits. Most industry analysts had expected a rise of about 5 per cent in net profits this year. The sharp fall in the share price was also attributed to the fact that Alcatel-Alsthom previously resisted the effects of European recession, having increased profits every year since 1986. 'It caught investors rather off guard,' said one electronics analyst in Paris. In an interview with Les Echos, the French financial daily, Mr Pierre Suard, chairman, blamed the expected decline in profits on a deterioration in some of the group's principal telecommunications markets. He cited Germany, Italy and Spain as countries where conditions were particularly difficult. He said the economic situation in Europe had been exacerbated by a 'unilateral opening of the market', and the failure of other developed economies to adopt similar measures. 'The ongoing problems in mature markets mean that 1994 will be a difficult year,' said Mr Andrew Haskins, electronics industry analyst at James Capel in London. He said Alcatel-Alsthom remained in a strong position to benefit from the introduction of new technologies. Mr Suard emphasised the strengths of the group and prospects for expansion. He said Alcatel had made progress in diversifying its markets, and that the combined European subsidiaries of the group had increased their exports by 30 per cent last year, and should raise them again by about 20 per cent this year. The international telecommunications industry, he said, showed strong growth potential in areas such as broad-band transmission, mobile communications, and interactive television. Mr Suard said Alcatel planned to compete for a third radio-telephone licence to be awarded by the French government. The Alcatel chairman also expressed confidence in the conclusion of a Dollars 2bn high-speed railway contract with South Korea. GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French joint venture, has been competing fiercely with a German consortium for the contract.</p>

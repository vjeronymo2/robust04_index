			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Minister proposes moves to speed house buying MEASURES to speed the process of house buying are to be introduced in an effort to boost the housing market recovery, the Department of the Environment said yesterday. The proposals, which would force local authorities in England and Wales to reply to standard land-search inquiries within a statutory period and give the public greater access to land information, are due to be announced by Sir George Young, housing minister, in a speech to the National Association of Estate Agents tonight. A government consultative document examining ways of improving purchasing procedures, and guaranteeing the public's access to property information in accordance with the Citizen's Charter, is due to be issued within the next few weeks. Proposals for the creation of a national land information system are also under discussion. The environment department said yesterday the initiative was in response to a 'clear recognition' that the present purchasing procedure needed to be speeded up. Sir George, noting that 'just about every housing market indicator' was pointing to a recovery, said: 'There is considerable evidence of pent-up demand. There are clear signs that buyers who have been holding back waiting for the housing market to pick up are now becoming active.' Mr David Goldsworthy, president of the National Association of Estate Agents, said agents would welcome the initiative, which they had been demanding for some time. 'At the moment so much time is wasted by people in local authorities dragging their feet,' he said.</p>

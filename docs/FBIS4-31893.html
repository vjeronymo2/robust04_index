			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- Late Tuesday [14  June] night, beginning with 2245, the trade unions and the  government started negotiations at the latter's headquarters,  the Victoria Palace in Bucharest, after a first day of marches  and rallies staged by the Alfa Cartel and other two large trade  union blocs. These were joined, the press assessed, by some  12,000 employees, many of whom travelled to Bucharest from the  province.    The executive was represented at the talks by Labor and  Social Protection Minister Dan Mircea Popescu, Finance Minister  Florin Georgescu, Government's Secretary General Viorel  Hrebenciuc, and Octavian Partenie, the government's liaison  officer with the employers' and trade unions' associations.    The trade union delegation consisted of 15 persons, with the  Alfa Cartel leader Bogdan Hossu, and his CNSLR-Fratia [National  Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions] counterpart,  Victor Ciorbea, at its head.    According to a government release, lying at the core of the  talks was a government ordinance regulating the maximum wage  fund exempted from supplementary taxation, which the unions  consider as restricting wage rises. Also of prime importance  was the subject of the degradation of the purchasing power of  the common citizens, and wages in the educational system.    At 0120 the talks were interrupted and scheduled for  resumption Thursday, 16 May. After this first round of talks  Octavian Partenie said that the government made its point of  view known, to the effect that supplements to the budget  allocation for education would be approved as soon as the  economy provided the necessary funds. He also said the  government consented to resume the talks provided the unions  called off their rallies. Bogdan Hossu was quoted as saying  that there was hope that on Thursday positive solutions would be  found for all the claims.    The unions' actions started Tuesday [14 June] morning with a  rally in Aviatorilor Square and continued with marches along the  main avenues of Bucharest until the afternoon, when the  demonstrators returned to Victoriei Square, in front of the  government's building, where they demanded that a trade union  delegation be received by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. The  first round of negotiations started after long bargaining  between the sides related to the size of the unions' delegation  to the talks.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BERNHARDT VICTORY SIGN  </P> <P> Floyd Morrow's backing of Linda Bernhardt gives a victory sign for Linda in  November. After a disappointing defeat, it takes a really fine person to step  forward so soon and endorse a former opponent. Floyd has always had his heart  in the right place, and San Diego City Councilman Ed Struiksma should realize  that Floyd's love and concern for Linda Vista and Clairemont will bring the  voters out. Floyd has seen Linda grow with leadership capabilities that have  surprised everyone. His endorsement gives us hope, and, if everyone gets out  and works for Linda, we can end the reign of big money.  </P> <P> RUTH DUEMLER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

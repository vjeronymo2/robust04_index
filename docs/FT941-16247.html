			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: State to raise Dollars 1.4bn from IMI sale The Italian government stands to make up to L2,200bn (Dollars 1.4bn) by selling part of its stake in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the latest candidate on its privatisation list. Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury minister, said the state would roughly halve its shareholding in IMI to about 30 per cent from just over 60 per cent. The transaction, to start on January 31, involves the sale of 200m IMI shares, representing one third of its capital. About 90 per cent of the shares being sold are held directly or indirectly by the Treasury. The pricing will be revealed on January 29. However, the Treasury has indicated that shares vill be sold for between L9,800 and L11,000 each. The majority of the issue will be reserved for institutional investors, notably abroad. Some 35m shares will go to US institutions, 65m to other foreign investors and 25m to Italian institutions. A further 75m shares are being sold to private investors in Italy. Mr Mario Draghi, the director general of the Treasury, who has been overseeing the IMI sale for more than two years, justified the decision to dispose of only half the state's stake for the time being. With the privatisation of Credito Italiano barely completed and that of Banca Commerciale Italiana coming immediately after IMI, the Treasury had to be careful not to flood the market, he argued. The BCI deal starts on February 28. The fact that the IMI privatisation is an initial public offering, rather than the disposal of residual public-sector stock, compelled caution, he said. Selling IMI shares in more than one tranche could maximise receipts for the state. IMI embraces long-term lending, fund management, securities trading and insurance. It raised net profits to L376bn in the nine months to September 30 1993 from L275bn in the same period in 1992.</p>

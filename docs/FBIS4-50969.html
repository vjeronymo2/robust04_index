			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yaozhong (1776 5069 0022): "Each Is Doing Its Best </F> To Stop Losses--A Roundup of State-Owned Enterprises Making Up  Their Losses"]    [Text] State-owned enterprises are the "big brothers" of  the national economy but their long-standing deficits keep  worrying us.    One-third of state-owned enterprises are obviously suffering  from losses, one-third are facing latent losses, and only  one-third are really making profits. This is the current common  appraisal. Loss-making state-owned enterprises with independent  accounting amounted to 11,453, accounting for 31.8 percent of  the total.    A comrade in the State Council pointed out: The serious  deficits in state-owned enterprises have caused them economic  losses, brought about big difficulties to state and local  revenues, directly affected sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi  xu, kuai su, jian kang, 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] economic  development, and affected the smooth carrying out of enterprise  reform. Politically, enterprise deficits, their inability to  pay their employees' wages, and the decline in the employees'  living standards have seriously affected social stability.    The people throughout the country are concerned about making  up state-owned enterprises' deficits. The government and  enterprises are considering how to change this situation and we  are very clear that this situation must not remain any longer.  <H5>  Introduction of Foreign Capital Yields Good Results </H5>   In Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, there are 37 state-owned  enterprises directly under the city's jurisdiction. Thirteen of  these enterprises were making losses, most of them were only  making meager profits, and only three of them were making  profits of more than 1 million yuan. The loss-making  enterprises either had stopped their production for years or  were in a state of semi-production. Some could not repay their  debts or their profits could not offset the interest on loans.  These enterprises could not make up their deficits.    In August 1992, the Quanzhou City authorities sold 60  percent  of the assets of these enterprises to the Hong Kong China  Strategic Investment Company Limited, which became the main  stockholder. After a year of joint venture, these enterprises  saw tremendous changes. According to statistics at the end of  1993, the sales volume in these 37 enterprises increased by  15.28 percent over the previous year; their taxes paid to the  government increased by 48 percent; their profits rose by 4.4  times; and they repaid special loans of 3,027 yuan [figure as  published]. Their losses were cleared and their profits  increased by a wide margin. In 1994, these enterprises have  continued to register a steady growth. Why is it that after  foreign capital was introduced, these enterprises were so  greatly different from before? The chairman of these  joint-venture enterprises gave the following six reasons: With  the introduction of foreign capital, there is a clear  distinction between management and ownership and between  responsibility and duty; these enterprises can obtain foreign  exchange funds for their technical transformation; they can  introduce advanced foreign technology and scientific managerial  methods; they can explore the international market by means of  the foreign side's relations with other countries, their broad  channels, and their responsive information; they can put their  stocks in overseas listings and open the way for raising capital  abroad; and they have established an effective supervisory  mechanism. Many people in economic circles say that the  participation of foreign investors in the formation of limited  shareholding companies with state-owned enterprises is an  effective way of transforming state-owned enterprises, making up  their deficits, and improving their vitality; this bears  practical significance in helping small and medium state-owned  enterprises out of their predicaments. Hopwever, in the course  of implementation there is a need to assess state-owned assets  rationally to prevent them from being sold at low prices or  being allowed to drain away. Whether or not the stocks of a  joint-venture enterprise should be held by the foreign investor  depends on the specific situation. We should not link an assets  transfer to the political and social system but should regard it  as a normal practice in the market economy.    Selling assets to foreign investors for joint-venture  purposes is not an individual case. The Hong Kong China  Strategic Investment Company Limited alone pooled capital with  102 light industrial enterprises in Dalian and dozens of  enterprises in Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Wuxi in running  joint-venture enterprises in these cities, thus enlivening  state-owned enterprises there.    People in economic circles call this a "China Strategic  practice" which switches the transformation of enterprises'  operational mechanism to the transfer of state property rights.  This is a more thorough way of transforming enterprises'  operational mechanisms and serves as a foundation for the  establishment of a new enterprise system.  <H5>  Orienting Enterprises Toward the Market Gives Much Hope </H5>   Some enterprise deficits in the 1980's were the "after  effects" of the traditional planned economy; in the 1990's, many  enterprises' deficits are the results of their "inability to  adapt" to the market economy. A state-owned machine-building  enterprise in northeast China has incurred losses for many  consecutive years. Its staff members and workers, having  nothing to do, will usually sit in the sun and play cards in the  factory compound, waiting for state relief. A small factory of  a similar type in south China held a trade fair in the city in  which the enterprise is located. Within a few days, purchase  orders worth tens of millions of yuan were signed. The  enterprise staff members and workers in the northeast remained  indifferent to what was happening around them. There is a  similar example in Jiangxi. A ramie spinning factory in this  province has adopted the same method for 10 years, regardless of  market changes. It has finally changed from a profitable  factory into a loss-making one. Refusing to adjust production  in accordance with market changes is an important reason why  many state-owned enterprises have incurred losses.    The Shanxi Dazhong Machine-Building Factory is a military  industrial enterprise which used to manufacture one type of  product. It suffered from losses for six consecutive years from  1986 to 1992 and finally found itself in a predicament. In 1992  it started adjusting its leading group. As soon as the new  factory director assumed office, he led the employees in  breaking away from the traditional planned economy and a closed  military industrial structure. They removed the barrier between  the military industry and the market, used the market for  guidance, adjusted the product mix, and concentrated on  manufacturing gas stoves, textile winders [luo tong ji 4820 4592  2623], and other civilian products. As a result, they stopped  the factory's deficits within four months. The Beijing  Wristwatch Factory freed itself from its loss-making predicament  because it "always remembered the market, attentively watched  the market, and adapted its products to the market." They  adjusted the factory's operational strategy and product mix,  switched from manufacturing single-function to multi-function  wristwatches, and reformed their management system, investment  orientation, product design, trial production, and reward  methods. The period for developing new products was shortened  from six to two months and wristwatch models increased from the  previous dozens to more than 200. The factory reduced its  losses by some 7 million yuan in 1992 and made up its deficits  and began to make profits in 1993.    Managerial personnel from some state-owned enterprises which  had seen improvement said with deep feeling: In the past we had  blind faith in plans and ignored the market role and, as a  result, we were abandoned by the market and found the going  tough. We now trust the market and feel that it can provide  prompt information. Thus, enterprises can have impetus and  methods.  <H5>  Invigorating the Tertiary Industry and Supplementing the </H5> Secondary Industry    Overstaffed administrations, applying for relief when facing  a small problem, and complaining when there is no problem are  important reasons why state-owned enterprises have incurred  losses. When inspecting a coal mine, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  said: To make up deficits, increase profits, and free itself  from its predicament, an enterprise must tap its potential,  reduce its personnel, and develop a diversified economy and the  tertiary industry.    Shanxi's Yungang Coal Mine was engaged mainly in mining but  it was overstaffed. For many years, everyone in this mine had  eaten from the state's big pot. Before 1991, it incurred  deficits for many consecutive years. What was to be done? It  worked out the following method: It fully used the surplus  personnel to develop the tertiary industry and a diversified  economy and supplement the secondary industry, with the aim of  making up deficits. It divided the personnel into three groups:  One-third continued to carry out coal production, one-third  engaged in providing service for production and life, and  one-third engaged in the tertiary industry and a diversified  economy. It also formed seven companies which had their own  system and independent management, thus separating them from the  coal mine. The surplus personnel were given jobs through  various channels. After a year of practice, the coal mine began  to make up deficits. The profits gained from the tertiary  industry and diversified economy contributed to the coal mine's  turn for the better.    The Dalian Heavy Machine-Building Factory--a key enterprise  in the state's heavy machine-building industry--also suffered  serious losses. In making up the losses, it did not lay any of  its personnel off or shift the burden to society but used its  personnel, labor force, and capital in the commercial and  service fields and for tertiary industrial development. This  helped invigorate its dormant capital and boost the surplus  personnel's initiative. The profits gained from the tertiary  industry and other diversified operations amounted to 7.7  million yuan in 1992 and topped 10 million yuan in 1993.  Invigorating the tertiary industry and supplementing the  secondary industry are good methods for enterprises to make up  deficits and increase profits.    These methods have been implemented without affecting the  enterprises' employees' stability or increasing social burdens.  These methods have practical significance and provide us with  the following enlightenment: The market economic structure is  now being established. If we continue to stick to the old  conventions and restrict ourselves within the limits of the  secondary industry, we will have no way out. Breaking through  industrial restrictions and coping with market demands can turn  surplus personnel into useful assets.  <H5>  Macrocontrol and Regulation Enliven the Infrastructure </H5>   It is undeniable that some state-owned enterprises' deficits  have resulted from faults in macropolicies or ineffective  macrocontrol and regulation. There are many such examples. The  economic returns of some household appliance enterprises are low  because there is too much duplicate manufacture and the markets  are limited. So, quite a proportion of production remains idle  and, due to the "bottleneck" restrictions of basic facilities  and basic industries, many enterprises cannot bring their  productivity into full play. About one-third of China's  productivity is wasted because of power shortages or power  supply restrictions. Inadequate transport facilities have  caused stagnation in the transportation of raw materials from  hinterland provinces and have made it impossible for coastal  areas to display their processing capacity and market role. Due  to funds shortages, many enterprises cannot buy raw or  semifinished materials and have thus stopped their production.  Last year, one-third of light industrial, textile, and chemical  industrial enterprises in Chongqing City stopped production or  were in a state of semi-production; and enterprises which had  stopped production or were in a state of semi-production had  more than 300,000 employees.    Obviously, to make up these losses, the state should bring  into play macrocontrol and regulation or draw up a rational  macropolicy. To control investments in fixed assets and adjust  the investment structure, investments should be oriented to  "bottleneck" industries and enterprises' technical  transformation and duplicate manufacture should be stopped.  Strict control should be exercised over capital investments and  the release of loans. Limited funds should be used flexibly to  effectively support enterprise development. The prices of raw  and semiprocessed materials should be increased appropriately.  All these are indispensable for establishing a new market  economic structure and promoting economic development. However,  these must be processed during an appropriate period and the  impetus of adjustment must be properly controlled.    The state has now introduced quite a number of specially  targeted policies while encouraging the development of  "bottleneck" industries; it has made headway in forming the  financial and taxation macrocontrol structure. This is aimed at  creating conditions for state-owned enterprises to make up their  deficits. Only when the state has done well in exercising  macrocontrol and regulation will enterprises grow stronger and  enjoy healthy and reliable development.    Apart from using the above methods to make up their  deficits,  many enterprises, proceeding from their specific conditions,  have created other methods. For example, the Tianjin No. 1  Wool Spinning Factory stopped its production for rectification;  the Beijing No. 2 Wristwatch Factory transformed itself from an  industrial enterprise into a commercial enterprise; the Shanghai  No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory introduced an integration  method; the Handan Steel Corporation introduced a cost  accounting system related to the market economy; Fujian carried  out technical transformation; and Liaoning suspended, closed,  merged, and transferred the production in loss-making  enterprises. They all made remarkable advances not only in  making up their deficits but also in increasing their profits.    These facts suggest that, like mutual promotion and  restraint  between the five elements in nature, enterprises have the  methods to remedy their losses. This is called "the law is  stronger than the outlaws."    There are many new methods for us to explore in making up  deficits, such as by introducing reform, applying the market  mechanism, improving management, and using science and  technology.</p>

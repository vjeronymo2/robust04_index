Upon the conclusion of the 10th meeting of the  Mexican-Canadian Ministerial Commission on 1 March, the two  officials announced their governments' support for the candidacy  of the Colombian president, thus adding to the support already  pledged by the United States, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and  Argentina, among others.    The election of the OAS secretary general will take place in  Washington, D.C. on 27 March.

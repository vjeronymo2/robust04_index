			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO REASSESS ARTS FUNDING PLAN  </P> <P> The City Council will take another look at a 2-year-old report that recommended  the city expand its involvement in the performing arts.  </P> <P> This week, the council supported Councilman Mark Leyes' request to again take  up the report that suggested a permanent source of funding for the arts,  perhaps an entertainment tax, that could pay for projects such as the  construction of a third theater in the Village Green arts complex.  </P> <P> The recommendations were drafted by a community committee during a controversy  over funding the Grove Shakespeare Festival. The controversy led to the city's  phasing out of financial support for the festival and the Garden Grove  Symphony.  </P> <P> But with the election of Leyes and the retirement of Councilman Raymond T.  Littrell, who opposed arts funding, the council may now be more open to  supporting such funding.  </P> <P> The committee's report will be brought to the council for consideration at a  future date.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOARA BASEBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW'S MISTAKES, WALKS HELP NO.1-RANKED LAKEWOOD RETAIN TITLE  </P> <P> Generosity is fine, but Ocean View High School Coach Steve Barrett said his  team went a little far in a 9-3 loss to Lakewood in the Loara baseball  tournament championship game Saturday at Glover Stadium.  </P> <P> "We gave free passes, we gave free runs and we're probably going to give  everyone in the stands free steak dinners when we're done," Barrett said.  </P> <P> Lakewood (5-0), ranked No. 1 nationally by USA Today, won the tournament for  the second consecutive year.  </P> <P> Due largely to Ocean View (4-1) mistakes, the Lancers took a 3-1 lead after two  innings on just one hit. Further, Ocean View pitchers walked six batters, and  five of them scored.  </P> <P> Lakewood's Jeff Marsh singled to open the first inning and moved to third when  Ocean View pitcher Eric Schaff overthrew first base on a pickoff attempts. He  scored on a fielder's choice by David Reeser.  </P> <P> In the Lancers' second inning, Chris Miller and John Haberland walked with one  out and advanced on a double steal. Schaff got the second out on a strikeout,  but followed with a wild pitch to score Miller. Haberland also scored when  Ocean View catcher Kevin Bill's throw to the plate, in an attempt to get  Miller, was wild.  </P> <P> "We never gave ourselves a chance tonight," said Barrett, whose team was making  its first appearance in the championship game. "We came out and kind of  self-destructed. We've got a couple of youngsters and I think they were a  little nervous."  </P> <P> Lakewood extended the lead with four runs in the fourth and two in the fifth.  Miller, who scored three runs and stole two bases, accounted for the  fifth-inning runs with a home run.  </P> <P> Neither team used its top starter because Barrett and Lakewood Coach Spud  O'Neil were working around the pitching limitation rule in use in the Southern  Section for the first time this season. The rule states that, from Monday to  Saturday of each week, a team may not use a pitcher more than 10 innings.  </P> <P> Barrett said he would have preferred to start Jim Gwaltney (1-0), who relieved  Schaff (0-1) in the fourth inning. O'Neil's top pitchers are Reeser, 11-1 last  season, and Miller.  </P> <P> Still, Lakewood's Ryan Hornbeck filled in well. He won his first start of the  season by allowing just four hits, including Gilbert Gonzales' solo homer in  the sixth, and striking out four in six innings.  </P> <P> "We have superb pitching," said O'Neil, whose team allowed 11 runs in five  tournament games. "They're all good athletes and can play in the field, too."  KOLLEN LONG  </P></p>

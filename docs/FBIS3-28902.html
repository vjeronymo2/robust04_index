"They had lunch together at the presidential palace in  Tampaksiring and a meeting was held after the lunch," the source  said without saying how long the meeting lasted. [passage  omitted]    The meeting between the two leaders, at the summer palace  built by founding president Sukarno and overlooking the sacred  Hindhu bathing place and temple of Tampaksiring, was closed to  the press, journalists in Bali said by telephone.    The Taiwanese president flew to Bandung in West Java on  Thursday where he played golf and visited the state-owned  Nusantara National Aircraft Industry (IPTN) accompanied by its  president, Research and Technology Minister Bacharudin Jusuf  Habibie.

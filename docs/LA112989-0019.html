			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: TEST WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT FEAR  </P> <P> Should children be afraid? How much do you know about normal and abnormal fears  in children? Here's true-or-false test on this subject.  </P> <P> 1. -- A healthy child has no fears.  </P> <P> 2. -- The child who fears that every cold may turn into pneumonia is  intelligent, not unhealthy.  </P> <P> 3. -- The young child's fears are basically the same today as they were in the  past.  </P> <P> 4. -- If a 7-, 8- or 9-year-old expresses a fear of strangers or robbers,  parents should be concerned, because chances are this is an indication of  neuroses.  </P> <P> 5. -- Parents can help reduce the level of a child's anxieties about almost any  problem.  </P> <P> 6. -- If a child has fears, it may be an indication that he's less intelligent  than the child without fears.  </P> <P> 7. -- Parents should protect their children but not worry them about so-called  "bad" people who might take advantage of them.  </P> <P> 8. -- The greatest fears and worries of 15-year-olds center on whether or not  their world will be destroyed by nuclear war.  </P> <P> ANSWERS:  </P> <P> 1. -- FALSE. Everyone needs to have some fears. Without them no one would  survive, for we would take too many foolish risks that could destroy us.  </P> <P> 2. -- FALSE. This is an unrealistic fear that may be an early indication of  hypochondria. This shows an excessive preoccupation with sickness and may be  reflecting a parent's anxiety.  </P> <P> 3. -- TRUE. Children between the ages of 4 and 7 fear unknown things and bad  things.  </P> <P> 4. -- FALSE. These are normal anxieties in children of that age, because  they're more aware of things happening in the neighborhood and community.  </P> <P> 5. -- TRUE. They can do this by being calm and rational themselves and by  talking about specific problems that concern the youngster. Children's fears  often reflect their parents' anxiety levels.  </P> <P> 6. -- FALSE. Actually, a child who is fearful is apt to be more intelligent  because he or she is more aware of the dangers in the world and the  environment.  </P> <P> 7. -- FALSE. Of course parents should protect their children, but part of the  protection is to warn them that all strangers may not be nice. They should know  how to protect themselves from sexual abuse just as they should know about the  importance of obeying traffic rules.  </P> <P> 8. -- FALSE. Probably the biggest fear and anxiety of 15-year-olds is related  to sex. By this age, many children have been pressured by peers either to have  or not to have sex. Those who do may feel guilty and fearful of the  consequences, and those who don't may worry about being liked by peers and  being considered "normal."  </P> <P> If you answered six questions correctly, you're better informed than most on  this subject.  </P></p>

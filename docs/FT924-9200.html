			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Christiania cuts deficit but will seek more capital CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second-biggest bank, yesterday reported a sharp reduction in nine-month net losses to NKr785m (Dollars 122.8m) from NKr7.32bn last year, helped by a 20 per cent reduction in operating costs and an increase in net interest income. However, Christiania warned it will seek up to NKr1.44bn in fresh state capital to enable it to comply with the minimum 8 per cent capital adequacy rule by the end of the year. The bank said that at the end of September its capital ratio was 5.3 per cent. 'The government bank insurance fund has confirmed that it will assist the bank to meet the capital ratio requirement at the end of 1992,' Christiania said. Government-appointed bank fund officials are due to meet at the weekend to discuss changes to Norway's troubled banking industry and further state cash transfers to the banks. It is widely expected the state will have to inject NKr3bn to NKr4bn into the ailing bank sector. Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, met bank fund officials to seek further state support of between about NKr2bn and NKr3bn after receiving a NKr5.9bn injection last year. Fokus Bank, Norway's third-biggest bank, is expected to call on the state for up to NKr2bn in fresh support. Christiania said that nine-month credit losses had been reduced to NKr1.86bn from NKr5.79bn last year and that net interest income rose to NKr2.29bn from NKr2.07bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- The Afrikaner  Volksfront [National Front, AVF] on Thursday [31 March] asked  that the state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal be lifted and the  matter discussed with King Goodwill Zwelithini and Inkatha  Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi. An AVF statement  condemned what it called, "the one-sided imposition of the state  of emergency on kwaZulu/Natal by (State President) F W de Klerk  on the instructions of the African National Congress". It said  the state of emergency was an act of aggression against the Zulu  nation and, in particular, the king and Mr Buthelezi. The state  of emergency was also a sign that negotiations had failed. The  election now needed to be postponed, the statement said.</p>

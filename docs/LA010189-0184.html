			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SIFTING THROUGH YEAR'S OPINIONS  </P> <P> During 1988, various Orange County residents wrote about their feelings and  thoughts in articles submitted to our Sunday commentary columns. As we look  back, some of those thoughts are recalled:  </P> <P> David Camplin on drug use:  </P> <P> I see the problem every day I'm in school. Friends ditch school to go to the  beach and do drugs. Friends skip class and go to a field to smoke a quick  joint. People in my classes sell paraphernalia as well as the drugs right in  class. I see kids destroying their lives with such substances as pot, cocaine,  crack, acid, speed and many other drugs. We've got to wage a war against drug  abuse. Some users just need someone to accept them and be their friend --  outside of the drug circles. We need to care enough to listen and be willing to  help them. If drug users do not respond to that we need to inform as many  authorities as necessary to get the person off drugs. I've seen some beautiful  lives produced from horrible ones because they were forced into programs.  </P></p>

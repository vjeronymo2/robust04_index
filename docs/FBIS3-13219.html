			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab </F> Darawshah by Ibrahim Humaydi in Damascus; date not given]    [Text] [Humaydi] Do you see any political dimension to  your visit to Syria?    [Darawshah] We have come to offer our condolences and  perform a social, pan-Arab, and humanitarian duty. We are not  carrying any messages or carrying out any political mission.    [Humaydi] Do you believe that the visit will contribute to  pushing the peace negotiations forward?    [Darawshah] The aim of the visit is not to give an impetus  to or influence the negotiations. However, if it secures better  conditions, we welcome that. But I stress that that is not the  aim. The aim is to perform a duty.    [Humaydi] Who are the officials you will meet with during  the three days you are to spend in Damascus?    [Darawshah] We wish to hold political meetings, and, of  course, we are not going to embark on anything of that kind  without coordination with the Syrian brothers.    [Humaydi] What about the possibility of contacts with those  opposed to the Oslo accord?    [Darawshah] That is up to the brother Syrian hosts. We have  no reservations about any meeting.    [Humaydi] What is your opinion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement  between Israel and the PLO?    [Darawshah] We advocate ending the occupation, establishing  an independent Palestinian state, and achieving a just and  comprehensive peace -- a peace of the brave, as President  al-Asad called it. I believe that Arab strategy is a peace  strategy, and Yitzhaq Rabin's government is required to make  goodwill gestures by announcing its acceptance of the  land-for-peace principle, agreement to implement resolutions 242  and 338, and willingness to end the occupation of the occupied  Arab territories, including the occupied Syrian Golan, so that  rights will be restored to their legitimate owners. Then there  would be a real possibility of achieving peace in the region.    We are struggling in two directions: the first is to achieve  peace, end the occupation, and provide every possible support  for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories so that  they can obtain their freedom and independence; the second is to  obtain our rights as citizens, because we are suffering from the  policy of racial discrimination at all levels. There is  discrimination against anyone who is not a Jew.    [Humaydi] What is your view of a solution to return the  parties to the negotiating table?    [Darawshah] As I said in the Knesset, the Israeli Government  must make goodwill gestures; restrain the settlers; guarantee  international protection for the Palestinians, who are subjected  to repression, torture, and massacre; and declare its  willingness to evacuate the settlements and disarm the settlers.    [Humaydi] And if that does not happen?    [Darawshah] International efforts are under way to find a  solution to these issues. We are awaiting a resolution from the  Security Council, and I hope the council's resolution will be in  line with the Palestinian demands.    [Humaydi] You were not offered a ministerial portfolio.  Will you be offered one when peace is established?    [Darawshah] We have demanded our rights and rejected  injustice and discrimination. Rabin has the desire to deal with  us. But so far he is still refusing, and we are still insisting  on our position and demanding our rights.    Our rights are numerous, and we have not obtained them. Our  lands and rights have been confiscated, and these are among the  things which we will continue to demand. We also demand the  return of the confiscated land, our national rights, and our  rights as citizens.</p>

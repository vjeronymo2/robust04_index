			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ALANNAH MYLES HITS ROXY WITH HER BEST SHOT  </P> <P> To say that Alannah Myles is the new Pat Benatar, however accurate, is to do  both singers a disservice. Before moving on to motherhood and pop  respectability, Benatar always looked a little out of her element as a Spandex  queen; Myles, though, is a more natural hard-rocker than Benatar ever was,  fitting into her chosen role as a saucy mama with lung power as well as she fit  her skin-tight black bodywear on Monday at the Roxy.  </P> <P> This was Myles' Los Angeles debut, but as a show-woman, the ambitious Canadian  chanteuse came off as a seasoned performer already at the top of her  professional form. Alternately feisty, teasing and grinning, Myles dropped to  her knees and bounded on top of the speakers, her knockout looks and teasing  sneers sending the males into ga-ga fantasyland and the gals into jealousyland.  </P> <P> Face, figure and insatiable drive aside, Myles also has a voice that can be  occasionally angelic but more often is an in-your-face blast that sounds  ruinous to the throat. Why, when she affects that mean-model look and curls her  lip, she even looks a little like Elvis -- subject of her recent, bluesy, No. 1  hit "Black Velvet."  </P> <P> But depth? None of her other pop-metal songs are remotely in the same league,  and if Myles stops somewhat short of overtly selling sex as a weapon, she  doesn't have much else of substance to pitch yet. Perhaps we should be grateful  these days for a new female singer who can sing, but the sheer, shallow  calculation that goes into Myles' act makes the effort finally as unendearing  and impersonal as it is viscerally impressive.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 17 May -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov told  ITAR-TASS today that Uzbekistan will conclude an agreement with  the IMF this summer. He said Tashkent has officially endorsed  this important document. The president, who is currently  visiting Japan, said that the absence of this kind of agreement  was delaying the implementation of Western programs to assist  the Republic in its transition to a market economy.    The president noted that "unlike certain other former Soviet  republics, which meekly agree to all IMF terms in order to gain  access to foreign investment, Uzbekistan is approaching the IMF  agreement with great circumspection, since its main concern is  to develop the Republic's industrial base." Islam Karimov  acknowledged that "the talks with the IMF about the agreement  have been very long and difficult," but the work has now been  completed. The Uzbek president said: "The document has been  initialled by Uzbekistan" and will be officially endorsed by the  IMF management this July, after which it will be signed.    Referring to Tashkent's economic policies, Islam Karimov  noted that ever since embarking on reforms aimed at bringing in  a market economy, Uzbekistan's objective is to "build a socially  orientated economy" based on private enterprise, but to retain a  significant regulatory role for the state. "We have never  sought to force the pace of reform, believing that it is  necessary to build a new house before destroying the old one,"  the president said. He warned other former Soviet republics  that are building a market economy against being too hasty in  what they do, pointing out that "attempts to force the pace of  reform could discredit the market economy in the eyes of the  public."</p>

The Huangjuezhuang power plant will have a total installed  capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts. In the first stage of  construction, two 200MW coal-fired units will be installed; the  project is a joint investment construction effort on the part of  the State and Sichuan Province. Construction officially began in  November 1991. The No. 1 unit was among the units that would  give the nation an increase of 12,000MW in 1993. The No. 1 unit  will help to ease Sichuan's energy shortage and promote the  province's economic growth.    The plant's No. 2 unit could be finished and could begin  generating power by June 1994.</p>

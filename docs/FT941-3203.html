			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Ashdown urges more share bonus plans Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called for a big increase in the use of share incentive schemes to improve industrial competitiveness. He said that wider employee share ownership was part of the answer to the 'fundamental question' of how to compete with Pacific-rim economies without endangering social cohesion. He said that only 55 per cent of British companies used bonus schemes, and only a sixth of companies with share incentive schemes had extended them to non-executive staff. Mr Ashdown told the Involvement and Participation Association, a business group, that tax incentives should be used to increase employee shareholdings. He pledged that a Liberal Democrat government would give employees the right to participate in decision-making if companies failed to set up voluntary consultation. He said: 'My message to industry is this. If you don't want compulsory structures for consulting employees, prove that you are. . . practising genuine employee involvement.' A Liberal Democrat working group led by Baroness Williams, the former Labour cabinet minister, is drawing up detailed plans for employee rights and share schemes. Its draft proposals are believed to suggest that the numbers of employee shareholders could be 'massively' increased if the tax treatment of executive and ordinary share incentive schemes was equalised. The group is considering legal reforms to prevent companies restricting schemes to executives. Stock Exchange rules requiring shareholder approval for broader-based schemes would be abolished. Mr Ashdown's remarks are in line with his party's long-standing commitment to increased employee participation and wider share ownership of industry.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Post Office chief demands sell-off decision THE CHAIRMAN of the Post Office, Mr Michael Heron, yesterday renewed calls for a government decision on the company's privatisation. A decision had been expected by the end of this month but the issue, which has been dogged by controversy, is likely to be delayed by the illness of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who suffered a heart attack this week. It was already delayed by the sacking in last month's government reshuffle of Mr Edward Leigh, who was junior trade and industry minister. Mr Heron said recent signals from the government threw 'very little light' on whether privatisation would go ahead. 'When you're running a business, the one thing that gets you is uncertainty,' he said. As on previous occasions, Mr Heron refused to be drawn on his views on privatisation. 'What we need is the freedom to meet the commercial challenges of the future, which lie in technology and internationally,' he said. 'Whether that means privatisation is for the government to judge.' He was now hoping for a decision by the end of the year. 'If it goes beyond that point, all you're doing is increasing the hill we've got to climb in terms of opportunities and challenges,' he said. Mr Heron said the board would prefer the businesses to be kept together if privatised. He denied that morale in the Post Office was low as a result of the delay. Although morale had suffered slightly, he said, it was still higher than in most commercial organisations. Mr Heron was presenting the Post Office's results for the year 1992-93. Pre-tax profits were up 15 per cent at a record Pounds 283m - the 17th successive year of unsubsidised profits. The Post Office contributed Pounds 80m in cash to the Treasury over the year, compared with a targeted contribution of Pounds 66m. Mr Heron described the sharp rise to Pounds 181m required by the Treasury this year as 'a daunting challenge'. He said the board was examining ways to raise the money, and did not rule out higher letter prices, which have been frozen since September 1991. Profits from Royal Mail were down 5 per cent at Pounds 252m. Those at Post Office Counters, the retail network, were down 4 per cent at Pounds 25m. Losses at Parcelforce, the parcel delivery business, were reduced from Pounds 24m to Pounds 13m. Postal workers in London are to vote on strike action over compensation payments for compulsory transfer of staff between sorting offices. The Union of Communications Workers said nearly 6,000 jobs were due to be cut in London over the next three years because of the introduction of new machinery.</p>

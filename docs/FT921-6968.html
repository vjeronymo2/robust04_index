			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Briefings for Ulster leaders THE GOVERNMENT yesterday began a series of briefings for Northern Ireland's political leaders intended to fill the vacuum in the province's politics until formal 'round-table' negotiations can start. Mr Brian Mawhinney, Northern Ireland minister, opened the discussions in Belfast on economic and social issues. The talks were promised last month when the Northern Ireland Office wound up attempts to start political negotiations until after the British general election. Subsequently Mr John Major, the prime minister, reopened the political initiative, calling on Unionists and nationalists to find ways of overcoming obstacles to formal talks. Mr Major will meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, in London tomorrow.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Treasury moves to sell off debt SECURITIES houses are being invited by the Treasury to bid for Pounds 5bn of government debt that remains with privatised industries. One securities house said yesterday that several City institutions had been asked to look at ways of repackaging parcels of debt owed to the government, mainly by British Telecommunications and the electricity distributors. The transfer of the debts - incurred in the run-up to privatisation - would release to the Treasury revenue that would otherwise have been repaid over almost 20 years. The revenue injection would count as negative government spending and therefore cut the size of the public sector borrowing requirement. The Treasury would not confirm that it had plans to sell debt, but officials said it would be possible to sell the rights to it and to raise a lump sum. 'We would simply need to find somebody who would be prepared to buy the rights to receive the debt,' said a Treasury official. 'Most of the debt is potentially marketable, but some of it isn't' BT still has to pay off just under Pounds 2.2bn, while the electricity distribution companies owe about Pounds 1.2bn. Further smaller stocks of debt from the generating companies, the Scottish electricity companies and National Television Licensing brings the total still owed to the Treasury to just over Pounds 5bn. The debt, which is in the form of debentures and loan stock, was to be repaid over a number of years. For example, British Gas made its last repayment of Pounds 350m in April. The debt should be relatively easy to buy and sell, but its transfer to bond markets might make it harder for the privatised companies to raise capital subsequently in a market where there is only a finite demand for sterling bonds.</p>

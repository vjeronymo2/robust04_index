			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Airlines agree truce in LA airport fees row A potential shutdown of Los Angeles airport was averted yesterday when representatives of the airport authority and the big US airlines reached a temporary deal over higher landing fees. The airlines agreed to pay the airport's new fees under protest until a final judgment by the courts or federal agencies on whether the new fees were reasonable. Los Angeles airport authorities had announced a tripling of their landing fees this summer, and had threatened to shut down the airport at midnight on Friday for airlines that refused to pay up. With the exception of Qantas, all the main US and foreign airlines had balked at the higher fees, and a lawsuit against the increase is waiting before a federal court. Both sides were summoned by Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, for talks in Washington this week aimed at averting disruption of the US's third busiest airport, which serves around 120,000 passengers a day. Under the terms of the deal signed yesterday, the airport agreed not to raise its fees again before July next year and to repay the higher fees if the court judgment goes against it. Even after tripling its fees, Los Angeles will be far from the most expensive airport in the country. The increase to Dollars 1.56 per 1,000lb, or about Dollars 900 for a Boeing 747, still leaves Los Angeles charging far less than the three New York area airports or Chicago's O'Hare. Mr Richard Riordan, Los Angeles's new mayor, promised in his election campaign to raise money from the airport to pay for more police officers. But he has backed away from this, which would be an illegal diversion of funds because Los Angeles received federal grants to help pay for capital improvements at the airport. US airlines pay more than Dollars 3bn a year in landing fees, and, although this makes up only about 4.5 per cent of their costs, some carriers fear that other airports country could be encouraged by Los Angeles's example to raise their fees. A separate case, in which airlines complained that higher fees at Grand Rapids airport in Michigan violated a federal law requiring them to be reasonable, was argued this week before the US Supreme Court. The airlines, which are already in shaky financial condition after years of rising costs and cut-throat competition, are afraid of being milked by cities anxious for new revenue sources.</p>

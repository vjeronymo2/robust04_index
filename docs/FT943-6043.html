			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Test ban treaty faces delays A treaty banning all nuclear tests is unlikely to be completed by next April when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) comes up for renewal, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. Mr Miguel Marin-Bosch of Mexico, who chairs the test ban treaty negotiations in Geneva, said yesterday it would take 'a minor miracle' to finish the pact by then, though it might be possible to have an 'almost agreed' text next spring. A number of developing countries have said their position on extending the NPT will depend on progress in the talks on a comprehensive test ban treaty which began last January under the auspices of the United Nations Disarmament Conference.</p>

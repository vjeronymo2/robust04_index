			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN OLD-FASHIONED JOURNALIST  </P> <P> Charles Kenny McClatchy, known simply as C.K., inherited enough newspapers and  enough money to work at anything he wanted to or at nothing at all. He chose  journalism, and over the years his quiet, stubborn brand of integrity kept  raising standards not only for his own newspapers but for all of journalism.  </P> <P> Slim, patrician and slightly old-fashioned, McClatchy often seemed out of place  in an era of leveraged buyouts and manipulative politics, but he was never out  of touch. After taking over the family chain of Bee newspapers, the first of  which was founded in Sacramento by his great-grandfather in 1857, he set an  uncompromising tone for editorials and news coverage that chopped away at  pretense, sham and lapses in honesty at whatever risk of retaliation in the  courts.  </P> <P> Typically, having expanded the chain of California newspapers by purchasing  papers in Washington and Alaska, McClatchy used the forum of the  Press-Enterprise lectures at UC Riverside last year to attack chain  newspapering.  </P> <P> Mergers and buyouts, he said, too often put people with no newspaper tradition  in charge of newspapers and made companies of all kinds less responsive to  public interest. "The public and the government increasingly accept what used  to be unacceptable," he said.  </P> <P> Fortunately for his own newspapers and the many others that admired and  identified with his high standards, C.K., who died at age 62 while jogging in  Sacramento Sunday, never had any trouble identifying the unacceptable or any  qualms about attacking it.  </P></p>

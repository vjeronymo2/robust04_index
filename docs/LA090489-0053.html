			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi has decided to cut off or trim the flow of funds  to some liberation and terrorist groups, Western and Palestinian sources said.  The sources, in Tripoli over the weekend for ceremonies marking the 20th  anniversary of the coup that brought Kadafi to power, said he has told several  Palestinian groups that they will no longer receive direct funding from his  government and that they should close their offices in Libya. If the reports  are true, the action would reflect what appears to be Kadafi's efforts to  improve his image in the West and reduce Libya's isolation.  </P></p>

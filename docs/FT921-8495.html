			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / High-tech blitz on crime against business: Police cameras on the ground and in a helicopter will monitor industrial sites A HELICOPTER-MOUNTED television camera, hydraulic barriers outside shops to deter ram-raiders and the use of a computerised geographical information system to analyse and predict crime are among measures proposed to reduce the highest crime rate in the country. Encrypted radios, infra-red detection equipment on a police helicopter and the installation of closed-circuit television systems to monitor urban centres and industrial areas are also proposed by the Northumbria police force in a submission to the Home Office. Mr John Stevens, chief constable of the Northumbria force, which covers Tyne and Wear and Northumberland, said the force's area had the country's highest crime rate per 1,000 population and per police officer. The government has chosen Northumbria, Merseyside and West Yorkshire police forces for its one-year Urban Crime Fund experiment, to start in April. Each will receive about Pounds 3.6m for innovative measures involving local communities in the fight against urban crime. Mr Stevens who became chief constable after last September's riots in North Shields and Newcastle upon Tyne, has pledged to make crime against business a priority in his use of the urban fund money, to which the Northumbria police authority is adding Pounds 1.2m. 'Business confidence has been affected by the riots and the amount of crime,' he said last week at a Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce seminar in Newcastle. He expects the private sector to help pay for closed-circuit television (CCTV) in Newcastle city centre and North Shields. He also plans to extend a Business Watch project in which co-ordinated security on a Gateshead industrial estate, paid for by local companies, has reduced burglaries. Northumbria police believe the new, virtually crime-free Newcastle Business Park, where the management charge covers CCTV, is a model of how to tackle crime. Mr Stevens also plans a registration scheme for pub and club doormen. His Urban Crime Fund proposals for Northumbria ally high technology to a heightened police presence on problem housing estates where, he says, a hard core of criminals are respected and emulated. Officers will target known offenders, protect witnesses and stamp on harassment of local people and of police officers and their families. He proposes a 'drop-in' centre on one Sunderland estate, where police could 'interact' with residents. He has also recommended rewards for information. The 3,500-strong Northumbria force has been pressing for extra manpower since budget problems forced a cut of 116 officers this year. In November last year the Home Office granted 27 extra posts, but the authority is bidding for 80 more officers in 1992-93. Mr Stevens has switched many officers to patrol duties, and under his crime-fund plans recruitment of civilians will free a further 65 officers for front-line work. Crime has been estimated to cost businesses nationally between Pounds 5bn and Pounds 10bn a year, according to the Confederation of British Industry and Crime Concern, a crime-prevention charity set up by the Home Office. There is concern in Tyne and Wear that crime may deter investment and job-creation. Mr Bob Tilmouth, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce, said: 'Anything which disrupts performance or endangers business survival and confidence has to be tackled.'</p>

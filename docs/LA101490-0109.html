			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANTELOPE VALLEY STAYS UNBEATEN WITH 43-7 WIN OVER EAST L. A.  </P> <P> Ask any player on the Antelope Valley College football team about it and he  will give the same answer: Coach Brent Carder is still running a conservative,  take-no-big-chances, make-no-mistakes offense.  </P> <P> The execution has improved recently, though, and so have the numbers.  </P> <P> "We're still running the same basic plays," Antelope Valley tailback Steve  Miller said. "It's just that now, our offense is coming together. The offensive  line really did a great job tonight."  </P> <P> Miller's 217 yards rushing in 16 carries and two touchdowns underscored that  performance as the Marauders routed East Los Angeles, 43-7, in a Foothill  Conference game at home Saturday night.  </P> <P> The victory improved Antelope Valley's overall record to 5-0-1 (3-0-1 in  conference play). It is the Marauders' best start since the 1954 season when  they finished 10-0-1.  </P> <P> "We knew that we were capable of playing like this," Miller said. "It just took  us a while to get going."  </P> <P> After scoring 80 points in its first four games, Antelope Valley has scored 77  points in its past two.  </P> <P> The Marauders set one school record and tied another against the Huskies.  </P> <P> Marty Washington and tight end Thomas Reimer combined on a 98-yard touchdown  play to set one record, and Miller's 95-yard run in the third quarter tied  another.  </P> <P> One constant throughout the season has been the Antelope Valley defense.  </P> <P> Against East L. A., the Marauders forced five turnovers (two fumbles and three  interceptions) and held quarterback Santiago Alvarez to seven completions in 21  attempts for 52 yards.  </P> <P> Alvarez had completed 60% of his passes for 896 yards and six touchdowns.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley led, 30-7, at halftime, with the Marauders converting three  Husky turnovers into 17 points.  </P> <P> The Huskies' Steven Dumas fumbled the opening kickoff and Jason Camp kicked a  38-yard field goal to give Antelope Valley a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> On the Huskies' next series, Mike Gilliam fumbled and Antelope Valley strong  safety Rick Starling recovered at the East L. A. 35-yard line.  </P> <P> Three plays later, Miller took a pitch and went 30 yards around right end for a  touchdown that gave Antelope Valley a 10-0 lead with 10 minutes 30 seconds left  in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley's usually conservative offense produced a big play after an  East L. A. punt had pinned the Marauders on their two-yard line.  </P> <P> Washington hit Reimer with a short pass over the middle on first down and  Reimer broke Armando Torres' tackle and rumbled down the left sideline for the  school-record touchdown.  </P> <P> The score remained 17-0 until midway through the second quarter. John Johnson  intercepted his fourth pass of the season and returned it to Antelope Valley's  23-yard line. Three plays later, Tony Simmons turned a draw play into a 51-yard  touchdown.  </P></p>

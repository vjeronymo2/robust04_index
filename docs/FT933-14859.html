			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Swissair wins strong terms on aircraft sale SWISSAIR has sold six of its 23 MD-81 aircraft on very favourable terms, Mr Otto Loepfe, the Swiss national airline's chief executive, said yesterday. No figures were given. Swissair is frequently in the used aircraft market and aims to keep a modern fleet. In the past two years, proceeds from sales have prevented the airline from making losses. Mr Loepfe, speaking to the airline's annual managers' meeting in Zurich, said the Alcazar project, under which Swissair would join forces with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines, was the best way forward for the company. It said a memorandum of agreement was expected to be signed by the airlines in September. If the deal goes ahead, the four carriers would shed 10 per cent of their workforces, Mr Loepfe said. This would require Swissair to make some of its 25,800 staff redundant, but the workforce was falling by 5.3 per cent annually through natural attrition.</p>

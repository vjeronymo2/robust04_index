			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Recital of the fin-de-siecle One would have thought the arrival of a new millennium would be something to sing about. As the close of the 19th century a wealth of composers, such as Strauss and Wolf, Schoenberg and Berg, were producing songs for the new century - a level of activity that we show no sign of equalling as the year 2000 approaches. Half the art of giving a successful song recital comes in planning the programme. For her Wigmore Hall recital on Thursday Joan Rodgers turned exclusively to that rich period, 1885-1905. This also had the advantage of drawing her away from the Mozartian era for which she is known in opera. How would a favourite Susanna, Zerlina and Pamina fare as she ventured into decadent turn-of-the-century Vienna? The first thing to say is that she has not forgotten where she has come from. When she sings Mozart, Joan Rodgers has impressed audiences with a classical poise and purity of voice, though the sound is warmer than it was and has lost some of its ease above the stave. What remains special is the beauty of tone lower down, allied to a care over phrasing, rhythms, consonants that marks a singer of distinction. All these are important attributes, just as much in the music of Wolf and Berg. It is good to hear a recitalist really sing in Wolf, giving the vocal lines the musical eloquence they deserve. Rodgers was touching in any song where the singing came first ('An den Schlaf' radiant, 'Das verlassene Magdlein' haunting) but made little of songs in which the words should lead the way. In Berg's Seven Early Songs, a favourite with Wagnerians, her Mozartian elegance and precision made a welcome change, but these were again seven of the same. The sense of a true Lieder singer at work only fully came through with the Strauss songs. Perhaps Roger Vignoles, ever the supportive accompanist, encouraged a stronger contrast of mood, as the words suddenly started to communicate specific emotions. 'Allerseelen' managed to be delicate, but still suggest deep feeling. The ingenuousness of a Sophie, the mature sentiment of a Marschallin were held nicely in balance. Everywhere there was tact, a quality all too often foreign to singers who take up Schoenberg's Cabaret Songs. If anything, these were under-sold, where a hardened recitalist would be hawking their humour and catchy tunes to rake in the applause for the end of the evening. In the song about the cat, Rodgers was a kitten next to the audience-devouring tigress of Jessye Norman, who also gave us Schoenberg in London recently. To end on a note of unqualified delight: the first encore, Tchaikovsky's 'None but the lonely heart', was sheer beauty, understatement at its most moving, every shading of colour and emphasis perfectly judged. It is time that one of the British opera companies invite her to visit as Tchaikovsky's Tatyana.</p>

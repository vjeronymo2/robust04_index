Talks have been held  between all parties involved on all fronts but the deadlock  remains. This is because President Juvenal Habyarimana, author  of the artificial deadlock, has proved to be inflexible and  wants to desperately maintain his dictatorial power. [passage  omitted]    Everyone is growing tired of the irresponsible behavior of  President Juvenal Habyarimana who does not want to respect the  Arusha agreements. [passage omitted]    The ongoing struggle for democracy must be continued be it  --  against our will -- through the use of weapons. In this regard,  let us listen to a commentary by [words indistinct]:    [Unidentified reporter] [passage omitted] Should President  Habyarimana toughen his position by constantly violating the  Arusha agreements which he signed himself with his own hand,  there is no alternative other than that of resuming the armed  struggle. It is the only way, as experience has shown, for the  (?dictatorship) to listen to the voice of reason, albeit  momentarily.    Things must be clarified here. President Habyarimana agreed  with change mainly because the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  combatants' armed strength compelled him to do so. Even at the  present hour, if President Habyarimana continues to drag his  feet on the agreements which he solemnly signed before the  Rwandan people and the international community, the freedom  fighters will again take up arms as this seems to be the only  language capable of persuading Republican National Movement for  Democracy and Development [MRND] supporters to see reason.  [passage omitted]    The worst is to be feared should the current situation of  insecurity organized by MRND supporters last. The worst is to  be dreaded given the quantity of weapons distributed among the  people and given the stubbornness of President Habyarimana who  has deliberately and openly torpedoed the peace process.  [passage omitted]    Facing this feeling of inevitability of war which the  president of the Republic is trying to spread throughout the  country, everybody must acknowledge that peace remains the most  valuable thing since it is the only thing which can truly be  profitable to Rwandans. It is therefore important that  everybody works toward the restoration of that peace and the  creation f the broadbased transitional institutions.</p>

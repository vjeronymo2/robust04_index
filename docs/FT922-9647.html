			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: MIM declines 12 per cent to Adollars 46m MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, yesterday blamed weak metal prices for a 12 per cent fall in net profits to ADollars 46m (dollars 34.8m) for the nine months to April 5, on sales down 12.6 per cent to ADollars 1.2bn. The result represents a significant improvement over the first six months, when MIM reported a 76 per cent cut in new profits to ADollars 16m, on sales down 10 per cent to ADollars 840m. After including a second-quarter abnormal profit of ADollars 45.7m from the sale of its interests in Teck Corporation, net profits rose to ADollars 91.8m, from ADollars 52.8m the previous comparable period. However, net profits fell to ADollars 70m after including foreign exchange losses and minority equity interests. The equivalent profit in the first nine months of last year was ADollars 30m. MIM said profits had continued to be affected in the third quarter by weak metals prices, but reported excellent results from the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, which is 30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, an MIM subsidiary. The group said gold operations at Tick Hill also performed well, and coal operations at Oaky Creek returned to profitability during the quarter. Oaky Creek suffered a loss of ADollars 24m in the first six months, mainly because of operational difficulties. MIM said average copper prices during the nine months were 12 per cent lower than in the comparable period of last year. The equivalent falls in prices for other metals were 27 per cent for lead, 12 per cent for zinc and 10 per cent for gold. The directors said the weakness in prices was likely to continue in the absence of signs of economic recovery in the metal consuming countries. It said recent data on housing starts and retail sales in the US were encouraging, but this was offset by worsening economies in Germany and Japan.</p>

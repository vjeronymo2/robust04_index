			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOCKADE NOT EASING YET, LITHUANIA SAYS  </P> <P> Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis said Thursday that he sees no sign  yet of Moscow easing its economic sanctions against his breakaway republic  despite reports that some natural gas deliveries would resume.  </P> <P> "I checked yesterday and no one knew anything," Landsbergis said by telephone  from the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.  </P> <P> "This may be a red herring but we will see what the future brings. So far we  have nothing."  </P> <P> He spoke as the Baltic region marked a day of mourning for thousands of Balts  interned by Soviet secret police after Moscow took control of Lithuania, Latvia  and Estonia in 1940. The mass deportations were part of Josef Stalin's attempt  to consolidate Soviet control over the republics annexed a year earlier under a  secret agreement with Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said after talks  with Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov that Moscow had agreed to ease  the blockade it imposed after Lithuania's March 11 independence declaration.  </P> <P> The announcement heralded a possible breakthrough after three months of  deadlock between Moscow and Lithuania over the Baltic republic's drive for  sovereignty.  </P> <P> But many barriers to direct negotiations remained.  </P> <P> The cutting of oil supplies and sharp reductions in natural gas deliveries have  crippled Lithuanian industry.  </P> <P> Prunskiene on Wednesday said that Moscow had agreed to resume some gas  deliveries.  </P> <P> Asked if Lithuania would be willing to back down and accept President Mikhail  S. Gorbachev's key demand that it should freeze its independence declaration,  Landsbergis said: "We will debate everything that came out of yesterday's  meeting."  </P> <P> In the past, Lithuania has resolutely refused to discuss the issue of  sovereignty.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chong In-hwa] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that North Korean President Kim  Il-song is slated to visit China around April.    A high-level government source on 13 February revealed:  "China and North Korea are supposedly discussing President Kim  Il-song's visit to China," and added that "the timing is likely  to be April, right after President Kim Yong-sam's visit to  China."    It was learned that China's invitation to President Kim  Il-song was made in the course of China informing the North  Korean side of President Kim Yong-sam's itinerary. President  Kim Il-song will reportedly hold a summit with Chinese President  Jiang Zemin to discuss its nuclear issue and ways to enhance  bilateral cooperation to help North Korea spur Chinese-style  opening, said the government source.    The source said: "China is worried about being caught in a  diplomatic dilemma in case the United Nations decides to impose  sanctions against North Korea," adding, "Accordingly, China is  expected to invite President Kim Il-song and will stress its  stance of supporting denuclearization on the Korean peninsula  and will induce North Korea to adopt the policy of Chinese-style  opening to stabilize the North Korean system."</p>

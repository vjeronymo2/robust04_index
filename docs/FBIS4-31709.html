			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Drazen Vukov-Colic: "In the Shadow of the </F> Unpredictable Neighbor"]    [Text] What the proverbially calm, polite, and balanced  Slovene president stated after the meeting with Franjo Tudjman  could hardly be described as routine protocol ingratiation.  "These were open, polemical, at times hard talks, but there can  be no solution without dialogue," said Milan Kucan polemically,  openly, and hard, but also with a sigh of relief because the two  presidents did meet after 20 months; the malicious will  establish that in this unsettled period Zagreb meanwhile had  more meetings with Bucharest than with Slovenia, which is at its  doorstep and its neck. In these belated discussions, Tudjman, as  usual -- regardless of the fact that it has only been several  years -- viewed the whole thing with the inevitable historical  distance, while the Slovene president mostly spoke of the dark  Balkan present and the uncertain European future. To what  extent these things are out of joint in a completely unnatural  way is best witnessed by Tudjman's choice of words, when,  speaking of contentious interchanges, spoke out as if the  nonaligned summit in Cairo were still on: "Neither Slovenia nor  Croatia have any expansionist or imperialist demands in relation  to each other."    In the international diplomatic vocabulary such terms ended  up on the ideological trash-heap of the defeated state-ology  long ago, but evidently the Croatian president feels great only  when he uses great words that sound dark and dire. The  uninformed would think that it was Rabin and `Arafat who met,  rather than the leaders of two states whom the world keeps  reproaching for arguing like two sulky children competing in  inventing evidence of greatness. During the time of the  disintegration of Yugoslavia, Slovenia and Croatia seemed to  many like Siamese twins that were about to start a happy family  as soon as they ran away from the hateful Belgrade family, and  then they started to look at each other across the Sutla River  as if across the banks of the Jordan. In their renewed greed,  some Italian politicians have proclaimed Slovenia a small  provincial region, but Croatia also suffers such slander all the  time, even when Istria is not at issue. The blindness of  self-sufficient triumphalism can then perhaps be described no  better than by Kucan's ineffective lamenting over the newly  liberated and newly established states' childish habit of  extolling themselves too much while speaking of everyone else in  an unreasonable way.    The Slovene president did not say so publicly, but evidently  the Slovenians justifiably feel nauseous when Tudjman talks  about Croatia as the "super-state" with "super-democracy" and  "super-economy" that all the countries of former communism can  look up to, never -- or only seldom -- looking over his shoulder  and into the neighbor's yard, in which fruit trees (the  agreement with the European Union, the Partnership for Peace,  the Council of Europe, the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction  Aid to Poland and Hungary] program), which he keeps specifically  promising to Croatia, have already grown.    After the unwrapping of the "Croatian-Slovene package,"  which  started after the first unfruitful visits of the "European  threesomes," and became inevitable as soon as Slovenia got rid  of foreign supervision and European observers, Ljubljana thought  too soon that it had run away from the Balkans, while Croatia  hoped too soon that it would replace Serbia as a new regional  superpower, primarily in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- regardless of the  outlaws in its own backyard -- and then as the fortress wall of  something long gone by, such as the stories about "the bulwark  of civilization" and "the dividing-line of the worlds." This  language is still spoken, although there are few who believe in  this kind of delirious dream, while in the meantime Slovenia has  also realized that its TV's and water heaters do not fascinate  European consumers just because it has decided to proclaim  itself Europe and has preached everywhere that it has no ties  with or obligations to "those Balkans."    Ljubljana and Zagreb kept arguing over a dry river bed until  they realized -- if they realized -- that both live in the  shadow of an unpredictable neighbor who, deep down, hopes that  hundreds of kilometers on both sides of the disputed former  river will again become his property. In that framework, some of  Berlusconi's ministers inadvertently did a great favor both to  Croatia and Slovenia, who were constantly looking too high and  too far, over and above their heads, and which in many ways  still come within the same mirror, as there can be no  imperialism without an empire, and both Croatia and Slovenia  occasionally suffer from the delusion that by contemplating  their own navels they are contemplating the navel of the world.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Szonda Ipsos Media and Opinion Poll Research  Institute made the following forecast regarding the second round  of parliamentary elections to be held on 29 May:    The most probable national participation in the elections  will be around 50 percent (among the people eligible to vote).    Both the participation proportion and the number of votes  per  candidates could differ considerably from the expected figures  if an event takes place in the remaining time that considerably  affects the evaluation of the political parties that enjoy  greater support, namely the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and  the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. [MSZP Chairman] Gyula  Horn's car accident before the first round of elections was such  an event. On the basis of this, it is possible that the current  chances of the MSZP might change considerably if the public's  ideas connected with the aforementioned accident become  stronger. Such a change would also affect the chances of  parties that can still count on obtaining individual mandates.    At the time of this forecast, namely 10 days before the  elections, it is not yet fully known who will really run in the  second round from among the candidates who made it to the second  round. Withdrawals, the parties' call to the voters of  candidates that have withdrawn from the race, and the campaign  finish will also have an effect on the real election results and  the differences in forecasts.    In its first prognosis regarding the second round of the  elections, the Szonda Ipsos took into consideration the results  of the first round as well as the trends and connections  emerging from the opinion polls of recent months. We mainly  considered the following factors among the research data: the  voters' readiness to participate in the elections and the  firmness and nature of their party affiliation; secondary  preferences; the viewpoints and motivations of choosing among  various individual candidates; the extent to which the  candidates are known and their evaluation; and the personal  factors that affect their chances. We modelled the voters'  expected attitude in the second round of elections by comparing  the composition of remaining candidates in various districts,  the results they achieved in the first round, and the main  parameters that determined the voters' decisions.    According to the results based on the aforementioned  considerations and the stipulations of the electoral law, we  calculated the mandates of the national list according to the  parties. The parliamentary mandates obtained in the first round  and the most probable individual and compensatory mandates show  the expected composition of the new parliament according to our  current knowledge.    In addition to its two mandates already obtained, the winner  of the first round, the MSZP, is leading in 158 electoral  districts and it will also emerge as the strongest parliamentary  party after the second round. However, it will be unable to  preserve its advantage in some of the electoral districts and  turn this advantage into mandates. The extent of this drop is  decisive regarding the possibility of obtaining the majority of  parliamentary mandates or having to share two-thirds of the  mandates with the SZDSZ. Regarding the possibility of an  absolute majority, 10 days before the elections we cannot  provide a firm answer, because the most probable figure of the  MSZP mandates falls precisely on the critical border line. This  means that, at the moment, we see equal chances of the MSZP  falling behind the 50 percent by a few percent, and crossing  this border by a few percent. Regarding the two-thirds border  equally important for coalition and legislation considerations,  the chances seem to be clear: There is a high probability of  the MSZP and SZDSZ filling up at least two-thirds of the  parliamentary places.    At the same time, we must also consider the fact that a  large  number of citizens have double preferences, their party  commitment is generally loose, and their current approach to the  stronger parties has proved more unstable than previously. Just  like before the first round, this time too, various media  effects lead to greater uncertainty and unpredictability than  usual in the voters' decisions. Along with all this, it is  justified that, together with a prognosis of the election  results, we should provide the realistic values of difference  from the most probable values.    The electoral law bans the publication of opinion poll  results eight days before the elections; therefore, we will make  our next forecast public on 29 May, immediately after the  closure of the polls.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Expected Minimum and Maximum Mandates                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Individual mandates      |All mandates             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fidesz [Federation of Yo-|0-1                      |20-21                    |  |ung Democrats]           |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |FKGP [Independent Smallh-|0-2                      |25-26                    |  |olders Party]            |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KDNP [Christian Democrat-|2-6                      |20-24                    |  |ic People's Party]       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |MDF [Hungarian Democrati-|12-23                    |45-54                    |  |c Forum]                 |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |MSZP                     |108-148                  |175-208                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SZDSZ                    |14-38                    |67-86                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agrarian Alliance        |0-1                      |0-1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Entrepreneurs Party      |0-1                      |0-1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Independent candidates   |0-2                      |0-2                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

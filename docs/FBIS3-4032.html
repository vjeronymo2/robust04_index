			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Gavin Patterson, Deputy Business Editor, and Ming Man] </F>   [Text] Jardine Matheson yesterday carried out its threat  to delist its shares from Hong Kong, drawing immediate criticism  from China and heralding the beginning of the end of British  rule in the territory. Its shares will cease trading on 31  December when all transactions will move to London, the home of  the company's primary listing.    Reaction was quick and ranged from anger to regret.    A Chinese official in Hong Kong immediately attacked the  British trading giant for being irresponsible, even though  Beijing has long targeted the hong [large trading company] over  its origins as an opium dealer on the mainland.    Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of the XINHUA News Agency,  said: "The Chinese side doesn't want to see any company ignore  Hong Kong's economic development and Hong Kong people's interest  by doing something extremely irresponsible." But Jardine  director Sir Charles Powell denied the group was moving out of  the territory or that it lacked confidence in the future. "In  no way does this decision mark a withdrawal from Hong Kong," he  said. "We have full confidence in the future and I would expect  our business to increase."    Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod also dismissed claims  that the delist ing would affect confidence inthe local business  community. "I think it's a great pity to see the delisting of  Jardine. We have had an extended dialogue on the subject. We  must not exaggerate the effect," Sir Hamish told reporters  yesterday afternoon. "It is merely a delisting but,  nevertheless, I think it is a pity and it takes a modest amount  of capitalisation out of the Hong Kong stock market.    "Of course it has been more than compensated by the increase  in capitalisation over the past year or so, but it is a pity and  I regret it."    Sir Hamish said Jardine had made it clear the company would  continue to operate and be a major employer and trader in the  territory.    However, Liberal Party legislator Allen Lee attacked the  decision saying it was irresponsible as the company had made so  much money out of the territory. "I think it's very  unfortunate. Jardine has a long history and connection with  Hong Kong," Mr Lee said. United Democrats legislator Dr Huang  Chen-ya also took the China line, saying: "It's not very  responsible."    He said the Securities &amp; Futures Commission (SFC) should  protect the interests of small shareholders. Dr Huang feared  that small investors might panic and sell their shares off  cheaply. "They might be afraid that they may not be able to  trade in these shares properly in the future," he said.    Sir Charles said the group had taken great pains in  explaining its decision to the Chinese and added that the move  was purely due to regulatory reasons. "To delist is not a  drama, far from it. It will have no effect on our business, it  concerns only the details of how we are regulated," he said.    The company has fought a long but unsuccessful battle with  the SFC to avoid being regulated by Hong Kong's code on  takeovers and mergers after the territory returns to China in  1997.    The SFC said it regretted the decision to delist but added  it  would not be justified in granting special treatment to Jardine,  or any company, by exempting them from the local code.</p>

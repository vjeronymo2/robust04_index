			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Paris urges EC to curb imports of cheap fish THE FRENCH government yesterday called on the European Community to curb the surge of cheap fish imports which has caused a rising tide of complaints and protests in Brittany, the country's main fishing region. As several small Breton ports were closed yesterday afternoon in sympathy with their fishermen, Mr Charles Josselin, the French secretary of state for maritime affairs, pressed the case for EC import restrictions with Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. France wants the Commission to invoke a Gatt safeguard clause and block fish imports temporarily, or to set a minimum price for such imports. Cheap fish imports have depressed French prices by up to 30 per cent. After meeting industry representatives, the EC looked set yesterday to fix minimum import prices on white fish coming into the EC. Fisheries officials said such emergency measures would be in line with the EC fisheries regime and compatible with international trade rules. The Commission was also in contact with envoys from Russia, Poland, Iceland and Norway - the main sources of the cheap fish - to underline the 'sensitivity' of the issue. A final decision on import prices is expected tomorrow. Earlier yesterday, Mr Josselin met fishermen's representatives in Rennes to explain his plan to give them FFr272m (Pounds 33.8m) in subsidised loans and emergency aid. The national aid scheme was 'well received', claimed Mr Josselin's spokesman. But a fishing industry representative in Concarneau criticised Mr Josselin for not going far enough in giving fishermen six months to pay social security charges. If there was no pick-up in the market, industry officials said they would not be 'able to pay the charges in six months' time'. Concarneau joined the ports of Douarnenez and Le Guilvinec in a concerted shutdown yesterday. Its shops and public facilities closed in sympathy with the fishermen who number 2,500 of its 19,000 population. Half France's total fishing fleet, comprising 18,000 men on some 4,000 boats, are based in Brittany. The targets of Breton displeasure also lie inside the Community. Over the weekend, Breton fishermen in Roscoff ransacked a warehouse of imported fish and frightened British drivers of refrigerated trucks on a ferry into landing their fish elsewhere in France. The recent depreciation of sterling and the peseta against the franc has exposed French fishermen to sharp competition from the UK and Spain. In contrast to farm products, there is no EC scheme to insulate the Community fish market from fluctuations in national currencies. French rail chaos, Page 3</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Mar (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser and head of the  Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, returned to Cairo  this evening after a three-day visit to Tunis, during which he  participated in the meetings of the Palestinian leadership and  the PLO Executive Committee.    Dr. Sha'th stated upon arrival that he is carrying a letter  from Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to President Husni  Mubarak dealing with the current situation and contacts during  the next stage. These fall within the framework of Palestinian  contacts and action during the period when the negotiations are  suspended.    Sha'th clarified that Palestinian activity will consist of  his going to London; Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO  Information Department, to Paris; and Faruq Qaddumi, head of the  PLO Political Department, to Damascus.    He added that another Palestinian envoy will travel to  Washington to hold talks with U.S. officials.    The Palestinian official said that after the horrible  massacre, which is rife with collusion and menace, we need to  take a stand to guarantee security for the Palestinian people  under occupation. There cannot be peace without security and the  situation cannot continue as it is with the presence of the  armed settlers under the protection of the Israeli army shooting  everywhere and killing innocent people.    Sha'th noted in his statement that the Palestinian stand  will  provide an opportunity for taking swift action through the  Security Council and through negotiations with the Americans.    He praised the important roles Nabil al-'Arabi, Egypt's  permanent representative to the United Nations, and Ahmad Mahir,  Egypt's ambassador in Washington, are playing to bolster the  Palestinian stand. He pointed out that 'Arafat is holding  constant meetings with a number of Arab and foreign officials.  He will meet this evening with a Russian envoy, and then a  Greek envoy because Greece is the current chairman of the  European Community.    Sha'th noted that 'Arafat has contacted President Mubarak  more than once. He also contacted Indonesian President Suharto,  Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Saudi Arabian King Fahd, and  Moroccan Monarch King Hassan II, and discussed with them the  situation and action to guarantee the security of the  Palestinian people so that the peace process can continue on a  sound and correct basis.    Sha'th said that suspending the negotiations represents a  hiatus because, at this time, we cannot continue these talks.  We need to prepare a sounder basis for continuing them.    On the guarantees the Palestinians are demanding, Sha'th  said  that two of the most important guarantees are to provide  international protection on the one hand, and disarm the  criminal settlers on the other, because disarming the settlers  achieves some security for the Palestinians. The presence of  international protection adds life to this security. After  these two conditions are met, there are many things that need to  be reviewed, such as the settlement process. We need to put  pressure on the international conscience so that it will see  that settlement is one of the obstacles before peace.    Sha'th said that there is another important issue that the  Palestinian envoy to Washington will discuss during his meetings  with officials there. This is that the criminal who committed  the Hebron massacre, and most extremists and criminals in  Israel, are of U.S. origin. There is a clear relationship  between them and some legitimate U.S. organizations that gather  aid and contributions from the United States to fund and support  these extremists in Israel.    Sha'th pointed out that when Likud Party leader Netanyahu  was  in the United States, he was with these criminals from the Kach  gang, as was Kahane, who collected contributions from them.    Therefore, the United States has to bear its responsibility  in this regard where financing terrorism publicly is a major  responsibility.    As regards the steps Israel has taken, such as releasing  some  Palestinian detainees and disarming some settlers, Sha'th said:  This was nothing new. Shahaq told me before the massacre was  committed that some detainees would be released during the  current week. However, they tried to exploit this point once  again.    I reiterate that the new aspect in the Israeli reaction has  been their admission that religious and racist extremism and  terrorism are characteristics that apply to the Israeli settlers  as well, after they had been using them to describe the  Palestinians. Despite this confession, the deterrents and  punishments are devoid of any content and represent only  something shamefully negligible.</p>

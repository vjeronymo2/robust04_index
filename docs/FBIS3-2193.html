At the closing session of a national working conference on  the civil aviation service, Zou said that since the new  leadership of China's civil aviation services analyzed the major  problems and took some measures to deal with them at the end of  last year, progress had been made in the work of the services.    But, he noted, the problems -- including some slackness in  management and low service quality -- have not been totally  solved and arduous tasks remain for the services.    He said that civil aviation services play a special role in  China's opening to the outside world and it is an industry with  modern scientific and technological knowledge.    He called for practising strict management and discipline,  and improving various responsibility systems.    The primary task for the civil aviation services is safe  flights, he said.    He said that he is against blindly setting up airlines  without taking account of conditions.    He urged the China Administration of Civil Aviation to  regulate the air navigation market and set up good order in  navigation.    The vice-premier also stressed the need for readjustments in  those local airlines which had had more accidents.    He said that punctual flights and improvement of service  quality should be an obligation for all airlines.    He urged the airlines to study the psychology of passengers,  understand their difficulties and make efforts to meet their  needs.</p>

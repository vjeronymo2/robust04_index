			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> PERUVIAN LAWMAKER SLAIN  </P> <P> Assassins shot to death a legislator from Peru's ruling party, the second such  slaying in nine days. Pablo Li Ormeno, who represented the Lima area in the  Chamber of Deputies, was slain by two men in a slum on Lima's outskirts, the  government news agency Andina said. President Alan Garcia cut short a trip to  Brazil, where he was attending a summit on the Amazon, to attend Li Ormeno's  wake. No one claimed responsibility for the killing, although authorities  blamed Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas. On April 27,  congressional deputy Eriberto Arroyo was killed in an attack police blamed on  the Shining Path, although the rebel group denied it was responsible.  </P></p>

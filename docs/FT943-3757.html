			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Strike hits vehicle output in Brazil The main unions in Brazil's vehicle industry went on strike yesterday for an immediate pay rise, in the first serious threat to a wage freeze introduced under the government's anti-inflation plan, writes Angus Foster in Rio de Janeiro. Production at all large factories, based in Sao Paulo state, was much affected. Union officials said nearly half their 150,000 members had stopped work yesterday. Autolatina, Brazil's biggest carmaker and a joint venture of Volkswagen and Ford, said production had 'almost totally stopped'. Anfavea, the car-makers' association, said that, if the strike lasted more than a few days, it would seriously disrupt sales because demand is high and stocks are 'non-existent'. Unions are calling for salaries to be increased monthly so as to make up for losses in purchasing power through inflation. Such monthly increases were common before the introduction, on July 1, of Brazil's new currency, the Real, under the anti-inflation plan. The government has now ruled that wage increases can only be granted once a year. Union leaders argue that official inflation indices show an 11.9 per cent increase since the new currency was launched. They also argue that a 1992 agreement by labour, car-makers and government guaranteed monthly increases. See Sao Paulo survey</p>

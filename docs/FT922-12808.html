			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Non-Cabinet appointments Richard Needham THE NEW trade and industry minister, is a chirpy and interventionist Tory likely to fit comfortably in a department headed by Mr Michael Heseltine. In his previous job as Northern Ireland's economy minister, Mr Needham believed in taking a pro-active role in encouraging investment. Aged 50, he holds the record for continuous service at the Northern Ireland Office  - a testimony as much to the unease with which he fitted into Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government as to his dedication to Ulster. At times he survived only by luck. His biggest claim to fame came after terrorists intercepted a telephone conversation about Mrs Margaret Thatcher in which he wished 'the silly cow would resign'. A few months later she did. Mr Needham is witty, sometimes a show off and frequently a tease, annoying his staff by running behind schedule. He can be over-sensitive and unable to summon sufficient political brutality to push ideas through into practice. He succeeded in uniting nationalist and Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland against his plans for privatising the province's electricity industry. Anthony Nelson MR NELSON, who has been appointed economic secretary to the Treasury, used his detailed knowledge of the working of the City to press for the more effective regulation of the financial services sector during the passage of the legislation which established the Securities and Investments Board. Mr Nelson, MP for Chichester since October 1974, led the final stage of the campaign for televising the Commons. A frequent participant in finance bill debates and a staunch advocate of Britain's membership of the European Community, Mr Nelson will bring panache and style to the Treasury team. He was a merchant banker with NM Rothschild before entering the Commons and was one of Mrs Virginia Bottomley's 'political minders' when she won the South West Surrey by-election in 1984. Mr Nelson was one of the backbenchers who successfully pressed Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to take action in his pre-election budget to freeze the transitional element in the uniform business rate by ensuring that the increase in 1992-93 did not exceed the rate of inflation. Stephen Dorrell THE incoming financial secretary to the Treasury, who steps up from junior health minister, was secretary of the Conservative backbench Treasury committee from 1980 to 1982. He became identified with the 'wet' wing of the Conservative party at the age of 22 when acting as personal assistant to Mr Peter Walker in the general election held in February 1974. After capturing Loughborough to become the youngest member of the Commons in 1979, Mr Dorrell served as secretary to the Conservative backbench trade and industry committee before becoming a parliamentary private secretary and serving in the whips office. Mr Dorrell demonstrated combative qualities when appointed junior health minister in 1990. He championed the NHS reforms, and his robust denials of Labour's claims that the NHS was being privatised impressed senior colleagues. Early associations with 'one nation' Toryism handicapped Mr Dorrell during the Thatcher years when he was described as 'excessively moderate' by Mr Julian Critchley, the sage of the Tory backbenches. In Major's era his political roots should prove a developing asset. Sir John Cope SIR JOHN has earned his reward for his time spent overseeing Tory party finances with his appointment as Treasury minister. The former deputy chairman of the Conservative party is a popular, genial MP, specialising in small behind-the-scenes triumphs. Although Central Office does not publish its detailed accounts, Sir John appears to have gone some way towards reversing the fall-off in donations to the Conservative party. Aged 54, Sir John is an unassuming figure likely to suit an important, but relatively low-profile, job. He does not have political panache, an excessive appetite for publicity, or the clout of a heavyweight. But he has a warmth and intelligence that makes him able to work effectively as part of a team. He also has business acumen from a background as a chartered accountant and past company directorships. In his political life he has paid particular interest to the needs of small businesses. His past incarnations include a respected tenure as deputy chief whip and a less impressive period as Northern Ireland security minister. He has also been an employment minister. Tim Eggar IT IS an indication of how obscure Mr Tim Eggar's progress through the ministerial ranks to his new appointment at the Department of Trade and Industry that he is perhaps best known for an altercation, more than two years ago, after he caught a six-year-old girl taking flowers from his garden. That incident led to the girl's father being convicted of assaulting Mr Eggar, but the judge also criticised the then employment minister's behaviour. While this incident may have reinforced his pugnacious reputation, he is also tough and determined. Having been selected as prospective parliamentary candidate for Enfield North at the age of 23 in October 1975, he spent three nights a week and most weekends there for the next three years, familiarising himself with constituents' concerns. In July, he will complete three years as a minister, first at employment, then at education under Mr Kenneth Clarke, now at Mr Michael Heseltine's DTI. An advocate of privatisation throughout the 1980s, he has been credited with engineering the change in Tory thinking in favour of vocational education. Jonathan Aitken Although a deeply ingrained Euro-sceptic, Mr Jonathan Aitken,the new minister of state for defence, made a timely decision not to vote against thegovernment in the most recent division in the Commons on the European Community Budget. He also lavished praise on Mr John Major,the prime minister, for his defence of British interests when negotiating the Maastricht treaty. Fittingly, after 18 years on the Tory backbenches, Mr Aitken, a Beaverbrook scion, has reached the front bench by skipping the lowest rung on the ladder. As a journalist he campaigned against the Official Secrets Act and was cleared of breaching it at the Old Bailey. Mr Aitken has a trenchant debating style, which he demonstrated when likening the private legislation authorising self-regulation for the Lloyd's insurance market to 'cleaning the Augean stables with a toothbrush'. The MP for Thanet South, he championed his constituents' interests and maintained a Euro-sceptic stance when voting against the 'inadequate, unfair, partisan and rushed' plans for the Channel tunnel.</p>

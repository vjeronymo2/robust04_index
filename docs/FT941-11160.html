			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace Rumblings from Honda were only to be expected in the wake of British Aerospace's decision to sell Rover to BMW. Revenge is, after all, often the first thought of jilted brides. Whether Honda will carry through its veiled threats is the nice calculation which BMW has to weigh. While the deal was consummated quickly, the courtship between Rover and BMW went on for four months, so BMW has had time to consider the nature of the relationship. It has also made efforts to woo the Japanese carmaker in the last week. While Honda can still profit from the relationship, it will always be difficult to judge the response of a company which has been so badly slighted. Elsewhere, the tidying up of BAe continues apace. Making provision for the leases on its turboprop aircraft will help prepare the business for merger with a joint-venture partner. The company says there is no need for a rights issue, which is no surprise since the Rover deal has released Pounds 2bn of cash and banking facilities. While the sale and provisions will shrink BAe's balance sheet, it has plenty of capacity to finance its defence business and any joint ventures it wishes to establish. Talk about the departure of Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, later this year comes at the end of a heavy phase of restructuring. If a suitably heavyweight non-executive is found to replace him, shareholders should have little to worry about. More curious is the closer ties to GEC being mooted by Mr Dick Evans, the chief executive. While he is clearly right that consolidation of the European defence industry is inevitable, there still remains the choice of national champions like a merged GEC and BAe or European-wide joint ventures along the lines of Tornado or Eurofighter. That battle has yet to be fought.</p>

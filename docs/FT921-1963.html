			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Gloomy close to the equity account THE LATEST statistics on domestic inflation did nothing yesterday to revive confidence in the UK stock market on the final day of the Budget trading account which has seen the FT-SE Index fall by about 3 per cent. A market increasingly upset by a closely-run election campaign will wait nervously for announcement on Sunday of a list of important public opinion polls. The UK annualised inflation rate of 4.1 per cent in February was a shade below the most optimistic forecasts in the City of London, and undercut lingering hopes for a reduction in UK base rates. A nervous trading session ended with hefty selling of the March future contract on the FT-SE, reportedly by Goldman Sachs, which left the future again at a discount to the underlying cash market. This checked a late rally in the stock market itself and the FT-SE Index closed 11 points down at 2,456.6. The stock market was unimpressed by the fall in UK inflation to below German levels because, as one market economist commented, 'the City knows that the two headline rates are not comparable.' There was concern at the news that German public sector wage negotiations had broken down, but the stock market remained focused on domestic political considerations. The market opened firmly, helped technically by completion of a large trading programme involving about 300 of the smaller, non-Footsie stocks; Goldman Sachs was also said to have been the house involved in the deals, which were both buy and sell operations. However, with the future still moving nervously, the stock market soon stalled with a gain of eight points, and slipped back to overnight levels. When the future was sold heavily in the afternoon, the Footsie Index briefly fell below the 2,550 mark, touching 2,446.9. There was little substance behind the final rally which reduced the day's fall from 13 Footsie points to 11. Seaq volume improved to 587.8m shares from Thursday's 485.5m as traders sought to close share positions which have cost them dearly over the past two weeks. On Thursday, retail, or customer, business in equities was worth Pounds 1bn, indicating that the big institutions have been reshuffling portfolios in the wake of the Budget. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett pointed out that since the Budget, the UK market has lost the equivalent of over Pounds 2bn, raising the possibility that election uncertainty could once again bring the economic recovery to a standstill. 'A high price to pay to vote,' he comments. Retail, or customer, volume in equities fell sharply after Budget Day and as the election campaigns opened but has now rallied.</p>

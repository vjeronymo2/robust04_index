			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "rom": "Cooperation Treaty With China </F> Signed"]    [Text] Duesseldorf -- On Monday [24 January], North  Rhine-Westphalia and the PRC signed a memorandum on economic,  technological, and scientific cooperation. As North  Rhine-Westphalia Economics Minister Guenther Einert explained,  this should put an end to the "concept of nothing but the export  of goods."    The cooperation treaty is the result of a visit paid to  China  by a delegation made up of 50 representatives of North  Rhine-Westphalian companies led by the minister in October of  last year. The main points of the agreement are:     -  The  establishment of cooperation between interested companies from  North Rhine-Westphalia and appropriate Chinese parties for the  development and production of robust, inexpensive, numerically  controlled machine tools that are simple to operate for the  Chinese market;    -  The establishment of a technology center for the  plants supplying the automobile industry in Wuhan. Under the  recent initiative of the North Rhine-Westphalia Automobile  Association, which was recently set up, partners will be sought  who want to be based at the center and operate on a joint  venture basis.    -  The development and construction of clean  coal-fired power plants. The project should involve the  participation of power companies and scientific circles. As  Einert pointed out, China's coal reserves are estimated to  amount to 970 billion tonnes. The growing demand for power on  the part of industry, which is expanding, and private households  has to be taken into consideration; 120 million people have  still to be connected to the public power supply;    -  According to  Einert and Wang Chunzheng, the deputy chairman of the PRC's  State Planning Commission, cooperation should also involve joint  research projects about structural change in the developed and  newly industrialized countries; launching scientific and  technical projects; and exchanging information about areas of  interest for investment in both countries. The cooperation  should be coordinated by a commission, which will meet twice a  year and will establish a program for two-year periods.    As Einert explained, the cooperation with North  Rhine-Westphalia companies should smooth the way to Southeast  Asia and provide the Chinese economy with competent partners.  The minister thus wants to involve Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg,  and Hessen in this kind of cooperation and has already started  negotiations with them.    Wang stressed that the State Planning Commission, which is  the top coordinating body for the economic activities of  individual ministries and determines a framework for the further  development of the socialist market economy, nowadays hardly  ever issues "plans of a directive kind." In this respect,  decentralization is "well advanced." Since the beginning of the  economic reforms in China 15 years ago, one has increasingly  gone over from "a principle of commanding" to one of  "instructing." Thus, in 1994, only about 4 percent of the  country's industrial output is "organized" through directives  issued by the State Planning Commission.    In addition, Wang has also been seeking longer-term  involvement in China by German companies. China has a market of  about 1.1 billion people that has to be supplied. Since 1990,  industrial output rose by 6 percent in 1990, by 14.2 percent in  1991, and by 21.7 percent in the following year. The Chinese  GNP has also risen at a similar rate: The GNP rose by 13  percent between 1992 and 1993 and is expected to increase by  about 10 percent in 1994.</p>

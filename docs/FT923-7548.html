			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Japan With the equity market back to 1986 levels, investors are beginning to ask whether Japanese shares represent good value. On some valuation measures Japanese industrial companies do indeed stand direct comparison with their international competitors. Unfortunately the best support comes from exotic investment criteria. For example the ratio of a company's market capitalisation to its sales gives a fairly crude rating, but has the benefit of excluding differing accounting conventions. On that basis Toshiba has a market value of only 0.4 times its sales, while General Electric sells on 1.5 times, GEC 0.6 and Siemens 0.5. True, this says nothing about the value Toshiba extracts from sales, but it starts to argue the shares are not hugely expensive. Similarly the price to cash flow measure shows firms such as NEC, Hitachi, and even Nippon Steel holding their own. The snag is that investors cannot eat a price to cash flow ratio, and it has become fashionable to focus on low Japanese dividends. Equity yields rose as the market fell, but there are good reasons for dividend payments to remain below western levels. Some 60 per cent of Japanese shares are held by other quoted Japanese companies; with dividends taxed at more than 50 per cent, increasing dividends becomes an expensive exercise. At the heart of the debate about value lies profitability. It is a cliche that Japanese companies until now pursued market share at the expense of profits. With strong balance sheets, many of the larger companies might still be tempted to stick with the culture that puts corporate size above stock market performance. But pressure from banking partners who face large losses on their share portfolios is shifting attitudes. Companies are moving on from cost control to rationalising their range and extending product life-cycles. Matsushita is cutting back from 50,000 to at most 40,000 product types this year. Others have made strategic change. Fujitsu has withdrawn from the US facsimile market and Toshiba has pulled out of audio products. In all cases the focus has shifted from commodity items such as consumer durables and towards higher added value areas. But change is slow; profitability will improve, but Japanese consensual management means it will not arrive overnight. Investors looking for value in Tokyo must tread warily.</p>

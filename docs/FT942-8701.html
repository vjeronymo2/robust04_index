			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rethink needed on investment Sir, Hanson's decision to increase its investment pay-back period highlights the need for a much more sophisticated approach to investment by many UK companies. UK companies typically demand excessively high internal investment returns - often twice the real cost of capital. We have found that those with the lowest discount rates and good financial control of their business have seen the greatest growth in profitability and shareholder value. Conversely, those with the highest rates frequently face competitive problems in large parts of their portfolios as profitable growth opportunities are under-exploited and rivals are allowed to attack positions of strength. For many American companies, investment appraisal techniques and hurdle rates are a fundamental, explicitly-stated part of their communicated strategy. This contrasts with the reluctance of UK companies to talk about investment strategy in other than the most general and generic terms. Costs of capital, discount rates and investment criteria need to be reviewed regularly by the chief executive, the CFO and the board, with key underlying assumptions clearly set out and debated, not delegated to 'technicians' within the finance function. Hanson's announcement recognises this, but may also signal a more general shift by companies from an acquisition and short-term cashflow-focused environment to one that needs to be more reliant on investment-driven organic growth. The challenge will be to convince the investment community that such companies possess the management style and skills required to succeed in this new world.

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Delegates optimistic on timber pact NEGOTIATIONS ON a new International Tropical Timber Agreement resumed in Geneva yesterday, with both producing and consuming countries expressing optimism for progress in the week-long talks. The first session of talks in April ended in stalemate over producer demands for temperate and boreal, as well as tropical timber, to be included in the new agreement. Producing countries, the biggest being Malaysia, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Papua New Guinea and Brazil, say the present accord is discriminatory. The 1983 International Tropical Timber Agreement, which came into force in 1985 and expires in March next year, aims to balance economic use of tropical timber with environmental needs through co-operation, consultation and research. It has no price-setting mechanisms. Consumers have pressed for stronger environmental provisions, including a clear commitment to ensuring that by the year 2000 all tropical timber exports come from sustainably managed forests. Producers do not want this target to be legally binding and say similar commitments should be imposed on all internationally traded timber. Consumer countries continue to oppose the inclusion of temperate and boreal timber in any agreement. At a meeting of the International Tropical Timber Council in Kuala Lumpur last month, however, they proposed three points for discussion in Geneva which they hope will allay producer concerns. In particular, consumers have suggested language in the new agreement that would bar discrimination against exports of tropical timber as such and ensure the accord could not be used to justify trade curbs. Consumers have also offered to examine a shift to sustainable forest management for temperate timber and increased funds for projects in tropical producing countries to promote sustainable management and increased market transparency. The negotiations, sponsored by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, involve some 50 countries accounting for virtually the whole Dollars 7.5bn a year trade in tropical timber. Unctad officials say that a final deal is unlikely this time.</p>

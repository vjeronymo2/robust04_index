			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hualon textiles plant deal should be reviewed Sir, Recent coverage of the decision by the European Commission to approve the award of substantial public funding for the Hualon textiles plant in Northern Ireland has served to highlight inconsistencies in the policies of the European and UK authorities. First, there is a difference of view as to whether there is over-capacity or not in this sector of trade. Clearly Tim Smith, the UK economy minister for Northern Ireland, feels that there is unsatisfied, and indeed growing, demand for the product, whereas the European textile industry believes the opposite, a position the Commission initially agreed. Second, the Commission is quoted as saying that the project is of a low-technology nature, whereas the UK government is saying the opposite. Third, the project envisages the creation of 1,850 jobs whereas others contend that this level of employment is improbable. In this regard it is interesting that Tim Smith, in his detailed contribution to the debate in the FT ('A respectable and respected public corporation', June 3), makes no reference to the number of jobs that will be created. I should emphasise that the British Apparel &amp; Textile Confederation is strongly supportive of inward investment in the textile industry in all parts of the UK. However, each case must be judged on its merits and surely, given the contradictions surrounding the Hualon investment, the whole case should now be reviewed by both the Commission and the Industrial Development Board before contracts are signed.

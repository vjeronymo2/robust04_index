			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / FT Guide to the Week MONDAY 15 Japan's war memories Emperor Akihito and Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister (left), attend a service in Tokyo marking the 49th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Some 10 members of the Murayama cabinet may attend a more controversial ceremony at the capital's Yasukuni Shrine to pay homage to Japan's war dead - those buried there include war criminals. Last year, only five members of the government of Morihiro Hosokawa visited the shrine. Germany's economics minister, Gunter Rexrodt, is expected to present a positive analysis of the German economy. With two months before the federal elections, the governing coalition, now running nearly 8 points ahead of the opposition Social democrats and Greens in opinion polls, is keen to use encouraging economic indicators to help maintain its lead. Pipeline talks open Leaders from Russia, Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan meet in Ashgabat to discuss the construction of a new gas pipeline to Europe. The existing pipeline does not have enough capacity to meet the export ambitions of Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, the main energy producers in the former Soviet Union. Disputes between Russia and the two southern republics about access to the pipeline have worried western investors. Trial in Albania: Five members of Omonia, an ethnic Greek political organisation in Albania, go on trial in the capital Tirana on charges of treason and espionage. Greece has threatened to veto European Union financial aid to Albania, claiming human rights abuses against the Greek minority. Holidays: Austria, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, France, parts of Germany, Greece, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malta, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Venezuela (Assumption). Argentina, Costa Rica, India (Independence Day), Italy (Summer Bank Holiday), Paraguay, S Korea (Independence Day). TUESDAY 16 US rates poised to rise The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy for the Federal Reserve, is to meet in Washington. Most economists predict the Fed will decide to raise short term interest rates to head off what it sees as signs of incipient inflation. Swedish inflation: The reasons for Sweden's surprise decision to lift interest rates last week may become clearer today when the country's July consumer price index is published. The index, which rose from 1.8 per cent to 2.6 per cent between March and June, is expected to have continued its upward trend. The median expectation for July is 2.9 per cent. Nigeria's high court in Abuja is to decide whether it can try Moshood Abiola, the banned winner of last year's annulled presidential election, for treason. No decision about a prospective general strike by the Nigeria Labour Congress will be taken before the hearing, except in Lagos where opposition to the military government is strongest. Oil workers' unions, however, say that they will stay on strike until the military hand over power to civilians. Sri Lanka holds a general election. It appears likely that the ruling United National party, which has governed the country for 17 years, will lose to the left-leaning People's Alliance, an eight-party coalition. UK economy: The CBI distributive trades survey will be scanned for early indications of an upturn in official figures for July retail sales, due on Thursday. Volume sales were unchanged between April and May, and up only 0.2 per cent in June. However, recent consumer credit data and a strong CBI survey last month suggest that Britain's canny consumers were keen bargain-hunters in the summer sales. Ballet russe An international ballet competition devised in honour of the Russian ballerina Maya Plissetskaya begins in St Petersburg (to August 22). Oz prey: The memoirs of Bob Hawke, the former Australian prime minister, are due to published. Mr Hawke quit in late-1991 after a bitter leadership struggle with Paul Keating, the current PM, and the book is expected to provide insights into the Labor Party conflicts of that time. WEDNESDAY 17 Palestine progresses Shimon Peres, (left) Israel's foreign minister, will meet Nabil Shaath, senior Palestinian negotiator, in Cairo. They hope to speed implementation of the extension of Palestinian self-rule across the West Bank. The two sides will also begin discussions on the holding of national Palestinian elections due in mid-December. An agreement is near to transfer power in the Israeli-occupied West Bank from Israeli to Palestinian hands in five areas: education, health, direct taxation, tourism, and social welfare. Differences have emerged, however, about Jerusalem, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and the timing of elections. Global population: The United Nations Population Fund, based in New York, publishes the 1994 report on the State of the World's Population. The 65-page report describes sharp falls in developing country birth rates during the past two decades, and advocates wider distribution of contraceptives and better education for women in developing countries. It is published only a month before the opening of the UN's conference on population in Cairo. The Vatican has censured the US government's support for contraception and its tolerance of homosexuality. Musicians invade Lucerne's International Music Festival begins, with two concerts a day for more than three weeks (to Sep 10). UK economy: Hopes are high that retail price inflation stayed subdued in July. Summer sales began later this year than last, which may offset adverse effects of less aggressive discounting. Economists are looking for a 0.2 per cent drop in the RPI between June and July, with the year-on-year rate unchanged at 2.6 per cent. The underlying rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments, may nudge higher from 2.4 per cent to 2.5 per cent, the middle of the government's target range. Holidays: Indonesia (Independence Day). THURSDAY 18 Mandela to outline policy South Africa's president Nelson Mandela addresses parliament on his 100th day in office. He is expected to flesh out the so-called Reconstruction and Development Programme, his government's plan for social investment in areas such as housing, electrification, education and health. The speech is an important public relations effort aimed at meeting the demands of blacks for government action on poverty. Israel and Jordan wind up their first substantive bilateral talks on trade, borders, water, tourism, finance and banking on the Israeli side of the Dead Sea. They are expected to announce progress on demarcation of the disputed border, sharing the waters of the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers, co-operation and joint marketing in tourism, steps to link the two countries' electricity grids, and transit of Jordanian goods through Israel's Mediterranean ports. 'A Level' results: Anxious UK parents and their teenage children will be put out of their misery with the release of examination results that are vital for university entrance. Cricket: England meet South Africa for the third test at the Oval, London, (to August 22). Commonwealth Games begin in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada (to August 28). Holidays: Bahrain, Lebanon. FRIDAY 19 Swedish poll manifesto out Sweden's opposition Social Democrats, hot favourites to win next month's general election, present their manifesto with all eyes trained on their economic policies. With the fragile state of the economy dominating the campaign, the party is under pressure to detail how it will deal with the big budget deficit, fast-growing public debt, and rising interest rates. So far, markets have been less than enthusiastic about the Social Democratic emphasis on tax increases and unwillingness to be drawn on the need for deep cuts in the welfare state. UK economy: The forecast deterioration in the trade balance with non-EU countries to a deficit of Pounds 600m in July, from Pounds 495m in June, should cause little concern. UK export volumes are rising, giving economists fewer worries about the 1994 current account outlook than three months ago. US president Bill Clinton turns 48, but he may not have much to celebrate unless Congress reverses its recent setback to the crime bill or acts to advance healthcare reform. Even his planned holiday on Martha's Vineyard in the run-up to the Labor Day holiday on September 5 threatens to be fraught with Washington-related distractions. Holidays: Abu Dhabi, Afghanistan (Independence Day), Kuwait, Morocco, Tunisia. WEEKEND 20-21 Mexican elections Mexico goes to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president and Congress. Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is strong favourite to win the presidential race, while his party is expected to maintain its control over Congress. The opposition and about 15,000 national and several international observers will be watching for fraud. Alpbach forum: Nine heads of state and the European Union Commission president, Jacques Delors, will hold an informal meeting on Sunday within the framework of the annual Alpbach forum in the Austrian Alps (to August 22). Topics will include questions of new neighbourly relations, security problems and cultural ties in the light of the forthcoming enlargement of the EU. Chess: The Lloyds Bank's annual tournament starts at the Cumberland Hotel, London (until 29 August). With more than 30 grandmasters competing, it is Britain's strongest-ever open-to-all chess event. Winners qualify for the Pounds 100,000 Intel Grand Prix and a chance to compete against Gary Kasparov and Nigel Short. Three Choirs Festival: Britain's oldest musical festival, going back to the early 18th century, begins at Hereford on Sunday. Compiled by Patrick Stiles and Martin Mulligan.

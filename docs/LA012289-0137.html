			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LONG WAIT ENDS FOR MATSUBARA IN CSUN WIN  </P> <P> Darren Matsubara had waited a long time.  </P> <P> Two and a half years to be exact.  </P> <P> That's how long he had lingered on the sidelines before becoming eligible to  play basketball for Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> But the 6-1 senior took center stage on Saturday night as the Matadors rallied  for a 72-63 victory and their first win at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo since 1985.  </P> <P> Matsubara scored a season-high 27 points at a very opportune time for CSUN,  which was coming off a blowout loss at Cal State Bakersfield on Thursday.  </P> <P> "I've been waiting for this," Matsubara said after helping the Matadors run  their record to 11-5 overall, 2-1 in California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play.  "The wait was worth it, no doubt."  </P> <P> Matsubara, whose ineligibility was prolonged by a complicated transfer from  Hawaii Pacific, made 9 of 13 field-goal attempts and 7 of 9 free throws. And on  the occasions he penetrated and didn't shoot, he created high-percentage  opportunities for his teammates.  </P> <P> "I've been watching myself on tape a lot," Matsubara said.  </P> <P> And what had he seen?  </P> <P> "I was doing a lot of passing around the outside, not doing much of anything."  </P> <P> And what had he used during Saturday's game, teammate Kris Brodowski inquired  in the locker room afterward?  </P> <P> "Oh, yeah, Kris's body glove," Matsubara said.  </P> <P> "No," Brodowski said. "You used common sense."  </P> <P> Said Matsubara: "I'm still going to wear that body glove every game from now  on."  </P> <P> Whatever Matsubara used best, it helped stop a San Luis Obispo team that had  been on a roll.  </P> <P> The Mustangs (10-5, 2-1) had won 7 of their past 8 games and had not lost a  conference game at home since the 1986-87 season.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo led, 56-52, with 6 minutes left when CSUN mounted its decisive  rally.  </P> <P> Matsubara made a 3-point shot to cut the Mustang lead to 1 and after CSUN  forced San Luis Obispo into a 10-second backcourt violation, Karl Becker  swished a 10-footer from the baseline to give the Matadors the lead for good,  57-56.  </P> <P> The suspense wasn't over, however.  </P> <P> Northridge was clinging to a 3-point lead with a little more than a minute  remaining and only a few ticks left on the 45-second clock when Matsubara  converted a jump shot to give the Matadors a 66-61 lead.  </P> <P> The elation of CSUN and its guard-of-the-night was temporary. Only 11 seconds  after hitting perhaps the key shot of the game, Matsubara was gone. He was  called for his fifth foul while trying to strip the ball away from the  Mustangs' Coby Naess.  </P> <P> But Jemarl Baker and Derrick Gathers each made 2 free throws and Todd Bowser  added a short jump shot down the stretch as the Matadors held off San Luis  Obispo.  </P> <P> It was a somewhat ironic finish because Gathers and Bowser, CSUN's top two  scorers, combined for only 14 points.  </P> <P> Gathers, who came in averaging 18.5 points a game, made 3 of 15 field-goal  attempts. He made up for an off-night shooting in other departments, however.  He led all rebounders with 12 and added 4 steals.  </P> <P> Gathers acknowledged afterward that, in this case anyway, a bad shooting night  was for the best.  </P></p>

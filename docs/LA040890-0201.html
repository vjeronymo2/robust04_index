			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CS NORTHRIDGE CAN'T TAKE THE 5TH, FALLS TO POMONA  </P> <P> For four innings Saturday, Cal State Northridge left-hander John Bushart did a  fine impression of former major league pitcher Tommy John, the ground-ball  specialist.  </P> <P> Bushart induced nine ground balls, forced two double plays and did not allow a  hit to Cal Poly Pomona over the first four innings of the California Collegiate  Athletic Assn. game at Northridge.  </P> <P> But in the fifth, Bushart's routine fell apart. First he lost the no-hitter,  then the shutout, and finally the game.  </P> <P> Bushart was tagged for five hits and six earned runs in the fifth, as Pomona  came back from a 3-0 deficit to defeat Northridge, 7-5, for the first time in  five meetings this season.  </P> <P> Matador Coach Bill Kernen demonstrated the patience of a fisherman as Pomona  battered Bushart in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> "I kept thinking he was going to get the third out, but he didn't," Kernen  said.  </P> <P> Steve Keelin broke up the no-hitter with a leadoff single to left field, but  Bushart retired the next two batters and appeared to be in control. Then Kurt  Miltenberger lined a run-scoring single to left-center. Runs began pouring in.  </P> <P> Dan Andrews followed with a walk and Jason Keeline laced a two-run double down  the third-base line. Neil Weingarten singled in a run and Matt Bullock bounced  a double off the wall for two more.  </P> <P> Bushart (4-1) walked the next batter and saw him go to second on a wild pitch  before Kernen finally yanked the freshman in favor of Todd Denhart.  </P> <P> Denhart gave up a single that scored the sixth run of the inning, then struck  out Erik Daniels to end the onslaught.  </P> <P> "Bushart got the ball up and into hittable areas and they hammered him," Kernen  said. "We didn't really self-destruct, they just beat us."  </P> <P> In the first, Denny Vigo hit Northridge's first home run in six games, a  two-run shot. Northridge (22-14, 9-6 in conference play) made it 3-0 in the  second inning on Greg Shockey's RBI single.  </P> <P> But after Pomona's six-run spurt, the Matadors could not respond sufficiently.  </P> <P> Shockey drove in Mike Sims with a sacrifice fly in the fifth, and Vigo smacked  his 10th home run in the sixth to cut the deficit to 6-5. But that's as close  as Northridge could get against Pomona freshman Rich Rohde (2-0), who limited  the Matadors to six hits in his first collegiate start.  </P> <P> Scott Sharts, who leads Northridge with 16 homers, struck out twice and did not  get the ball out of the infield in four at-bats.  </P> <P> Sharts did not get a hit in the three-game series with Pomona (10-26, 4-12) and  is hitless in his last 19 at-bats.  </P> <P> "He's been struggling," Kernen said. "There's always ups and downs during the  season -- especially with power guys."  </P></p>

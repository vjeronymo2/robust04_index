			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / M0 growth hints at retail recovery Buoyant figures for money supply growth published yesterday may indicate that retail sales were healthy last month. M0, the narrowest measure of the money supply, grew by a seasonally adjusted 5.8 per cent in the year to March compared with an annual rate of 5.5 per cent in February. Notes and coins, the core component of M0, rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent between February and March and by 6.1 per cent over the 12-month period, said the Bank of England. The annual growth in M0 has been consistently above the target range of 0 to 4 per cent - though the authorities have pointed to low interest rates, which cut the effective cost of holding cash, as a contributory factor. M0 growth has traditionally been assumed to reflect a rise in retail sales. But analysts warned that special factors may have applied in March. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, the Japanese bank, said: 'The recent relationship between M0 and retail sales has been less precise.' Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist at Robert Fleming Securities, said: 'The fact that Easter fell right at the start of April means consumers will have built up cash at the end of March.' If the money supply figures do translate into higher retail sales, this will be an encouraging sign of the strength of the recovery. The annual growth rate of retail sales dropped to 2.5 per cent in February, the lowest rate since May 1993, and commentators had assumed that consumers were cutting back in anticipation of this month's tax increases. Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said the strong M0 growth would be disappointing news for gilts. Other figures released by the Bank of England show that overseas institutions were net buyers of gilts in February, purchasing more than Pounds 1.5bn. The main sellers were domestic institutions, which unloaded a net Pounds 338m. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the Bank, reported to have intervened in February to help individual marketmakers, was likely to have made net purchases of less than Pounds 500m. The UK's gold and foreign currency reserves rose by Dollars 89m last month, taking reserves at the end of March to Dollars 43.5bn compared with Dollars 43.4bn at the end of February. The underlying change in reserves was a drop of Dollars 45m. This excludes various factors including proceeds from this month's tender of UK Ecu Treasury bills and British Telecommunications privatisation receipts of Dollars 142m.</p>

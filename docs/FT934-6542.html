			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BTR disposes of US offshoot - Sale continues strategy of concentrating on core activities BTR, the industrial conglomerate, is selling Summers Group, a Texas-based electrical wholesale business, for up to Dollars 120m (Pounds 80.5m) to Willcox &amp; Gibbs, the US distribution and manufacturing group. Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said: 'We are very pleased to have concluded this divestment which represents a further important step in reducing our involvement in wholesale distribution. 'It complements our recent divestment of the Newey &amp; Eyre electrical distribution business in the UK and our stated intention to float the Graham builders' merchant business in 1994'. The disposals are in line with BTR's strategy of concentrating resources on the development of its core industrial manufacturing businesses, which Mr Jackson has adopted since he became chief executive in 1991. Summers, based in Dallas, has more than 80 branches in the southern US and about 1,100 employees. Last year it had sales of Dollars 395m and post-tax profits of about Dollars 6m. Net assets being sold amount to Dollars 66m. BTR will receive an initial Dollars 85m and further profit-related payments of up to Dollars 35m. In September BTR agreed to sell Newey &amp; Eyre Group, a Birmingham-based electrical distribution group, for up to Pounds 165m to Hagemeyer, the Netherlands-based international trading house. Last month BTR said it would spin off the Graham group of builders' merchants and other businesses through a stock market flotation in the first half of next year. The flotation is expected to value the Graham group at about Pounds 200m. BTR has won the inaugural British Quality of Management Award, sponsored by Mori, the market research organisation, and Sundridge Park, the corporate and executive development organisation. Mori asked financial institutions, leaders of industry and financial editors of national papers to nominate companies they believed had quality management.</p>

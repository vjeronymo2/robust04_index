			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's  Guizhou Province plans to build more power plants and stations  in the coming few years.    As a mountainous province, Guizhou is rich in hydropower and  coal resources. It now has a generating capacity of more than  2.8 million kw.    Xiang Dehong, director of the electricity bureau of the  province, said that more than ten power projects with a total  generating capacity of 5.63 million kw will be constructed from  1995 to the end of this century.    As its neighboring east Chinese provinces suffer power  shortages, the province aims to jointly build power stations and  plants with these provinces and supply more electrical power to  them.    At present, several such projects are under construction and  two power transmission lines to Guangdong Province have been  completed and another one is being built. A transmission line  to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is also under  construction.    As the power industry develops, the electricity-consuming  mining and metallurgy industries are becoming the mainstays of  the province's economy.</p>

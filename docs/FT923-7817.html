			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Books: At the edge MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE by Ariel Dorfman Methuen Pounds 13.99, 167 pages BLACK DIAMOND by Rachel Ingalls Faber Pounds 14.99, 279 pages THE JEWESS by Irene Dische Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 213 pages WITH Death and the Maiden, his play about torture and recrimination, Ariel Dorfman burst on London last year as the most exciting and original voice to come out of South America for a decade. The play is now packing houses in the West End and on Broadway; Dorfman's new collection of stories, My House is on Fire, clamours for as wide an audience. Playgoers will recognise the ingredients. First, the imaginative sweep with which Dorfman depicts his unique world of impetuous hearts pushed to the edge by politics, and family conflicts shocked into life-and-death crises by Chile's regime of terror. Then the buoyancy and physicality and whooping beauty of the prose, racing along at breakneck speed, its psycho-thriller pace punctured by reversals, reflections, satires. Are the children playing house in the title story hiding from a real or imaginary enemy? Is the soldier-boy returning to confront his companero father in for a worse shock than the one he is to give? Dorfman pares down to essentials, then twists away from the suspense he has been building up, into a new climax. It's a technique perfect for the slim, concentrated story, as is his ability to create character and define narrative consciousness through an individual's language and tenor. Everyday emotions from Oedipal conflicts to petty vanities are set against a backcloth of real fear. But the ironic edge never lets up, making Dorfman, like Nabokov, a writer's writer, as well as a storyteller of almost mythic intensity. Rachel Ingalls is a more tentative, quiet writer, but as with Dorfman, her mastery of the short story lies in a sense of when to turn the fictional screw at an unpredictable angle. Her characters, troubled mid-Atlantic spirits, are mousy and uncertain; she shows them tumbling to awareness in giveaway moments - booking a holiday, intercepting a letter, falling in love  -which unleash nightmare consequences, from murder and plane crashes to lost babies and a wedding in a madhouse. 'The Archaeologist's Daughter', about a girl whose fears of adulthood last to her thirties and are symbolised by blackmail from a possibly illegitimate sister and a group of Eygptian statue-collectors, is the best; reserved, fastidious style, slow rhythms, balance horror and magic. The effect is of an Anita Brookner character transposed to Thomas Pynchon land. When she can manage the descent from the normal to surreal, keeping a veneer of logicality, Ingalls is idiosyncratic and enjoyable. But too often she wallows in sentimental farce, as in the story of the adopted boy who searches out his true parents only to kill them in an incestuous orgy. Ingalls is one of a cluster of American women writers whose short stories are being trumpeted to English readers by Faber. Zany yet cautious, Ingalls has her own style; she also has an unerring feel for social and period setting: the pressure in the optimistic, puritanical 1950s on teenage lovers; the cultural knowingness of an arty family with homes in Switzerland, Paris and New York are both evoked with a few deft strokes. The subtitle of The Jewess: Stories from Berlin and New York reveals the trouble with this collection. A flurry of defectors and clandestine operators; a candle business from Dresden; an ageing American virgin turned rapist on the Kurfurstendamm - American writer Irene Dische lets rip with trendy Berlin settings, but all the east-west tensions of a thousand collapsed iron curtains won't fire the imagination if the writer cannot transform her material beyond travel brochure titillation. Occasionally she forgets about local colour, as in 'The Passion of Nanny Jackie', about a nanny who nurses a poet in his last months, and an individual voice seems on the point of emerging. But mostly this quirky talent is lost in Dische's gushing High School enthusiasm for her adopted city. Buy a guide book instead.</p>

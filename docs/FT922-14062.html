			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Observer: Champion It may not be one of the world's great sporting events, but the 1992 National Tennis Championships of Cambodia have provided a heartwarming spectacle for the two dozen people who turned up to watch. For the first time in years, the handful of players still alive and in the country after the genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge are competing with plenty of new balls and without borrowing each other's ageing tennis rackets, thanks to the sponsorship of Wilson Sporting Goods' Singaporean operation. Under UN guidance, Cambodia is slowly returning to normal after two decades of civil war, but life is still pretty tough. 'There are not many of us left,' is how one veteran of the Khmer Lawn Tennis Federation founded in the 1930s puts it. 'And you have to make economies even to buy a pair of socks.' The singles players paid 200 riels - about 15p  - to enter the competition. 'Nobody was playing tennis after the Pol Pot period,' recalls Yi Sarun, singles champion in 1974, the year before the Khmer Rouge overran the capital. 'After 1984 people began to play again using old rackets and makeshift nets.' A few young players are on the rise, but it is a sad reflection of the devastation endured by his country that this year's national champion - and winner of a graphite racket and a can of tennis balls - is the self-same Yi who won 18 years ago.</p>

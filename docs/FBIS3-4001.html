During the meeting, Luo said that since infrastructural  deficiencies have become bottlenecks in China's economic  development, the Chinese Government will focus on infrastructure  construction in the next five-year plan period.    He expressed his welcome to German companies' wish to  participate in China's infrastructural development. He said  that the prospect of German companies' business in China would  be very bright.    Teltschik introduced his talks with officials of China's  State Planning Commission on the cooperation between the two  countries in this regard.    He said that nine big German companies had shown willingness  to help China to improve its infrastructural facilities, and a  concrete plan had been put forward.    The German Government will support the plan, he added.    The German guests arrived here on Sunday [20 March] at the  invitation of the China Council for Promotion of International  Trade.</p>

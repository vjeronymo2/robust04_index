			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (18): Early fears give way to enthusiasm - A long-established family business in Scotland discovers the benefits of trading electronically / Case study of Product supplier - Thomas Tunnock BAKER and confectionery manufacturer Thomas Tunnock says it was pushed into electronic data interchange (EDI) by Tesco, the food retailer - but a year later it is more than satisfied with the result. Tunnock's, as the company is known, has been baking in Uddington, on the outskirts of Glasgow, for more than 100 years. Today this family business has a Pounds 25m turnover and 700 staff; its biscuits, chocolate and caramel wafers, tea cakes and marshmallow Snowballs are exported to more than 30 countries. Tunnock's moved into computing in a big way in 1990, replacing its accounting package with a total financial, sales, production and materials management system from Trifid Software and installing a bigger computer from McDonnell Douglas Information Systems. The system is accessed by 30 terminals and personal computers, including three in the London office, which previously sent orders to the head office by post. Soon after the Trifid system went live, Tunnock's found Tesco promoting EDI. 'Tesco wanted us to use its package, sent us details of the product, training, costs and so on,' says computer systems manager Mr Joe Hailey. 'No one here knew anything about EDI, so we held back until we'd looked into it. 'Tesco never said we had to go EDI or else, but we got the impression that if we didn't we would have no more business from them.' Mr Hailey says its big retail chain customers were very helpful in getting Tunnock's into EDI and that the whole operation 'went very smoothly.' Tunnock's settled on an EDI software package from Trifid's sister company, Kewill Xetal. It costs around Pounds 900. This package provides access to all EDI services, an important consideration for Tunnock's, because another big customer, Safeway, uses the IBM EDI network rather than the INS Tradanet service favoured by Tesco. Tunnock's uses a personal computer to link to Tradanet: this is the cheapest way of connecting, because INS bases its charges on the size of the trader's computer. So another package, a Pounds 250 product from Pixel Innovations, has been added to convert the EDI messages into the format the Trifid system can understand and vice versa. IT cost Tunnock's Pounds 5,200 to join the Tradanet service, including the necessary software, training and consultancy, so the total set-up cost, including the Kewill Xetal and Pixel packages, was around Pounds 6,350. There is now a monthly charge to INS of just over Pounds 80, or Pounds 975 a year. So far, Tunnock's only uses EDI to receive orders and this is free on Tradanet, although there is a storage charge if messages are not removed after seven days. Tunnock's now trades electronically with Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury and Safeway and sees clear benefits. 'Orders come in by EDI and pass into the Trifid system, so details are available in minutes to everyone in the organisation: for example, to senior executives for management information and to production people,' Joe Hailey says. 'The more companies we trade with electronically, the greater the benefits of EDI. 'We pride ourselves on the fact that we make to order, so our products are always fresh. Now, as more and more companies send us orders via EDI directly into the Trifid system, we can set up longer production runs, handling two or three orders at a time. 'With EDI and the Trifid business system, orders sent by our customers on Monday can be scheduled for production on Wednesday and delivered on Thursday. Previously, orders might come through the post from the London office and someone might spend an hour a day keying the information in from documents that had already been produced by hand. This slowed our response to orders and was naturally error-prone.' Joe Hailey says around 50 of Tunnock's 300 or more customers are probably of suitable size and computing sophistication to trade electronically. EDI could also be used to trade with a dozen or so suppliers. These suppliers include giant groups in the sugar and chocolate business. However, Tunnock's is working initially with its main packaging supplier here: an Edinburgh company, William Thyne. The project is William Thyne's first move into EDI. 'We're not pushing them into it,' says Mr Hailey. 'They were keen to pursue it and we are their ideal EDI partner, as one of their biggest customers.' Meanwhile Tunnock's is expanding its EDI relationship with some of its customers. 'Tesco is talking to us about sending us sales forecasts,' says Mr Hailey. 'This will be useful for our production people especially.' From being a rather anxious newcomer to EDI, Tunnock's has become something of an enthusiastic user and keen to exploit it in different ways. 'The fact that we're into EDI will make a difference for our sales manager when he's talking to new customers,' says Joe Hailey. 'We can be up-and-running in days and then we can process orders quickly and there's no danger of orders going missing. 'Initially, when we only had EDI links to one customer, we weren't certain about the benefits. But EDI is certainly paying for itself now.' A boon for small businesses: see page 20</p>

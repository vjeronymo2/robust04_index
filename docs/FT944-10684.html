			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets firmer ahead of poll result Wall Street US shares put on a firm showing yesterday on program buying as the market awaited results from the mid-term elections, and producer price news expected tomorrow, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 21.87 ahead at 3,830.74, slightly below its high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.58 at 465.65, while the American Stock Exchange composite improved 0.64 to 451.05 and the Nasdaq composite rallied 5.23 to 767.54. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 289m shares. The markets were also influenced by expectations of a rise in interest rates after next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. An increase in rates could draw money out of equity markets and into fixed income instruments. Merrill Lynch yesterday advised investors to reduce their stock holdings in favour of bonds and cash. Program buying caused moderately active volume, but investors remained generally cautious as they awaited the government figures on producer prices, which are expected to show a 0.1 per cent rise for October. If the number is significantly larger it could provoke fears of a large or early move to increase interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Markets were uncertain as to the impact of the mid-term elections, but some believed that a strong showing by Republicans could bolster markets today. Smaller issues trading was boosted by gains in software stocks. Broderbund Software advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 61 5/8 and Boole &amp; Babbage moved forward Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 25. The day also saw gains for the large high-technology stocks, IBM, Apple Computer and Motorola, in further response to Monday's news of a joint venture by the three computer makers to design a new personal computer. IBM rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 73, Apple picked up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 42 1/4 and Motorola advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 57 1/2 . Hewlett-Packard also rose, by Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 97 7/8 , on news that its printer business was very profitable, in spite of decreasing profitability seen elsewhere in that market. Southwest Airlines fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 22. It reported higher traffic in October but fourth-quarter yield figures showed lower revenues per passenger mile than for the same period last year. AMR, parent of American Airlines, was up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 51 3/8 on similar news. Allied Signal firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 33 5/8 after announcing a joint venture on Monday with General Motors to produce a part for a catalytic converter that decreases pollution. Ann Taylor, the retailer, retreated Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 41 1/2 after Monday's report that third-quarter earnings were well below both last year's figures and analysts' expectations. The Argentine telecommunications company Telefonica de Argentina forged ahead Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 after New York brokerage, Oppenheimer &amp; Co initiated coverage with a buy recommendation. The broking house's analyst covering Latin American telecommunications companies said he based his recommendation on the fact that average bottom line growth at the Argentine group had been higher than that of other Latin American and US telephone companies.</p>

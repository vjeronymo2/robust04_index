			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONGRESS LEADERS PUSH TAX HIKES  </P> <P> Democratic and Republican leaders in the House struggled today to persuade  their members to vote for large tax increases, little more than one week before  congressional elections.  </P> <P> The taxes are part of a five-year, $500-billion deficit reduction package that  was expected to come to the House floor late today or early Saturday.  </P> <P> The package, which is aimed at cutting $40 billion from the deficit this year,  encountered last-minute disagreements between Democrats and Republicans over  increases in costs for Medicare health insurance and several other issues.  </P> <P> "We're not there yet, but I believe we will be able to reach agreement," Senate  Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said.  </P> <P> House Democratic Caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Democrats could  not push the budget through on their own and were counting on help from the  Republicans.  </P> <P> "I think it is close," he said.  </P> <P> Some congressional sources warned that if the final agreement does not reach  the floor by late today, the precarious majority being assembled in the House  might begin to fall apart.  </P> <P> This would be a major blow for both Congress and President Bush and plunge the  entire budget negotiations into disarray.  </P></p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / TGWU computers hit by 'ambush' Ninety-four campaigners protesting at the TGWU general union's dismissal of one of its Merseyside officers yes-terday occupied the union's Pounds 4m national computer centre in Newcastle upon Tyne, Chris Tighe writes. The day-long occupation in support of Mr John Farrell, the union's former north-west region trade group secretary for general workers, seriously disrupted the computer system's functions including pension payments. The campaigners, including Mr Farrell, left late in the afternoon but warned of further direct action. They said the occupation had been to publicise their claim that Mr Bill Morris, the union's general secretary, had acted as 'judge, jury and executioner' in dismissing Mr Farrell. Mr Farrell was dismissed last month on various conduct-related grounds. The union said yesterday these included abuse of dispute benefit payments. He took High Court action, which ultimately failed, to prevent his dismissal. Mr Farrell said he had been dismissed because of his criticism of Mr Morris.</p>

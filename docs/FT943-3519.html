			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / World Trade News: White House gives up fight for fast-track The Clinton administration yesterday abandoned its fight for 'fast-track' authority to negotiate future trade pacts. It had been looking to pave the way for next month's legislation, needed to implement the Uruguay Round trade deal. No announcement was expected, but a trade official said the administration recognised approval of the authority by Congress 'is not going to happen'. By granting fast-track authority, Congress promises to vote on trade legislation without amendment. The fast-track request has become so controversial that the administration feared it would hinder passage of the Uruguay Round legislation and thus jeopardise its approval by foreign governments. The immediate purpose of the fast-track request was to open formal negotiations with Chile, which is next in line, after Israel, Canada and Mexico, for a free trade deal with the US. Informal talks have already begun. The administration had badly wanted fast-track authority for its Summit of the Americas, a meeting with the leaders of the Latin American democracies in December in Miami, and a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Council forum in December in Jakarta. In recent days, officials have taken pains to point out negotiations on the Uruguay Round were undertaken two years before Congress approved President Ronald Reagan's fast-track request in 1988. They say they expect 'a full debate' next year on President Clinton's request. Some trade analysts believe Congress will never turn over to the executive branch the kind of broad authority it has had in the past. Even the fast-track proposed this year called for closer scrutiny of the administration's moves. Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the trade subcommittee, this week voiced one of the dilemmas facing the administration on future trade deals. 'If we begin talks and cannot agree, or if we reach agreements and cannot ratify them, we do not return to the status quo. We slide back. We cause ill feeling, we alienate one another, and it takes years to recover,' he said. However, he warned, going too slowly may result in getting left behind. 'Brazil has already suggested going on to a South American free trade area. We could find ourselves shut out if we don't keep up.'</p>

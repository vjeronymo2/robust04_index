			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid April 12 TASS -- Asked by ITAR-TASS about the  significance of the Russian-Spanish treaty on friendship and  cooperation, Felipe Gonzales said the document is interesting on  three reasons.    Firstly, it continues the Russian-Spanish treaty of 1812.  Secondly, it establishes legal and political conditions for the  implementation of other agreements, including those on the  environmental protection, economy, finances, industries and  scientific cooperation, which will help to deepen the  Russian-Spanish relations. Thirdly, the treaty plans meetings  of Russian and Spanish foreign ministers no less than twice a  year and a summit no less than once a year.    In his turn, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Russia has  had abnormal relations with Spain. Two big nations with huge  possibilities had a goods turnover smaller than that with other  European states. In his opinion, a reason for this situation  was the absence of a fundamental document - the treaty on  friendship and cooperation. "The cooperation will now swiftly  develop," said Yeltsin.    Asked about prospects for signing the Russian agreement on  civic accord, the president said he wants the document to be  signed on April 28. This idea is basically supported by the  leadership of the State Duma, the Federation Council, the  government, the majority of parties and public movements.    "That is why, I think the majority will sign the document on  April 28. Then it will be open for signing to all those  wishing," stressed Boris Yeltsin.</p>

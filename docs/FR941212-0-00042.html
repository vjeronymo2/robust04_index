			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16. We also tighten the non-ownership rules in two respects. First, we generally prohibit LECs from exceeding the carrier-user relationship in their telephone service area with franchised cable operators, except to provide enhanced or other nonregulated services related to the provision of video programming in areas substantially served by a video dialtone platform, or to lease cable drop wires. Second, we generally prohibit affiliations between LECs and any video programmer for the purpose of operating a basic video dialtone platform. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. We relax our non-ownership rules as described above because those rules as originally structured appear to be more restrictive than necessary to achieve our objectives. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we permitted LECs to exceed the carrier-user relationship with a video programmer, but only if that programmer was a customer of, interconnected with, or shared the construction or operation of the basic video dialtone platfrom. In requiring this connection, we explained that we believed it necessary ``to assure that, in exceeding the current carrier-user relationship, telephone companies will both provide the basic platform to video programmers and use it as the basis for their own participation in the video marketplace.'' We were concerned that, absent this link, telephone companies might forego investing in video dialtone, limiting themselves instead to providing services on existing cable facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. We conclude that our goal of encouraging LECs to build and use basic video dialtone platforms can be achieved without requiring that purchasers of LEC enhanced or other nonregulated services related to the provision of video programming maintain a nexus to those platforms. So long as a LEC has built a basic platform that satisfies our video dialtone requirements, and that is available in a particular video programmer's service area, there is no public interest justification for prohibiting the LEC from offering enhanced or other nonregulated services to that video programmer, even if the programmer has no nexus to the platform. Indeed, permitting that video programmer to purchase such services from the LEC expands the range of potential customers of LEC enhanced and nonregulated services, thereby increasing LEC incentives to build video dialtone systems. At the same time, permitting LECs to provide services to video programmers who have no nexus to a video dialtone platform, including cable operators, benefits video programmers by enabling them to take advantage of such services, even if they choose not to use video dialtone as their transmission medium. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. We recognize that a video programmer's service area often will not coincide precisely with the area served by a video dialtone platform. For example, a cable operator's franchise service area that substantially overlaps a video dialtone service area may include households outside the video dialtone service area. In that situation, so long as the LEC has made video dialtone available to a significant majority of the households in the area in which the cable company seeks enhanced or other nonregulated services from the LEC, there would be no reason to prohibit the LEC from providing enhanced or other nonregulated services to that cable operator. We therefore hold that LECs may provide enhanced and other nonregulated services within their telephone service area to a video programmer if video dialtone is available to a significant majority of the households in the area in which the video programmer seeks such services. We also hold that, for purposes of applying this rule, 70% of the households in the area in which a video programmer seeks enhanced or other nonregulated services would constitute a ``significant majority.'' We acknowledge that this seventy percent standard is not the only standard that we could have adopted. We believe, however, that this standard is reasonable because it does require that video dialtone be available to a significant majority of households within the area in which the video programmer seeks to take LEC nonregulated services and thus provides LECs with the necessary incentives to deploy video dialtone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. We also permit LECs to enter into certain other non-ownership relationships ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , joint ventures and debt financing) within their service area with video programmers who are not cable operators, without regard to the existence of a video dialtone platform. Eliminating the requirement that LECs build a video dialtone platform before establishing these other relationships will not compromise our goal of encouraging video dialtone deployment. The revenues offered by a video dialtone system, including the ability of LECs to provide enhanced and other nonregulated services in areas substantially served by video dialtone, should provide ample incentives for LECs to construct video dialtone platforms. Indeed, it is not clear that the rule adopted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would further the goal of ensuring widespread deployment of video dialtone systems. Under that rule, it could be argued that a LEC could enter into a non-ownership relationship with any video programmer who had a nexus to a single video dialtone platform of that LEC. Thus, for example, a LEC could provide debt financing to a national video programmer if that programmer offered one program on one video dialtone platform operated by that LEC. We do not believe that this required nexus has a sufficiently compelling relationship to our goals to retain it. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

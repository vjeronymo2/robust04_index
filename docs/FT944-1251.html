			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc France's largest chemicals company keeps mutating. Its gradual exit from low margin commodity chemicals continued with the sale of its FFr2bn acetics operations. That followed the disposal of its TDI business earlier this month. The disposals, combined with Rhone-Poulenc's strong cash flow, suggest the group should meet its debt cutting targets next year. The more comfortable debt burden should allow Rhone-Poulenc to sort out its healthcare operations which have severe problems. Last week's US Food and Drug Administration rejection of the cancer treatment Taxotere was a disaster for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, its majority-owned subsidiary. The drug, which should have generated sales of Dollars 300m by 1996, will not now be launched in the US before 1997. Until then, that leaves RPR with a portfolio of old drugs with strictly limited growth prospects. Last month's Gencell initiative in gene therapy was strategically correct, but will not generate any new products for five years. An obvious move for Rhone-Poulenc would be to buy the 31 per cent of RPR that it does not own. This would enhance earnings and would free Rhone-Poulenc to sell or merge the business. Alternatively, it could raise equity, acquire another drugs company and drive earnings growth through cost cutting. That is something RPR's management is good at. Whatever happens, Rhone-Poulenc must deal with the problems at RPR.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SPINDLER'S KNEE READY FOR PROS  </P> <P> Marc Spindler, a defensive tackle from Pittsburgh who might skip his final year  of college football and turn pro, is a step closer to making that decision.  </P> <P> Spindler had his right knee examined over the weekend in Kansas City by a  doctor who said the joint is sound. That pronouncement gives Spindler the  opportunity to declare himself eligible for the NFL draft in April.  </P> <P> Spindler, reportedly angered at the recent Pitt firings of Coach Mike Gottfried  and defensive line Coach Frank D'Alonzo, reportedly is ready to bypass the  coming season in favor of the pro ranks. Draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. said  Spindler is a likely first-round draft choice.  </P></p>

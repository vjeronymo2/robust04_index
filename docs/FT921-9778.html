			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Management: Bank tots up the cost of coddling toddlers - Childcare The cost to an employer of replacing an experienced employee is a year's salary. The cost of subsidising childcare for the first four years of an infant's life is about half that. When Midland Bank made this calculation at the end of the 1980s, it concluded that helping mothers with childcare must make good commercial sense. Three years later, Midland is providing almost as many nursery places as the rest of the private sector put together. It is involved in more than 100 nurseries, offering places to nearly 1,000 Midland babies and toddlers. Already the scheme is having results. In 1989, no fewer than 1,400 women at the bank became pregnant, but only 30 per cent returned to work. The latest figures suggest that about 50 per cent are returning. While not all the improvement can be attributed to the nurseries, Midland believes that they have played a big part. 'We found that for the majority of women, childcare was a major barrier to promotion,' says Anne Watts, equal opportunities director. The bank will not be drawn on how much it has spent on the scheme, because it fears the giddy cost would put off other companies. 'I am conscious that we are pioneers in this,' says Watts. 'Other employers would look at our figures and say that they were totally unrealistic.' Even Midland seems to be baulking a little. It no longer talks of the 300 nurseries that it mentioned at the outset. Instead it plans to hold the total at about 120 for now. Midland has a direct interest in encouraging other employers to start similar schemes and is disappointed that not one has yet done so. Almost all its nurseries are run as partnerships - usually with the public sector. Running nurseries on its own is prohibitively expensive: the more willing partners there are, the lower the costs, as the overheads can be spread more thinly. Watts blames the absence of imitators on recession and the cuts in most companies' workforces. The other culprit is the government. 'It has set up conferences and said: 'It would be jolly good if you get together'. But it has done nothing.' At the moment the cost of providing workplace nurseries is tax deductible for private-sector employers. For industrial companies, the capital costs may also qualify for capital buildings allowance. For the employee, the benefit is tax deductable, but only when the employer is involved in financing and running the nursery. However, Watts argues that this does not go far enough, and that the government should be more active. The bank decided to become directly involved in childcare - rather than simply hand out subsidies to staff - because it recognised the problem for working mothers was not just financial. Nurseries and childminders were in short supply and their quality uncertain. At each nursery, Midland guarantees that the premises are up to scratch, that there are enough staff and that the children are learning as well as playing. The bank shares the cost with employees, who pay Pounds 42 to Pounds 58 a week towards a total cost of around Pounds 100. But with just 1,000 places available - against 60,000 employees - the nurseries are not a benefit for everyone. Instead, Midland allocates them in hard-nosed commercial fashion. It supplies childcare in areas where it is having trouble recruiting staff, recognising that a nursery has great pulling power. When the Midland advertised for jobs in Jersey where workers are in short supply, the promise of subsidised childcare brought more than 200 enquiries on the first day. Even in areas where a Midland nursery exists, employees are not assured a place. Priority is given to those whom the bank is particularly anxious to keep, because their skills are in short supply, or because they would be expensive to replace. Although Midland may have abandoned a target of 300 nurseries, Watts stresses that it has not had second thoughts about the need for childcare. Instead, the bank is channelling money into other areas. It has started holiday play arrangements for the over-fives. It also offers employees - male and female - five days off a year on full pay to deal with sick children or other crises at home. Parents are also allowed a break of up to five years, with their jobs back at the end of it. The one important area which it has not attempted to tackle is after-school care for children. This, it reckons is something the government should do. A handful of other big employers have made gestures, but most are peripheral. At Dixons, the electrical retailer, much was made of a scheme that offers term-time working contracts to men and women. That was three years ago, and only 30 people have taken it up.</p>

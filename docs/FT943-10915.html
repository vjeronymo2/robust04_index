			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU horticulture support cuts planned Intervention prices that have encouraged huge surpluses in Europe's fruit and vegetable sector would be reduced to 'unprofitable' levels under proposals for reform unveiled by the European Commission. The sector, which costs the European Union's common agricultural policy budget Ecu1.6bn (Pounds 1.26m) a year to administer, is one of three - with wine and sugar - that escaped overhaul in the MacSharry reforms of 1992. However, Mr Rene Steichen, the agriculture commissioner, said last week that the fruit and vegetable sector was generally well-tuned to the marketplace. Announcing only modest changes, involving a redirection rather than a reduction in funding, he said: 'If it works, why change it?' Surpluses would be tackled, however. Producers typically destroy 600,000 tonnes of surplus, subsidised fruit and vegetables each year while. In future, these 'withdrawal' subsidies would be set at a 'clearly unprofitable level, well below the present withdrawal price in most cases', said the commission paper. Producer groups would be allowed to top up these subsidies from operating funds, half of which would be provided by the EU and national governments. But they would be able to use only 'a limited and decreasing proportion' of the funds for this purpose. About 1.8m farming families depend on the fruit and vegetable sector, which represents 16 per cent of EU agricultural output. It is particularly important to southern states such as Spain and Italy, accounting for 27 per cent of these countries' agricultural output. Recognising the dependence of some sectors on intervention, Mr Steichen proposed scaling prices down gradually over four years. He suggested financing should be targeted at producer groups to encourage them to expand 'to match increasingly concentrated distribution'. Funding would increase if groups forged cross-border links. Money would also be made available for grubbing-up surplus crops. Mr Steichen rejected the idea of output quotas or area aid payments and said the thrust of policy should be to improve quality and market dynamism. Producer groups could use their operating funds to promote products and encourage environmentally-friendly growing and packing methods. The proposals are expected to be discussed by agriculture ministers in September.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Is there an agreement between the Vatican and the  Jonassaint government for the supply of food aid to Haiti?  Confusion continues regarding the signing of this agreement.    The Vatican denied this information, while the minister of  foreign affairs of the provisional government asserts that this  agreement had been signed with a Vatican representative, and  that the 75 tons of wheat which were promised will arrive in  September. Rothschild Francois filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Francois] There is still confusion  regarding an agreement that was reportedly signed between the  Vatican and the Jonassaint government for a supply of wheat to  Haiti. After the government in Port-au-Prince announced this  information at the beginning of the week, the Vatican  authorities formally denied the news on Tuesday [14 June]. The  Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, asserts that no Haitian  political representative was received in the Holy See.    In Port-au-Prince, the minister of foreign affairs of the  provisional government confirms the signing of this agreement  with a Vatican employee. In an exclusive interview with Radio  Metropole, Charles David specifies that the 75 tons of wheat,  worth U.S. $35 million, would arrive in Port-au-Prince in  September.    Mr. Minister, did you really sign this agreement?    [David] Certainly I signed this agreement. I do not wish to  enter a war of denial which seems to nourish subtleties of  Vatican diplomacy. I agreed to talk to you. I do not intend to  hold a news conference or to send other messages. What I can  tell you is that the wheat is coming. For the rest, serious  people will get to understand the exact reality of things.    [Francois] When is the wheat coming?    [David] The wheat will arrive, according to the terms of the  agreement, beginning on 30 September 1994. I signed this  agreement with a representative of the Vatican state  secretariat. That is all I want to say because I do not intend  to nourish rumors or gossip, especially since one denial leads  to another denial and to counterdenials. In brief, each person  takes pleasure in this kind of tactic. One should not forget  that this country is in crisis. It is the first time I have  spoken. I make it a point to say that. I do not intend to speak  often. I have work to do. I do it.    [Francois] Regarding the relations between the Vatican and  Haiti, it should be noted that on 18 May, apostolic Nuncio  Bishop Baldiceri renewed his support for the resigning  government of Robert Malval.    Questioned on the policy of Judge Jonassaint in diplomatic  matters, the minister of Foreign Affairs told us that he  maintains some contacts abroad. Charles David explained that he  is working for the nation's interests.    [David] I am certainly not idle. Right now, it is true,  there  is the loneliness of the long-distance runner. But at least, let  us be serious. You are right to think that contacts were made. I  do not have to say it aloud. Let me give you an example.    For many years, China was not recognized by the United  States, by the big powers. Contacts were made however. In short,  things moved forward quietly. What we want to say is that we are  trying to build a policy first, to protect the Haitian people  from the invasion, the occupation.    [Francois] Questioned about the Montreal press' criticism of  him, Minister of Foreign Affairs Charles David replied he has  accepted this post because of the threats weighing on Haiti and  specifies that he is above all, Haitian.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Le Xuan Trinh, minister of state in charge of the  the government office, held a news conference at his office on  the afternoon of 23 May to make public the situation regarding  the implementation of various government programs of action  since early this year and to outline the implementation of a  socioeconomic development plan for the last six months of 1994.    According to Minister Le Xuan Trinh, the socioeconomic  situation in our country has since early this year continued to  be stable and developed. Along with the stability and  development momentum generated since 1993, generally, in this  year's winter-spring crop, almost all localities in the entire  country -- except for a number of central provinces where there  were difficulties arising from crop failure -- attained or  exceeded their targets in both area and yield. It is estimated  that the grain ouput in the first half of the year may reach  more than 11 million tons, increasing by 1 million ton over the  same period last year.    Industrially, it is estimated that the gross production  value  in the first six months will attain 48 percent of the annual  target, representing a 11-percent increase over the same period  last year with local industrial ouput value increasing by 10  percent.    A number of essential products such as electricity, coal,  crude oil, steel, cement, electric motors, and the like have  showed an increase with certain items increasing by nearly 20  percent.    A number of key construction projects have been deployed  such  as those designed to improve and upgrade a number of segments of  National Highway 1-A, to start construction of a project to  channel gas onto the shoreline from the sea, and so forth.    Apart from the results obtained, over the past months, many  difficulties and weaknesses in the implementation of the  socioeconomic plan have, however, not been overcome, and the  difficulties arising from budget inbalance are still  particularly serious. Various sources of revenue obtained have  not been able to offset requirements for spending in  development. A number of key construction projects of the state  that have been deployed in the past years continue to have  difficulties in capital. The speed at which a number of  projects have been being built is still slow.    Minister Le Xuan Trinh presented various guiding and  operating measures of the government for the period ahead aimed  at overcoming the aforementioned difficulities to ensure that  the economic growth rate for this year will attain the target  set by the National Assembly in its previous session.    At the news conference, Minister Le Xuan Trinh quoted the  prime minister as hailing the contributions of the press to the  government in its efforts to guide and run various programs of  action in the past and expressing the hope that the mass news  media will continue to support the government's activities in  the period ahead. The mass news media must strive harder to  disseminate information on the deployment and implementation of  Government Resolution #38-CP, which calls for further renovating  various newly promulgated administrative procedures in resolving  works related to citizens and organizations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of  Cambodia, has said that the Khmer Rouge should surrender to the  Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] the regions they control,  dissolve all their armed forces, and join the RGC and the Khmer  Royal Armed Forces through an amendment of the Constitution.  This is a solution. Another is the reorganization of elections.    His Majesty stated this in his 7 May clarification letter.  The king added that the two solutions are just his own  suggestions and that he has not asked the government or the  National Assembly to adopt or implement them.</p>

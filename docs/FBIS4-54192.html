			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Nearly 60 percent of  respondents do not want an early dissolution of the House of  Representatives for a snap general election, according to an  opinion survey released by a major newspaper Thursday [26 May].    The poll, conducted nationwide by the YOMIURI SHIMBUN on  Saturday and Sunday, showed 59 percent of respondents said there  is no need to rush to dissolve the lower house to call a general  election, while 31 percent wanted a lower house dissolution for  a general election immediately after passage of the fiscal 1994  state budget.    Asked which party they will vote for if a general election  is  held, 29 percent said they will vote for the LDP [Liberal  democratic Party], 13 percent cited Shinseito, 8 percent  preferred the Social Democratic Party [SDPJ], 5 percent  supported New Party Sakigake and the Japan New Party [JNP],  while 3 percent said they will vote for Komeito.    The YOMIURI found a moderate recovery in the support rate  for  the LDP, which was 31 percent in June last year, while support  for both the SDPJ and the JNP dropped by about half compared  with figures registered last June.    The respondents were equally divided over the issue of  whether the next general election should be held under the  current multiseat constituency system or the new election system  approved under the package of political reform passed by the  Diet. A new electoral map for single-seat constituencies has  not been drawn up yet.    The survey covered 2,091 people aged 20 and older.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In their (?focal) efforts to destabilize the  tranquillity in the Sudan, the British House of Commons is  holding a meeting today with the so-called Sudanese opposition  groups approved in the rebel factions. The meeting was called  by Christian Solidarity, at their national agency in London,  under the auspices of Baroness Cox. The theme of the meeting is  to unite all Sudanese opposition abroad, with the aim of  overthrowing the legitimate government of the transitional  revolution in the Sudan. The organizers of the meeting have  rejected the participation of neutral Sudanese and Islamic  institutions in the meetings, which are being kept secret. In a  separate development, reliable sources disclosed that a meeting  of rebel factions earlier had taken place in London, under the  patronage of the anti-Islam christian association.</p>

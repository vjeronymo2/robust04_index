			<p>BFN     [Text] Jadranko Prlic is the new deputy premier of the  Federation, and therefore vice president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina government, and defense minister. Here is  what he told our correspondent Ivica Tomica about the tasks  facing the man with three important functions in the Federation  and the government of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna, in an  exclusive interview for Croatian Herzeg-Bosna radio.    [Begin recording] [Tomica] Asked whether the newly appointed  deputy premier of the Federation and defense minister will keep  his post as prime minister of the Croat republic of  Herzeg-Bosna, Prlic said:    [Prlic] There are in fact three positions here. In line with  the constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, the  government has a premier and a deputy premier, so that, speaking  about the Federation's government, I am deputy premier, and,  speaking about the government of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, I am deputy prime minister [podpredsjednik  vlade], and I am consequently defense minister in both cases.    The government of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna and  Herzeg-Bosna itself will continue functioning in the interim  period. There will be many problematic relations and decisions,  but one thing must be understood: Life goes on both through  inertia and through things which have already been initiated.    I would like to say something -- I will say this next week  in  Sarajevo: the Croats have entered the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina with a considerable dowry. They had a  regulated legal system, a regulated system of payment of  soldiers, police force, state administration, health service,  education system, judiciary, and care for the families of the  dead and wounded members of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO].  I am speaking about all these things which have not at all been  regulated on the territories which have until now been under the  control of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is a great  imbalance in that respect. We will -- I will personally --  demand very high standards for the organization of the state  administration and the full implementation of the Federation's  constitution. This is the basis on which I, in my capacity as  deputy premier, will not back down. Consequently, I believe  that all other members of the Government of Croatian nationality  will do the same. I believe that other government members will  support this stance as well.    [Tomica] What will you do as the new defense minister?    [Prlic] At this moment, as defense minister of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I am nominally the defense minister of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. This situation should be solved  because the HVO has its own Defense Ministry and its own system  of logistics, and everything else a military force needs. I  will try to attain gentleman's agreements in that respect, which  will clearly specify all issues. I believe that I should be the  defense minister of a joint command. All the many variations  were set up when the Federation's constitution was signed and  relevant military agreements which followed the signing. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "Nongovernmental </F> Report": "The Majority of Russian Citizens Have No Personal  Savings At All. And, Apparently, They Will Have None"]    [Text] In the spring of 1994 the hopes and  expectations, declarations and promises, disenchantments and  lost illusions will be nine years old.    The ideologists and the ideology of reform have changed.  There is no longer any mention of the initial objective of  restructuring the economic mechanism--the creation of a state  system that stimulates a desire to work, which has no  restrictions on wages and enables people to live better and  better. The people are remembered when there is a real threat of  social upheaval, when the government is taking  spur-of-the-moment measures to quell the rising antagonisms.  That is the way it was and still is in relations with miners,  gas extraction workers, petroleum workers, peasants,  metallurgists, etc. As a result, two levels of socioeconomic  perception have taken form today:    --first, the theorizing, governmental one which, in spite of  and without accounting for the results of voting, sociological  polls, and domestic social and economic prognoses, has relied on  the questionable practice of listening to foreign advisers,  using any means available to construct a model of a  postsocialist society that is unfamiliar to the broad masses;    --second, the nationwide level, oppressed by the nightmare  of  the collapse of the homeland, unbridled inflation, and the  growing squall of poverty and unemployment.    According to the estimate of Andres Ostlund from the  Stockholm School of Economics, who until the middle of January  1994 was an economic adviser to the Russian Government,  inflation in the country during 1993 alone amounted to 850  percent.    The research division of the All-Russian State Company  (TV4R)  during October-November 1993 conducted a mass sociological poll  of the population of the European part of Russia with a  representative sampling involving 1,224 people. Among others,  the respondents were asked questions about monetary savings. As  a result of the poll it became clear that 57.0 percent of the  citizens have no savings, 27.0 percent have money in the Savings  Bank, and they are mainly elderly people, and one can  confidently assume that whatever dealings the majority of them  have with the bank are dealings involving pension accounts.  Commercial banks are used by 3.2 percent of those questioned and  savings are kept in stocks and bonds by about 3.0 percent of the  citizens. About 4.0 percent use the services of savings and  commercial banks at the same time. Thus 84.0 percent of the  population of Russia have no guarantee of social stability. This  is the large proportion of the population that is actively  joining the constantly growing stratum of the so-called  aggressive underclass.    In the opinion of another former adviser to the Russian  Government, Jeffrey Sachs from Harvard University, published by  the newspaper THE NEW YORK TIMES, the failure of the reforms is  explained by the West's slowness in rendering financial aid to  Russia: "Of the 18 billion which the IMF and the World Bank were  to have turned over to Russia, only 2 billion has been  received." In Sachs' opinion this kind of "support" for the  reformers will cost the West dearly. In the opinion of that same  FINANCIAL TIMES, "By saving a kopek but losing a ruble, the  leaders of the West have possibly made the biggest mistake since  Versailles."    On the crest of the so-called Russian nationalism, new  meaning has been given to the idea of reinforcing the NATO bloc.  The tone of statements in the Washington administration has  changed. An administration expert on the former USSR, Strobe  Talbott, stated that Russian leaders should worry more about  unemployment and street crime--whatever is bothering the simple  people most. The administration of the IMF and World Bank assert  that they have always recommended that the Moscow government  develop programs capable of satisfying the "real needs" of the  population.    Former USSR president M. Gorbachev in November 1993 was  speaking in Richmond (the state of Virginia) at an international  forum organized by FORTUNE magazine. Regarding questions of the  crisis situation in the country and the role of the West, he  said "The problem is that the method of conducting economic  reforms was rejected at the level of society.    "The market is needed...but the negative results from it  turned out to be greater than the positive. Production dropped  by 40 percent as compared to 1989. In terms of living conditions  the country was thrown back 20 years, to the beginning of the  seventies.    "What happened to the Western capital? Why is Russia not  suitable for investing capital? We have less risk for investors  than other countries do. The October revolution will not be  repeated and we can solve the other problems along with you. In  terms of business prospects, our country cannot even be compared  with any other.    "You have not resolved the main problem: Are you going to  cooperate with Russia or not? There is a desire to keep Russia  in the role of an appendage for supplying raw material to the  West. We have received from your investors absolutely no  proposals for reorganizing the Russian machine-building  industry. When it comes to petroleum and other raw  material--sure. But not machine building.    "Russia will never agree to play the role of a younger  brother or a junior partner...in this respect it is closed, it  will establish the conditions it needs and, relying on its own  people, its own educated cadres, will prove itself. But the West  will get a hostile armed regime."  <H5>  What Is Happening in the Military-Industrial Complex? </H5>   Events are developing tragically in industry, and above all  in the military-industrial complex. According to data from the  Russian Federation State Statistical Administration, last year  there was a maximum reduction of output in branches that produce  defense products--by more than 30 percent. According to data of  the intelligence administration of the U.S. Defense Department,  the decline of arms production in the Russian Federation  amounted to: for attack helicopters--1990--70 and 1992--five;  for artillery systems--1,990 and 450, respectively; for missiles  with laser warheads--190 and 45; for fighter-bombers--575 and  150; for combat infantry vehicles--3,600 and 1,100; for  submarines--20 and eight; tanks--1,300 and 675; and bombers--35  and 20. (The figures for 1990 were for the USSR and for  1992--for Russia.) Since 1989 the volume of state allocations  for the production of arms and military equipment has decreased  in real terms by 78 percent, and financing for scientific  research and experimental design work has decreased by almost as  much.    In 1993 the client (the state) owed the defense industry  about 300 billion rubles [R] and it had not paid its bills for  1992 to many enterprises. By adopting a policy of state  responsibility, the government is again discrediting itself,  since it does not have a real economic basis for fulfilling the  commitments it has made, and it even has an immense budget  deficit.    As a way out of the situation that has been created it would  be possible to adopt a simplified version of the decision--to  reduce the number of enterprises for whose financing the state  bears responsibility. As a result, privatization could also  affect those enterprises that must remain state enterprises, but  the government will apparently have to "push" them into the  market sphere. This is why the Ministry of Finance has the last  word in the organization of the country's defense capability.  <H5>  Salvaging Weapons and the Capabilities of the Budget </H5>   The deadline for storing certain kinds of weapons will  expire  in the near future--about 70 percent of the overall volume  subject to being salvaged. Several thousand square kilometers of  land have been set aside for warehouses for equipment that is  ready for salvaging. Additionally, in keeping with international  agreements, Russia must eliminate several classes of missiles  and infantry weapons, which make up 30 percent of the volume.    A federal program has been developed for salvaging arms and  military equipment for the period up to the year 2000. The  program is divided into two stages. The first stage  (1993-1995)--the development of documents, the selection of a  strategy and tactics, the introduction of new technologies--will  require R2.4-3.4 trillion in the prices of the third quarter of  1993. This is to be financed from the state budget, foreign aid,  and private investments from within Russia. As for foreign  investments, during the next 1.5 to two years the United States  is promising Russia aid with equipment and technology for a  total of $800 million, and Japan is promising another $100  million. A number of Italian and German firms are expected to  participate. So far, in the words of Nikolay Shumkov, chief of  the main administration for guarantee of supervision and  salvaging of arms of the Russian Committee on the Defense  Industry, R2 billion of Russian origin can be considered real  investments. Taking the budget deficit into account, this will  be another problem in converting Russia's defense complex.  <H5>  Prices in Russia--Higher Than World Prices </H5>   In 1993 (according to data from the Ministry of Economics),  prices of certain kinds of foods that make up the basis of the  subsistence minimum of the population of Russia were equal to  world prices or higher.    In particular, the price of one tonne of sugar in Russia  reached $650, while its price on the world market was $350,  vegetable oil--$1,300 and $660 respectively; beef--$1,900 and  $480 respectively; butter--$1,900 and $1,700; pollack--$700 and  $400; and flour--$280 and $215. In 1994 the prices of these and  certain other products on the domestic market could rise  significantly (up to 1.5-twofold).  <H5>  Who Will Buy the Land </H5>   In the opinion of specialists of the Russian Agency for  Investments and Real Estate, the land market in the Moscow area  has already taken form and the current tendencies in supply and  demand will continue in the future.    Up to this point the buyers have been commercial banks,  which  have acquired the right to own plots of land and now intend to  turn them into private property.    The sellers are entrepreneurial structures, local  administrations, and joint-stock sovkhozes that are experiencing  a critical need for money. Recently there have been so-called  pure firms which were created especially for buying and selling  land. The object of the transactions of the present day are  mainly sections of land of up to 10 hectares. Of the total  demand, 90 percent is for sections for suburban homes. The  buyers are not only the future homeowners but also firms that  intend to build cottages for subsequent sale. Of the plots that  are acquired, 2 percent are intended for entrepreneurial  activity, mainly for construction of gas stations and  campgrounds, and 8 percent of the applications are for garden  plots. In a year and a half not a single plot has been acquired  for organizing any kind of agricultural production.</p>

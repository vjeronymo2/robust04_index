			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AUDIENCE MEMBERS SAY PLAY HITS HOME  </P> <P> It was intermission at a recent performance of "Roleplay," a musical set in a  therapy group, and outside the theater Robert Burke held center stage. In a  gathering of audience members, he was the sole veteran of group therapy. Or at  least he was the only one who would admit it.  </P> <P> Burke, of Long Beach, was asked if the play seemed true to life.  </P> <P> "Yes, in that the people don't have monumental problems," he said. "They have  daily issues. They're adjusting, they're dealing with things."  </P> <P> The play, which runs through July 30 at Group Repertory Theatre in North  Hollywood, depicts five women and their therapist. One character, a single  mother, has difficulty making her son obey. Another is afraid to speak her mind  to her boyfriend. Another is torn between a successful career and the needs of  her family.  </P> <P> "A lot of it reminds me of what I heard in group," Burke said.  </P> <P> That's no surprise, as the play was based in part on a women's group run by  therapist Margaret Paul in West Los Angeles. Paul attended a recent  performance.  </P> <P> "I laughed my head off," she said. "Many of the incidents were right off my  group. It was quite startling to see them."  </P> <P> Another therapist who saw "Roleplay" is Jeri Darling, who practices in Encino  and North Hollywood. She said the work illustrates one of the big advantages of  group therapy.  </P> <P> "Now there is a real need for the kind of support you can get," she said.  "Group seems to be making a comeback. It was hot in the '60s, and in the '70s  individual became more prominent. Groups took a step back. But today we don't  have the extended family around that we can count on. For a lot of people, the  group situation is the only place they can get that kind of support."  </P> <P> Theater exaggerates, of course, and in "Roleplay" the group goes so far as to  help organize a showcase for a member who wants to make a comeback as a singer.  One woman arranges catering. Another handles decorations. Another rounds up  audience members.  </P> <P> "I sat there and wished I'd had that kind of support," Burke said.  </P> <P> The therapist in "Roleplay" drew mixed responses. Burke admired her and found  it realistic that she drew truths from her clients. But therapist Paul thought  otherwise.  </P> <P> "She was cold and she was controlling," Paul said, "and to me that does not  make for good group. She did not role model a centered human being. Clients  have to see that to grow and flourish."  </P> <P> Jackie Benster, a veteran of group, said she liked the fact that the characters  changed slowly.  </P> <P> "In group you notice that the same issues come up over and over in different  garb," she said.  </P> <P> Eager for audiences, "Roleplay" authors Doug Haverty and Adryan Russ sent a  mailing to 50 therapists. Haverty said the mailing has drawn therapists and  their clients.  </P> <P> Clearly something is working. "Roleplay" has been extended twice at Group  Repertory. Performances are Saturdays and Sundays at 5 p.m. "Toward  Perestroika!" plays at the traditional 8:30 time.  </P></p>

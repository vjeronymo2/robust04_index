			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / US to improve ties with Vietnam President George Bush yesterday said in a letter to Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh that Washington would take action to improve relations with Hanoi, Reuter reports from Hanoi. US Senator John Kerry said the promise was in response to a big increase in Vietnamese co-operation in recent months to help resolve the fate of US servicemen missing from the Vietnam war. Mr Kerry was speaking at the end of a three-day visit. He did not say whether Washington might ease or lift the trade embargo it imposed in 1964 or move towards opening diplomatic relations with Vietnam. The letter was the first direct communication by a US president to a Vietnamese leader since 1973, when then President Richard Nixon ended the US combat role in Vietnam.</p>

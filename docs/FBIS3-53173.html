The  Rabin government has asserted that negotiations on the  Palestinian-Israeli track could last two months. The  Palestinian side, however, does not think there is any need for  the negotiations to last more than three weeks.    Apparently, Israel does not plan to reach an agreement with  the PLO anytime soon. This is driving it to obstruct the  negotiations. Israel has repeatedly said that it will not  relinquish sovereignty over the crossings and the bridges and  will not abandon direct supervision of Jewish settlements in the  self-rule region, nor will it change its position on the size of  Jericho. In brief, Israel has already started to create  problems and concentrate on disputed issues.    It could be that Israel wants to paralyze its negotiations  with the PLO to see the outcome of the al-Asad-Clinton summit  and the situation on the Syrian-Israeli track and how this is  going to affect the peace process on all tracks. Israel is thus  capitalizing on the weak coordination between the Arab cordon  states and the suspension of negotiations on some tracks.    Since the Madrid conference, the Rabin government has been  seeking to divide the peace process and conclude separate peace  treaties with certain Arab parties. This government will  continue to exploit the weak coordination between the Arab  cordon states and the weakness of their negotiating cards.    The Arab cordon states should therefore take note of the  intentions of the Rabin government and enhance and deepen their  coordination to restore credibility. The Rabin government has  worked hard to sow distrust among the Arab parties.    It is worth mentioning that Nabil Sha'th, head of the  Palestinian negotiating team, has denied Israeli claims that  Jordan objects to Palestinian supervision of the crossings.    It is important that the Arab cordon states should be  vigilant and alert to Israeli attempts to destroy Arab  coordination and conclude separate agreements that will prove  unacceptable to future Arab generations.</p>

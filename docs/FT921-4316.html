			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties fail to burst through 40% barrier - Public Opinion IN THE week the election is likely to be called the two main parties are neck and neck in the public's estimation, according to the FT's poll of polls. After a week in which Labour believes it has neutralised the prospect of any tax cuts with accusations of Tory economic imprudence, the compilation suggests it may still take today's Budget to break the poll deadlock. The latest weighted average, which takes account of the differing sample sizes of the seven polls covered, puts Labour almost exactly level with the Tories - with both parties on about 38.6 per cent, while the Liberal Democrats are just below 18 per cent. If this were translated into parliamentary seats, the Tories would still be the largest single party, with 311 MPs. They would still be short of the 326 needed for an overall majority, but would be clearly ahead of Labour, on 296. The Liberal Democrats would have 19 seats. While support for the Tories is almost precisely where it was in last week's compilation of opinion polls, the Labour party's showing has slipped from just over 39 per cent. The Liberal Democrats have recorded a further slight increase. At present the Liberal Democrats have 22 MPs, while Labour has 230 and the Tories 367.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                            Recent meetings between PLO leaders and a delegation of  mainstream Palestinians demanding reform of Yasir 'Arafat's  autocratic leadership appear to have achieved little to resolve  the growing internal Palestinian dispute over PLO decisionmaking.  'Arafat's evident unwillingness to heed the reformer's demands is  likely to exacerbate dissent among mainstream Palestinains,  irrespective of the course of negotiations with Israel.                        END SUMMARY     PLO leaders and a delegation of seven Palestinians led by the  prominent Gazan Haydar 'Abd-al-Shaf i met in Tunis in early  January following growing public Palestinian criticism of PLO  chairman Yasir 'Arafat's leadership.  In November, more than 100  prominent Palestinians in the Occupied Territories and Jordan  reportedly signed a memorandum demanding reform in the PLO.  According to the Amman daily Jordan Times, the signers reaffirmed  their recognition of the PLO as the representative of the  Palestinian people but said that they "are not satisfied with the  working method of political leadership at this stage," with  regard either to "running the difficult and sensitive  negotiations with the Israeli side" or to "preparing for . .  national development in the transition stage" envisaged for the  territories under the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles [DOP]  (21 December).     While media accounts of the reformers' demands have differed on  details, the demands clearly include measures to make the PLO  leadership more accountable, assure creation of democratic  institutions in the proposed autonomous Palestinian entity, and  ensure that professional competence will be the primary criterion  for choosing Palestinian officials in the autonomy regime (see  box).  According to the French news agency AFP, 'Abd-al-Shafi  said that the objective of the reformers is "to broaden the  decisionmaking structure so that it does not stay entirely in  Abu-'Ammar's ['Arafat's] hands" and to establish a "collective  leadership" (3 January).     Meager Results, Continued Criticism     Judging from comments by 'Abd-al-Shafi and others, the Tunis  meetings did little to further reformers' goals.  Speaking to  journalists in Amman on 8 January, 'Abd-al-Shafi proclaimed the  meetings a success, but his awkward and contradictory language  suggested an effort to paper over unresolved differences.  As  quoted in the Jordan Times on the 9th, he said that the PLO  leadership's response to his delegation was "not rejectionist to  our calls for democratic reforms but not actively supportive."  In the same interview, he said that PLO leaders acknowledged "the  importance of democratizing the structure of the PLO and of  adopting democracy in our political life as a whole" and  "endorsed" the statement presented by his delegation, but he also  said "not all demands were accepted."  'Abd-al-Shafi confirmed  that the PLO had accepted one demand, authorizing him to initiate  a "popular dialogue" among all Palestinian factions, including  those opposed to the DOP.  Nonetheless, he clearly implied a lack  of agreement on calls for institutional reform within the PLO,  saying on the one hand that "expanding the decisionmaking body  and collective leadership cannot be done at this stage" but  adding on the other hand that "it is unacceptable that Abu-'Ammar  ['Arafat] alone makes the decisions."  According to the report,  he also insisted that Palestinian elections be carried out as  scheduled next summer.     Other remarks attributed to 'Abd-al-Shafi immediately after the  Tunis meetings left no doubt that he was dissatisfied with the  outcome.  On 7 January, the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al-  Awsat quoted him as criticizing both 'Arafat and the PLO  Executive Committee, saying that "'Arafat is still monopolizing  the decisionmaking" and that Executive Committee members "are  making it easy for him to continue to do so by accepting that he  is the decisionmaker."  According to the paper, 'Abd-al-Shaf i  warned that if 'Arafat did not accept reformers' demands, they  would seek recourse to "the PLO's legitimate institutions,"  possibly a reference to the Palestine Central Council or the  Palestine National Council, and "after that we would seek the  verdict of the masses."     Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to  bilateral Middle East peace talks until her recent resignation-  -apparently out of frustration with 'Arafat's autocratic  leadership--from all formal PLO activity, stepped up her own  criticism of the PLO leader in a recent interview.  Indicating  her disenchantment with the PLO leadership and in particular  resentment over the limited role of residents of the territories  as Palestinians prepare for autonomy, she said that Palestinians  currently "have a leadership that has not lived in its own  country, with its own people, with a system of accountability, of  control, and critical commentary for a long time."  As  Palestinians undergo the transition to self-rule, she said, "we  must ensure that the new government respects citizens' rights and  is truly democratic," adding that Palestinians must not emulate  "many Third World countries wherein a monolithic authority puts  itself, not the people, at the center."  Ashrawi avoided a direct  answer when asked explicitly whether 'Arafat exercised too much  power, but made her opinion clear by saying that "the PLO  leadership should be more open and more democratic" and that "the  old decisionmaking process is no longer valid."  It "remains to  be seen," she added pointedly, "whether the PLO is capable of  effecting this change."  Asked directly whether PLO leaders in  Tunis or Palestinians from the territories should occupy key  position in the autonomy regime, Ashrawi replied "there should be  a good mix" and "the people who have lived permanently in a  coherent Palestinian society should get an effective say" (Vienna  Der Standard, 10 January).     Dissent within PLO's Leadership .     Notwithstanding 'Abd-al-Shafi's complaints about the PLO  Executive Committee's inaction, several of its members have also  reportedly voiced objections to 'Arafat's leadership.  The London  daily Al-Hayah cited Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah as  saying that he, along with prominent Executive Committee members  Mahmud 'Abbas, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, and Sulayman al-Najjab had sent  a memorandum of their own to 'Arafat calling for more democratic  decisionmaking and had only recently resumed attending committee  meetings following a "period of seclusion" (8 January).     And Grumbling in the Ranks     In addition to facing increased criticism from prominent  mainstream Palestinians in the territories, the PLO leadership  also appears to be encountering protests from some of its own  cadres in the territories.  Some of these less prominent  individuals, who see themselves as having borne the primary  burden of sustaining the Palestinian uprising, evidently fear a  loss of status if the PLO makes the transition from a  revolutionary organization to a more conventional political  establishment and in particular resent the possible rise at their  expense of mainstream Palestinians both in the PLO and the  territories whom they perceive as lacking militant credentials.  For example, Israel's Qol Yisra'el radio broadcast a statement by  Husayn al-Nazir, identified as one of three Fatah officials from  the area of Hebron who recently resigned their Fatah posts,  attributing his resignation to the "deteriorating internal  situation in Fatah institutions in the past few months,"  specifically the "absence of a democratic policy" and the  existence of "bad personalities who hold sensitive posts inside  Fatah."  Alluding to fears that the PLO leadership in Tunis might  use the proposed Palestinian police force to impose its will on  PLO cadres in the territories, al-Nazir cited unnamed individuals  charged with "forming a security apparatus" and warned that  "entrusting a bad personality with running this apparatus will  practically destroy Fatah's internal structure."  While  professing loyalty to 'Arafat, Al-Nazir complained that 'Arafat  is "surrounded by a group of personalities who do not brief him  on the true reports sent from the territories" and blamed such  people for "the rise of traditional personalities who are outside  the organization and . . . away from the suffering of the  strugglers" who "were always in the confrontation lines" (6  January).     PLO Lip Service     The PLO's own account of the Tunis meetings strongly suggests a  strategy of paying lip service to the reformers' demands while  resisting any measures that would effectively reduce the PLO's  domination of Palestinian decisionmaking.  In its newscast on 7  January, the PLO radio Voice of Palestine (VOP) in Algiers  reported a press conference by 'Abd-al-Shafi on the 6th, giving  no hint of any tension or disagreement between the delegation and  the PLO leadership. (See Note 1)  While saying that the meetings  were held to discuss "proposals . . . to entrench the democratic  conception and consolidate the unity of our people on the basis  of political plurality and democratic practices," the report  portrayed 'Abd-al-Shaf i as indicating that agreement had been  achieved on how to proceed toward these ends.     (Note 1) Al-Hayah reported that 'Abd-al-Shafi's press conference  included critical remarks (8 January).     In the same broadcast, VOP carried the text of a statement by the  PLO Executive Committee that purported to welcome the reformers'  demands but conveyed a veiled warning to mainstream Palestinian  dissenters not to cause trouble.  The statement affirmed the  Executive Committee's commitment to "the principles of democratic  dialogue, political plurality, the respect of views, and the  practice of democracy."  It also stressed, however, "the  importance of consolidating our national unity" and called for  "more cohesion and unity. . . . in order to realize the  establishment of a patriotic Palestinian authority to complete  the Israeli withdrawal [from Gaza and Jericho] as a first step  along the path of retrieving the inalienable national rights of  our Palestinian people."  Alluding to the delegation, the  Executive Committee welcomed "the efforts made by some brethren  with a view to strengthening national unity and reinforcing the  bases of the democratic process" but characterized such efforts  as proof of "the health and vitality of the Palestinian arena and  our people's determination to rally around the Palestine  Liberation Organization."  The statement pointedly asserted that  "this is the time for unity and not for disunion" and "the time  for solidarity that is based on common denominators and not on  elements of division."     Implications     Although most mainstream Palestinians support or at least  acquiesce in the PLO's move toward a negotiated settlement with  Israel, growing disaffection among mainstream Palestinians,  rather than the often more publicized opposition of Palestinian  rejectionists, constitutes the greater long term challenge to  Yasir 'Arafat's and the PLO's primacy in the Palestinian  movement.  Tensions between the PLO leadership and mainstream  critics--primarily from within the Occupied Territories--are  likely to continue regardless of how successfully the PLO  conducts negotiations with Israel.  Progress toward establishment  of a Palestinian autonomy regime could well bring further into  the open a thus far semi-veiled struggle for influence among  various mainstream Palestinian elements, while deadlocked  negotiations and continued disarray in the territories would  heighten the perception among many Palestinians that the PLO  leadership is incapable of defending their interests.     An escalation of disputes among mainstream Palestinians could  ultimately weaken the PLO leadership's ability to deal with the  complex pressures arising from the current negotiations,  especially if protracted difficulties continue.  'Arafat is  undoubtedly aware of mounting criticism of his leadership and  probably has recognized the need for tactical concessions to his  critics.  Thus far, however, there is little indication that he  has any intention of abandoning his tight control over  fundamental decisionmaking, thus leaving open the possibility of  a major collision with reform-minded dissidents.     Box 1     Palestinian Delegation's Demands     According to AFP on 4 January, the list of demands presented to  the PLO leadership by 'Abd-al-Shaf i's delegation included the  following:     --Creation of specialized councils to pursue national action on  Palestinian autonomy and also with the Arab and international  worlds.     --Calling on qualified people and experts to form councils and  the planning and executive structures that depend on them.     --Giving priority to professional and political competence in  forming working groups and negotiating committees and teams  instead of favoritism and clan loyalties.     --Working out a plan of negotiation based on the text of the  [Israel-PLO] Declaration of Principles and ensuring  complementarity and coordination among the various commissions  and negotiating groups.     --Forming a supreme authority for guiding, directing and  following up the negotiations process.     --Forming a Palestinian Development and Reconstruction Council  based on specific criteria so that it should be credible in the  eyes of [the Palestinian] people and the donors of funds for  building and national economic infrastructure.     --Finalizing the work of the [PLO] legislative committee charged  with drawing up the basic law--constitution--of the national  Palestinian authority in a way that brings out its democratic  nature.     --Creating as soon as possible a supreme committee to organize a  wide national dialogue grouping all Palestinian tendencies.     --Creating a high consultative committee of experts with a  parallel status to that of the PLO Executive Committee, which has  already been weakened by the departure of several of its members.     Box 2     The Palestinian Constitution--All Power to 'Arafat?     Mainstream critics of Yasir 'Arafat may have had their concerns  heightened by the publication in the Jordanian daily Al-Ra'y on  26 December of a reported draft text of the constitution for the  proposed Palestinian interim authority in the Occupied  Territories.  As reported by Al-Ra'y, the constitution clearly  concentrates effective power in the hands of the PLO in general  and 'Arafat in particular.     The draft establishes that the chairman of the PLO Executive  Committee, that is, 'Arafat, will be president of the "national  authority government" and will "exercise his prerogatives as  given to him in the PLO bylaws and the decisions of the Palestine  National Council, Central Council, and Executive Committee" as  well as specified by the constitution itself.  Among other powers  listed in the draft, the president is to be "the supreme  commander of the Palestinian security forces, which will take  orders from him."  The draft specifies that the president may  serve two six-year terms of office (AFP reported on 8 January  that the presidential term was set at five years).  It does not,  however, mention presidential elections.  In addition, the  president is empowered to appoint his own vice-president.     The draft also outlines the structure and function of the rest of  the national authority government, specifying that it will be  "appointed by the Executive Committee and will be responsible to  it."  The draft devotes only one short paragraph to legislative  authority, establishing that all legislative power will be  exercised by the national authority government "until the  legislative council is elected," but omitting any mention of the  powers of the prospective legislative council.

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Germany leads continued slide in European prices In the wake of Friday's slide, Europe's bond markets continued to tumble yesterday, led by heavy selling in the German government bond market. Although US markets were closed for a holiday, traders reported continued selling by US hedge funds, albeit at a less frantic pace than last week. Bond traders today will keenly await US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, weighing his words for hints of further tightening. 'Everyone is petrified of another tightening,' said Graham McDevitt, bond strategist with market analysts IDEA. The slide in European bonds began earlier this month when the Fed surprised markets with a small rise in rates and bonds have not regained their poise in spite of last week's round of European rate cuts. While many observers agree that most European bond markets are now heavily oversold, investors remain side-lined, awaiting buying opportunities at even lower levels. 'Markets are so volatile, it would be prudent to let the air clear before getting back in,' said Mr Richard Woodworth, head of economic and bond research at Merrill Lynch, 'I would not recommend testing the waters at this time.' However, others said the market recovery, when it comes, could be so fast that buyers might miss the boat. 'When the market does turn around, it'll be an extremely powerful rebound,' said Mr Karl Haeling, head of Deutsche Bank's futures and options group. After weakening steadily throughout the morning, bunds were were knocked sharply lower in the afternoon when Germany's engineering union IG Metall said it had called a strike vote from March 1 - 3 in the northern state of Lower Saxony. If approved, a strike could begin on March 7, and could spread to other parts of northern Germany, the union warned. Fears of another bad M3 money supply number also put pressure on bunds, with talk of a January rate of between 7 and 10 per cent - well above the Bundesbank's target range - rattling the market. German January M3 and February inflation data should be released this week. 'We are having a bear panic - there are still a lot of sellers with long positions left from last year's rally, and I see no one who is willing to buy,' said a senior futures dealer in Frankfurt. 'It's purely psychological and has very little to do with fundamentals,' he added. The March bund futures contract closed at 97.49, down 0.69 points on the day but off its 97.21 intra-day low. French government bonds also fell sharply, dragged lower by bunds but also pressured by disappointment that the Bank of France left interest rates unchanged at its latest repo operation. Traders now are pinning their hopes on Thursday's repo, which is also the day the French central bank's policy-making council meets. But given that the Bundesbank left its key repo rate unchanged last week, some say there is little chance of a French rate cut. The March notional bond futures contract on Matif fell 0.64 points to 127.52. Gilts followed the rest of Europe lower, with the long gilt future dropping by 1 3/32 points to 114 1/2 , up from its low of 114. Despite widespread nervousness, most participants appeared confident that tomorrow's auction of 7 per cent gilts due 2001 will go relatively smoothly. 'Its saving grace is that it's only Pounds 2.5bn and it's partly-paid,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. See Lex</p>

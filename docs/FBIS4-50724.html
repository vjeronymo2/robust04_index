			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Hangzhou, May 13 (CNA) -- The relatives of the  Taiwan victims killed in the March 31 Qiandao Lake disaster  Friday [13 May] expressed their dissatisfaction with Mainland  China's investigation of the incident.    The relatives, who on Thursday ended their visit to Qiandao  Lake with a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) delegation led by  deputy secretary-general Hsu Hui-you, said in a joint statement  that the trip "hasn't increased their understanding of the  truth" behind the tragedy, in which 24 Taiwan tourists and eight  mainland crew and guides were burned to death in the lower deck  cabin of the tour boat they had been cruising on.    "On the contrary, it did increase our doubts of the result  of  investigation," they said.    Four mainlanders were arrested for robbing and murdering the  tourists. The incident provoked a storm of protest in Taiwan  and led to a boycott organized by local travel agents of tour  groups to the mainland.    The SEF delegation, which also included criminal  investigators, visited Qiandao Lake and were able to inspect the  boat on which the victims perished. In a meeting with mainland  police Friday morning in Hanzhou, however, the group raised 50  questions pertaining to the incident, all of which went  unanswered.    Taiwan has accused the mainland of attempting to cover up  the  incident, and has demanded that it clear up remaining questions,  such as the kind and number of weapons used by the killers, the  time of the killing, and whether mainland police set fire to the  boat a second time to destroy evidence of the crime.    Meanwhile in Taipei, vice chairman Kao Koong-lien of the  Mainland Affairs Council said that the SEF delegation will  publish the results of its investigative trip prior to its  departure for home Saturday.    He called on local travel agents to continue the tour group  boycott until mainland authorities make known all the facts of  the case.</p>

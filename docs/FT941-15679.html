			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: GUS overhang A large stock overhang in Great Universal Stores saw the shares marked sharply down at the opening of business yesterday. But they later recovered as Smith New Court, the UK securities house, apparently cleared its position in the stock, which had been taken aboard from a large institutional seller. The drama started on Tuesday when Smith New Court took delivery of 13m GUS shares. Just under half were placed on Tuesday at 610p, then a mere 3 per cent discount to the market price. However, the remaining 8m or so shares remained unsold overnight, and rival marketmakers were quick to mark the shares down as soon as London opened yesterday morning. In late trading it appeared that Smith finally got the majority of the stock away as a block of 6m was sold at 590p, a move which will have sharply reduced the broker's profits on the deal. GUS shares closed 27 1/2 down at 592 1/2 p. BP's move to close its Baglan Bay ethylene plant in South Wales and take a Pounds 200m exceptional charge in its fourth-quarter results to encompass a Europe-wide restructuring came as no great surprise to the market. Nevertheless, the news helped the company's shares outperform most of the FT-SE 100 stocks and other big international oil issues. The BP share price raced up to 373p at the outset as a technical short position was hurriedly filled in. But subsequent weakness across European equity markets and an early fall on Wall Street saw the appearance of profit-takers and BP ended a net 3 off at 362 1/2 p. A Europe-wide retreat by leading electronic stocks impacted heavily on GEC, the UK's flagship electronics group. The slide was prompted by a profits warning from Alcatel, of France. The Alcatel revelations triggered a 9 per cent fall in Alcatel shares in Paris and also affected Siemens, the German electricals/electronics giant, which fell about 2 per cent in Frankfurt. GEC dipped 6 to 328 1/2 p amid hectic trading which saw 9.1m shares dealt. Optimism from David S. Smith, the paper manufacturer, lifted the sector. Although the group reported a 10 per cent decline in first-half profits to Pounds 13.7m, it said the UK economy was picking up, while continental Europe's slide seemed to be over. The results coincided with positive comments from Arjo Wiggins Appleton on European pricing. Arjo rose 7 to 263p, David S. Smith 18 to 456p and Bowater 13 to 477p. The market became increasingly enthusiastic about the Securicor group of companies ahead of preliminary figures due this morning. Securicor 'A' added 9 at 910p and Security Services 13 at 780p. Talk of a share placing at well below the market price hit Vodafone, which fell 20 to 591p. Advertising group Gold Greenlees Trott jumped 14 to 244p on takeover speculation. Food retailers were firm, with SG Warburg said to be positive on selected stocks. Tesco put on 6 at 235 1/2 p. Results from First Leisure received a warm welcome from analysts, although a lack of buying saw the shares drift 4 lower to 291p. Smith New Court was considering moving its 'hold' stance to 'buy', while NatWest Securities upgraded to 'outperform'. More management changes at Ladbroke kept the positive news flow rolling and the shares gained 3 1/2 at 201 1/2 p. Good results from Remy Cointreau helped Highland Distilleries, in which it has a cross-holding and marketing agreement, climb 14 to 373p. TI Group gave up 13 to 438p after Credit Lyonnais Laing turned seller, having been a strong buyer recently. Turnover in British Steel rose to 14.7m, making it the day's most actively traded stock. After a cautious press interview with the chairman, the shares shed 3 to 123p. Shanks &amp; McEwan fell 17 to 97p after the waste management group warned of lower profits and said Mr Roger Hewitt, its chief executive, was leaving over a policy row. Smith New Court cut its forecast for the year to March by Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 8m but strengthened its recommendation, saying the management change was a step in the right direction.</p>

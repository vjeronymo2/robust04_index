			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 17 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-QADISIYAH  maintains that the game of deception and farces spearheaded by  the U.S. Administration to exterminate nations through killing,  starvation, and humiliation -- means that have brought about the  subjugation of the international bodies that are supposed to  uphold law, values, and norms -- must be halted.    In an article today, the paper adds: The world community has  realized that the malicious colonialist tactics are part of an  endless game, and that the only thing that can stop this game is  the determination of peoples who choose their own way to ensure  their own survival -- not just their physical survival, but the  survival that epitomizes loftiness, dignity, and continued  defiance.    The paper notes Iraq's declared position on the need to halt  the farces being led by the U.S. Administration to exterminate  peoples, saying that international organizations must halt their  evil approach, shoulder their responsibilities humanely, and  refrain from submission. These organizations, the paper adds,  must honor the actual texts that grant peoples the right to live  in peace and dignity, and safeguard their sovereignty. These  texts also stipulate that peoples' investments and rights must  be guaranteed so that their future generations may survive and  lead a free and decent life.    The paper adds: Given these ethical and reasonable tenets  agreed on by world peoples and enshrined in international laws  and rules of conduct, the UN Security Council [UNSC] and the  United Nations do not have any excuse for the perpetuation of  the embargo against Iraq, particularly since Iraq has  underscored its commitment to these laws. The UNSC does not  have any excuse for bending and yielding before the U.S. whip.    AL-QADISIYAH goes on to say: The unfair embargo resolution,  the epitome of falsehood and deception that flouts man's  dignity, is no longer acceptable to conscientious people.    The paper concludes by saying that the statements made by  His  Excellency President Saddam Husayn regarding the pursuit of a  new approach to ensure our own salvation as we deem fit reflect  the only option we have left. This option is the option of  faith that will lead to victory, the paper maintains.</p>

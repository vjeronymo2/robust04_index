			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just heard that the first session of the  National Assembly will only take place next Monday [9 May] in  Cape Town and not, as initially planned, on the 6 May. The  Transitional Executive Council's management committee has  decided that the first meeting of the provincial legislature  will be held on Saturday, 7 May, at various meeting points.  This decision by the management committee was taken on the  basis of information received by the Independent Electoral  Commission. The change of date will not affect the inauguration  ceremony for the state president at the Union Buildings in  Pretoria on Tuesday, 10 May.</p>

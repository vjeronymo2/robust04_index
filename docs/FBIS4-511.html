			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M Merten] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 10 SAPA -- Five hundred and fifty  two people died in politically related violence during March,  reversing a seven month-long downward trend, the latest Human  Rights Commission [HRC] report said on Sunday [10 April]. It  was more double the 245 deaths recorded in February and also the  fourth highest monthly death rate since the HRC began monitoring  politically related violence in 1990.    The HRC recorded 640 incidents of political violence,  compared with February's figure of 361. Nearly half of this  year's total of 1,529 incidents took place in March.    The death toll in Natal in March increased by 73 percent to  311 deaths compared to February. This was "the most concerning  element of this months' figure as it is the only region in which  high levels of ongoing violence are occuring", the report said.    The HRC recorded 4,139 deaths since the election date was  announced in July 1993 and 13,464 deaths since July 1990.    The number of injuries has increased more than three times  from 302 in February to 1,053 in March.    The 643 political arrests were made in March. This was the  highest number of arrests during the past 18 months, excluding  August 1993. The figure was inflated by the arrest of 405  prison warders taking part in an illegal gathering, the report  said.    The Bophuthatswana uprising, the Zulu royalist march through  Johannesburg on March 28 and prisoners' protests contributed to  the high figures, according to the report.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DREAM STREET' UP THEIR ALLEY  </P> <P> The show's production office is atop an aging seven-story building housing such  other enterprises as the Hoboken Health Club, Choices in Cardiology and Cogent  Information Systems, Inc.  </P> <P> Welcome to headquarters for the makers of NBC's "Dream Street," a coming  dramatic series about the lives of young blue-collar men and women in this  venerable, hard-nosed waterfront town of 42,500, right across the Hudson River  from Manhattan.  </P> <P> The show's executive producers, Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, created  ABC's Emmy Award-winning "thirtysomething," which inspects the travails of the  upwardly mobile Cuisinart generation each week.  </P> <P> Their association with "Street" has caused some speculation that the new  one-hour series, which is being filmed entirely in Hoboken, is but the  working-class edition of ABC's venture.  </P> <P> Such talk ticks off Mark Rosner, who created and is producing "Dream Street,"  which will premiere at an as yet unspecified date this spring. Six episodes  have been ordered thus far.  </P> <P> "The NBC people say stuff like 'thirtysomething' and I really hate that," said  Rosner, a short, intense native of suburban Valley Stream, N.Y., who was head  writer and co-producer of NBC's "Crime Story."  </P> <P> "I try to discourage them because it's unfair" to both shows, he added.  </P> <P> The series stars relative unknowns: Dale Midkiff and Peter Frechette as  brothers and Thomas Calabro as Midkiff's best friend, who works for a local  mobster doing "errands."  </P> <P> Rosner is a USC film school graduate whose friendship with executive producer  Zwick goes back to their student days together at the American Film Institute.  The genesis of the show, he said, "is that NBC wanted to do something young,  blue-collar and sexy. That was how it was related to me. And the catch phrases  of '501 jeans' and 'Bruce Springsteen' were bandied about."  </P> <P> A major difference between "thirtysomething" and "Dream Street," he submits, is  that in his show, "because the characters are younger and because the  neighborhood is much rougher, everyday life has many highs and lows. There are  more life-and-death issues."  </P> <P> That was the case in the '50s classic "On the Waterfront," which also was  filmed in Hoboken -- once a gritty, ugly industrial and shipping town that  later went into a period of decay.  </P> <P> Ironically, Hoboken now is enjoying a revival of sorts, yuppyized to some  degree by the "thirtysomething" crowd lured away from Manhattan by lower rents,  old tenement buildings ripe for renovation and things like country kitchens.  The City is only a five-minute train ride away.  </P> <P> But more than enough of the old Hoboken remains to provide the working-class  look for "Dream Street," which has only two standing sets -- a warehouse and a  bar. It films its home and apartment scenes inside the homes and apartments of  local residents.  </P> <P> Unlike Los Angeles, where location filming is so common that some citizens  would like to see it made a felony, the reaction of Hobokeners to "Street" on  their streets seems to be mild puzzlement.  </P> <P> "Nobody quite knows who we are yet," said co-producer Brooke Kennedy, a New  Yorker with a good Irish laugh. She previously worked in Miami for a year as  production manager on "Miami Vice."  </P> <P> "They're not quite sure if we're just another film that came in," she said.  "Nobody quite understands that we're theirs, just like 'Vice' was Miami's."  </P> <P> The proximity of Manhattan has allowed producer Rosner to cast the show from a  large and ready-to-work pool of New York stage actors, as does CBS' New  York-based "The Equalizer."  </P> <P> Although not all still call New York home, most of the 12 regulars in "Dream  Street" either got their start on the New York stage or have done time there.  </P> <P> "It's like having a gun with 12 cylinders," Rosner said. "Anyone I go to can  carry the weight."  </P> <P> His troupe is distinctive in several respects.  </P> <P> Two players -- Charles Brown and Debra Mooney -- were in Pulitzer Prize-winning  plays in New York, Brown in "A Soldier's Play" and "Fences," and Mooney  opposite Judd Hirsch in "Tally's Folly."  </P> <P> And Brown and Frechette currently are working two jobs -- on Broadway by night,  in Hoboken by day. Brown is in Neil Simon's hit "Rumors" and Frechette is in  "Eastern Standard."  </P> <P> Brown, who plays a warehouse foreman and friend of Frechette's father in "Dream  Street," hasn't worked much in television. He said he's been fortunate --  "knock on wood" -- to find regular work in theater.  </P> <P> "This is almost a whole new ballgame, and I'm finding that out rapidly," he  said on a recent chilly morning.  </P> <P> "I'm used to playing (before) 1,200 people a night, and the first thing I keep  finding I have to do here is curtail my projection, to pull it back and let the  camera do it for me."  </P> <P> He stood near a space burner, trying to warm himself, inside an old, very cold,  concrete-floor warehouse filled with fan belts, copper tubing, dust-covered  generator engines and a crew assembled to film a tense scene with him and  actors Frechette and Midkiff.  </P> <P> It truly is glamorous, this TV business, laughed Frechette, who plays the  oldest brother in a working-class family, his character a perpetual loser  always seeking the easy dollar.  </P> <P> The actor, whose stage credits range from Chekhov to a recent off-Broadway  revival of the musical "Flora, the Red Menance," calls Los Angeles home now. He  moved there in 1981 from New York when he landed a lead role in the film sequel  to "Grease."  </P> <P> Now he sublets a New York apartment.  </P> <P> Mooney, who plays Frechette's mother, calls the series akin to "three dreams  come true -- because you have good people, good scripts and it's here."  </P> <P> Like many actors who began here, Mooney once went West. Unlike many such  actors, she did not stay there and amuse herself by denouncing Hollywood and  generally being what they call a patriotic New Yorker.  </P> <P> No, she sublet her Los Angeles apartment and moved back to New York in 1979 for  Neil Simon's "Chapter Two" on Broadway. She later was in the female version of  his "The Odd Couple" that co-starred Sally Struthers.  </P> <P> "I haven't been tempted to move back," she said in a phone interview. But she  won't take a New York stage job while working "Dream Street."  </P> <P> "I have forsaken the poor old theater for this," Mooney mock-sighed. "I didn't  want to get so overburdened that I thought I couldn't do justice to either  thing."  </P> <P> Consider, now, how the fates have treated Jo Anderson, a young actress cast as  a divorced single mother, a teacher who proves sweet on Frechette's younger  brother in "Dream Street.  </P> <P> Anderson, who studied in New York at the Actors Studio and with Tony  Award-winning actor Michael Moriarty, actually lived in Hoboken for five years.  </P> <P> "But I went out to California two years ago because I was not getting any work  that could pay me enough to live on," she said. "I was tiring of the  starving-artist gig."  </P> <P> When she auditioned for "Dream Street" last year, she said, the producers said  the show would be filmed in Hoboken. "I said, 'Oh, man, I hope I get this job.'  "  </P> <P> So now, although it won't be permanent, she is living in a hamlet settled by  the Dutch early in the 17th Century and known to them by the Indian name of  Hobocan Hackingh, meaning "land of the tobacco pipe."  </P> <P> The place is now called Hoboken.  </P></p>

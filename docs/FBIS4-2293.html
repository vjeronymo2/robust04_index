			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan on  Thursday [7 April] harshly denounced the Beijing regime for its  handling of the incident in which 24 Taiwan tourists were killed  on board a cruise boat in the central China province of Zhejiang  last Thursday.    "We felt shock upon learning the news (about the incident)  on  April 2," Lien said. "Since then, we've asked relevant  government agencies, through the Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF), to get help from the Mainland authorities."    All efforts by Taiwan to get information concerning the  incident have been met with no response by Beijing, and every  reasonable demand has been categorically rejected, Lien said  after hearing a report by Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the  Mainland Affairs Council.    "The treatment of the incident by the Chinese communists,"  Lien stressed, "is an indication of the Beijing regime's nature  -- its ignorance of basic human rights and its acting with utter  disregard for human life."    Lien's condemnation was the harshest ever by a ranking  government official on the mysterious deaths. The 24 Taiwan  travelers, along with six Mainland crew members and two guides,  were burned to death inside the lower cabin of the cruise ship  that was ferrying them across Qiandao lake last Thursday. Many  commentators here suspect the victims were set afire by robbers  who first pillaged the boat.    As of now, little has been revealed about the incident due  to  Beijing's censorship. Relatives of the victims, as well as  reporters, were denied access to the boat and the bodies, and  the relatives were forced to accept Beijing demand that all the  bodies be cremated in Mainland China.    "We can hardly imagine how a government could handle such a  big incident in such a dumb way," Lien said. "Should the issue  not be fairly and reasonably handled and the truth not unfold,  it would definitely have a severe impact on private exchanges  across the Taiwan Strait."    Lien also ordered the formation of a special task force to  investigate the incident, to be led by Vice Premier Hsu Li-the.    Pressure also continued to mount at the Legislative Yuan,  with legislators demanding that the government halt the  scheduled fifth round of talks between the SEF and the  Mainland's Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait  until Beijing opens up about the case.    Meanwhile, relatives of the 24 victims plan to hold a press  conference upon their arrival at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport on  Saturday.    The relatives, who departed for the Mainland last Sunday,  were detained at a hotel by security officials following the  breakdown of negotiations between the relatives and Mainland  officials over how the victims' bodies would be handled.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Swedish banks crisis deepens THE biggest banking crisis in Sweden for more than half a century showed signs of deepening yesterday with further evidence of mounting credit losses and deteriorating financial results. The country's commercial banks and financial institutions are being hit by the difficulties caused by troubled loans to property and finance companies during the last decade. Senior banking analysts in Stockholm believe that it could be three years before stability is restored to the banking system. All four leading banks are undergoing, or seeking ways of, strengthening their underlying financial bases. In an attempt to end uncertainties and volatility in its earnings, Gota Bank, the country's fourth largest bank, announced yesterday it was being supported through a SKr13.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn) financial insurance plan for the next five years covering its entire loan portfolio for losses and unpaid interest. The bank said that the size of the premiums payable will amount to between SKr8bn to SKr10bn spread over the period to 1996. As a result of the scheme Gota's credit losses for the first four months of the year were SKr210m and not SKr1.147bn although this still left the Gota group with an operating deficit of SKr638m. The breadth of the banking crisis was also illustrated by results from other banks. Foreningsbank announced a SKr175m operating loss for the first four months. This was a 43 per cent improvement on the same period of 1991, but credit losses totalled SKr926m and the bank said the outlook was so uncertain it could not give any forecast for the whole of 1992. Svenska Handelsbanken, Sweden's third largest commercial bank with a reputation for prudence, announced a 35 per cent drop in its profits for the first four months to SKr664m due to credit losses that totalled SKr1.559bn for the same period, a 47 per cent jump on the first four months of 1991. These results follow rapidly on last weeks' announcement of the first-ever financial operating loss of SKr600m for the first four months by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's largest commercial bank, and the troubles at state-controlled Nordbanken, which announced a SKr1.97bn loss for the first four months.

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Turkish state lifts stake in bank THE Turkish government has increased its stake in Turkiye Isbankasi, the country's second-largest bank, to 52 per cent. In a controversial move, the Turkish treasury last week acquired a 29 per cent stake in Turkiye Isbankasi from the opposition Peoples Republican Party (CHP). The bank is one of Turkey's best-managed, and Mr Unal Korukcu, its managing director, is considered one of the country's best bankers. It recently reported pre-tax profits of TL1,100bn (Dollars 117m). The CHP's holding was once owned by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's founder, and passed to the party in his will. At Turkiye Isbankasi's annual meeting, however, it was decided the CHP was entitled to only 1.92 per cent of the shares. The party says it will challenge this in the courts. Until the 1980 military coup and subsequent ban on political parties, the bank was controlled by the CHP. After the coup the party's stake was represented by the presidential secretariat, which until last week had three seats on the bank's board. Before the treasury's latest move, Turkiye Isbankasi was an anomaly among Turkish banks, in being state-controlled but not state-owned. Apart from the CHP, the bank's pension fund owned 39 per cent of its shares, the treasury 13 per cent and 19 per cent was traded on the Istanbul stock exchange. The dispute over the CHP's holding arose after a recent decision by Mr Suleyman Demirel, prime minister, to lift the ban on political parties banned by the generals. The revived CHP, in an attempt to raise funds, tried to establish title to its former assets. The treasury's move, which paved the way for it to appoint six members of the bank's 11-man board, underscores the political rivalry between Turkey's coalition government and the CHP over control of Turkiye Isbankasi. Many businessmen were surprised by the treasury's move, given the government's policy of privatisation of state assets. According to brokers, the bank's pension fund, hitherto a dormant board member, may buy Turkiye Isbankasi shares in the market to regain its position as largest shareholder.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / People: SelecTV's new finance director Ian Buckley, 39, former joint head of corporate finance at Carr Kitcat and Aitken, is going to work for one of his old clients. He is taking over as finance director of SelecTV, the independent television production company behind comedy and drama series such as Birds of a Feather and Lovejoy. Buckley, who has known SelecTV's chief executive Allan McKeown for some time, was appointed a non-executive director in May. Buckley had lost his job at Carr Kitcat following Banque Indosuez's decision to close down his part of the business. Rather than go to work for yet another broker he decided that he wanted to try something else. Nicola Egerton-King, SelecTV's current finance director, has handed in her notice and Buckley, a chartered accountant, will take over responsibility for the group's financial affairs from September 5. SelecTV, currently capitalised at Pounds 37m, increased its pre-tax profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 926,000 on a 19 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 23.8m in the year to end-March. Ian Buckley is not related to Michael Buckley, one of the company's founders, ousted as SelecTV's chairman last year following a boardroom row over payments to McKeown.</p>

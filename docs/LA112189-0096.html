			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: LIVE ENTERTAINMENT STILL HAS NO REPLACEMENT FOR MENENDEZ  </P> <P> Live Entertainment Inc. said it needs more time to find a replacement for Jose  E. Menendez, its slain chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> Menendez and his wife Kitty were killed Aug. 20 at their home in Beverly Hills.  Police are continuing to investigate the case, but no arrests have been made.  </P> <P> Live, a distributor and retailer of video and audio entertainment, announced  several appointments and the creation of a new unit for acquisitions and new  business, Live Enterprises Inc.  </P> <P> Devendra Mishra, executive vice president-operations, has been named president  and chief operating officer of Live. Meshra, prior to joining Live three years  ago, worked for RCA for 18 years.  </P> <P> Live said Chief Financial Officer Roger R. Smith, who was named acting  president of Live following the death of Menendez, has been named president of  the new unit.  </P> <P> The company said it was continuing to search for a successor but warned that  the process may take a while.  </P> <P> "This search is not expected to be concluded quickly, and the management  structure announced today is seen as extremely capable of handling all aspects  of the company's business, however long it takes to find a new chief executive  officer," said Peter Hoffman, acting chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> The company also announced appointments of two well-known entertainment  executives to its board: Alan Hirschfield, former chief executive at 20th  Century Fox and Columbia Pictures Industries; and Cy Leslie, founder of  Pickwick International and founder of MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group.  </P></p>

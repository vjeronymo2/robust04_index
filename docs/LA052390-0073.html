			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FUGITIVE MARSUPIALS OUTMANEUVER POLICE NEAR DUTCH TOWN  </P> <P> Police Tuesday called off a search for two wallabies that have been running  wild near this Dutch town for two months.  </P> <P> "It can't do any harm to let them live up in the dunes," Deputy Cmdr. J. N.  Boer of the National Police said after abandoning the search.  </P> <P> "Besides, we have better things to do."  </P> <P> The wallabies are relatives of the kangaroo and are also native to Australia.  They were the pets of a local resident until they hopped over his fence.  </P> <P> Police were concerned that the sight of two 20-inch-high wallabies hopping down  the highway might cause a traffic accident. They even called in a helicopter to  ferret out the marsupials.  </P> <P> The wallabies eluded searchers.  </P> <P> Police said the owner had refused to cooperate in capture attempts. Repeated  telephone calls to his home were not answered.  </P> <P> "There's no law against letting your pet kangaroos roam free, but he will be  responsible for whatever might happen," Boer said.  </P></p>

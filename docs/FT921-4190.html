			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Number of share owners down 1.2m - Shares THE NUMBER of personal shareholders in the UK has fallen by 1.2m in the past year, the first decline since the boom in share ownership created by the privatisations of the 1980s. Around 9.8m people currently own shares, down from 11m this time last year, according to the Treasury's annual survey of share ownership, conducted with ProShare, the wider share ownership group. The decline has come about in spite of the privatisations in the last 12 months of the electricity generating companies and Scottish electricity companies, and the sale of a substantial stake in BT. It means the proportion of adults in the UK owning shares has fallen from 25 per cent last year to 22 per cent this year. The fall-off in share ownership has not been caused by a decline in privatisation holdings. According to the survey, conducted by NOP, 14 per cent of adults in Britain own privatisation shares, the same proportion as last year. Similarly, the proportion of adults owning shares in the companies where they work has also remained stable, at 4 per cent. At the same time, there is little evidence in the survey that shareholders are broadening their investment portfolios. The proportion of investors owning shares in only one company has fallen by just one percentage point to 53 per cent, while those with two shareholdings has also fallen by one point, to 19 per cent. On the other hand, those with four shareholdings or more has risen slightly.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Media groups hit problems in drive to print in India Plans by foreign media groups to invest in India have run into political controversy and legal argument. The Financial Times and Time magazine of the US have submitted investment proposals to the Indian government, in the belief economic liberalisation will soon extend to newspaper and magazine publishing. The FT plans to publish a business daily in partnership with the Ananda Bazar Patrika Group, a Calcutta-based publishing house, and Time is proposing printing an Indian edition in collaboration with Time and Living Media, publisher of India Today, India's leading news magazine. Other publications which have considered printing in India include the International Herald Tribune. Foreign publishers and their Indian partners believe the Indian market offers big opportunities. But before they can invest, they must persuade the government to lift a ban on foreign newspapers, magazines and news agencies imposed in 1956 by Mr Jawarhalal Nehru, India's first premier, who believed the country needed protecting from foreign influences. With satellite TV beaming everything from BBC News to Madonna concerts into millions of homes, many Indians say Mr Nehru's restrictions look increasingly obsolete. Reuters, the UK news agency, has been given permission to distribute a limited service. A recent survey by Business India magazine showed 65 per cent of those polled supported entry of foreign newspapers. English-language newspapers account for only about 60 of India's 350 dailies, but dominate the reading of the country's political and business elite. The foreign groups' plans have provoked sharp differences of opinion in the newspaper industry. Last month, the All-India Newspaper Editors' Conference warned the foreign press's 'invasion' would be an 'infringement of the fundamental rights and constitutional guarantees provided to Indian citizens'. The Press Council, the industry's watchdog, stands by a demand it made in 1992 that government decisions on amending Mr Nehru's ban should be postponed for 'three to five years'. But some editors have spoken out in favour of foreign investment, including Mr HK Dua, editor of the Hindustan Times daily, who told a media conference last week: 'We must pull ourselves up instead of bemoaning the entry of others into the market.' The overseas groups' plans have some strong supporters among politicians, notably Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, who believes India will benefit from greater access to overseas news. But others are more cautious. Mr Pran Chopra, a former newspaper editor who favours the entry of foreign publications, says: 'Many politicians fear that (by opening the market) they might cause a political storm for little benefit.' Mr Chopra believes Premier PV Narasimha Rao will take time to make up his mind, but the spread of satellite TV will make the ban on printed publications meaningless. Much of the controversy centres on the Financial Times. The FT would have a 50.1 per cent stake in the venture, but only two out of 500 staff would be sent from the FT. Mr David Bell, chief executive of the FT, says: 'The paper will be Indian-edited and Indian-managed.' Ananda Bazar, a family-owned group run by Mr Aveek Sarkar, would merge into the venture its existing business paper, Business Standard. The new paper would compete with the Economic Times, the market leader, controlled by the Delhi-based Jain family, whose flagship is the Times of India, the premier English-language daily. The FT and the Times of India group are involved in court battles over rights to the Financial Times name. The FT registered the name with the trade marks registrar in 1987. But the Times of India group registered the same name two years later with the registrar of newspapers for India, a separate official body. The Times of India then started publishing papers sporadically with the name Financial Times. The FT has challenged the Times of India's right to publish a pink paper called the Financial Times. Individuals have filed cases in the high courts of Delhi, Allahabad and Bangalore challenging the foreign papers' rights to register their names in India. Lawyers for the FT have claimed in the Delhi High Court that these individuals are 'a front' for the Times of India group. Mr Bell and Mr Ashok Jain, head of the Times of India group, declined to comment on the dispute. It will probably have to go to the Supreme Court.</p>

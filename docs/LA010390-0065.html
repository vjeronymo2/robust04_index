			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN CUTS FARES; SAVINGS ON MOST FLIGHTS 25% TO 45%  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines, in a bid to draw more passengers as it struggles to emerge  from bankruptcy, said Tuesday that it will slash its fares on most domestic  flights by 25% to 45% below the lowest industry rate.  </P> <P> "Our objective is to maximize revenues on board the airplanes. This initiative  is aimed at discretionary travelers," said George Brennan, vice president of  the Texas Air Corp. unit.  </P> <P> "Excluding flights from the Northeast to the West, we are talking about savings  between 25% and 45%," he said.  </P> <P> The airline said the fares require a seven-day advance purchase and a two-night  stay. The tickets are refundable, may be changed without penalty and can be  used from Jan. 9 through May 1, excluding holiday blackout dates.  </P> <P> Brennan said the fare cuts apply to between 90% and 95% of Eastern's domestic  flights. The remaining fares were cut last week in response to general industry  reductions, he added.  </P> <P> Under the promotion, Eastern will charge $69 each way for travel between any  Florida city and Atlanta.  </P> <P> Eastern said flights to Florida from most points in the East start at about $69  each way.  </P> <P> A flight from New York to Miami will cost $79 each way off-peak and $99 each  way during peak travel, compared to the lowest industry fares of $149 off-peak  and $169 on-peak, Eastern said.  </P> <P> The new Eastern fares are based on a round-trip purchase. Off-peak prices are  available for travel from noon Monday until noon Friday. Weekend fares are an  additional $20 each way.  </P> <P> Eastern said the new fares are not available for travel to Florida on Feb.  14-18 and April 12, 13 and 22. They are not available for travel from Florida  on Feb. 19, Feb. 24-26, April 12-13 and April 21-23.  </P> <P> The fares to and from all other cities are not available April 12-13 and April  22.  </P> <P> The fare cuts were expected by industry analysts, who said Eastern was trying  to boost traffic and improve its cash flow.  </P> <P> Last week, the company said it would eliminate about 600 jobs and temporarily  cut wages and benefits for some employees in an effort to reduce costs.  </P> <P> Separately, another Texas Air unit said it will raise domestic and  international air fares by 4% because of soaring jet fuel prices.  </P> <P> Continental Airlines said the fare increases will go into effect on all tickets  purchased after Jan. 10 for domestic travel and on subsequent January dates on  international tickets.  </P> <P> The carrier said its fuel costs rose 43% to an average of 71 cents a gallon in  the fourth quarter of 1989 from an average of 49.6 cents a gallon in the 1988  period.  </P> <P> Continental said it has seen fuel prices jump to $1.10 from 63.5 cents a gallon  on the New York market during the past 30 days.  </P> <P> Other carriers, including UAL Corp. and Trans World Airlines Inc., said they  are considering ways to defray rising fuel costs.  </P></p>

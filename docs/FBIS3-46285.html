In addition to Taiwan investment, a number of Southeast  Asian  nations poured money into Vietnam last year, including Malaysia,  Thailand and Indonesia, who invested US$346 million, US$209  million and US$131 million respectively, the IDIC statistics  showed.    From 1988 to November, 1993, Taiwan's accumulated investment  in Vietnam hit US$1.275 billion with Taiwan Sugar Corp. and  Chinese Petroleum Corp. as leading investors.    Hong Kong ranked second in accumulated investment, with  US$1.064 billion during the period. South Korea came in third  with US$473 million, followed by Australia's US$415 million and  Japan's US$414 million.    In recent years, foreign capital has continuously poured  into  Vietnam due to its cheap labor and the legislation of an  investment law in 1987 as well as the free market reform policy  adopted by the Vietnamese Government at the end of the 1980s.    The market reform policy, although coming later than similar  policies in other Southeast Asian countries, still fueled an  outstanding average economic growth of 7.1 percent over the past  three years.    Total approved foreign investment in Vietnam in 1991 reached  US$1.146 billion, and the figure jumped to US$2.863 billion in  1993, the statistics showed.    Although Taiwan topped other investors in 1993, its US$430  million was a decline of 17.8 percent from 1992, the IDIC  statistics showed.    Taiwan manufacturers focused their investments in the hotel,  tourism, service, petroleum and natural gas industries.</p>

Brittan said he had received the assurances after a heated  joint news conference Monday with Chinese Foreign Trade Minister  Wu Yi.    At the conference Wu had reiterated Beijing's position that  the Sino-British row over political reform in Hong Kong would  "inevitably affect" bilateral trade ties.    "I have now had absolutely unequivocal assurances that there  will be no discrimination against any member state on political  grounds," Brittan told reporters.    The promises were made by senior leaders that Brittan met  during his stay in Beijing, he said.    In addition to Wu, Brittan talked with Vice Foreign Minister  Jiang Enzhu and Vice Premier Li Lanqing.    Brittan said he had also received the "firmest possible"  assurances that China understood that the principle of non-  discrimination, against members and the EU as a whole, is  fundamental to China's re-entry to the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Brittan reiterated that any attempt to discriminate against  an EU member state would be viewed as "a very serious matter" by  the Union.    However, he refused to specify what retaliatory action the  EU  might take and admitted that discrimination "may be difficult to  prove."</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Blue Arrow Trial: Points seen in favour of defendants THE DEFENDANTS in the Blue Arrow trial kept nothing back from the group's directors about their handling of the 1987 rights issue and this was a 'real point in their favour', the jury was told yesterday. Mr Justice McKinnon said in the second day of his summing up that Mr Tony Berry, then Blue Arrow chairman, had participated in the late taking up of rights after the issue had closed and had not been called to give evidence. 'There can be no allegations that anything material was kept from Blue Arrow,' the judge said. 'You are entitled to use that as a real point in the defendants' favour.' He will continue his summing up on Monday.</p>

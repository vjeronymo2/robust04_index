No comments were received on the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex is amending Rule 205: (1) To provide that no differential shall be charged on odd-lot order transactions except for non-regular way trades; (2) to revise the definition of the effective transaction that triggers the execution of an odd-lot order with respect to certain odd-lot limited orders; and (3) to delete, reposition, or re-number various provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current provisions of Rule 205, all standard odd-lot market orders, as well as marketable odd-lot limited orders, are executed with no differential charged. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  However, a differential may be charged in connection with executions of odd-lot limit orders, market orders to sell marked ``short,'' stop orders, and other types of orders as specified in Rule 205(B) and (C). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures for executing odd-lot market orders and marketable limit orders are currently being implemented on a pilot basis, extended until November 8, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34496 (August 8, 1994), 59 FR 41807 (August 15, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amex Rule 205(B) and (C). Currently, the Rules permits differentials to be charged in connection with buying on the offer and selling on the bid, limited orders ``with or without sale,'' buying or selling ``or on close,'' buying or selling ``at the close,'' orders filled after the close, ``seller's option'' trades, and cash trades. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the amendments to Rule 205, the Exchange intends to require the execution of all odd-lot market or limit orders, except for non-regular way executions, without a differential. Non-regular way trades will include (1) a ``seller's option'' trade for delivery not less than six business days nor more than sixty days following the day of the contract; (2) an odd-lot order for cash or ``next day'' delivery, and (3) any order for additional settlement periods as may be provided under Rule 124 (Types of Bids and Offers). All other odd-lot orders will be executed without a differential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Odd-lot limited orders must be executed on the first eligible effective transaction. Under the current odd-lot pricing procedures, the effective transaction for a limited order to buy is the first round lot transaction below the specified limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount. Further, the effective transactions for a limited order to sell marked ``long'' is the first round lot transaction above the specified limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount. Finally, the effective transaction for a limited order to sell marked ``short'' is the first round lot transaction which is above the specified limit by the amount of the differential or by a greater amount, and which is also higher than the last different round lot transaction price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the amendments to Rule 205, the effective transaction that will trigger the execution of an odd-lot limited order is a transaction ``at or lower'' than the specified limit for a buy limited order, or ``at or higher'' than the specified limit for sell limited orders. In addition, for sell limited orders marked ``short,'' the triggering transaction must also be higher than the last different round lot transaction (a ``plus'' or ``zero-plus'' tick). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, under the amendments, marketable limited orders will continue to be executed in accordance with the procedures outlined in Rule 205 applicable to market orders. Currently, any order entered as a limited order, which is marketable at the time it is entered, is treated exactly as though it were entered as a market order. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Thus, this provision in the amendments is merely a codification of current Exchange practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Conversation between Michael Cavalier, Assistant General Counsel, American Stock Exchange, and Amy Bilbija, Commission, on August 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

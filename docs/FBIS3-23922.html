			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Loginov and Andrey Melnikov under the </F> rubric "Business: Foreign Banks in Russia": "Western Bankers  Take First Cautious Steps in Russia"]    [Text] The scandal that continued this week regarding  the privatization of Bank Slaski in Poland (a large block of  shares was purchased at clearly understated prices by a major  foreign investor--ING Bank of Holland) has once again drawn  attention to the problem of the presence of Western bank capital  in the postsocialist countries. Much dispute was seen in Russia  in 1993 as to whether or not to allow foreign bank capital into  the country. As a result, those who support protection of the  national banking system from foreign competitors managed to  effect a temporary restriction on the sphere of activity of  foreign bankers in Russia. Nonetheless, a number of banks that  obtained licenses in 1993 have in fact begun operations.  <H5>  Little in Credits, Few Rubles, Few Resident Clients </H5>   Of course, foreign banks in Russia have not yet moved as far  ahead as they have in Poland and Hungary. But already the first  few months of foreign bank activity in the country enable us to  note certain "partialities" of bankers from abroad. First of all  it must be said that because of the unfavorable economic  situation and opposition from a certain segment of the Russian  business community and establishment, the arrival of foreign  banks in Russia is not proceeding very energetically. In  particular, this is reflected in the extremely cautious approach  Western banks are using in matters of investments and extension  of credits to borrowers. In their first stage of operation  virtually all foreign banks in Russia have concentrated on  providing clearing-operations services for clients.    Foreign banks are opening and managing current accounts,  issuing cash currency, effecting international money transfers,  opening letters of credit, performing deposit and conversion  transactions, issuing guarantees, and providing consulting  services to clients on capital investment matters. As a rule,  payments within Russia are effected through a system of  corresponding accounts opened in Russian banks.    A comparison of terms for opening accounts and the amount of  commission charged by foreign banks and their Russian colleagues  shows that the foreign banks are trying to avoid standing out  too much. Their rates are not very different from the rates of  the leading Russian banks, although in a number of instances  they exceed the latter. Bank Austria and BNP-Dresdner Bank  (Rossija) have a "more democratic" look, for example. The bank  Societe Generale Russie stands out somewhat--$1,000 to open an  account, and a slight hint to the effect that small-scale  clients need not apply.    Nonresidents predominate as clients of the foreign banks.  This is not just related to the temporary ban on servicing  Russian firms and citizens. A particular feature of the strategy  of a number of large-scale foreign banks is the fact that they  are striving not so much to gain a local clientele as to  "escort" their traditional clients, creating comfortable  conditions for them to carry out their business in a new country  (Societe Generale Russie) or facilitating the economic relations  of a particular country with Russia (Bank of China in Russia).  After obtaining an "offshore" license from the Central Bank,  Bank Austria set as its goal from the very beginning the aim of  "seizing" the money of foreign firms and citizens operating in  Russia, not the money of residents of Russia. The ethnic  composition of the clientele of foreign banks varies. Bank of  China in Russia services Chinese firms or joint enterprises  almost exclusively, with the participation of Chinese capital.  The European banks are more "international." Only one-fifth of  all the clients of Bank Austria constitute Austrian companies  and citizens.    Juridical persons predominate as clients of foreign banks.  The explanation for this can also be found in the particular  policy features of a number of banks (for example, the bank  Societe Generale does not do "retail" banking business at all  outside the borders of France). Foreign banks are presently  performing transactions primarily in hard currency and they are  in no hurry to initiate ruble transactions.    However, 1994 promises to become a year of more intense  activity on the part of foreign banks in Russia. First of all,  during the course of the year at least another six banks will  begin operations in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Secondly, it is  expected that at mid-year the restrictions on foreign bank  activity imposed by the 15 November 1993 presidential edict will  be lifted. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will return frequently to the  problem of the presence of foreign banks in the country.  <H5>  Bank Austria (Z-Landerbank Bank Austria AG) </H5>   Bank Austria was the first foreign bank to obtain the right  to open a branch in Russia (License No. 1). The branch began  operations on 7 December 1992. Today 30 people work in the  branch, of whom only two are foreigners. In essence, the branch  is an offshore banking institution without the right to service  residents of Russia. It operates exclusively with nonresidents.  As of today, the bank's clientele numbers in the hundreds. Over  half the clients of the Moscow branch of Bank Austria are firms  (corporate customers), approximately one-third are physical  persons (private customers), and about 20 percent are financial  institutions. In the future it is possible that the circle of  clients will be expanded by virtue of joint enterprises with the  participation of Russian capital. The bank does not intend to  carry on business with "pure" residents in the near future.    The Moscow branch of Bank Austria carries out transactions  in  foreign currency exclusively. It is tied into the Reuters  Dealing system and SWIFT system. The bank devotes special  attention to cash currency transactions. Ready cash can be  obtained at the Austrian bank itself or at the offices of  Russian banks with which Bank Austria has concluded special  agreements (specifically, in Moscow--with Tokobank, in St.  Petersburg--with the bank St. Petersburg).

The founders  of Credit Lyonnais Russie are Credit Lyonnais Europe (35  percent), Credit Lyonnais Belgique (30 percent), and Credit  Lyonnais Global Banking (35 percent). The bank officially opened  in December 1992 and began operations in July 1993.    Presently the bank does business with juridical persons and  Russian commercial banks (number of clients totals about 120).  Private individuals comprise an insignificant portion of the  clientele. Commission rates charged by the bank have been  declared a commercial secret. In the words of bank officials,  these are not published in either full or abbreviated form and  are not taken out of the bank premises. Deposit rates are  established for each specific instance by agreement with the  client, depending on type of currency, amount of deposit, and  term of deposit. Minimum amount of deposit is set at $50,000 (or  its equivalent in any freely convertible currency).    Bank address: 12 Nevskiy Prospekt, St. Petersburg.  Telephone: (812) 210-31-00.  <H5>  BNP--Dresdner Bank (Rossija) </H5>   The bank's founders are Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and  Dresdner Bank AG, each of which owns 50 percent of the capital.  The bank opened 10 September 1993. It currently provides  services to physical and juridical persons, residents, and  nonresidents. Ruble accounts are opened only for subsequent  conversion into hard currency. Client rubles are converted at  the St. Petersburg Currency Exchange or within the bank. The  charge for conversion at the currency exchange is 1 percent, but  this may be reduced in certain instances (for major clients).  Conversion inside the bank (according to unofficial information)  costs the client 2 percent. The bank does not operate with cash  rubles.    Bank officials refused to provide information as to the  exact  number of clients. They noted, however, that the bank is not  experiencing any shortage. The bank does virtually no business  extending credits to clients. A client may be issued credit only  under the guarantee of a Western bank, a deposit to a bank of  the BNP-DB network against the extension of credit, or the  guarantee of the parent company in the West (for affiliate  structures of foreign companies in Russia).

Telephone: (812) 312-21-00.  <H5>  Societe Generale Russie </H5>   A subsidiary bank of Societe Generale, Societe Generale  Russie began operations on 8 November 1994 [as published]. Some  35 people work in the bank, including seven foreigners. Bank  clients presently include about 10 major international companies  in France, Great Britain, Japan, and the United States (names  are not divulged). The bank does not currently provide services  to residents. Societe Generale Russie is tied into the SWIFT  system. In the spring the bank will move to a new office on  Belinskaya Street, augment its staff, and expand its sphere of  activity. It provides settlement-account servicing for clients  and accepts deposits for terms of at least 30 days and amounts  of at least $100,000 (the interest rate paid on deposits is  somewhat lower than the LIBOR rate). Terms for the conduct of  exchange transactions with cash and noncash currency are the  subject of special agreements with clients.

Telephone: (095) 940-08-15.  <H5>  Bank of China (Bank of China in Russia) </H5>   Bank of China in Russia is a branch bank of the state  Chinese  bank, Bank of China. In addition to Bank of China (75.4 percent  of the charter fund), the shareholders of Bank of China in  Russia are two Hong Kong banks--Sin Hua Bank Ltd. and Kincheng  Banking Corp. (24.6 percent). Both these banks belong to the  group Bank of China. The bank's charter fund amounts to $10  million. The bank obtained a license from the Central Bank in  April 1993 and actually began operations in November of that  year. About 20 persons are presently employed at the bank, most  of whom are Chinese.    By the end of January 1994 the bank had about 100 clients,  of  whom approximately half were physical persons--mainly Chinese  residing in Russia. Chinese companies doing business in Russia  and joint enterprises with the participation of Chinese capital  also predominate among those clients comprising juridical  persons. Soon the bank intends to expand its clientele and  operate more intensively with Russian companies and citizens.    Transactions involving cash currency are not yet very  widespread. Interest is presently not being accrued in deposit  accounts because of the unprofitability of banking operations.  The bank has not yet officially begun transactions in Russian  rubles. At the request of clients, however, the ruble proceeds  of Chinese companies are converted to freely convertible  currency. Bank of China in Russia is not yet tied into the SWIFT  system, but it is linked with the extensive network of branches  of Bank of China throughout the world.    Commissions charged by Bank of China in Russia (as of 26 Jan 94)   Type of transaction                      Cost of bank service   Check-cashing                            From 0.1 to 0.5 percent, depending                                           on the type of transaction (min $20;                                           max $300)   Documentary letters of credit            From 0.125 to 0.15 percent,                                           depending on the type of transaction                                           (min $30; max $300)   Transfers                                0.1 percent (min $10; max $200)   Guarantees                               From 0.25 to 0.5 percent for a term                                           of up to three months (min $50)   Note: Cost of a guarantee for a longer period of time or for a large amount  is the subject of negotiations between the bank and the client      Bank address: 6/1 Kadashevskaya Quay, Moscow.  Telephone: (095) 230-02-15.  <H5>  Citibank T/O Moscow </H5>   This is the last of the foreign banks to begin operations in  Russia. Citibank T/O Moscow is a subsidiary bank of the very  large American bank Citibank. An inaugural ceremony marked the  opening of the bank on 14 January 1994. The directors of the  Moscow Citibank have often stated their intention to include  residents of Russia within their clientele, but the already  mentioned presidential edict does not yet provide the bank such  an opportunity. In the words of Citibank T/O Moscow  representatives, the amount of bank commission is established  for each specific instance during negotiations with the client.    Bank address: 8/10 Gasheka Street, Moscow. Telephone:  (095) 956-23-45.  <H5>  Several More Foreign Banks To Begin Operations in 1994 </H5>   The group of strong foreign banks now operating in Russia  will be joined in 1994 by another six or seven banks. The joint  Russian-Turkish Yapi TOKO Bank will soon begin operations. ING  Bank will open around April of this year, and Chase Manhattan  Bank--in May. Also beginning operations in Russia in the spring  is the bank Credit Suisse (bank officials were presently unable  to give a more precise date). The time frames for opening ABN  Amro Bank (the Netherlands), the Russian-Turkish bank in Moscow,  and a branch of Postipankki OY (Finland) in St. Petersburg have  not yet been determined.</p>

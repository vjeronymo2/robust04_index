			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Mar 09, BNS - MP Romualdas Ozolas,  chairman of the Lithuania Center Union, said he was surprised by  the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry's apologies to the Polish  Embassy in Vilnius.    The embassy last week presented a note of protest to the  Foreign Ministry concerning Ozolas' statements in the  Vilnius-based LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper.    The lawmaker accused Jan Widacki, Polish ambassador to  Lithuania, of "organizing active polonization" in Lithuania and  called him "a Polish security employee."    The Polish embassy announced on Tuesday [8 March] that the  Lithuanian Foreign Ministry expressed regret about the  lawmaker's statements.    At a press conference Wednesday, Ozolas said he will meet  Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys to discuss the incident.    In Ozolas' words, Polish newspapers wrote about Widacki's  previous career. The lawmaker said he has documents to prove  that the ambassador lectured in a Polish school of security  officers. Hence, Ozolas said, it is possible to maintain that  Widacki worked for the Polish security. The Lithuanian lawmaker  said he will hand over these documents to Jurgis Jurgelis, head  of the Lithuanian National Security Service.    Ozolas said the policy of the Lithuanian Government is  surprising because Lithuania consents to the appointment of  foreign ambassadors without paying any attention to their past.    The lawmaker said the recently appointed Belarusian  ambassador is a former employee of the KGB. "I understand the  interest of Belarus and Poland to appoint ambassadors who have  experience of work in security systems, but I do not understand  Lithuania's position."</p>

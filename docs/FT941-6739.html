			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Russia backs downing of jets: Nato action prompts Moscow peace effort Russia firmly backed Nato's downing of four hostile aircraft over Bosnia yesterday, as the Bosnian Serb leader flew to Moscow to face further pressure to reach a peace deal. US F-16 fighter jets blasted the Yugoslav-made Galeb light attack aircraft with missiles to enforce the United Nations 'no-fly' zone over Bosnia. It was Nato's first combat action since it was formed nearly 45 years ago. The Russian foreign ministry said unequivocally that any violator of the UN flight ban over Bosnia deserved to be punished. But Moscow, a traditional ally of the Serbs, made a diplomatic gesture to them by noting they had not conceded that the offending aircraft were theirs. The unexpected trip to Moscow by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, came just hours after the fighters were shot down. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, indicated that the urgent talks with Mr Karadzic were an attempt to keep up the momentum of peace efforts, including the creation of demilitarised zones. The Russians are apparently seeking to pull off another coup, after their intervention two weeks ago speeded Bosnian Serb withdrawal of heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and so averted Nato air strikes. On the same day as the Nato dogfight, Russia also indicated its willingness to forge closer links with the western alliance. Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy foreign minister and special envoy to former Yugoslavia, said Moscow would soon sign up to Nato's 'partnership for peace', which envisages closer military co-operation with the alliance. He was speaking after talks in Moscow with three Nato ambassadors. Russia's endorsement of the peace plan - a week after President Boris Yeltsin's promise of a more assertive foreign policy - lent credence to Mr Churkin's promise that Russia was determined to conduct a foreign policy 'not aimed at worsening conflicts' but worthy of 'a great sovereign state'. Nato secretary-general Manfred Worner said the downing of the aircraft was a sharp lesson to show that the UN and Nato were serious. He warned the offenders not to retaliate. US Admiral Jeremy Boorda, Nato's commander in southern Europe, said an Awacs surveillance aircraft had spotted six Galebs south-east of Banja Luka, the main Serb air base in northern Bosnia. Four F-16s flew in and shot down four Galebs after they ignored two warnings for them to land or leave Bosnian airspace. The other two Galebs fled towards Croatia. In its defence of Nato's action, Russia said it was in accordance with the UN Security Council resolution passed in October 1992. The UN resolution bans unauthorised flights by all fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters in airspace over the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Nato declared the no-fly zone in April 1993. In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the White House had been in touch with Moscow 'and we have explained what happened'. Other western leaders, including Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, who was visiting Mr Clinton, supported the action.

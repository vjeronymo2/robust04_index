			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Cambodia poll puts Untac's chief to the test THESE are anxious days for Mr Yasushi Akashi, the 62-year-old Japanese diplomat who heads the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac). His reputation depends on the success or failure of this week's UN-organised general election. As Cambodians go to the polls after 19 months of UN efforts to implement the peace plan signed in Paris in 1991, many of Mr Akashi's critics inside and outside Untac are blaming his apparent indecisiveness and policy of patient diplomacy for the UN's failure to disarm the warring factions or bring peace to the country. But Untac's mandate was to monitor a ceasefire rather than enforce one, and Mr Akashi was blocked at almost every turn by the intransigence of the Khmer Rouge, which reneged on the peace accord and threatens to disrupt the elections, and by the unwillingness of the government in Phnom Penh to yield control to UN administrators. One of the turning points of Untac's mandate was in June last year, when Mr Akashi and Gen John Sanderson, Untac's Australian military commander, declined to insist on the UN's right to enter Khmer Rouge areas. Gen Michel Loridon, Gen Sanderson's forceful French deputy, left Untac, complaining that it should have called the Khmer Rouge's bluff and if necessary take on the Khmer Rouge militarily even if it meant the loss of perhaps 200 men. Mr Akashi disagrees. 'I have no authority. I am not at liberty to sacrifice 200 good soldiers, even 20 soldiers,' he said in an interview at Untac headquarters. 'We have to remain within the mandate given to us by the Paris agreement and by the UN Security Council. 'We are not a group of heroic soldiers. We're not a group of Joan of Arcs here. We are here based on the willing consent of four Cambodian parties, who in their free will agreed to accept a number of political obligations. But some of the parties act as if they have forgotten the instrument which they signed in good faith in Paris.' Asked whether it might not have been better to have changed Untac's mandate to give it more powers of enforcement, Mr Akashi said there was little support for such a move from governments contributing to the peacekeeping forces, especially those from Asia and Australia. 'Use of force in a domestic conflict can be extremely messy and bloody.' He added: 'With the end of the cold war we thought the golden age of peace would arrive but it has not arrived and we are faced with Somalia, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan. We are seeing how persistent the domestic route of conflict is.' Mr Akashi accepts the need for some kind of continuing UN presence after the scheduled departure of Untac in August, but is worried about Cambodia becoming too dependent on outside help. 'I do not like the spectre of Cambodia becoming a second Cyprus,' he said. 'I'm torn between the desire to help Cambodia and Cambodian people longer - to see to it that some of the reforms and the policies we have started will be completed - and my desire not to make this country and the Cambodian people feel too dependent on external influence. 'If the new government of Cambodia wishes, I think the Security Council will respond favourably to establishing some kind of small UN presence. . . In the meantime the reconstruction projects will continue and be expanded even. The World Bank, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank will come in, but they are waiting to see whether peace and stability in Cambodia after the elections will be secure enough ..' Responding to his critics, Mr Akashi denied he was merely a practitioner of 'patient diplomacy'. 'No, I think I am not that patient,' he said. 'I combine patience and impatience. If you are not patient you will not get things done, but unless you are impatient nothing will move, so you have to have appropriate combinations of both.'</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Letter: Telephone competition still lacking Sir, In response to a Mercury Communications initiative to promote competition by offering cheaper calls to domestic users ('Competition cuts phone charges', December 2) BT proposes to freeze the cost of UK calls but increase the cost of line rental charges, just like last year, by 10p or some 7 per cent per week, well above the rate of inflation. Thus an increase in line rental charges will ensure that BT increases its revenue whether the network is being used or not and regardless of whether the service is improved. Large organisations, those which make the most use of telecommunication networks, will see some overall reduction in expenditure; however, residential customers, who use the network far less frequently, will see an increase in their bills, even before VAT. Surely if I use a service or a facility more than my neighbour I should expect to have to pay more for that service than my neighbour. The need for more competition in UK telecommunications is becoming increasingly essential. Kenneth Armitage, 29 Stoneham Close, Petersfield, Hants GU32 3BX</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHINGBIOLOGISTS' STUDY OF SAND BASS HABITS RESUMED  </P> <P> Last week on two twilight trips with volunteer anglers aboard, First String,  Russ Izors' boat from 22nd Street Landing, caught 742 sand bass. Mac Oliphan  and Paul Gregory, biologists from the Department of Fish and Game, then tagged  and released the fish.  </P> <P> That marked the beginning of the second year of the catch, tag and release  study of sand bass migration, in which the department seeks answers concerning  the spawning habits of the fish at South Bay beaches.  </P> <P> Gregory said that little is known about this species of bass and it may take  two more years to complete the study.  </P> <P> According to Oliphan, 28 tags from last year were returned. The average  distance the fish traveled before being caught again was just under 10 miles.  </P> <P> There are more than 1,400 bass wearing tags from the past two years of the tag  program.  </P> <P> Anglers fishing from a party boat can give the tag to the crew, who will then  record where the fish was landed and the fisherman's name and address. The  angler will receive a $5 reward by mail.  </P> <P> Anglers fishing from private boats can mail the tag with the information to the  Department of Fish and Game, 330 Golden Shores, Long Beach.  </P> <P> Rowan Henry of King Harbor Marlin Club battled a swordfish for 10 hours and 55  minutes that he hooked 10 miles out of San Diego using a mackerel for bait on a  50-pound test line.  </P> <P> The fish weighed in at 129 pounds.  </P> <P> The Venice Anglers will hold their third annual Shark Tournament this weekend  with a top prize of $2,500.  </P> <P> Weigh-in will be at Marina del Rey each day until 5 p.m. Information: Jack  Bailey at (213) 823-9715.  </P> <P> Lomita anglers Ryan and Sharon Asato returned from a long-distance trip Monday  with six albacore, 12 yellowtail and three bluefin tuna that weighed more than  50 pounds each.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Jeff Fukawa of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the  Outerlimits on a half-day tuna trip, caught the whopper of the week, a 50-pound  bluefin. . . .

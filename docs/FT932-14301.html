			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Sacking unlikely to end political impasse THE latest turn of events in Islamabad has a depressing familiarity. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan is sacking a prime minister and dissolving the national assembly for the second time in less than three years. In 1990, he dismissed Ms Benazir Bhutto and promoted the election of Mr Nawaz Sharif. In 1993, he is dismissing his hand-picked protege and opening the door to the possible return of Ms Bhutto. Such cavalier treatment of the country's elected leaders bodes ill for the future of Pakistan's fragile democracy; it raises concerns about the role of the country's powerful military establishment, its economic prospects and its relations with foreign states, especially the US and India. Pakistan has had 15 rulers since independence: the two who lasted longest were both military dictators - General Ayub Khan in the 1960s and General Mohammed Zia al-Haq, who died in an air crash in 1988. Among President Zia's political legacies was a constitutional amendment which gave great powers to the presidency. His successor, Mr Ishaq Khan, has now used these powers twice to striking effect. On each occasion, the president has claimed that he was acting to defend the constitution. In fact, this 79-year-old former Finance Ministry official has also been acting to protect his own political position. Ms Bhutto was sacked after losing a power struggle with the army, which might have culminated in a military takeover had the president not intervened. Mr Sharif has been dismissed after a concerted effort to enlarge his own authority at the president's expense. After apparently working well together for two years in which Mr Sharif did nothing to anger his political mentor, the two men quarrelled over the appointment of a new army chief, over Mr Sharif's ambition to head the Pakistan Muslim League, the country's largest political party, and finally over Mr Sharif's effort to curb the president's constitutional powers. The president's dismissal of the government and the national assembly is, he announced, to be followed by national elections in three months' time. But already in Islamabad yesterday there were doubts whether polls could be held in July, in the heat of the summer. Mr Zahid Sarfraz, one of Mr Ishaq Khan's top supporters, said elections might be postponed for 12 months to allow time for the summer, the monsoon and a long-overdue census. Whether the polls are three months away or 12, the campaigns are likely to be bitter. The Pakistan Muslim League, the main component of the coalition which supported Mr Sharif's government, is split between the former prime minister's faction and one backing the president. The main opposition party, Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party, has swallowed its pride and temporarily allied itself with the president to secure Mr Sharif's dismissal. But relations among these groupings are fluid, as are links with other parties, notably Islamic fundamentalist groupings. Mr Sharif's political survival depends on support in his home province of Punjab, where he served as chief minister and where his family has extensive business interests. 'Punjab is the crucial test of Sharif's popularity,' says one of Mr Sharif's political advisers. If Punjab backs Mr Sharif, as seems likely, while the other three provinces do not, dangerous inter-provincial rivalries could erupt. General Abdul Wahid, the army chief of staff who took over in January, is avowedly apolitical. But he is also the president's man, appointed against Mr Sharif's wishes. So, if the president chooses to delay elections to boost his own popularity at the expense of Mr Sharif, the army is unlikely to protest. The army's main worry is that the political battles now raging should not lead to civil disorder. The prospect of extended political confusion unsettles businessmen. The Karachi stock exchange's index slid 3 per cent yesterday, its biggest one-day decline this year. Mr Nasir Bokhari, a leading broker, said: 'The business community is not panicking but it is very much shaken by the prime minister's dismissal.' The shock is particularly acute because Mr Sharif was lionised by businessmen for being the first industrialist to have led the government. They welcomed his policies of economic deregulation, privatisation and the encouragement of foreign investment. However, as long as the pre-election uncertainty is not too disruptive, the long-term impact of Mr Sharif's departure may not be as bad as some businessmen fear. His policies owed much to economic bureaucrats who will survive the change in government. The new government, like Mr Sharif's, will also probably have to pay attention to the country's international donors led by the World Bank. The general expectation in Pakistan is that economic reform will continue, though it may slow down. The crisis will do little to enhance Pakistan's international reputation as a place in which to invest. But Mr Sartaj Aziz, Mr Sharif's finance minister, says that companies which have already committed themselves to Pakistan will press ahead, including Honda Motor, the Japanese car maker which is building a small assembly plant near Lahore, and Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, the US stockbroking companies which are establishing joint ventures in Karachi. Foreign governments will be closely watching the impact of the crisis on Pakistan's external relations. There is a risk that Pakistani politicians on the campaign trail may try to court easy popularity by appealing to nationalist or Islamic fundamentalist sentiments - for example, by denouncing India or the US, which is considering whether to blacklist Pakistan as a terrorist state for its support for insurgents in India. A more probable international effect of the crisis could be that Pakistani leaders will be distracted from dealing with external affairs. Foreign visits will be postponed or cancelled. That in itself will be serious enough because Pakistan has found it hard to redefine its foreign policy since the end of the Afghan war. Relations with the US, Afghanistan, Iran and above all India need attention.</p>

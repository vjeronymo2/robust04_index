			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Don't walk under a ladder. Don't let a black cat cross your path. Don't crack a  mirror. And don't play for the Los Angeles Clippers. . . .  </P> <P> Ron Harper is headed for surgery instead of the NBA All-Star game and it is  time for General Manager Elgin Baylor to unload some of those four future  first-round draft choices in a trade that still could salvage a playoff berth  for the world's unluckiest basketball team. . . .  </P> <P> A Jeff Malone or a Danny Ainge might be available. . . .  </P> <P> Now that the boys of winter have begun working out at Dodger Stadium, we'll  save Tom Lasorda the bother of making out his opening-day lineup card: Juan  Samuel, cf; Willie Randolph, 2b; Kal Daniels, rf; Kirk Gibson, lf; Eddie  Murray, 1b; Hubie Brooks, 3b; Mike Scioscia, c; Alfredo Griffin, ss; Orel  Hershiser, p. . . Clearly, here is a team that will finish anywhere from first  to fifth in the National League West. . . .  </P> <P> Daniels says he wants to bat third. We'll grant him his wish because Gibson  will make a fine cleanup man. Of course, all this is based on the complete  cooperation of their knees. . . .  </P> <P> A record crowd for college basketball, 65,000, is expected at the Louisiana  Superdome Saturday for the LSU-Notre Dame game. All proceeds will go to the  homeless through Comic Relief. Coach Dale Brown sold two seats on the LSU bench  for $5,000 apiece and even the promoter, Sonny Vaccaro of Pacific Palisades,  paid for his dozen tickets. . . .  </P> <P> The key to beating Oklahoma is to get the Sooners into a half-court game. They  didn't know what to do against Lon Kruger's well-coached Kansas State Wildcats  the other night in the Little Apple of Manhattan. . . .  </P> <P> My favorite sports nickname of all-time remains that of former Temple  basketball star Bill Mlkvy, the Owl Without a Vowel. . . .  </P> <P> They're not twins, but Chuck Robinson, Terence Mullin and Eddie Bird are dead  ringers for their famous older brothers, David, Chris and Larry. They also play  basketball for their brothers' old schools -- Navy, St. John's and Indiana  State. . . .  </P> <P> Somehow, I don't miss the old NFL Playoff Bowl, which used to match the losers  of the Western and Eastern Conference championship games. . . .  </P> <P> Bill Shoemaker's last ride may not be the only highlight of the Feb. 3 card at  Santa Anita. Akinemod and Gorgeous, talented 4-year-old fillies, are expected  to race in the 1 1/8-mile La Canada Stakes that afternoon. . . .  </P> <P> Good news for Jack Nicholson. The Academy Awards, March 26, don't conflict with  the NCAA basketball championship, April 2, this year. . . .  </P> <P> Vlade Divac is quickly making friends at the Forum. During the Martin Luther  King Day matinee against Sacramento, the rookie Laker center scored a basket  and then low-fived a young girl sitting in the front row. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Neil Lomax and Ted Danson. . . .  </P> <P> UCLA is interested in Kip Keino's son Martin, who attends Fork Union Military  Academy in Virginia, and will run the prep mile in the Sunkist meet Friday at  the Sports Arena. . . .  </P> <P> Comedy Night. Batting Helmet Day. Movie Day. Ice Cream Day. Wrist Band Day.  Date Night. Baseball Cap Day. Beach Party Day. A list of Dodgers' promotions?  No. All these events are planned for Dedeaux Field on the USC campus, where the  Trojans will try to uphold their preseason No. 1 baseball ranking by Baseball  America. . . .  </P> <P> Three world record-holders -- Janet Evans, David Wharton and Mike Barrowman --  will compete in a double dual meet featuring the USC women against Stanford and  the men against Michigan Friday at 1 p.m. at the McDonald's Olympic swim  stadium. . . .  </P> <P> USC safety Mark Carrier made a big hit in Oklahoma City when he accepted the  Jim Thorpe Award wearing a tuxedo, black cowboy hat and snakeskin boots. . . .  </P> <P> It's uncertain whether Carrier will opt for the NFL draft as a junior, but  probable that teammate Junior Seau will leave early. . . .  </P> <P> Bob Halloran, the director of boxing at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, wants to  make a Michael Nunn-Thomas Hearns match. . . .  </P> <P> Pete Rose, who was honored at Cappy Harada's annual Hot Stove League Golf  Tournament in Santa Maria last week, donated the $5,000 check he was awarded to  Hancock College in Santa Maria. . . .  </P> <P> Two intermissions in hockey are one too many. . . .  </P> <P> What is important to know about the NHL All-Star telecast Sunday on NBC is that  Wayne Gretzky will play for the Campbell Conference and Mario Lemieux for the  Wales. . . .  </P> <P> John Robinson was spotted in an Orange County theater watching "Glory," the day  after his football team fell short of it in San Francisco. . . .  </P> <P> The next time you see a 19-year-old college kid sink two free throws with  thousands screaming, think about the veteran pro golfers who step away from a  putt if they hear the click of a camera.  </P></p>

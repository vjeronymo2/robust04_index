			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / US lacklustre jobs figures boost bonds US BOND prices rose sharply on Wall Street yesterday following the release of lacklustre employment figures pointing to continued sluggish economic growth. The Labour Department said unemployment was unchanged last month at 6.7 per cent and reported a net rise of 156,000 in non-farm employment, less than many traders expected. Analysts had feared that a robust increase in jobs would step up pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. The release of relatively weak figures relieved the tension. The price of the benchmark Treasury 30-year bond soared 1 3/8 points in early trading, one of the biggest gains in recent weeks. By midday the dollar was down two pfennigs at DM1.6050. 'It's a respectable job gain, but the details of the report are disappointing,' said Ms Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, the forecasting group. There was no reason to expect an acceleration of economic growth, currently 2.5 per cent a year. 'The Fed might as well go on vacation.' Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, said the jobless rate was still too high. He said the number of people unemployed for six months or more was still rising despite economic recovery and a fall in the overall jobless rate in the past year. The increase in non-farm employment last month was in line with the average monthly gain so far this year. It followed a revised decline of 41,000 in August. Manufacturing employment fell by 18,000 last month, taking the total loss since February to 266,000. Service sector employment rose 164,000 with most of the gains in the government and retail sectors. The index of aggregate hours worked fell 0.8 per cent, further evidence of relatively sluggish trading conditions.</p>

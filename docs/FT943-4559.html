			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Observer: Gated When Michael Heseltine unfolded his notion of the new 'linear city' to the east of London in 1991, he picked the decidedly unpromising tag of East Thames Corridor for the project. So what can we expect from the rechristened Thames Gateway? Environment minister David Curry was claiming credit for the new moniker when he launched an action plan for the area yesterday. East Thames Corridor had sounded a bit 'Kafkaesque', he said, and, rather than spend years agonising over a new name or running competitions to choose one, he simply 'sat down and made the decision'. Good to see a minister willing to make a tough call. But what a pity that the same spirit of determination does not extend to the corridor itself. Yesterday's plan had no new proposals and no new money to offer. At this rate, Thames Gateway will be more of a linear village than a city.</p>

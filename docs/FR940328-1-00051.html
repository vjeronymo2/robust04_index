			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered or threatened due to one or more of the following five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors described in Section 4(a)(1): (A) the present or threatened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (B)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D) the inadequacy of existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory mechanisms; and (E) other natural or manmade factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affecting its continued existence. The application of these factors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 30 African species named below is shown by the appropriate letter in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parentheses (information from Collar and Andrew 1988, Collar and Stuart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1985, and Grzimek 1975, unless otherwise noted). Also indicated is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of the petition covering each species, the formal ICBP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification, and the proposed U.S. classification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amsterdam albatross ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diomedia amsterdamensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1991 petition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a large sea bird of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family Diomedeidae; known to breed only on Amsterdam Island, a French  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possession in the southern Indian Ocean. Destruction of nesting habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by fires and introduced cattle (A) and predation by introduced rats and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cats (C) have reduced numbers drastically. On the average, only five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pairs were known to breed each year during the early 1980s.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thyolo alethe ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alethe choloensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1991 petition, ICBP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a small, ground-dwelling bird of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the family Muscicapidae, related to the Old World robins and thrushes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known only from 13 small patches of submontane evergreen forest in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> southern Malawi and from 2 such areas in northern Mozambique. Suitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat already has been largely destroyed through human clearing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encroachment and remaining sites are at risk of destruction (A). About  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,500 pairs are estimated to survive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uluguru bush-shrike ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Malaconotus alius <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980 petition, ICBP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rare, proposed U.S. threatened; a small predatory bird of the family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laniidae, resembling the true shrikes in structure but utilizing more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> densely vegetated habitat and dwelling in the forest canopy; known only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Uluguru Mountains in central Tanzania. Because of its dense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forest habitat and evident low numbers, this bird has been difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locate and little is known of its status. However, the lower slopes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mountains on which it lives are being steadily cleared and such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity places the species at risk (A). The Service would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly interested in receiving new information on the severity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Madagascar sea eagle ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Haliaeetus vociferoides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980 petition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICBP endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a fish-hunting species of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family Accipitridae, related to and somewhat smaller than the American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bald eagle; confined to the rivers, shorelines, and offshore islands of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the west coast of central to northern Madagascar. Its numbers have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dropped sharply since the last century, with only 96 individuals being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counted during the mid-1980s. Although reasons for the decline are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unclear, hunting and deliberate nest destruction by people (B) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thought to be partly responsible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Madagascar serpent eagle ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eutriorchis astur <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980 petition, ICBP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered, proposed U.S. endangered; a raptor of the family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accipitridae, more closely related to the harrier hawks than to most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other eagles; until recently, known only from 11 specimens collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over 50 years ago in the eastern forests of Madagascar. In 1988 an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual was observed and in 1990 a dead specimen was recovered, both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in northeastern Madagascar (Raxworthy and Colston 1992). The species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus is known to survive, but it is apparently dependent on large tracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of undisturbed primary rainforest, and such habitat is rapidly being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed or adversely modified by human activity (A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mauritius fody ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Foudia rubra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )._1980 petition, ICBP endangered,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed U.S. endangered; a small weaver of the family Ploceidae,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feeding on insects, nectar and small fruits; formerly widespread in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upland forests of the island of Mauritius, a part of the nation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same name in the Indian Ocean. It now is restricted to the southwestern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of Mauritius, where perhaps only 150 breeding pairs survive. More  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than half of the population had been wiped out in 1973&hyph;1974 during a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large-scale forest clearing project (A). The remaining birds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to intensive nest predation from rats, macaques, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduced animals (C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

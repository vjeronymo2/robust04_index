			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades IBM debt rating INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' debt rating has been downgraded two notches by Moody's Investor Services. About Dollars 28bn in debt and securities are affected. The debt rating agency cited IBM's increased risks as the primary reason for its decision to downgrade the computer company's long-term debt from A1 to A3. 'IBM's operating results will be under pressure as it seeks to remake itself into a more nimble, customer-focused competitor in the volatile and intensely competitive computer industry,' the agency said. Moody's also cut IBM's short-term debt rating, to Prime-2 from Prime 1, and reduced the preferred stock rating to baa1 from a3, and its shelf registration to (P)A3 from (P)A1. Moody's noted that IBM had taken more than Dollars 28bn in restructuring charges over the past six years. These were connected with efforts to realign cost structure and adjust capacity levels to slowed revenue growth rates and lower margins, with its debt increasing considerably. The agency also said last month's restructuring actions, which included an Dollars 8.9bn charge to cover the costs of cutting 35,000 jobs, would make significant inroads in reducing its operating costs. IBM Deutschland, the group's German subsidiary, plans to continue into 1995 a series of job cuts begun in 1992, according to Mr Hans-Olaf Henkel, chief executive, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.</p>

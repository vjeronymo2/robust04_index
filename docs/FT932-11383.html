			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Export of waste is burying neighbours GERMANY is coming under increasing pressure from its EC partners over its ambitious waste recycling legislation, which many of them believe is stifling their own recycling industries. Germany does not have the processing capacity to deal with the quantities of waste packaging that has to be collected and recycled. As a result, German waste material is being exported to other member states, often with a subsidy, and occupying capacity which is inhibiting the development of indigenous recycling efforts. Britain, backed by France and Spain, submitted a formal complaint at yesterday's meeting of EC industry ministers, calling on the European Commission to act. The Netherlands, Italy, Ireland and Luxembourg echoed the complaint. Environment ministers decided in March to set up a working group to examine the industry in the light of the German waste laws. But the UK is now arguing that unilateral leaps forward in environmental policy can slow the advance of 'green' standards in the EC as a whole, and going it alone can create distortions in the single market. The British document says its plastics recycling sector, still in its infancy, is getting German material 'at zero cost and delivered free of charge, or in some cases with an incentive payment of up to Pounds 200 per tonne'. UK imports of plastic waste rose 450 per cent last year compared with 1991, and the organisation set up by the British plastics industry to collect material cannot compete, the document says. In the more developed recycling industry for paper and board, the UK says its recyclers cannot compete against subsidised imports from Germany. It claims 'this was a major contribution in 10 per cent of UK paper and board manufacturers in the packaging sector being forced out of business in 1992.'</p>

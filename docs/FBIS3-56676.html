			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1900 GMT on 16 January, as part of  the "Voskresenye" program, carries a video compilation of  statements made by Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy. The recorded excerpts come from a Zhirinovskiy  address to the State Duma on 13 January.    Zhirinovskiy is shown standing at the State Duma podium  saying: "One of our party's representatives has said that a  psychiatric examination is required here. I agree. On one side  of this parliament there are quite a lot of candidates for it,  and I'll certainly see to it that it's done in the next two  years, through our intelligence services. And in two years  we'll have papers indicating which ones of you have had which  diseases, and for how long."    The video cuts to a later portion of Zhirinovskiy's address:  "Don't interrupt while.... [shouts] Shut up! [Bangs fist on the  podium] I am speaking here now. Do you expect me to let you  make all this noise while I'm speaking? So get out of the hall,  get out! All of you, get out!" An unidentified voice calls out  to Zhirinovskiy. He continues, "All the candidates for lunatic  asylum." A different unidentified voice says, "Turn the  microphones off, enough of that."    Zhirinovskiy continues: "Go on, stay in your seats. You  haven't spent long enough in prisons under communists! Just  look at you, how many of you there are!"    The video cuts to another portion of Zhirinovskiy's address:  "In the autumn of 1995, most of the people who will be sitting  here will be representatives of real democratic parties, who  will never interrupt a speaker. Yes, that's exactly what I  mean, people repeating `time is up' all the time, and you, Mr.  Chubays, you'll be making this sign when you're in the cell, in  Lefortovo prison. You'll be making this sign [Zhirinovskiy taps  himself on the wrist] in the cell, asking for your lunch."    The video cuts again. Zhirinovskiy says, "I have a different  role, and the party believes we are destined for something  different. We are waiting for other elections."    The video cuts and Zhirinovskiy continues: "I would gladly  have agreed to carry out the functions of leader of the Russian  parliament as it would have been an example, not just for this  country, not just for Europe, but for the whole world. After  all, just two days that I spent in Europe sent the entire planet  reeling, all the diplomats, all the ministers."    The video cuts to Zhirinovskiy saying, "The entire Russian  nation -- not those with guttural speech or dual citizenship --  need me to be in good health."    In the final excerpt of the speech Zhirinovskiy says, "I am  waiting for presidential elections in Russia. And rest assured  that I'll have enough to speak to you about after that."</p>

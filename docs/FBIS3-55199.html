The group held a meeting in the parliamentary centre, where  they approved a declaration about the association. The  declaration says, "the association can and must became a true  centre for the consolidation of all the State Duma's  constructive forces". In the future the association intends to  lobby for parliamentary faction status.    The declaration also states that the independent deputies,  "who were elected in one-seat constituencies and are not  obligated to any of the political parties or movements, are  personally responsible before their voters, the constitution,  and Russia as a whole".    The association promises to base its activity on "the  principles of parliamentary freedom and responsibility, common  sense, political realism and pragmatism, and respect for the  views of other groups and factions".</p>

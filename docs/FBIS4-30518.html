			<p>BFN     [Text] Wellington, June 27 (AFP) -- New Zealand's central  Reserve Bank signalled tighter monetary conditions Monday by  calling for higher interest rates in the face of what it says is  growing inflationary pressure.    The bank is required by law to keep inflation within a zero  to two percent range, and in a six-monthly statement governor  Don Brash cited pressures in the economy that could push  inflation towards the top of the target range over the next 18  months.    "Given the forecast outlook, the bank is comfortable with  the  slightly firmer interest rates seen recently, and some  additional modest firming in monetary conditions would reduce  the risk of inflation going above two percent," Brash said.    "More substantial firming is not yet required but would  almost certainly be needed if signs of inflation pressures  continued to accumulate," Brash said.    The bank did not see inflation taking off, but did forecast  pressures that would push inflation to around 1.7 percent to 1.8  percent in late 1995 and 1996.    "Inflation at those levels would provide little room for  error and, with the economy continuing to grow strongly, we are  more likely to encounter greater, not less, inflation  pressures," he said.    A cautious tightening of monetary conditions at this stage  would, by reducing the risk of a boom/bust economic cycle, help  to extend New Zealand's current robust growth.    "We are in the midst of another period of volatility in  overseas financial markets," he said.    "The bank tries to take a medium-term view of financial  market conditions, rather than reacting to every period of  domestic volatility induced by overseas developments.    "But if such impacts were prolonged or sharp, we could need  to react in order to maintain price stability."    The bank said a distinct uptrend in underlying inflation was  likely to emerge within a year.    "Our forecasts indicate that, in the absence of monetary  restraint, a distinctly upward trend in underlying inflation is  likely to emerge within a year," the bank statement said.    "The outlook for inflation presented in this statement  underlines the importance of setting policy in a forward-looking  manner.    "Inflation is currently near the middle of the forecast  range. Our forecasts indicate that, in the absence of monetary  restraint, a distinctly upward trend in underlying inflation is  likely to emerge within a year.    "This suggests that somewhat firmer monetary conditions than  prevailed in the March quarter are appropriate. Some firming,  mainly through higher interest rates, has already occurred.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Flogas rises to IPounds 7.16m Pre-tax profits of Flogas, a distributor of liquefied petroleum gas, amounted to IPounds 7.16m (Pounds 6.8m) for the 13 months to June 30. That compared with IPounds 6.74m for the 12 months to end-May 1991. The inclusion of the extra month had no impact as a break-even result was achieved for the month - in common with previous years. Sales of the Irish Republic-based group declined to IPounds 48.1m (IPounds 50.5m), principally due to lower selling prices. Net borrowings were reduced by IPounds 1.22m to IPounds 4.03m, some 12 per cent of shareholders' funds. Earnings were static at 23.92p (23.78p) but a final dividend of 4.98p makes a 7.92p (7.41p) total.</p>

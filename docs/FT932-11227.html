			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Thomas Cook bolsters its Canadian operation THOMAS COOK, the travel agency chain which is controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, has acquired Marlin Travel, Canada's largest travel chain, for CDollars 22m (Pounds 11.3m). Thomas Cook said the deal made it the biggest retailer in the Canadian business and leisure travel market with an 11 per cent share and 350 outlets. It is to pay an additional CDollars 3m deferred consideration, subject to Marlin's performance over the next two years. Marlin, which is privately-owned, has 840 employees and 251 outlets in Canadian shopping malls. Mr Rod Marlin and Mr Gary Elliott, its two founders, own 52 per cent of its equity. Thomas Cook said the North American Free Trade Agreement and the integration of the North American travel business had made the strengthening of its Canadian operation a priority. The company has been prevented from operating directly in the US because federal regulations prevent banks from owning travel companies. Until last year, Thomas Cook was owned by Midland Bank. It operates in the US through Thomas Cook Travel US, a franchised organisation.</p>

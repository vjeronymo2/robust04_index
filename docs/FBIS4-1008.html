			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of advertisment by the Independent Forum for Electoral </F> Education; ad shows a sample ballot and offers the following  instructions]    Many people are under the impression that you can vote for  the Provincial Legislature of your choice from any voting  station throughout the country. This is not the case. If you  want to vote for a specific provincial government, you have to  go to that province in order to cast your vote.  <H5>  Different papers </H5>   The ballot papers for Provincial Legislatures are all  different. The reason is that not all the parties which are  standing for elections are standing at both national and  provincial levels. Some will not stand at the national level.  They will only stand in one or more regions. Likewise, a party  standing at national level does not necessarily have to stand in  each of the 9 regions.  <H5>  One national ballot </H5>   The national ballot paper is the only one which will be the  same irrespective of the region where you are voting. This is  why it is the only one which will be issued to all the regions.  <H5>  Home and Away </H5>   If you vote in Johannesburg but your home is in the Western  Cape, you will not be able to vote for the Western Cape  Provincial Legislature. If you want your vote to count in the  Western Cape province you will have to travel to the Western  Cape and vote there.  <H5>  Invisible ink </H5>   Because invisible ink is applied to the hands of those who  have already voted, it will not be possible to vote in one place  for the National Assembly and then vote in another region for  the Provincial Legislature. The ink will still be visible on  the hands of voters even after the voting days are over.    If you work away from your home but want to vote for the  regional government in your home province, you must travel home  to go and vote.  <H5>  THE VOTING STAGES </H5>   At the voting station you will go through the following  steps  to vote. There will be election officials from the IEC  [Independent Electoral Commission] to guide you though the  process. If you need any help, just ask.    1. On entering the voting station, your hands are examined  under ultra-violet light to see if you have already voted.    2. Your ID or temporary voters card is checked and if you  qualify to vote, it will be stamped with an official stamp in  invisible ink.    3. Your hand is marked with invisible ink which can only be  seen under ultra violet light. The ink is harmless and will  wash off after seven days. The ink is only put on your hand to  prevent you from voting more times than you are entitled to in  the election.    4. You are given a ballot paper to vote for the National  Assembly.    5. In secrecy inside a voting booth, you choose one party on  the ballot paper for the National Assembly. If you make a  mistake do not scratch it out. Take the spoilt paper to the  officials and ask for a new paper. Ballot papers with more than  one mark on them are spoilt papers and will not be counted.    6. Place your ballot paper in the ballot box marked  "National  Assembly".    7. You will then be given a second but different ballot  paper  to vote for the Provincial Legislature. This is your vote for  the regional government. The first vote is for the national  government. You can choose the same party you voted for in the  National Assembly, or you can choose a different party. It is  your choice entirely.    8. In secrecy inside a voting booth, choose one party to  represent you in the Provincial Legislature. You must only mark  the paper once. Fold the ballot paper so that no one else sees  how you voted.    9. Place your ballot in the ballot box marked 'Provincial  Legislature'. Now leave the voting station."

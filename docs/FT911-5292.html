			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / US forces in Iraq begin withdrawal to 'buffer zone' US FORCES in southern Iraq have begun to withdraw to a border 'buffer zone' in which they will continue to protect Iraqi refugees, Mr Richard Cheney, the US defence secretary, said yesterday. Thousands of fleeing Kurds and other Iraqis have moved into the Euphrates area since the end of the Gulf war where they have been protected by American troops. 'We clearly are not going to withdraw and end the effort in a way that leaves these people vulnerable, or results in more deaths than otherwise would have occurred,' said Mr Cheney. The 15km-wide buffer zone is 10km in Iraq and 5km in Kuwait. US troops will provide protection and relief until the area can be turned over to international authorities. The Iraqi military was yesterday continuing its attacks on Kurdish rebel-held northern areas a day after President Saddam Hussein told refugees they had nothing to fear if they returned to their homes. The Iraqi leader, making one of his now rare public appearances, visited the Kurdish town of Irbil near the Turkish border at the weekend and repeated his amnesty offer. 'What is past is past. We are starting anew,' Mr Saddam told local Ba'ath party officials. In Baghdad, a United Nations delegation began talks on the refugee crisis. Mr Eric Suy, a Belgian official leading the team, met Mr Saadoun Hammadi, Iraq's prime minister, and other government officials yesterday. Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, arrived in Tehran, the Iranian capital, on Saturday, to determine the refugees' immediate needs. In south-east Turkey yesterday a massive relief airdrop by US, UK and French aircraft was continuing. Two UK Chinook helicopters made their first drops near Semdinli on the border, where bad roads have hampered efforts to reach thousands of refugees. The Chinooks will be joined by an additional seven helicopters. The US is also deploying 16 helicopters at a base near the border to ferry emergency aid. The first of 3,500 US soldiers deployed to help in the relief effort arrived at a port in southern Turkey yesterday aboard three warships. At Van, an Ilyushin transport aircraft carrying EC food and medical aid arrived over the weekend. The government in Ankara is under increased pressure to relent on its policy of confining the refugees to border areas where lack of accessibility and the severe climate is threatening the relief effort.

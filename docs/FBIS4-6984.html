			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Economic Planning Chief  Manae Kubota expressed concern Friday [22 April] about a ruling  coalition agreement that apparently paves the way for a hike in  the consumption tax.    Expressing her personal opinion at a regular news conference  after a morning cabinet meeting, the director general of the  Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said, "I am worried that it might  have a bad effect on the economy."    Kubota urged that conditions be attached to any tax change,  such as putting such an overhaul in the context of  administrative reform, cutting unnecessary spending and  reviewing government subsidies.    The Social Democratic Party, of which Kubota is a member,  compromised on taxes early Friday, agreeing to shift the tax  burden away from such direct levies as income taxes and toward  indirect taxation with "the understanding of the people."    Kubota said her fellow socialists appeared to have "jumped  the gun" in agreeing to the tax overhaul before details have  been worked out, although she stressed that she had not heard  details of the agreement.    She said it is easy to take the tax overhaul as a rehash of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's failed attempt to replace the  3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare  tax," which Kubota branded as just a change of packaging while  leaving the content the same.    Noting that she had opposed the introduction in April 1989  of  the consumption tax, Kubota apologized to the women's groups  with whom she had worked to block the levy.</p>

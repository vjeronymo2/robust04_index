			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Ho Liang-liang (0149 </F> 0081 0081): "Sidelights of Zhu Rongji's Inspection in Jilin"]    [Text] Changchun, 25 June (WEN WEI PO)--Between 14 and 18  June, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji inspected work in Jilin Province,  helped the province solve problems arising in economic  development, and discussed major economic issues with principal  party and government leaders of the province.    Zhu Rongji's entourage included more than 60 senior  officials  from various ministries and commissions of the State Council.  They were divided into six separate groups for investment  projects, state-owned enterprises, rural fair markets, financial  and taxation affairs, foreign trade, and banking affairs. They  joined the departments and enterprises concerned in Jilin in  considering and resolving various problems.    Zhu Rongji himself focused attention on the grain issue and  problems with the large state-owned enterprises. Jilin is  China's largest commodity grain production base. On 10 June,  the prices of various foodstuffs in all parts of China were  raised. Zhu Rongji inquired in detail about the prices,  storage, and circulation of grain in Jilin. In Gongzhuling  City, which is located south of Changchun, Zhu Rongji inspected  the state's grain reserve warehouses and visited local peasants  and a rural fair market. When Zhu was told by local grain  officials that they did not issue even one single IOU to  peasants last year, Zhu Rongji said seriously: "IOUs have  become a thing of the past and will never appear any more." When  Zhu Rongji called on peasant Zhou Shuwen, the host said that he  regretted having sold grain too early and not waiting until  grain prices were raised. Zhu Rongji smiled and said: "This  year, you can still sell grain at the good price. As long as  you make efforts to produce more grain and also develop  sidelines, you will certainly build up a family fortune." Zhou  Shuwen's daughter gave the guests strawberries the family grew  themselves. Zhu Rongji said wittily: "The girls here are  prettier than those in Changchun."    At the fair market, Zhu Rongji inquired about grain prices.  When being told that grain prices had not increase but slightly  decreased, Zhu Rongji was pleased. At a meeting, he said that  without substantial agricultural development, there would be no  substantial development in the economy as a whole, and the state  must adopt macroeconomic measures to effectively stabilize the  price of chemical fertilizer when raising the grain prices.    On the afternoon of 17 June, Zhu Rongji met with officials  of  the relevant departments of Jilin Province, and expressed his  opinion on various economic issues. When talking about the  national economic situation, Zhu Rongji said: The situation is  good, not just ordinarily good but very good, much better than  that in the same period of last year. As for the situation in  Jilin, Zhu said: The situation is good; there remains great  potential; the momentum of develop will last; difficulties still  exist; and there are also solutions. On the spot, the officials  of the relevant ministries and commissions of the State Council  solved 21 of the 22 issues the Jilin provincial authorities  requested assistance with from the central authorities. The  central authorities also decided to give a certain amount of  financial subsidies to Jilin in order to help the province boost  its economy.    Zhu Rongji's team worked with high efficiency, and they  often  worked late into the night. They often did not eat at the same  time, and those who finished the meal might leave first in order  to continue their work. The time for social courtesy was  reduced.    At an evening show held in Changchun City, Zhu Rongji  listened to famous Peking opera singer Zhang Chunqiu's recital,  and applauded while listening to a local official's explanation  of the story. The opera singer recognized Zhu Rongji and asked  him to play the erhu. Zhu gladly and skillfully played the erhu  to accompany the singing. The audience applauded, and the  atmosphere was animate.    Some senior provincial officials told this reporter that Zhu  Rongji's inspection tour gave substantial assistance to the  province in solving some major issues, and the concerted efforts  made by the central and local authorities were inspiring. They  said that Vice Premier Zhu's highly efficient style of work was  impressive and also set a good example for us.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, May 6 (AFP)--Southern forces fired six Scud  long-range missiles at economic and civilian targets in Yemen's  capital on Friday, but without causing damage or casualties, the  northern General People's Congress (GPC) said.    A GPC spokesman, quoted by the official news agency SABA',  said one of the missiles exploded near Sanaa international  airport and another three in mountainous areas. It gave no  location for the other two.    "These missiles caused only horror for children, women and  the elderly," said the spokesman, warning that the southern  forces of the Yemen Socialist Party would be tried for war  crimes.    He denied earlier reports from the south that the  presidential palace in Sanaa had been hit.    With Yemen's four-year-old union in peril, President 'Ali  Abdallah Salih's GPC has said its troops are bearing down on the  southern port city of Aden with the aim of capturing it.    The forces of Salih, a northerner, are locked in a bitter  struggle with those of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a  southerner, who was dismissed by parliament on Thursday night at  the end of a first day of heavy fighting.    Southern officials said their planes had hit the  presidential  palace with missiles and set it ablaze.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Brussels PM trips over his tongue - FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels Belgium's francophone Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemings set prickly standards of even-handedness in the use of language. They require ministers often to switch judiciously back and forward between the two, even in press conferences. The Flemish community was not amused therefore by a surreptitious deal at the October Brussels summit by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's Flemish-speaking prime minister. With his 11 colleagues, he agreed that the official languages used by the new European trade marks office to be set up in Spain would be cut from the nine employed now to five - English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. Flemish politicians found out when the Netherlands complained that this would heap discriminatory costs on Dutch industry. There was a brief flurry of tit-for-tat vetoes. Since the Dutch were holding up Spain's trade marks office, Spain blocked the go-ahead for Europol, the EU criminal intelligence unit to be set up in The Hague. A row erupted over language-use in the Eurocorps, the joint Franco-German-Belgian army unit (fighting languages: French and German) which Spain is now set to join. This particularly exercised the Flemish press. The memory still rankles of Flemish troops dying needlessly in the first world war because they could not understand the orders of their overwhelmingly francophone officer class. They also discovered that the Dutch word for 'fire' is remarkably like the Spanish vernacular for a more intimate form of engagement. The 12 found a complicated way round the trade marks office problem this week, but then Flemish MPs reopened the controversy in the Belgian parliament. It was likely the summit conclusions would have to say something linguistically correct to mollify them. This, one Dutch diplomat said, would need to be 'All EU languages are equal, but some are more equal than others.'</p>

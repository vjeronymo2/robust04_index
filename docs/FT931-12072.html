			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Truth of the Matter: A mid-winter pilgrimage - Nigel Spivey pays his respects to Athens, the city which gave birth to democracy MAKING A pilgrimage to Athens in midwinter has much to recommend it. Strong winds pummel at the city's miasma of smog, and temperatures are rarely more than a little fresh. Tavernas put out tables on the pavement, and women are in furs for status, not insulation. But it is timely for more than considerations of comfort. Athens is celebrating a birth. The city invites you to pay your respects to its most nimble and long-lived offspring: democracy, born here 2,500 years ago. As one might expect, given the recent collapse of walls and iron curtains, much is being made of the anniversary, with scholars and politicians joining all sorts of jamborees. I made my own visit last month, for a conference organised by the American School at Athens, called 'The Archaeology of Democracy' . To he a pilgrim to democracy's birthplace is more satisfying than the history books might imply. Relatively little is known about the supposed progenitor of Athenian democracy, Kleisthenes. No statues exist to him. And rightly so, perhaps. Such frugal sources as we possess regarding him suggest that he is a wheeler-dealer: not a man of the people, but an aristocrat seeking to upstage rivals by engaging popular support. Kleisthenes is credited with a series of manoeuvres during 508 and 507 BC which included a decimal system of voting districts (designed to reflect the interests of rural as well as urban areas), and a five-hundred strong council elected by those districts. Whatever Kleisthenes himself called these manoeuvres, later Greek commentators were in no doubt: it was the beginning of demokratia, literally 'people-power'. So much for Kleisthenes. The relics of the political system which was rapidly established in his wake are, however, more substantial than his historical presence. For more than 60 years American archaeologists have been excavating within the hub of ancient Athens, the Agora. To translate that as 'the marketplace' understates its function in the topography of democratic Athens. It was the principal point of traffic, negotiation and general hob-nobbing in the city; it was also host to most of the monuments and institutions one would now describe as 'civic'. Democracy in classical Athens never sold itself short. The Athenians were proud of it: they made a fetish and a cult of it. Democracy was still infantile when Athenian citizens went to defend it against invading Persians. The Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, when the Persian hordes were held off Greece by a small and mainly Athenian detachment, has been described (by John Stuart Mill) as a more important event in British history than the Battle of Hastings. Had the Athenians lost - so this logic goes - we all might now be subjects of Saddam Hussein or some other oriental tyrant. The archaeology of Athenian democracy is presented by its American excavators with a particular sense of communion. Thomas Jefferson, we learn, had classical Athens uppermost as the ideal of his own political activity. And Americans believe that their version of democracy approximates more closely to the Greek ideal than most others. The American excavations have revealed not only the foundations of the various council buildings and meeting places in the Agora. Much of the minutiae of democratic protocol has also emerged. Ballot boxes, voting tokens, little water-clocks for timing speeches: these testify to the scrupulous building-in of safety devices to protect the system from corruption. There was always the fear that someone might aggregate too much power for himself: hence the process of ostracism, introduced very soon after Kleisthenes, which served as an annual opportunity for the citizens to banish anyone looking too big for their boots. It was a quaint process: names were inscribed on old shards of pottery, and by a simple majority the person with most shards (ostraka) went into exile from the city and its hinterland for ten years. And it worked simply: the popular assembly (the ekklesia) decided whether to hold an ostracism vote; that decided, so long as the basic quorum of 6,000 citizens voted, the most unpopular nomination departed Athens within ten days. After his exile, he returned to take up full citizenship. Examples of the inscribed shards survive by the thousand: you see a nice range of them in the Agora Museum. One can hardly help thinking of modern equivalents for some of these processes. So it might be convenient to see ostracism as simply replaced with ordeal by media: in cases like that of David Mellor, the 'popular' press certainly justified its campaign as being in 'the public interest'. But wandering about the ruins of Athens, it is not so much the familiarity of democracy as its peculiarity that strikes one. Take the site of the popular assembly, the Pnyx: a terraced hillside where the popular assembly met. True, it could only accommodate 6,000 citizens - roughly one fifth of the voting population - but this is still an astonishing proportion of voters actually involved in decison-making. The more one ponders the natural habitat of these ancient political animals, the more one realises the extent of the gulf between their concept of democracy and our own. Apart from the widespread indifference shown towards politics by the citizens of most modern democracies, there is the matter of time: unless you had slaves and other types excluded from politics (in ancient Athens, that included women and foreigners), you would hardly have time to get so involved in 'people-power'. And is a device like ostracism really akin to the strategic smut campaigns conducted by newspapers reliant on smut (political or otherwise) for their sales? In this respect the ruins of Athens are misleading. The city was highly self-conscious about its image. The monuments of Athenian democracy are easily confused with the monuments of Athenian imperialism, and become loosely re-employed as totems of order and stability. Thus the Greeks are using the Parthenon as a backdrop to their claim to the name of Macedonia; and IBM likes to use the Parthenon as a symbol of computers which never go wrong. The totemic force of Athenian ruins lulls us into a sense of familiarity with their political system. We tend to overlook the fact that democracy was designed for a city-state, not a nation, nor even a community of nations. We tend to overlook the fact that it had an economic basis completely different from the basis of market forces. Were it possible to recall Plato and Aristotle - neither of whom regarded democracy as anything like an ideal political arrangement - they would both be staggered that, 2,000 years on, the world still celebrates what Kleisthenes started. But that, in a sense, is beside the point. The lineage claimed by modern democracy may be spurious, but it has been so widely believed by so many for so long that there is no use in disowning it. If classical Athenian democracy is not a durable institution, its mythology certainly is.</p>

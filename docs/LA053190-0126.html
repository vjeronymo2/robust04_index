			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: HIPSTER DINOSAURS  </P> <P> Dinosaurs may no longer grace the earth, but don't tell that to Stella  Stegosaurus and Dinah Diplodocus.  </P> <P> They and a host of other prehistoric creatures are part of an acclaimed musical  adventure titled "Dinosaur Rock."  </P> <P> The children's quasi-rock opera will be performed at 7 p.m. today in the  Ventura High School Auditorium.  </P> <P> An award-winning children's album in 1984, "Dinosaur Rock" was adapted for the  stage, its original songs performed by a septet of walking, talking and dancing  dinosaurs.  </P> <P> "It's education through entertainment," said Brian Bemel, director of the  Ventura Children's Festival. "The kids have a high interest in dinosaurs," he  said. "Through the play and song, they are introduced to the different types,  as well as such things as the theory of evolution."  </P> <P> A yodeling paleontologist has the magical power to give life to a museum  collection of dinosaurs. In a mixture of musical styles, from rock and swing to  bluegrass and polka, seven reptiles portray their extinction and more.  </P> <P> Ventura High School Auditorium, is located at 2155 E. Main St., Ventura.  Tickets are $6.50, $4.50 for children. Call 648-5251 or 650-9688.  </P></p>

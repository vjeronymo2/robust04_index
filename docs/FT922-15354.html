			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Caterpillar in first rail market step CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment and a manufacturer of heavy-duty engines, signed an agreement yesterday to provide engines for railway locomotives made by Morrison Knudsen, a large engineering, construction and manufacturing group. In its first step into the rail market, Caterpillar will provide engines for shunting, commuter and freight locomotives that will be built by Morrison Knudsen. The total North American locomotive market is estimated at some 400 to 500 units annually, with prices ranging from Dollars 1.5m to Dollars 2m each. While General Electric and General Motors dominate the market now, officials of both companies believe that the prospects for their new products are good. They expect demand for locomotives to increase during the 1990s and believe they have the new products that will respond to changes in the industry.</p>

The agreement was  reached by Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi and his  Russian counterpart Anatoliy Adamishin, currently here to  discuss regional and bilateral issues with Iranian officials.    Adamishin, who arrived here last Friday, said that there was  proper grounds for Tehran-Moscow cooperation to resolve  Tajikistan disputes. Referring to the endeavors made by the  Islamic Republic to bring an end to the disputes, Va'ezi  reiterated that Iran, like before, would continue efforts to  establish a just peace in Tajikistan.    Any effort should be based on existing realities inside  Tajikistan and be aimed at resolving people's problems, Va'ezi  added, stressing that the best way to this end was formation of  a government able to materialize national aspirations of the  Tajik people.

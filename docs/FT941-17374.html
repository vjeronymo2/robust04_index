			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Venezuela oil group's earnings leap Venezuela's national oil company's net earnings climbed to more than Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 870m) last year, sharply up from Dollars 338m in 1992, according to official estimates. The increase came despite weak international oil prices and a heavy domestic tax burden. Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), one of the world's largest oil companies, had a 1993 operating profit of Dollars 7.4bn on gross revenues of Dollars 21.6bn. However, it paid Dollars 5.6bn in taxes. In 1992 the group's operating profit was Dollars 7.7bn on gross revenues of Dollars 21.4bn. It paid Dollars 7.2bn in taxes. The company's profitability was boosted by greater efficiency and productivity, reorganisation of some functional areas and less burdensome taxes, officials said. Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's minister of energy and mines, said the company would make capital investments of Dollars 4.2bn this year, the highest figure in the company's 19-year history. Its 1994 investment plan should provide a shot in the arm for Venezuela's flagging economy, which logged 1 per cent negative GDP growth last year. Mr Parra said most of the capital outlays this year would go to projects for increasing PDVSA's crude oil production capacity and for upgrading its two largest home refineries. Capital outlays in 1993 were Dollars 3.7bn. PDVSA, which has substantial equity holdings in oil refining and distribution companies in the US and Europe, is carrying out a 10-year, Dollars 48.5bn capital investment programme. One of its main goals is to raise oil production potential to at least 4m barrels a day by the year 2002. The company planned to contract new international debt of about Dollars 637m this year to help finance its investment programme, the minister said. It ended 1993 with total indebtedness of Dollars 4.2bn. Security was increased in Venezuela's overcrowded prisons yesterday after a riot and mass breakout at two separate institutions left more than 100 prisoners dead.</p>

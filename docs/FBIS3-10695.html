Following the ceremony held at the  Joint Telecommunications Complex [Contel] Satellite Control  Center in Ixtapalapa, Secretary Gamboa spoke on the importance  of the Solidaridad I satellite, which replaced Morelos I.    [Gamboa] "I would say we will take an important step in  productivity and efficiency, as demanded by Mexican society and  the entire world. I am sure the finance, education, trade, and  educational sectors will be better prepared, and they will be  much more productive and competitive with the Solidaridad I  satellite."    He said the range of services offered by Solidaridad I will  render every sector of the country more efficient, and he  announced that the Solidaridad II satellite will be launched in  October.    [Gamboa] "I am very pleased that the Solidaridad I satellite  will primarily help in social aspects which are needed by Mexico  today -- in the education and rural telephone communications  sectors."    At the farewell ceremony for Morelos I, Mr. Andres Massieu,  assistant secretary of communications and technological  development at the SCT [Communications and Transportation  Secretariat] spoke of a new generation of satellites.    [Massieu] "It make it possible for us to meet the challenge  of extending telephone service to rural areas with smaller, low  cost telephone exchanges to meet the needs of communities that  have less than 500 inhabitants, are scattered throughout the  national territory, and have critical communication problems due  to the country's geography."    Roger Diaz de Cossio, special projects coordinator at the  education secretariat, spoke of the high school television  service that reaches more than 8,000 schools.    [Diaz] "High school education through television is the only  education service we offer the underprivileged and poor with a  better quality than that of conventional services."    He said this is an economic education model that makes it  possible to provide a high school education to a town with 500  residents and a junior high school from which only 10 students  graduate each year. He said states such as Oaxaca, Chiapas,  Durango, and Veracruz have three to five times more high schools  using the television system than the conventional system. He  said the high school television system is the only option to  improve the service in Indian zones. He pointed out that only  by expanding this service and attending the needs of elementary  and junior high schools every year, will we allow the Mexican  people to have a 10th grade education average. He said that  1994 will be an important year during which 10,000 parabolic  antennas will be installed in high schools using the television  system, and a digital system will be used to transmit and  receive the signals.    Mr. Roberto Hernandez, chairman of the Mexican Banker's  Association said:    [Hernandez] "The government thus reaffirms its firm  determination to guarantee that telecommunications will become a  powerful catalyst for the competitive spirit our economy needs."    The ceremony was also attended by Telecomm  [Telecommunications of Mexico] General Director Carlos (Neri  Teran), as well as businessmen and Televisa representatives.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / US Treasury official set to join JP Morgan MR Charles Dallara, one of the US Treasury's key international officials for the past decade, is leaving the administration to join JP Morgan, the New York banking company, writes Peter Riddell in Washington. He will start at Morgan in June as a managing director, working in the international area and dealing, in particular, with emerging market economies in eastern Europe and Latin America. Aged 42, Mr Dallara has spent virtually all his career in the Treasury, where he has been assistant secretary since early 1989. Previously, he was the US executive director on the International Monetary Fund board. As deputy to Mr David Mulford, the Treasury's top international official, Mr Dallara has been at the heart of the US's more active role in international financial policy in recent years. He has been especially involved in the structural impediment initiative (SII) talks with Japan, intended to open markets, and in recent discussions over burden sharing in the Gulf crisis, as well as the regular series of Group of Seven meetings. He said yesterday that he was leaving the Treasury partly for financial reasons - he has two children approaching college age and wants to be able to safeguard their position. It is not unusual for someone with Mr Dallara's experience to spend some time in the private sector before returning to government at a more senior level.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Hungary acts to accelerate privatisation Hungary's new Socialist-led government has sacked eight of the 10 board members of AV Rt, the state holding company, and is investigating its general manager for alleged corruption as part of a wide-ranging shake-up of privatisation. It has appointed four new board members and an acting president to oversee the AV Rt until a replacement for Mr Lajos Csepi as general manager is found. It is investigating charges that Mr Csepi misused funds, forged documents and abused his position. Mr Csepi became head of the AV Rt shortly after it was set up in 1992 to manage the 160 companies in which the state wished to sell strategic stakes but retain majority ownership. The government said the move was one of several designed to speed up privatisation and to restore public confidence in the process in the wake of several corruption scandals. In future, the state would place more emphasis on privatising companies via cash sales, flotation on the stock market and through sales to institutional investors, officials said. Until now trade sales to strategic partners, often through tender, have been Hungary's preferred privatisation method. However, investors have complained of influence-trafficking and long bureaucratic delays in privatisation negotiations. The government has already begun an investigation into privatisation under the previous administration and, in particular, the 320 companies sold off between April and June just before the change of government. Hungarian police said yesterday they would continue their clampdown on illegal immigrants despite protests from foreign embassies and business groups in Budapest. The police said they would use powers granted in a law which came into effect this month to enter private homes to check up on foreigners. The statement came after a month-long series of raids on restaurants, hotels and other night spots frequented by foreigners. More than 100,000 people, including 15,000 foreigners, had been checked since September 9, the police said. Western businessmen in Budapest said the raids were counter-productive and would hurt the government's drive to attract more foreign investment. Foreign companies have complained about new immigration rules which require expatriates working in Hungary to apply for three permits and to be tested for the HIV virus.</p>

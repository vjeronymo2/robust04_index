			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: Flawed and unworkable Sir, Was there ever a clearer sign that the financial world lacks leadership than that displayed by the Abbey National in its proposals for tax credits to those who sell houses at a loss ('House sales boost urged as prices fall further', August 4)? It was sad to watch an embarrassed Sir Christopher Tugendhat making proposals to the government that could only have been designed to catch the headlines. So flawed and unworkable is the idea of tax credits for capital losses on house sales that one shudders at the mentality of those running one of Britain's largest banks.

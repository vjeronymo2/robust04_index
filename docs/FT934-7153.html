			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Sport: A millionaire's dented ego - Tennis CHRISTMAS comes a little early in the world of professional tennis. This week the eight men competing in the IBM / ATP Tour Championship in Frankfurt will divide between them Dollars 2.75m. In three weeks' time five of the men from Frankfurt will be joined by another 11 in Munich to contest the Dollars 6m Compaq Grand Slam Cup, with its record first prize of Dollars 1.5m. I think Santa Claus can safely afford to strike 19 names from his list of calls this year. The ridiculous thing is that the players themselves will not be thinking about the money. They do not need to; the wolf has long ago given up calling at their addresses. What does matter to these battle-scarred competitors is self-fulfilment. In a highly charged individual sport where egos are dented with each defeat, success is everything. Yet, inevitably there will be losses. Coping with this mental pressure is one of the most difficult lessons a professional sportsman has to learn. The people who have exploited this simple but fundamental fact are the sports psychologists. Ever since Timothy Gallwey's Inner Tennis appeared in 1975 the gurus have proliferated. All they have done is to dress up in new clothing the techniques used over the years by successful coaches like Australia's Harry Hopman and Maureen Connolly's adviser 'Teach' Tennant. These people, and others who have followed like Nick Bollettieri and Bob Brett, have been great motivators. There has been interesting evidence in Frankfurt this week of the negative and positive aspects of this process. Take Pete Sampras and Jim Courier, for instance. Boyhood pals when they had attended the Bollettieri Academy in Florida, Jim and Pete won their first important title together in Rome in 1989. I remember Pete's excitement in the locker room afterwards when he was struggling with the local telephone system while trying to relay the good news to his parents that he and Jim had just become the Italian Open doubles champions. There was little thought then that the friends would become such rivals. In February last year Jim rose to the top of the world rankings, a position from which he was displaced by Pete last April. Inevitably their relationship was under strain. 'We're not as close as when I first turned pro (1988). We don't really talk but we're still good friends,' Sampras had said at the time. Then Courier lost his French title to Sergi Bruguera in a final he should have won. His ego was clearly dented. It was a mark of the skill of his coaches, Jose Higueras and Brad Stine, that Courier was able to bounce back from that disappointment to reach the Wimbledon final against Sampras. No-one had expected him to go as far. But, well as he played (and if he had taken the fourth set against a tiring opponent I believe he might have won), Jim still lost once more to his rival. Another dent for the ego. At the US Open top seeded Courier, who had briefly regained the No 1 ranking, crashed to the Frenchman, Cedric Pioline in the fourth round. The ego buckled further. Sampras inflicted more damage by winning the tournament to re-establish himself atop the computer list. Before Frankfurt began Sampras had made certain of ending the year as the No 1, a fact that must have contributed to some very odd behaviour from Courier this week. Once he had lost his opening match to Michael Chang - a 6-4 6-0 drubbing that suggested a fatalistic approach to the week's events - Courier must have known he would not reach the final as he had done last year. Yet afterwards he had bravely claimed 'I can still win it. Remember I lost one of my round-robin matches last year.' Behind the scenes Higueras was working overtime. By Wednesday he had persuaded Jim that he was going to beat Andrei Medvedev and then tame Michael Stich yesterday to reach this afternoon's semi-finals. The first part of the plan almost worked. In spite of seeming more interested in reading a novel at the changes of ends instead of thinking about his tactics, Jim actually served for the match against the Ukrainian and held four match points before losing 6-3 1-6 7-6. His comments afterwards revealed an attempt to protect the ego from further damage by pulling the blinkers firmly over his mind's eye. 'My concentration has never been better. I have never been more focused. ' he claimed. 'But why were you reading Maybe The Moon,' he was asked. 'It's an interesting book. I just felt like reading it.' he said. It cannot be easy for the official World Champion to accept that he is no longer the best player in the world. Ivan Lendl has found it difficult to admit that his career among the top players is over. The same realisation has been painful for Boris Becker. The brilliant winner here last year, Boris failed to earn a place this time. Like another former No 1, Stefan Edberg, whose form also seems to be slipping, he must now face other priorities - marriage and parenthood. Sampras understood. 'It's been a pretty frustrating year for Jim. When you come so close to winning two Grand Slams . . . and I can relate to that after losing to Edberg in '91 (in the US Open final) . . . it can be frustrating. He's just burnt out, he needs some time off, get his batteries charged up for Australia. He'll be fine. I mean he's got a good head on his shoulders' he said. This from a man who admitted that his loss to Courier at the 1991 US Open had: 'got the monkey off my back' following a year of mental anguish in the wake of becoming the youngest ever US champion in 1990. Yes, the mature 22-year-old, battle-hardened in the cauldron of competition and well advised by his coach of two years, Tim Gullikson, knew exactly how his friend felt.</p>

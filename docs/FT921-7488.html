			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Optical disc doubles data HOW do you cram more data on your optical disc? The answer could be a technique developed by Toshiba in Japan which, the company says, will more than double the data recording density of today's optical disc-based recording systems. Using a visible red laser diode, made from indium gallium aluminium phosphide (InGaAlP), researchers have managed to squeeze 72 megabytes of data - enough to record about 14m words - on to one square inch of disc space. The laser operates at the relatively short wavelength of 690 nanometres, producing a smaller beam size which enables data to be recorded at a higher density. Toshiba: Japan, 03 3457 4511.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Ukraine says nuclear fears are unfounded UKRAINIAN officials yesterday rejected Russian claims that Ukraine was unable to guarantee the safety of the nuclear missiles on its territory and accused Russia of using them as part of a wider effort to re-establish its hegemony in the region. 'We are witnessing an effort to return to the old division of the world into two blocs controlled by two super-powers,' said Mr Boris Tarasiuk, Ukrainian deputy foreign minister. In a reference to the expansionist drive which built up the Russian empire in the 17th century, Mr Tarasiuk said that Moscow was pursuing 'a new gathering of the lands, a renewal of the federation, or of the Russian Empire'. Mr Tarasiuk said that Russia's newly aggressive stance, most apparent in President Boris Yeltsin's weekend call for Russia to be given a free hand to police the former Soviet Union, presented the west with an historic choice. 'The question right now is whether the countries of the world will support the new world order and will respect international law or whether they will give in to the temptation to view might as right,' Mr Tarasiuk said. He warned that recent Russian allegations that Ukraine is unable to guarantee the safety of the nuclear weapons located on its territory were just one element in a wider range of issues which 'taken together constitute a dangerous tendency in Russian policy toward Ukraine.' Mr Tarasiuk said that recent Russian claims to Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet and threats to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine were part of the same wider policy. Russian claims that Ukraine was preventing Russian technicians from servicing the nuclear weapons in Ukraine and consequently creating a safety hazard were false, Mr Tarasiuk said.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (8): No MBAs among the masters - LSE insists that it is really not a 'business' school at all THE LOUD fanfares greeting the recent entry of Oxford and Cambridge into the management school firmament were notably absent from the reception given to another of the UK's elite academic institutions, the London School of Economics (LSE). To be fair, so obsessed was the LSE with schemes to transplant itself to County Hall, facing the Houses of Parliament across the Thames, that its more fruitful projects were easy to miss. It is now two and a half years since the LSE, Britain's leading social science university, established an Institute of Management. The institute is already a highly-rated undergraduate school, and it is now about to launch both masters and doctoral programmes. The biggest feather in its cap, however, is its status as the UK representative in the Community of European Management Schools (CEMS). CEMS is a consortium of eleven top European management schools. Collectively it runs exchange schemes and aims to produce an integrated academic curriculum for management schools across the Continent. Other members of CEMS include Rotterdam's Erasmus University, Vienna's Wirtschaftsuniversitat and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales at Paris. The institute's director, Professor Peter Abell, insists that his charge is not a business school. 'We are an explicitly inter-disciplinary management institute playing to a niche - the strength of our social science faculties. We are not a vocational training school for business studies. We do not do an MBA, nor will we; and all the appointments to the institute are joint appointments with other departments.' He does not mince his words as to why. 'There is some fairly clear evidence that the sort of people appointed to business schools are not the best academics.' By implication, 'business studies' are not thought to be much academic cop either - a sentiment shared by a large part of the academic community in Britain. Abell puts it more tactfully: 'We are concerned with the management applications of rigorous study of the main branches of social science, not with economics, and so on, as 'add ons' to courses in 'business''. When this coming September's intake of undergraduates arrives, the institute will have more than a hundred first degree students. Four-fifths of last year's recruits were from abroad; with most attaining or exceeding the institute's 'conditional entry' standard of three A-level grades at ABB (or the equivalent in academic standing), they are among the best qualified students at the LSE. The institute's masters programme in management is due to be launched next year, with 'advanced management theory' at its core and options on subjects such as international relations, development studies, and mathematics and statistics to follow. Its doctoral programme emphasises inter-disciplinary research and quantitative methods. Two aspects of the CEMS exercise have a direct bearing on the institute. These are the requirement to have corporate partners, and the exchange scheme with fellow members. The LSE's corporate partners, British Airways and Coopers and Lybrand, have a role in curriculum development, and they will be expected, in due course, to arrange placements for students. All UK-resident students do an internship in another country; by the end of their courses they are expected to be competent in three languages. If the emphasis on economic theory and international relations marks the LSE apart, its growth projections appear to be Xeroxed from the typical business school of yesteryear. It wants to double in size, 'in due course'.</p>

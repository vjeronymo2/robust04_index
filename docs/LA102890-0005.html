			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> BRUCKNER: Symphony No. 5. NDR Orchestra, conducted by Gunter Wand. RCA Victor  60361-2-RC (compact disc).  </P> <P> A skeptical consumer might wonder why RCA Victor is remaking its Wand-Bruckner  cycle when Wand's perfectly good earlier one, vintage 1974-1981, is still in  its catalogue. There certainly are some differences in this new Fifth -- more  expressive, flexible phrasing from the wise old veteran conductor, a better  orchestra with less raucous brass, slightly superior live digital sound. Yet  Wand's basic overview remains the same, an invigorating, straight-ahead  approach that only taps moderately into Bruckner's spiritual depths. RICHARD S.  GINELL  </P></p>

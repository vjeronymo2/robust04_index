			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICK OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> The Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet  Singing in America will hold its 44th benefit concert at the Pasadena Civic  Auditorium, 300 E. Green St. Tickets are $10 for the 8 p.m. show Friday and $12  for the 8 p.m. show Saturday.  </P> <P> The show features championship groups competing in such categories as song  arrangement, stage presence and balance and blend of voices.  </P> <P> Each quartet wears costumes appropriate to the group's name. For instance, the  "Chordiac Arrests" are costumed in surgical greens. The four men in the group  began singing together in 1987 and while technically and musically excellent,  they poke fun at many hallowed medical traditions with their lyrics and  harmony.  </P> <P> Proceeds will go to the Institute of Logopedics in Wichita, Kan., which  provides comprehensive programs focusing on communication for people who have  speech handicaps.  </P></p>

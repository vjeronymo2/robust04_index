			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Upturn reported in pay settlements The first pay settlements of the year suggest a modest upturn in the level of rises, with a growing number of private-sector deals at 3 per cent and above, Incomes Data Services, the information and research organisation, says. IDS said negotiations over pay were likely to become tougher. The inflation rate for January was expected to be 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent and there was growing awareness of the impact of the tax and National Insurance increases coming into effect in April. Similar predictions are made by Industrial Relations Services, also a research organisation, in its latest analysis of pay and benefits. It says that a car worker on Pounds 12,750 a year will pay about 2.83 per cent of salary in extra tax by April next year as a result of the Budget. A top civil servant earning more than Pounds 90,000 will pay less than 1 per cent more of earnings.</p>

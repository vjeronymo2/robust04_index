			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Is Being Asked of New Prime Minister Hata"] </F>   [Text] Mr. Tsutomu Hata was named prime minister in  plenary sessions of the two Diet houses on 25 April. He is the  80th prime minister, and the 51st person to serve as prime  minister.    We hope newly appointed Prime Minister Hata will take over  the intent of "reform government" pursued by former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and will go forward with courage  toward fundamental reform of the nation's political, economic,  and administrative systems.    Upon the launching of the new government, we would like to  ask the following two points of Prime Minister Hata.    The first is his basic stand on political reform.    Mr. Hata is regarded as a relatively clean politician who  has  pursued the tasks of political reform with passion since he was  with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], thus winning himself  the nickname of "Mr. Political Reform."    We completely agree with his purpose, declaring that if  plutocratic corruption cannot be removed, there will be no  future for the politics of Japan.    We also respect his determination shown in leaving the LDP  after concluding that the LDP has no will to carry out political  reform, and in deciding to head newly formed Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] to make it a front-runner in the first stage of  reorganization of the political world.    But there is a problem with what happened after that. What  has been done in political reform? To be sure, political  reform-related bills have been passed, but they are political  reform bills in name only, with loopholes everywhere.    While the song of political reform was being sung, huge  election campaign funds were spent by political parties in the  general election to get new faces elected. Later, the general  contractor scandal involving Shinseito General Secretary Ichiro  Ozawa surfaced and the suspicion of Prime Minister Hosokawa  having used Sagawa Kyubin money was raised, but there has been  no leadership mobilized to delve into the facts of these matters.    The four characters "sei-ji-rin-ri" [political ethics] in  new  policy guidelines which the ruling coalition parties had agreed  on in establishing the coalition government have disappeared  completely. The political history of Mr. Hata, who belonged to  the Tanaka faction and then the Takeshita faction, is one that  tells he was right in the middle of the LDP's plutocratic  politics. He has not yet cleared himself in this regard.    When asked about his possible links to plutocratic  corruption, Mr. Hata's set answer is "That is why we need to  carry out political reform." But what we want to ask  politicians is not about what they said in words but what they  did in deeds. At least, he is the head of Shinseito, the banner  of which is political reform. It is difficult to say he has  fulfilled his reponsibilities in all phases of political reform.    The second point is his relationship with Mr. Ozawa. Mr.  Hata was a key man supporting the Hosokawa government as deputy  prime minister and foreign minister. There was the inevitable  division of labor between Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Hata--the former  being in charge of party affairs and the latter performing  official functions.    But during the eight months of the Hosokawa administration,  there have been so many out-of-the-blue incidents like the  proposals on the national welfare tax, the cabinet reshuffle,  and formation of an alliance excluding the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger]. In each case,  Mr. Hosokawa took the form of being the initiator of action, but  actually it was a product of Mr. Ozawa's attempt to manipulate  government operations.    There is no denying that such high-handed political  techniques coming from a dual power structure only speeded up  the demise of the Hosokawa government.    Even in the new government, Mr. Hata's position is very weak  as the party head who should be able to check Mr. Ozawa's  operations.    Mr. Hata, who himself says "what matters for me is to  function as a coordinator," will not be able to function as a  controller over his friend and political game player, Mr. Ozawa.  And this presents a question on his qualifications as a  political leader.    It is very likely that the Hata government will turn out to  be a Ozawa-run government. In a dual power system, there are  many problems because it is unclear who is politically  responsible, and it is difficult for the public to understand  such a system.    Prime Minister Hata should do all he can not to repeat what  his predecessor did, and to run the government in a transparant  manner, while mainintaing his independence and moderation as the  top government executive.    It will be only a matter of time before the public decides  to  abandon him if Prime Minister Hata acts only as an actor in  scenarios written by Mr. Ozawa.</p>

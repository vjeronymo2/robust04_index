			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Wider sentencing powers called for LORD Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, England's most senior judge, yesterday appealed for 'sanity' to be restored to court sentencing through an urgent review of legislation which tied judges' hands. Lord Taylor told the annual conference of the Law Society of Scotland that the fundamental error underlying the 1991 Criminal Justice Act - which does not apply in Scotland - 'is a misconceived notion that sentencing should be programmed so as to restrict the discretion of the sentencing judge'. The desire to confine custodial sentencing to cases where it is really necessary 'has led to restrictive provisions forcing the judge into an ill-fitting straitjacket.' He said judges should have wider powers to impose custody sentences for youngsters.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH BOB;  </P> <P> MAN VS. MICROCHIP  </P> <P> Maybe this money isn't so lucky after all.  </P> <P> Classic Overlay, who was just that at 9-1, broke slowly and never menaced while  finishing fifth in the fourth race.  </P> <P> Patches, the 2-1 choice in the Railbird Stakes, couldn't get by Forest Fealty  in the final furlong, so there went another $60.  </P> <P> Trying to recoup the $80 I lost Saturday and then some, I'll bet a $20 exacta  box in the third from Tu Eres Mi Heroe to Cherokee Returns.  </P> <P> Bob's Saturday Bankroll: $2,150  </P> <P> Saturday's Loss: $80  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $2,070  </P> <P> Fortunately for me, the computer took a byte out of its bankroll, too. It lost  $80 when its choice in the ninth race, Silver Circus, finished a tarnished  fifth. Its bet today is a $40 exacta, Itsallgreektome to Warcraft, and a $20  exacta, Warcraft to Itsallgreektome, in the eighth race.  </P> <P> Computer's Saturday Bankroll: $1,992.50  </P> <P> Saturday's Loss: $80  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,912.50  </P></p>

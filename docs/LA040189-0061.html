			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL TRACK;  </P> <P> BURT MOVES BIRMINGHAM CLOSER TO TITLE RERUN  </P> <P> The Birmingham boys' track and field team failed to win a varsity league title  for 20 years, but after knocking off previously unbeaten Monroe, 72-54, in a  Mid-Valley League meet Friday, the Braves are on the verge of their second  consecutive league crown.  </P> <P> Birmingham defeated Kennedy, 64-63, in a Mid-Valley League finale last year to  win its first title since 1968, and it could be on its way to another crown  after defeating the host Vikings.  </P> <P> Birmingham (5-0) -- which will face Van Nuys next week and Reseda the week  after -- may have cleared its toughest dual-meet hurdle with the win over  Monroe (4-1).  </P> <P> Reseda (4-1), the 1987 and '88 West Valley League dual-meet champion, was  expected to challenge Birmingham for the league title, but sprinter-hurdler  Aaron Whitehurst transferred to Dorsey two weeks ago in the wake of  disciplinary actions and the Regents' title chances may have gone with him.  </P> <P> "I figured it would be a close meet," Birmingham Coach Scott King said of  Friday's meet. "I had it doped out, 66-61, with us winning the mile relay."  </P> <P> As it turned out, the Braves didn't have to win the mile relay -- the meet's  final event. They had clinched the victory minutes before when junior Brian  Gastelum won the two mile in 10 minutes, 15 seconds, to give Birmingham a 67-54  lead.  </P> <P> Gastelum also won the 880-yard run (2:04.3) as Birmingham won six of 10 track  events and nine of 15 overall.  </P> <P> Senior Rodney Burt led the Birmingham charge, winning the 100 meters in a  wind-aided 11.0 seconds, the 220 yards in a wind-aided 22.5 and the 440 in  51.1. He also anchored the mile relay team to victory in 3:35.1.  </P> <P> "We were hoping it would come down to the mile relay," said Burt, who placed  fifth in the 400 in last year's City Section championships. "But when we went  one-two in the 220, we basically put the meet away."  </P> <P> Trailing, 40-36, after nine events, the Braves took the lead for good when Burt  won the 220 and teammate Mark Vigil unexpectedly gunned down Monroe's Chris  Harvey in the final 50 yards for second. That gave Birmingham eight points in  the event -- to Monroe's one -- and a 44-41 lead.  </P> <P> Monroe was led by Mario Armijo and Derril White. Armijo won the 120-yard high  hurdles in a wind-aided 15.3 and the 330-yard intermediate hurdles in 41.1,  while White took the long jump at 20 feet, 8 inches.  </P> <P> In the girls' meet, Birmingham (5-0) defeated Monroe, 66-43, as freshman  Heather Ballard won four events.  </P> <P> Ballard took the 880 in 2:33.0, the 330 low hurdles in 55.2, the high jump at  4-10 and the shotput at 30-11 1/4.  </P> <P> Monroe (3-2) was led by Kynna Wright, who won the 100 in a wind-aided 12.9, the  440 in 1:03.5 and anchored the victorious 440 relay (51.7).

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Israel's new Labour party leader Rabin favours a halt to settlements in the occupied territories Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new Labour party leader, said yesterday he favoured a halt to settlements in the densely Arab-populated areas of the occupied territories, reports Judy Maltz in Jerusalem. Mr Rabin was responding to reports that the US had issued an ultimatum on Friday, linking the provision of Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees to Israel to a complete freeze on settlement activities in the occupied territories. Ministers in Mr Shamir's Likud government said yesterday they would reject any US ultimatum involving a freeze on settlements in return for the guarantees.</p>

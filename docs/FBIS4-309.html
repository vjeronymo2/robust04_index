			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lusaka peace talks are not deadlocked. That is  the unanimous view of the two negotiating teams, who said that  the question of national reconciliation will be dealt with at a  latter date.    Meanwhile, Dr. Jorge Valentim, spokesman for the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating  team, told journalists in Lusaka today that understanding has  been reached with the regime regarding ministerial and  provincial government posts. Valentim said UNITA has already  agreed in principle with the portfolios offered to UNITA, namely  the ministries of health, hotels, public works, and commerce as  well as deputy minister posts. For a sound national  reconciliation policy Dr. Valentim said UNITA has proposed to  the MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor  Party] that UNITA should govern Huambo and Benguela Provinces.  He added that UNITA officials should serve as deputy ministers  of interior and finance.    Jorge Valentim said he was unaware of the proposals  presented  by the Luanda government emissaries who were in Lusaka recently.  He said if there were any proposals, these were presented to  the mediator.    Meanwhile, the government negotiating team left for Luanda  yesterday; the reason is not known.</p>

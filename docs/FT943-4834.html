			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (3): From slagheaps to showpieces - Tourism To suggest a holiday in industrial South Wales would have seemed an unkind joke a decade ago, despite the nearby attractions of the Brecon Beacons and the Pembrokeshire and Gower coasts. Nowadays, a drive up the former mining valleys shows how much the character of the area has altered in a few years. Preconceptions of valleys scarred by slagheaps, abandoned steelworks and an air of hopelessness are soon dispelled. Over Pounds 136m has been spent on greening the countryside and developing tourist attractions, and beautiful hills and parkland now cover most of the ugly coaltip scars. There are forest walks, heritage parks and industrial and craft museums to attract the visitor. The valleys of industrial south Wales are joining the glories of the coastline, the mountains of the north and the green solitude of mid-Wales to embrace the tourist. Tourism has always been an important part of the Welsh economy, but until recently it was relatively low key, fragmented and under-capitalised. It consisted mostly of traditional family summer holidays in Llandudno and Rhyl in the north or Tenby and Porthcawl in the south, plus hikers and others attracted to the national parks of Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and the Pembrokeshire coast. Two factors have changed attitudes dramatically, however, and led to a much more coherent, structured study of the industry and how it should be developed. The first has been the steady decline of traditional industries such as coalmining and steel in south Wales, agriculture in rural mid and north Wales, and more recently, defence industries and air bases in west Wales. With a need to create jobs, the principality had to exploit its tourist assets: a beautiful countryside, historic castles, churches and Roman and Celtic antiquities, plus a distinctive language and culture. The second trigger for reform and development is the changing holiday habits of the British. As people began to opt for the guaranteed sunshine of Spain and Greece, Wales found itself too dependent on the traditional family summer holiday. Hence, it had to offer fresh attractions. In its first development plan launched over five years ago, the Wales Tourist Board put up Pounds 23m of pump-priming capital, which stimulated investment of Pounds 171m. That helped create 3,500 full-time equivalent jobs. Tourism is now an increasingly significant industry, employing 95,000 or 9 per cent of the workforce, and earning Pounds 1.3bn for the Welsh economy. Some 9m people visit Wales a year. The intention, revealed earlier this year in a study called Tourism 2000, is to create 10,000 more jobs directly or indirectly, turning tourism into a Pounds 2bn a year industry by the turn of the century. Mr Paul Loveluck, WTB's chief executive, says: 'We will target our efforts at certain overseas markets and at increasing the range of attractions for those seeking short breaks or second holidays.' Development programmes are planned for coastal resort regeneration in Tenby, Porthcawl and Llandudno; in the historic town of Caernarfon; for country holidays; customer care; and for golf, walking and cycling holidays. A prime requirement, particularly in the coastal areas most vulnerable to changing holiday patterns, is to attract visitors more evenly throughout the year. There are indica tions this is beginning to happen. In general, the 'shoulder' months of May-June and September-October have seen a slow but steady growth from second holidays and short breaks. In recent years, there has been a decline in visitors in the peak holiday months, together with a trend towards later booking and discounting. However, this year's fine weather and the economic upturn have brought an increase in hotel occupancy figures over the very poor 1993 season. For example, Mr George Pearsall, proprietor of the Plas Morfa hotel on the coast between Aberystwyth and Cardigan, has seen a rise of 25 per cent in occupancy rates so far this year. Another major requirement is to attract visitors who spend more money in the principality. This is being achieved by targeting overseas visitors, developing areas of tourism such as golf and yachting, and by improving hotel accommodation and car parking facilities. There are relatively few top class hotels in Wales, but the standard of accommodation has been improved greatly by the introduction of a quality grading system. Wales has fared relatively badly in attracting foreign visitors, with under 4 per cent of the UK total compared with 9.5 per cent for Scotland, and efforts are being made to improve this. Two years ago the WTB was allowed to market itself overseas separately from the British Tourist Authority, something Scotland has done for a decade. The key target market is the US, and a network of 1,500 travel agents has been built up in east and west coast cities to promote Wales as part of a UK tour or as a destination in its own right. Over 300 US travel agents have been brought to Wales for training visits and they receive regular updates on new attractions and facilities. Seminars on tourism in Wales are being held throughout the US next month. Other markets being researched are Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Ireland and Japan. (There appeared to be a big increase in Dutch, German and French car numberplates in the byways of rural mid-Wales this summer.) Over the next three years the WTB plans to double its overseas marketing budget from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 1.5m. Mr Loveluck expects overseas visitors to increase by 6 per cent compared with a 2.5 per cent rise in UK tourists. It is accepted that tourism development must not be allowed to harm the environment or the heritage that draws visitors to Wales. But even this can be controversial territory. Plans to clear and green some of the remaining slagheaps around Ebbw Vale are now being criticised for destroying the country's industrial heritage.</p>

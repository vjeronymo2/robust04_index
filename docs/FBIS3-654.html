Elias] </F>   [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA--The Bophuthatswana Defence  Force [BDF] is running a large group of armed right-wingers out  of Mmabatho, STAR photographer Ken Oosterbroek said on Friday  [11 March].    ITN [International Television Network] Reporter James  Brittan  told SAPA there was a "wall-to-wall" Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] presence in  downtown Mafikeng and continuous gunfire from the central  business district. "It is a running firefight," he said.    According to CNN news, the AWB has refused to pull out of  Bophuthatswana as "this is our land and we are staying".    There was fighting in dowtown Mafikeng on Friday between the  AWB and the BDF, with one AWB member killed and two civilians  caught in crossfire.    SUNDAY TIMES Reporter Ray Hartley described the scene "war".  There was sustained, continuous gunfire for more than four  minutes. "There have been casualties. One AWB guy has been  killed and two civilians. There are plenty of people wounded,"  Mr Hartley told SAPA.    Surrounding townships and Mafikeng were battlefields,  journalists told SAPA after returning from trips to Mmabatho and  Mafikeng.    "The AWB have moved beyond Mafikeng," Mr Hartley said,  adding  that hundreds of right-wingers had left town. A continuous  stream of vehicles filled with the right-wingers left the  Mmabatho area soon after noon, heading towards Mafikeng and  Lichtenberg in the Western Transvaal.</p>

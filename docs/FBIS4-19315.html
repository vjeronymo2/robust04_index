			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "`Silver Back': Withdrawal To Be </F> Completed Today"]    [Excerpts] Brussels, 15 Apr (BELGA) -- On Friday [15 April]  at 1100 GMT, a military spokesman said that the Belgian Army is  expected to complete by the end of the day the withdrawal of  Belgian troops. They had participated in the evacuation of  foreigners from Rwanda.    The military spokesman denies the AFP Press Agency report on  an announcement by Belgian Ambassador in Kenya, Christian  Fellens, that the Belgian troops departed from Kigali. However  the spokesman confirms that the Belgian "intervention  contingent" has finished the mission of evacuating foreigners,  and he reports on an incident that occurred with the Rwandan  Armed Forces on Friday morning. [passage omitted]    Colonel Gilbert Hertoghe has told the BELGA Press Agency  that  an incident took place Friday morning at the Kigali airport,  when a rp-14 multiple rocket launcher of the Rwandan Armed  Forces [government armed forces -- editor's note] was positioned  within 50 meters of the airport enclave, violating the agreement  concluded Thursday evening with the warring parties. The truce  was allowed humanitarian flights and planes for troops'  evacuation.    This piece of artillery towed by a truck has been positioned  50 meters away from the enclave, while the agreement stipulates  that this kind of weapon should remain at a distance of 500  meters, the spokesman says.    The rocket launcher was fired twice in the direction of  Kigali and the Belgian Armed Forces twice demanded its  withdrawal. Since the request not being met, the paratroopers  commandant ordered warning shots over the artillery piece. At  that moment, the rp-14 was moved from its position, Colonel  Hertoghe adds.</p>

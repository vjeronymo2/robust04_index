			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Chinese group in Australian joint venture CHINA'S largest steelmaker, Anshan Iron and Steel Complex (Angang), has signed a joint venture agreement with Perth-based Portman Mining to develop an iron ore mine at Koolyanobbing in Western Australia, writes Nikki Tait. Koolyanobbing was closed by Broken Hill Proprietary in 1982, but the aim is to redevelop the mine by July next year. Angang will buy all iron ore fines produced at Koolyanobbing - estimated to average around 1.1m tonnes a year - for the next 20 years. The joint venture will take over low-grade stockpiles left behind when BHP closed its iron ore operations on Cockatoo Island, off northern Western Australia. Angang will also buy the concentrate from Cockatoo Island for the six years of this project.</p>

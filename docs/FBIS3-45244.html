Forty large enterprises and enterprise groups have been  listed as the first batch of enterprises in the country to enjoy  preferential treatment in adopting the enterprise technical  center system. These include Jilin Chemical Industrial  Corporation, North China Pharmaceutical Plant, Yatai Enterprise  Group of Chemicals for Agricultural Use, and the China Great  Wall Computer Enterprise Group.    According to the regulations, the listed enterprises will be  exempted from taxation in importing meters and instruments,  chemical reagents and technical data, which China is not yet  able to produce, for their technical centers to develop new  technology. The products in trial production developed by their  technical centers will be exempted from income taxes for a  certain period. The technical centers also enjoy some other  preferential treatments.    Different from most developed countries, China used to  separate research institutes of applied technology from  enterprises. Experts noted that the new practice will promote  the integration of research with production, thus accelerating  the process of research and application of new technology.</p>

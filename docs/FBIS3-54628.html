			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- The government on Wednesday [26  January] expressed disappointment over the contents of six  nonpapers which New Delhi handed over on Tuesday because none of  them addressed the core and fundamental problem of Occupied  Kashmir.    However, the Foreign Office says it will study them very  carefully with the seriousness they deserve. Other ministries  would also study them and only then would a `considered  reaction' be given.    Giving his preliminary reaction Foreign Secretary Shaharyar  M  Khan said; "None of the six non-papers really goes into the  depth of the issue. We feel that India's position is mainly to  raise less important issues to show to the world that we are  engaged in negotiations so that pressure by Western countries,  governments and public opinion is diverted."    The Foreign Secretary said that unlike New Delhi, Pakistan,  in its two non-papers, referred to the two crucial issues, i.e,  steps for stopping repression in occupied Kashmir and modalities  of holding plebiscite.    Giving his reactions on the six-non papers one by one  Shaharyar M Khan expressed his amazement that proposal on Line  of Control (LoC) virtually calls for the acceptance of the  status quo on the LoC. "This is not acceptable to Pakistan.  This does not refer to the question of repression (on the LoC)  which is why there is tension there."    The Foreign Secretary felt that if this issue was addressed  as if there was no tension at the LoC, then one would have only  a `mechanical agreement' thus missing the point altogether.    He felt that the three non-papers on Siachen, Wullar Barrage  and Sir Creek show that the points on which discussions were  left off during the last talks, have not been accurately  reflected.    These technical issues, he said, had shown progress in the  past but the non-papers on the subject do not show this.    India's non-paper on confidence-building measures has also  greatly disappointed Pakistan which feels that these continue to  be `peripheral issues' while the core issue is completely  by-passed.    Commenting on the `no first strike' policy, the Foreign  Secretary said that since Pakistan was not a nuclear power and  since it did not possess any nuclear weapon "this was a  contradiction".    This proposal, he added, asks for something that Pakistan  does not possess.    In the same area, about increasing the frequency of the two  DMOs' [expansion unknown] talk to each other, Mr Khan replied:  "I was expecting reference to regional non-proliferation, or  the banning of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles."    There is agreement on the proposal of joint commissions but  the Foreign Secretary added: "It is important to discuss  repression in Occupied Kashmir, and the human rights issue.  These come first. Things like exchanging table tennis teams  and military bands can come later. They are not our top  priority."</p>

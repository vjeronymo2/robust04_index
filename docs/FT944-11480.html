			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Turning to time-share Eight years ago, I bought a freehold house in France. I now wish to convert it into a time-share, with six individuals each taking one-sixth of the property for Pounds 10,000 each. Should the legalities be arranged in Britain or France? And what exactly are the tax implications? France. After all, it was in that country's alpine resorts that time-share began in the 1960s, so a French property lawyer should be able to guide you. We assume you are a UK resident; thus, capital gains liabilities may arise in the transfer to the time-share company. The Inland Revenue publications department at Somerset House, London WC2 (tel: 071-438 6420) will be able to supply you with an appropriate booklet. (Murray Johnstone).

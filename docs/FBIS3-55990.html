			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- A contract to use highly  enriched uranium, obtained from dismantled nuclear weapons in  Russia, may be approved by the presidents of the Russian  Federation and the United States during their summit in Moscow,  experts of the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy hope.    According to a document, signed last February, and the  contract, which was discussed by representatives of the two  countries in September, Russia is to process 500 tonnes of  weapon uranium over a period of twenty years. This uranium,  after proper treatment, will be delivered to the United States  as fuel for that country's nuclear power plants in amounts worth  twelve billion U.S. dollars. Russia will use the obtained money  for switching its defence enterprises to civilian rails,  enhancing the safety of its nuclear power plants, supporting  fundamental sciences, and cleaning the environment in polluted  areas.    Moreover, the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy expects the  participants of the summit to sign an agreement allocating 75  million U.S. dollars to Russian organisations from the  Nunn-Lugar Fund. They will be used to build storages for weapon  plutonium. The point in question is an additional allocation of  75 millions, preliminarily negotiated by the Russian Ministry  for Atomic Energy and the U.S. Defence Department to pay for the  work done by building organisations, to grant subsidies to the  region, where the storages will be held, and also to finance  social requirements.    Two such storages are to be built in Russia -- one in Tomsk  region and the other in Chelyabinsk region. The Ministry for  Atomic Energy is looking forward to U.S. assistance in the  construction of one of these storages. The construction of the  other one will be financed by Russia.    Russian specialists also believe that the presidents of the  two countries will discuss the earlier signed agreements and  will conclude other bilateral agreements on new areas of  cooperation in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. These  areas include nuclear power sources for space vehicles, joint  efforts of Russian and American weapon laboratories to develop  more effective procedures and technological means for the system  of the International Atomic Energy Agency's guarantees against  the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.</p>

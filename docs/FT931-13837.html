			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Resort advance 11% to Pounds 3.3m RESORT HOTELS, which saw its share price collapse last year on uncertainty about expansion plans, has announced an 11 per cent increase in interim profits helped by acquisitions. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 3.25m in the six months to October 31 as the group increased its portfolio of managed or owned hotels by eight to 54. Mr Robert Feld, managing director, said Resort hoped to win further management contracts this year, especially in areas like Manchester where it is poorly represented. Turnover increased 28 per cent to Pounds 9.76m (Pounds 7.62m). Occupancy rates were stable at about 60 per cent while average room charges were almost unchanged at just over Pounds 40. A Pounds 20.6m rights issue last April, the fourth since the company floated in 1988, almost eliminated year-end debt of Pounds 22m. However, there was a Pounds 3.3m cash outflow during the period and Mr Feld said gearing would again rise sharply once two planned acquisitions of BES-funded companies, Country Resort Hotels and County Resort Hotels, were completed. The purchases were cast into doubt when Resort's share price fell below 50p. But the company had now agreed to buy Country Resort for Pounds 905,000 and discussions with County Resort were continuing. Earnings per share dropped from 3.61p to 2.8p, while the interim dividend is maintained at 1.2p. The shares, which last year fell from over 80p to 19p before recovering, fell 2p yesterday to 40p.</p>

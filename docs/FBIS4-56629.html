			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities monitored through 5 May.    Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko on 29 April announced that  Petrobras -- Brazilian Petroleum Corporation -- may no longer  pass on the cost of oil importation taxes to consumers in the  price of fuel. The taxes affect the importation of oil and  by-products. Petrobras has so far paid a 38 percent tax on crude  oil imports, which was passed on to consumers in the form of  higher fuel prices. The corporation will now have to absorb the  cost of this tax. (Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 30 Apr  94 p 1)    The Institute of Nonferrous Metals has reported that in the  first quarter of 1994 the production of nickel stood at 3,491  tonnes, and that during the same period in 1993 nickel  production stood at 3,915 tonnes. These figures show that  during the first quarter of 1994 Brazilian nickel production  dropped by 10.82 percent with respect to the same period in  1993. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 3 May 94 p 14)    The last stage of the privatization of the National Iron and  Steel Company -- CSN -- was concluded during the week ending 23  April. The shares that still had to be sold, amounting to 9  percent of the enterprise's capital, were sold in two auctions  conducted in March and last week. The operation yielded $1.494  billion. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 28 Apr  94 p B4)    The average general price index stood at 40.91 percent in  April. This figure stands almost 5 percentage points below the  45.7 percent rate that was registered in March. (Sao Paulo O  ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 1 May 94 p A14)    Professor Roberto Cavalcanti, of the National Institute for  Advanced Studies, on 27 April submitted a research paper  reporting that there are 39.2 million poor people in Brazil, of  whom 21.7 million are in the northeastern region, and that there  are 3.1 million poor people in the three southeastern  metropolitan regions -- Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo  Horizonte. Cavalcanti considered poor the members of a family  whose monthly per capita income stood below $35, in values that  were in force in 1990. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in  Portuguese 28 Apr 94 p 10)    The balance of trade registered a $1.03 billion surplus in  March. This figure is 31.97 percent lower than the figure  registered in March 1993. Ailton Barcellos, executive secretary  of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, on 27 April reported  that exports in March 1994 -- which stood at $3.351 billion --  dropped by 4.67 percent with respect to March 1993. Imports,  which stood at $2.321 billion in March 1994, grew by 15.99  percent.

Marlim-4 will produce 6,300 barrels  per day at a cost of $3.45 per barrel. (Sao Paulo GAZETA  MERCANTIL in Portuguese 2 May 94 p 13)</p>

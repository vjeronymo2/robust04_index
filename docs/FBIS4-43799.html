			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Veestraeten: "Government Majority Backs </F> Dehaene, Plus Sections of Opposition"]    [Text] It goes without saying that the CVP  [Flemish-speaking Christian People's Party] supports the  candidacy of Jean-Luc Dehaene for the presidency of the European  Commission (EC). The CVP has always said that it would consider  it a great honor for a Flemish Christian Democrat to be asked to  head the EC. It is said in CVP circles that if the CVP had done  badly in the elections, it would have asked Dehaene to continue  to serve as Belgian prime minister. When it became clear that  the result was much better than hoped, the need to keep Dehaene  in place was no longer felt. But how do the other Flemish  parties react to Dehaene's candidacy?  <H5>  Flemish-speaking Socialist Party: Continue </H5>   "The Flemish-speaking Socialist Party (SP) considers it an  honor for the country," SP Chairman Frank Vandenbroucke says,  "that Dehaene has been asked to head the EC." This is no doubt  due to the successful Belgian presidency of the EC during which  Dehaene and Willy Claes jointly managed to settle a number of  thorny issues.    On the other hand, the SP believes that the government must  continue as it considers that the present team still has a great  deal to do. The government must be able to reap the rewards of  the difficult work it has undertaken in the last two years. One  remaining problem is law and order. [Interior] Minister Tobback  has given great encouragement in this area, partly through the  additional 2,500 policemen to be recruited this year.  <H5>  Flemish Liberal Party Backs Dehaene </H5>   "The Flemish Liberal Party (VLD) has always said that it  backed Dehaene's EC candidacy," says Patrick Dewael, VLD leader  in the Chamber. He admits that this support has included a  "slight oppositional undertone." "But if Belgium has a chance  of winning Europe's top job, then we in the opposition are  certainly going to back it," Dewael says. "We therefore fully  support Dehaene's candidacy, without any ulterior political  motives."    The VLD does take issue, however, with the undemocratic  manner in which the EC president is appointed. It is in fact  all down to lobbying activity, the individual citizen being  totally excluded from the process. But it is accepted that  Dehaene does not personally bear any blame for this, as the  president is appointed by an established procedure. "If under  this procedure it seems that Dehaene has the best chances then  the government majority and the coalition must support it,"  Dewael says.  <H5>  Live Differently: No Support </H5>   Live Differently is unable to support Dehaene's candidacy as  EC president. Dehaene's vision of Europe is not at all to Live  Differently's liking. The most that can be expected of Dehaene  is that he will try to make Europe somewhat less undemocratic  and asocial.    Live Differently suspects that the other possible presidents  would offer even fewer guarantees of the kind of developments  the Greens would like to see. "But," Johan Malcorps states,  "Live Differently refuses to accept this fundamental absence of  any real alternative."  <H5>  Flemish Bloc: Elections </H5>   The fact that a governing prime minister is ready to move to  the EU at a difficult time for the coalition parties, leads us  to conclude that he no longer sees his task as the leader of a  government that is barely holding together. Such is the opinion  of Roeland Raes, Flemish Bloc's (VB) vice chairman.    Raes says that "the VB does not begrudge Dehaene his  European  post, but believes that Prime Minister Dehaene and his  government team should draw the necessary conclusions from this  departure, namely that this government has outlived its  usefulness and should consult the voters, as soon as possible  and no later than the year end, so that they can give their  verdict on the government record to date."  <H5>  The People's Union: Program </H5>   The People's Union (VU) says that it is not the candidate  president as an individual which is important but the program he  will put forward. In the policy program, Dehaene must draw  attention to, among other things, the equality of all languages  and cultures, and respect for the identity of each community of  peoples. The position of the Dutch language must be protected.  The VU hopes that Dehaene will display more Flemish  determination in this than in the matter of the European Trade  Marks Office. Also important are the social dimension,  democratization, and advocating the right to exist of  communities and regions.</p>

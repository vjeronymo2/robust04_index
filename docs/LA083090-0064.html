			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUROR PLEADS GUILTY IN TAMPERING CASE  </P> <P> A federal juror removed for suspected tampering with deliberations just hours  before Los Angeles businessman Michael R. Goland was convicted last May of  making an illegal political donation pleaded guilty Wednesday to one felony  count of criminal contempt of court.  </P> <P> Barry Kuhnke, 33, of Huntington Beach, a U.S. Defense Department employee, told  U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie that he had approached Goland and offered  to fix the case because he felt Goland was being unfairly prosecuted.  </P> <P> Goland reported the offer to his attorney, who notified U.S. District Judge  Dickran Tevrizian. Tevrizian removed Kuhnke from the jury the next day.  </P> <P> In exchange for Kuhnke's guilty plea, prosecutors have agreed to drop a second  felony count of obstruction of justice. Rafeedie set sentencing for Oct. 4.  Federal statutes set no limits for either a fine or jail time for criminal  contempt, although the judge cannot sentence Kuhnke to both a fine and jail.  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions bolster Great Portland - Property group sees rental growth although tenant demand remains sporadic Acquisitions following its 1993 rights issue helped Great Portland Estates, the UK's sixth largest property company, announce interim pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 16m to Pounds 21.4m. Since its preliminary announcement in June, Great Portland has bought four freehold office investments for Pounds 26m, a portfolio of seven properties in Cardiff and Plymouth for Pounds 19m, and a pre-let warehouse development in Bury, Lancashire for Pounds 9m. These are expected to increase net rental income by Pounds 4.25m during a full year. However, Mr Richard Peskin, chairman, said that demand for space from tenants was still patchy. 'Tenant demand is sporadic. Although, with development activity still low across the industry, we are optimistic that rental growth is on the horizon,' he commented. Net rental income for the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 44.8m. Only 3 per cent of the portfolio remains unoccupied, reducing rental income by about Pounds 2.75m. The company has continued to dispose of unlet space. Its vacant development at 39-41 Charing Cross Road was sold for more than Pounds 5m, 20 per cent higher than book value. The rights issue raised Pounds 95m. At the half-year stage, gearing stood at 62 per cent, although the property portfolio is only revalued at the year end. Mr Peskin said he would be comfortable with gearing of up to 90 per cent if acquisition opportunities arose. The company's main development project is 160 Great Portland Street, London, where it is building 80,000 sq ft of office space behind an existing facade. The building should be ready for occupation next autumn. After refurbishment costs and administration expenses, operating profits were Pounds 39.8m (Pounds 35m). Net interest charges amounted to Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 18.6m) and earnings per share were 5p (4.3p). The interim dividend is increased to 2.9p (2.7p); the company intends to pay a final dividend of 5.85p, making a total for the year of 8.75p, against 8p.</p>

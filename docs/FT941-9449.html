			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / BR signal staff seek 11% pay increase British Rail signalling staff are demanding an immediate interim 11 per cent basic pay increase in return for improved productivity in recent years. Unless the claim is met, their union - the RMT - says it will refuse to negotiate a restructuring agreement for signalling staff with BR. 'We have an overwhelming case for an immediate down payment', said RMT last night. Union leaders have submitted their proposal and BR is expected to reply shortly. In a letter to RMT branches, the union's general secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp says BR has 'obtained significant productivity from its signalling grades, but their rates of pay have remained unacceptably low in their own right and even more so when compared to other BR grades and London Underground signalling staff.' The RMT argues the number of signalling staff has fallen by 35 per cent since 1980 and new equipment and responsibilities have been introduced without any compensating cash reward. The union says signalling staff work an average 52.4 hours a week for a a basic Pounds 124 to Pounds 137. Average weekly earnings including overtime are between Pounds 248 and Pounds 268.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / US to scale down military operations at European and Korean bases THE US is to end or reduce operations at another 61 military sites in Europe and two in South Korea, the Pentagon announced yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The cuts are part of a continuing reduction in the US military presence overseas. They take to 559 the number of overseas bases at which operations will be ended, reduced or placed on standby as Washington slashes its defence budget now the Cold War is over. All but 35 are in Europe. The Pentagon gave no time frame for the latest cuts. In Europe, they will result in reductions of more than 6,000 US troops and 800 US civilian and 2,500 local jobs in Britain, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. In South Korea, forces will be reduced at Camp Ames north of Taejon, and ended at Songso, west of Taegu, with the departure of 246 US troops. In the UK the main cuts involved the end of US operations at RAF Burtonwood in Warrington, and the closure of naval communication operations around Thurso, Scotland. Sites in Germany affected by Friday's announcement included Peden Barracks in Wertheim, which will close, and Pond Barracks in Amberg and Robinson Barracks in Stuttgart, which are reducing operations.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Daf cuts operating loss DAF, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker in which British Aerospace holds a 16 per cent stake, cut its operating loss in the first half of 1992 to Fl 27.4m (Dollars 17.3m) from Fl 116.5m in the same period a year ago, writes Kevin Done. The operating loss for the first six months of this year included a charge of Fl 24.3m for guaranteeing Daf Finance bad debts. Group turnover fell by 2.9 per cent to Fl 2.18bn largely due to lower component sales and reduced defence turnover by Daf's special products division, which is to be restructured. Truck production rose by 15.9 per cent to 13,108 from 11,305 in the same period a year ago, while truck deliveries increased by 6.5 per cent to 13,709. Daf said the west European truck market (above 3.5 tonnes) fell by a further 3.7 per cent in the first half of the year. Daf captured a market share of 7.7 per cent against 7.3 per cent in the first half a year ago.</p>

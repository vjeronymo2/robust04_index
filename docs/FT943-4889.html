			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo probes alleged cartel The Japanese Fair Trade Commission yesterday launched an investigation into more than 20 Japanese trading companies suspected of forming a cartel to decide which companies should win government contracts for overseas development aid projects. The FTC investigated the offices of leading companies, including Mitsubishi Corp, Marubeni and Itochu among others, citing a possible breach of Japan's fair-trade laws. The raid, which comes as top-level US and Japanese negotiators meet for talks concerning how to open Japan's markets to more foreign goods and services, is likely to support US allegations of Japan's widespread unfair trading practices which prevent foreign companies from winning a fair share of business. The suspicion of bid-rigging also coincides with recent US interest in winning more business stemming from Japanese overseas development aid, the largest in the world. Last year, Japan's ODA topped the international aid league for the third consecutive year at Dollars 11.3bn, followed by the US with Dollars 9bn. Of that amount, approximately Dollars 8bn was bilateral aid to specific countries, as opposed to aid given to multilateral organisations. Of Japan's bilateral aid, 83 per cent is untied and bids are open to foreign as well as Japanese companies. Most untied aid comprises yen loans which are directed towards large infrastructural projects such as the construction of dams. The latest allegation of cartel activity involves the remaining 17 per cent of tied aid, about Dollars 20bn, which is grant-in-aid. For reasons of convenience, bidding for projects carried out on untied aid is open only to Japanese companies, mainly because the time span for conducting the bid and completing the project is usually restricted to one year. Companies involved yesterday expressed surprise at the FTC investigation. 'We don't know what it is about so we don't have any comment,' a Mitsubishi representative said.</p>

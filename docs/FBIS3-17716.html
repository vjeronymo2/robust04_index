			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Dolinin under the "First Hand" rubric: </F> "When Missiles `Die'"]    [Text] Support centers for implementing arms reduction  treaties exist in every branch of the Armed Forces but a special  place is occupied by the Strategic Missile Forces' center, given  the political realities that exist in the world. So when it  became necessary to create such centers in Belorusia [Belarus]  and the Ukraine [na Ukraine], it was no wonder that they turned  to the missile troops in particular for their experience, and  there is no denying that such experience exists there.    Suffice it to recall that since the founding of the support  center -- this dates back to the time of the implementation of  the Treaty on Intermediate-and Shorter-Range Missiles -- 826  deployed and nondeployed intermediate-range RSD-10, R-12, and  R-14 missiles, 608 launchers for those missiles, 60 missile  operational bases, and dozens of auxiliary installations have  been scrapped under the organizational control of the Strategic  Missiles Forces High Command and officers from the center and  with their direct participation....    The forthcoming work involved in the reduction of strategic  offensive arms is even larger in scale. The intensity of the  center's activity is now determined by the fact that missile men  began the planned destruction of obsolete missile complexes last  year without even waiting for the ratification of START-I and  START-II.    More than 200 silo-based missile launchers were removed from  service and then destroyed. A lot of work, notably by the  center's specialists, went into the creation of the Russian  destruction bases in Surovatikha and Pibanshurye and the  preparation of sites for the reception and stationing of U.S.  inspection groups at Strategic Missile Forces installations....    Colonel General Aleksandr Petrovich Volkov, first deputy  commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, who heads  the entire destruction project, believes that "the missile  troops are absolutely ready to ensure the successful fulfillment  of all the commitments made under the treaty."    Who are they, these people who bear the burden of the  destruction program on their shoulders? Colonel Anatoliy  Murashenkov, the center's chief, now takes up the story:    "Officers of the Support Centers for Implementing Arms  Reduction Treaties are real missile men. They only employ  people who have a wealth of military experience, who know  missile work and technology inside out, and who have years of  alert duty behind them."    Col. Murashchenkov himself, incidentally, was chief of a  combined unit's operational department prior to his appointment  to the Support Center (it was called the Center for Destruction  Management [Tsentr upravleniya likvidatsiyey] then). Prior to  that he had a learned all there is to know about missile service  from many posts. Like all the other officers he learned the  science of weapon destruction "from scratch" and by practical  experience. No one in the missile forces at that time knew as  much as he did.    I met with other specialists at the center. Colonel Valentin  Romashev, Colonel Georgiy Khristoforidi, Lieutenant Colonel  Anatoliy Pavlov, Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Shpirko, Lieutenant  Colonel Viktor Yakunin.... They, like other officers, have  clearly defined duties. Some are responsible for the planning  and coordination of destruction work and monitoring the  fulfillment of treaty obligations, others are busy with the  arms-destruction related problems of the military economy  [voyskovoye khozyaystvo] and the use of the funds thus  released....    Much time is spent on preparing and providing support for  the inspection work. During the center's six years' existence  316 inspection groups have visited the Missile Forces alone.  They monitor progress in implementing the Treaty on  Intermediate- and Shorter-Range Missiles (reciprocal inspection  activity under the treaty will not end until the next century)  and of conventional arms agreements....    "After the completion of special courses," Colonel Vladislav  Alekseyev says, "the center's officers themselves work in  inspection groups in the United States, Belgium, Britain,  Germany, and Italy."    Vladislav Arseniyevich, for example, has twice done  inspection work at the Hercules plants in Salt Lake City.    I did not catch the demolition engineers at home that day.  Colonel Vasiliy Orzhekhovskiy and Colonel Mikhail Kiryushin  together with their subordinates were busy organizing and  providing backup for the unique job of destroying silo  missile-launchers, which KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already written  about and which people have been able to see for themselves in a  recent Radar TV movie for Ostankino Television.    But the duty shift was there that day, as it was supposed to  be. Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Kirshkovskiy and Major Andrey  Titov were busy with current operational work, maintaining  communications with the National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center  and receiving information from the CSCE....    The work at the center seemed to me to be routine and free  of  fuss. Even when the latest notification of an inspection from  the United States arrived I did not see any change in the pace  of work. They did not know which Strategic Missile Forces  installation would be inspected or on what scale the inspection  would be (there is a memorandum stipulating this), but the  officers knew well what they had to do in these circumstances.  Just as they do in all other situations connected with the  destruction of nuclear missiles, furthermore.</p>

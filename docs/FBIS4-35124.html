			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lidia Reboucas] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo -- There is an urgent need for revising  Brazil's model of scientific and technological development, to  gear it to the new world political and economic order. Achieving  this requires a reversal of the previous trend implemented  during the past 25 years, which encouraged major technological  projects of large dimensions that were highly sophisticated and  centralized. There must be a move toward promoting initiatives  that will bring a high rate of technological return to the  productive system, and an international projection of Brazil's  scientific and technical capacity. This is one of the main  conclusions from a study prepared by the Getulio Vargas  Foundation (FGV) at the request of the Ministry of Science and  Technology and the World Bank (IDB), based on the agreement that  established the Second Program in Support of Scientific and  Technological Development (II-PADCT).    The work to assess Brazilian scientific policy, divided into  three phases, was done by an independent group of Brazilian  scientists and economists from Campinas State University  (UNICAMP), which was responsible for covering relations with the  economic sector; from the Getulio Vargas Foundation,  concentrating on the current status of Brazil's scientific  policy and the preparation of new guidelines; and from the  Ministry of Science and Technology, studying the institutional  aspects of the issue.    The results of the studies will be presented next week, at  the "International Seminar for Evaluation of and Proposals for  Brazil's Scientific and Technological Development," to be held  at the FGV. Also to be discussed are the results of the  applications of the funds released by the Inter-American Bank of  Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), totaling $72 million  between 1985 and 1990, and by the IDB, amounting to $150 million  during the past four years.    According to the coordinator of the work carried out by the  FGV, Simon Schwartzman, a clear identification of the  technological demands of Brazil's industrial plant is required,  as is the aiming of research toward potentially applied fields.  He explains: "Nevertheless, this does not imply a neglect of  basic research, but rather its adapation to the country's model  of economic and industrial development. In his assessment,  Schwartzman remarks: "The 1980's were typified by a major lack  of definition of the objectives and goals of Brazilian  scientific production." This was due to the failure of the  military plan during the Geisel government's term, with  accelerated growth of the economy. At that time, an S&amp;T  system  was set up in the country aimed at large-scale programs intended  to respond to the demands of the military sector, in the  telecommunications, nuclear, aeronautical, and computer science  fields.  <H5>  Potential </H5>   The abundance of funds and incentives was, however, not  reflected in a concern for quality and efficiency in scientific  production, which ultimately failed to gain an international  projection. During the 1970's, Brazil was responsible for 0.2  percent of worldwide scientific production. Ten years later,  that production amounted to only 0.4 percent. "There was little  growth," in Schwartzman's view.    According to data from the Ministry of Science and  Technology, the scientific community consists of 50,000 persons,  12,000 of whom have post-graduate degrees. "This number isn't  small, and is comparable to that of a small European country. To  take advantage of this potential, there must be a recovery of  installed capacity and a redirection of Brazil's scientific and  technological model."</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS TESTS  </P> <P> The National Research Council's recommendation that every baby born in the  United States should be "anonymously" tested for AIDS antibodies seems  guaranteed to offend just about everybody in exchange for statistics of, at  least, marginal utility (Part I, Feb. 9). Were I the parent of a newborn child,  I would demand, as an absolute right, to know of any condition which  represented a potential health hazard to my child. Anything less would strike  me as game playing of the worst sort.  </P> <P> This "recommendation" makes me wonder just how much the council members, for  all their medical and scientific expertise, know about how real flesh-and-blood  human beings feel and operate.  </P> <P> HORACE M.

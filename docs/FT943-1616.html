			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Management: Learning from inner experience It is a truism, but one which managers forget all too easily, that companies have a lot in common with most species in the natural world. In order to survive, they must adapt to changes in the environment around them. The analogy is limited in that companies have an ability, denied to all but a few species, to change their environment. Witness the impact of Apple, Intel and Microsoft on the computer industry, or Marks &amp; Spencer, Ikea and Wal-Mart on retailing. In order to adapt, a company needs to know what to change, and how. Hence the concept of 'learning organisations' - a mantra whose popularity is matched only by the confusion that besets most companies over how to put it into practice. Since most companies tend to be inward-looking, they are forever - and rightly - being advised to improve their learning from outside. Hence the current emphasis on benchmarking, on closer contact with customers and suppliers, and on more effective ways to connect technology with emerging consumer patterns and behaviour. But the drive for better external learning is blinding companies to one of the most valuable sources of insight and added knowledge: their own experience. Few organisations make a serious attempt to analyse the lessons of their own recent successes and failures. Powerful and detailed evidence of how this sort of learning can best be achieved, from the projects by which a company develops new products and processes, has been amassed in a study carried out by a team of US academics. Drawn from Harvard, Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Purdue University, the researchers worked closely with top executives in five leading US companies: Chaparral Steel, Digital Equipment, Eastman Kodak, Hewlett-Packard and the Ford Motor Company, examining 20 development projects. The companies succeeded in learning extensively from some of them, but failed dismally in others. In a lengthy, three-article report on the project in the latest Harvard Business Review* the academics argue that managers seldom realise that the learning to be gained from a development project is often more important to the company than the new product or process itself. By selecting projects carefully, a company can use them to develop new skills, knowledge and systems. The reason why development projects are such a good source of learning is that they are, in a sense, a microcosm of the whole organisation, the academics argue. Since project teams are usually made up of people from many parts of the company, development projects test the strengths and weaknesses of its systems, structures and values. The academics exemplify this by using contrasting examples from Ford in the late 1980s: the development of the compressor for an air conditioner from which all sorts of organisational lessons were learned and applied on other projects; and the almost simultaneous development in a different part of the company of the 1989 Thunderbird, where potential lessons were neither planned for nor learned. Probably the most successful learner in the study was Chaparral Steel. A mini mill specialist founded 20 years ago which has become one of the largest US steelmakers, it is best known for its 1980s innovations in horizontal casting techniques. At Chaparral, virtually everyone is involved continually in development or improvement projects. People work in a variety of functions. They may lead one team and then be members of another. But where Chaparral stands out from the other companies in the study is in the systematic way it selects projects and then applies learning from one project to another. Chaparral does several things that serve as a model for every company, say the academics. It requires every project to advance the company's capabilities, and plans combinations of them in a logical flow to ensure that they do so. After each project has been completed, Chaparral analyses it to find out what it achieved or failed to, and why. Auditing of this kind is surprisingly rare, as the academics point out. Only a handful of companies have any kind of auditing system. Moreover, audits tend to be done merely to ensure that a project complies with formal procedures, rather than to analyse its positive and negative aspects so that the company can learn. Of the 20 projects in the study, few were audited systematically. The work was sometimes done by reviewers reluctant to highlight problems for fear of embarrassing people and seeming unfair. As a result, a string of projects in the same company tended to suffer from the same mistakes. In their keenness to transform the way managers think of development projects, the academics do not tackle in sufficient detail the equally challenging question of how to transfer learning not just from project to project, but also from individual business units to the whole organisation. They also fail to warn against one of the pitfalls of their message; that, in a belated rush to understand the factors that determine the success or failure of individual projects, managers may forget that wider organisational influences - including strategic vision, shared values and reward systems - have an equally important impact on learning. But the vast majority of companies have no need to worry about this problem as yet. They have not even started delving into the goldmine of their project experience. *Regaining the lead in manufacturing. Three articles by H.

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Milk market Managing a UK dairy company is developing into a fearsome intellectual challenge as the industry prepares for the Milk Marketing Board's demise. Fretting investors this week knocked 9 per cent off Northern Foods' shares and 5 per cent off Unigate's. It is not easy to see how the uncertainty will quickly be resolved. Dairy companies are under attack on three fronts. First, they are finding it difficult to manage the orderly decline of doorstep deliveries as superstores rapidly lap up market share. Until now, the dairies have done well to maximise returns by maintaining high prices. But with pints costing as little as 22p in supermarkets and as much as 41p on the doorstep, the differential has seemingly grown too wide. Second, they have to contend with retailers' margin demands as they become more powerful customers. Tesco appears to have taken the margin pain in cutting its milk prices this week. But the dairies will bear some of the cost if other superstores join the fray. Third, the dairies face the prospect that farmers' milk prices will rise after the MMB is dissolved next year. This, too, could result in a further margin squeeze. The big dairies must hope these pressures will crush smaller operators, enabling them to gain market share and economies of scale. The chances are they will emerge bigger and more efficient. Nevertheless, they will be pushed to remain as profitable.</p>

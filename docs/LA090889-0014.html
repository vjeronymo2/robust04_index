			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID'S PAPER  </P> <P> Why do you make newspapers so boring for kids? Kids would like a section for  themselves.  </P> <P> There's too much junk like fires and accidents on the freeways in the  newspaper. Kids would like a page on their own futures. Kids get tired of the  stuff grown-ups like. Kids like toys, bikes and skateboards.  </P> <P> Grown-ups like shopping for ugly stuff. Grown-ups like boring business books.  </P> <P> COURTNEY COOPER  </P> <P> Age 8  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

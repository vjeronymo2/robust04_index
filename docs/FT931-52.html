			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures traded in a tight 20-point range, with dealers choosing to wait for news from tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting and today's UK government bond auction, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 2,876 and followed the recent trend of being in demand at the start of trading, with the talk this time focusing on the possibility of a cut in interest rates . This sent June forward and by 10am it was trading at 2,884, which turned out to be the day's high. With no follow-through buying, June retreated to the day's low of 2,863 just ahead of lunchtime. It hovered around that level until mid-afternoon, when bargain hunting brought renewed buying of the contract. June finished at 2,879, around 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash, which now stands at 11 points. Turnover remained poor at 6,962 lots. The volume in traded options improved from Monday's dull level, reaching 22,374 contracts by the close. Some 7,597 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, although there was little activity in the Euro FT-SE, a mere 923 trades being recorded. Cable and Wireless was the busiest stock option, with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to have accounted for the majority of the day's activity. It was followed by BT at 1,050 lots and Marks and Spencer at 1,008.</p>

According to experts, the population and nearby Lake  Shkoder might be in considerable danger as several containers  have sprung leaks and substances have escaped into the wagons.  Federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (CDU) intends to  make 1.4 million marks available immediately for emergency  safety measures, a spokesman for his ministry said in Bonn on  Saturday [27 November].    There are 217 tonnes of pesticides in the 17 wagons, which  was supplied by Germany following an order from Albania.  Following its political transformation, Albania decided not to  use these pesticides and asked the Federal Government to take  them back. The ministry spokesman said this was not an illegal  export of waste.    According to a report in the WESTDEUTSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG  (WAZ), a poison cloud could hit the town of Shkoder and affect  Montenegro or even parts of Italy, depending on the direction of  the wind. The Environment Ministry spokesman also pointed out  that 3,600 tonnes of pesticides from the European Union [EU] and  World Bank stocks were still being kept in several stores in  Albania. The EU plans to take immediate steps to dispose of the  pesticides. However, details had not yet been worked out.</p>

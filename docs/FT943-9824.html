			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Observer: Messing about in boats Who will be the next bigwig to be piped aboard the Alexander, Greek billionaire John Latsis's gin palace? Former US President George Bush, plus more than a dozen relations and friends, have already been to sea and Russian President Boris Yeltsin stayed on the Alexander when he turned up at Corfu's European Union summit. The word is that Prince Charles accompanied by Princes Harry and William are next in the queue. Latsis's legendary hospitality consists of lending his guests his yacht, equipped with helicopter, and leaving them to chart their own course. For Prince Charles, that could mean a stop at Mount Athos, the peninsula off the northern Greek coast inhabited only by Orthodox monks  - and indeed only males of any species. The theocratic republic, which enjoys autonomy from Athens, attracts an increasing number of western visitors with a mystical bent. Sounds like just the place for Prince Charles.</p>

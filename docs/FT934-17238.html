			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Property: Hunt for bargains in the malls - Richard Waters explains the current popularity in the US of real estate investment trusts Middle American shopping malls - symbols of the 1980s retail boom - are discovering a new lease of life on Wall Street. In the past fortnight, two of the country's biggest private developers from the 1980s have disclosed plans to sell stakes in their retail property empires, in deals that could raise Dollars 1.5bn between them. And although the yields on these public investment vehicles will be well below those available on similar private investments, there is no shortage of takers. Real estate investment trusts (known as Reits) have been one of the big hits on Wall Street this year. They bring together two groups of people: debt-laden developers who need cash, and yield-starved investors who want a higher return than that available in the bond market and a liquid investment that is publicly quoted. Given the scale of the fees involved, Wall Street has been happy to play host to this party. The latest developers to reveal their intention to go public are two of the most prominent names from the 1980s: Edward DeBartolo, an Ohio-based developer who has spent more than 40 years building a retail property empire in Middle America, and Melvin Simon who, with his family, has developed more than 100 shopping centres across the US. The Simon family will retain 51.4 per cent of its property investment vehicle, while DeBartolo will yield majority ownership. Both have been driven by the need to pay off old bank debt. DeBartolo, who has been looking for ways to appease his bankers for the past two years, will use Dollars 398m of the Dollars 561m raised (after fees) to repay debt: he also plans to repay another Dollars 396m of borrowings with a securitised debt offering launched at the same time. The Simon deal is similar: a net Dollars 993m will be raised, Dollars 240m of it through a debt issue, of which Dollars 870m will be used to repay borrowings. It is not hard to see why these and other developers have decided that now is the moment to go public to raise cash. After a rise in prices early this year, yields on Reits have fallen well below yields on comparable private property investments. By distributing 95 per cent of its income in the form of a dividend, for instance, the promoters of the Simon vehicle say it will offer a yield of 7 1/4 per cent. Regional shopping malls and 'community centres' (small shopping centres) of the type in the Simon portfolio might be expected to change hands in private transactions of yields ranging from 8 1/2 to 11 per cent, depending on the location, size and competitive strengths of each site, says Mr Christopher Budden, chief executive of Yarmouth Group, the property adviser. With such a wide gap between yields in the public and private markets, it is possible for developers to pay Wall Street's not inconsiderable fees for going public and still come out ahead. The Simon Property Group deal, which is led by Merrill Lynch, will net the advisers and underwriters Dollars 67m, or 8 per cent of the proceeds - and this for a what has become a fairly standard transaction. The DeBartolo transaction, led by Morgan Stanley, will raise around Dollars 40m in fees. (Neither of these figures includes the fees associated with the debt securitisations which are also planned.) No wonder most investment bankers are quick to sing the praises of Reits at the moment. What do investors in public deals get in return for the hefty premiums they are paying? Liquidity, first and foremost: most Reit investments this year have been snapped up by small investors and mutual funds. Both groups have been prepared to pay for the opportunity to take a relatively liquid equity investment in real estate. The investment trusts also bring diversification: the DeBartolo portfolio contains 51 malls, the Simon one 110. Beyond this, the main advantage claimed for Reits is that they are worth more than the sum of the individual shopping centres they contain. They give investors the chance to buy into established management companies, which will use their experience to squeeze higher rental income out of the properties in future. That, at least, is the theory. In the meantime, a more immediate concern for investors is likely to be whether rental income might fall in the near future, rather than rise. Two factors are at work: US retail sales continue to grow at only a sluggish pace, and a large part of the income of the shopping centres is tied to the sales of their tenants. Many smaller shopping centres are under pressure from the retail fad of the 1990s: the large dis-count store. Malls and other cen-tres which do not have strong department stores to 'anchor' them, by providing a focal point for customers, or which have big discount operations close at hand, are most at risk. Retail vacancy rates have already been creeping up since the mid-1980s (see chart). What this overall picture does not show, though, is where vacancy rates have been growing fastest, says Mr Budden - in the small, specialised retailers who yield the highest return for mall owners. As vacancy rates rise, rents inevitably fall (or, at least, stop rising) as mall owners struggle to hold on to those tenants that remain. The DeBartolo portfolio of malls - considered one of the strongest currently on offer to investors - reflects these pressures. The overall vacancy rate of the centres rose from less than 7 per cent in 1988 to 15 per cent at the end of June this year. With Wal-Mart stores and warehouse clubs sprouting across the US like mushrooms, where will it all end for the malls? For the weaker ones, no doubt, closure. Large Reits with well-spread properties, while benefiting from portfolio diversification, will not be immune to such pressures. But that is hardly something that will worry US investment bankers as they pocket their latest fat fees.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       CHANGES IN PROPERTY VALUES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Retail                Office  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Year to     Mnth of     Year to      Mnth of                        Aug 93     Aug 93       Aug 93      Aug 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth           -3.7       -0.2        -18.1        -0.9 Capital growth          -0.8        0.3         -7.5         0.4 Total return             7.4        1.0          2.2         1.2 Current yields           8.9                    10.0  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Industrial                All  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Year to     Mnth of     Year to      Mnth of                        Aug 93     Aug 93       Aug 93      Aug 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rental growth          -11.6       -0.5       -10.4         -0.5 Capital growth          -4.9        0.4        -3.9          0.4 Total return             5.4        1.2         5.2          1.1 Current yields          11.2                    9.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IPD Monthly Index, Investment Property Databank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

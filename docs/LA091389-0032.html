			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Accused mass murderer Ramon Salcido was linked to the deaths of his wife and a  co-worker by bullets identified by a state ballistics expert. Richard Arlo  Waller said at a preliminary hearing in Santa Rosa that bullets taken from the  victims matched a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol owned by Salcido. The  28-year-old winery worker is accused of killing his wife, two of his daughters,  a fellow winery employee, his mother-in-law and two of her daughters in a  bloody rampage on April 14. He was arrested in Mexico five days later. Three of  Salcido's daughters were found in a remote garbage dump, with their throats  slashed. One of the girls survived and lives with her maternal grandmother.  </P></p>

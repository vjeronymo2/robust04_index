			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Handling China's grain The World Bank has appointed LG MOUCHEL &amp; PARTNERS as chief adviser to the Chinese Ministry of Domestic Trade in a large investment programme to improve the efficiency of China's domestic and international grain management. A network of modern storage installations will be constructed including local primary depots servicing a number of farms, intermediate depots at strategic railheads and installations of up to 300,000 tonnes capacity at a number of deepwater ports. The storage installations will be equipped with appropriate aeration and drying facilities to conserve the grain and bulk handling methods for grain will be introduced to replace the traditional bagged handling methods. At the port locations, modern high capacity bulk ship loading and unloading equipment and deepwater berths will allow the transport of grain by large bulk grain carriers which can transport their cargo to large population centres in China or to overseas markets.</p>

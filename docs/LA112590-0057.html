			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW PERSPECTIVE ON WILD WEST  </P> <P> There are two prongs to the famous "frontier thesis" which reporter Terry  Pristin looks at in her piece on historians of the American West ("Taming of  the Wild West Is Rewritten by Scholars," Part A, Nov. 14). On the one hand, the  man who came up with this thesis, Frederick Jackson Turner, related American  democracy to the "safety valve" function of the frontier.  </P> <P> So long as there was lots of land on the other side of the border, and you were  willing to destroy any Indian nation that stood in your way, losers in the  "settled areas" could move west, get land of their own and become part of the  self-supporting, self-governing mainstream.  </P> <P> This was the historical part of the thesis. Turner used it to explain how the  nation had managed to flourish up to 1890, expanding in the course of three  centuries from one edge of the continent to the other.  </P> <P> Turner's second point was more threatening, and perhaps more relevant. To make  it possible for you to afford your special version of democracy, he warned us,  you have had to take over this entire land mass. The question now is, where are  you going to expand next?  </P> <P> Teddy Roosevelt in Panama and the Philippines, Woodrow Wilson in Vera Cruz,  Haiti and Flanders, Lyndon Johnson in Vietnam, Ronald Reagan in Nicaragua and  Grenada, each had his own answer to Turner's challenge. George Bush's upcoming  grab for Middle Eastern oil is in the same brutal tradition.  </P> <P> Surely it's time to stop playing this same bloody record. Bush seems locked in  some abstract macho dance. Must Congress insist upon playing to his tune?  </P> <P> BILL DOYLE, Chair  </P> <P> Social and Behavioral Science  </P> <P> Los Angeles Southwest College  </P></p>

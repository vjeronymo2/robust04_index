			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Wider VAT might yield Pounds 9bn EXTENDING the range of goods on which value added tax is levied might add revenue of more than Pounds 9bn to the Exchequer. Treasury officials have suggested that ministers may consider levying VAT on goods such as domestic fuel, public transport, new housebuilding and newspapers. Customs &amp; Excise said yesterday that there was no intention either to remove any goods from zero-rating for VAT or to change the present VAT rate. Treasury estimates last released in July in a parliamentary answer show that total VAT forgone as a result of zero-rated goods was Pounds 17.1bn in the year to last April. That may be an over-estimate because it ignores 'second-round effects' - consumption falling as the additional tax raised prices. The government has a number of options for raising more VAT: Reduce the number of exempt, zero-rated goods. Increase the basic rate of VAT beyond 17.5 per cent. Introduce a new intermediate VAT rate or a higher, luxury goods rate. Reduce the threshold for VAT registrations by companies below the existing Pounds 36,600 turnover. The first option is the most likely. The thrust of government initiatives has been towards increasing the VAT threshold - which rose by the maximum permissible amount in the last Budget - and keeping VAT low compared with other EC states. Agreements by the European finance ministers would limit VAT rates to between 15 per cent and 25 per cent, placing a ceiling on significant increases. Reducing the number of zero-rated goods would be controversial. The sixth directive from the EC permits goods that were zero-rated for VAT before 1991 to retain that status. Once taxed, exempt status can never be regained. Levying VAT on books, magazines and newspapers would be likely to bring criticism from the education lobby. Levies on public transport and domestic fuel would be criticised for the damage to those on low incomes - although they could be com-pensated with extra allow-ances. The estimated Pounds 3.4bn forgone from new construction would equally come under attack. Mr Roger Humber, director of the Housebuilders Federation, said VAT on the sale of new houses would be 'utterly nonsensical'. Items that have not been mentioned for VAT rating include the single one that provides most potential for additional revenue and controversy: food other than restaurant meals, which could have generated about Pounds 7bn in the last fiscal year. Equally, there has been no mention of introducing VAT on drugs and medicines on prescription, which might generate Pounds 400m, or on water and sewage charges, estimated to be worth Pounds 500m.</p>

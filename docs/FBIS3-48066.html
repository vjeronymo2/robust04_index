The rallies, organised by the military government's new  Union  Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) were designed to  obtain the people's approval for six motions aimed at "the  emergence of a peaceful, prosperous and modern nation". They  took place at Rangoon, Mandalay, Meikthila, Taunggyi and in  other cities.    On Thursday at Pegu, 80 kilometres northeast of Rangoon,  120,000 people were reported to have assembled at the district  sports stadium for what was the first major political gathering  in the city since the demonstrations against military rule in  1988. People congregated at 5.30 a.m., before marching behind  banners along four different routes from different quarters of  the city.    Some 25,000 came from the west of Pegu alone and passed the  site of a massacre in August 1988, where seven students were  shot dead when they confronted the military in the popular  democracy uprising that claimed the lives of thousands of  Burmese citizens. The four groups met around the towering  Shwemawdaw Pagoda, which overlooks the district stadium.    Only a fraction of those who arrived could fit inside the  stadium where USDA officials, including the Central Executive  Committee Member, U Pan Aung, addressed the rally. People  started dispersing from around the Pagoda soon after the meeting  had started.    State media reported that six motions were "unanimously  approved" by over 120,000 at the rally.    On the previous day, USDA representatives toured the city in  vehicles with loudspeakers announcing that at least three  members of each family should attend. A railway worker said  that he could not afford to be absent from the meeting or he  would be fined 200 kyat (equivalent to US$1.70 on the black  market).    "For 200 kyat," the man said, "I can feed my wife and three  children for two days."    The procession to the stadium was marked in part by a  carnival atmosphere, with musicians and marching bands. The  military presence was low other than at the entrance near the  stage, where the USDA officials addressed the rally.    A private tutor in the stadium remarked that most Burmese  easily forgot the sufferings of the past, but remained sceptical  of USDA rhetoric.    "They are happy just to exist," he said. He thought they  would not have attended without the threat of a fine. [passage  omitted]</p>

(A&amp;G) has filed a notice of exemption to acquire from Abbeville &amp; Grimes Railway Company (Abbeville) and to operate approximately 27 rail miles in Alabama, between Abbeville and Grimes, together with incidental trackage rights over 7 miles of CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) lines between Grimes and Dothan, AL, and substantially all of the other railroad operating assets of Abbeville. The proposed transaction is expected to be consummated promptly upon the effectiveness of the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&amp;G is 100% owned and controlled by Rail Partners, L.P. (Partners), a Delaware limited partnership, and Panama City Beach Office Park, Ltd. (Office Park), a Florida limited partnership (collectively, Owners). Neither Partners nor Office Park is a carrier, and Office Park does not currently control a carrier. However, Partners is jointly owned and controlled by Mr. K. Earl Durden (Durden), Green Bay Packaging, Inc. (GBP), and Rail Management and Consulting Corporation (RMCC), and with them jointly owns and controls several class III rail carriers. Office Park is jointly owned and controlled by Partners and RMCC, and is thus under common control with those class III carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> None of the class III carriers currently affiliated with Owners connects with A&amp;G. However, Durden, GBP, Partners, and RMCC are, by a contemporaneously filed notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32436,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rail Management and Consulting Corporation, Green Bay Packaging, Inc., K.

After the closing, a separate petition for exemption, or other pleading, will be filed with the Commission, seeking authority for them to dissolve the voting trust and acquire direct control over A&amp;G.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on Donald G. Avery, Slover &amp; Loftus, 1224 17th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20036.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ab initio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Decided: January 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Commission, David M.

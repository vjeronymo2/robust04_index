			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / German prospects gloomy: Business community pessimistic on the recovery THE west German business community sees no sign of an early recovery from the current recession, even if the decline in economic activity has slowed down, according to the latest comprehensive survey of business opinion. The autumn poll of 25,000 enterprises in east and west Germany, conducted by the German chamber of trade and industry (DIHT), shows a continuing improvement in the mood in the east, but an overwhelmingly gloomy assessment of prospects in the vital western economy. However, the federal statistics office released a more cheerful indicator yesterday, suggesting manufacturing industry orders in west Germany increased by 1 per cent in September, compared with August. The combined level of August and September orders was still 5.4 per cent below the value of the previous year, with the sharpest decline in the value of orders for investment goods - down 6.7 per cent. The key conclusions of the business survey are for a further decline in investments in the coming year, and a continuing loss of jobs in the west, although with a slowdown in redundancies in the east. 'There is still no sign of a recovery in the (western) economy,' Mr Franz Schoser, chief executive of the DIHT. 'Signs of stabilisation at a low level are emerging.' A marginal improvement in expectations for 1994 - with 20 per cent of the enterprises expecting an improvement, compared with only 12 per cent in the last spring survey - is based mainly on hopes for a recovery in exports. Some 24 per cent expect higher exports, compared with only 16 per cent in the spring. 'The frosty investment climate has grown more severe,' Mr Schoser said. 'The consolidation measures in the public sector are regarded as inadequate. Hopes for a cut in taxes are receding.' One positive assessment was over the effect of the reduction in interest rates, which should reduce business costs, and stimulate consumption. However, the number of enterprises planning to increase employment in the coming year shrank to just 5 per cent, compared with 7 per cent in the spring.</p>

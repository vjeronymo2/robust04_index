			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Technology: Now you see it, now you don't - The implications of a device that substitutes broadcast images Five years of effort to develop the technology for a powerful new broadcasting system unveiled last month may seem like nothing compared with the commercial and ethical wrangles to come. Matra Hachette Multimedia chose the annual international sports and television convention in Monte Carlo to launch a system that permits the electronic substitution of the advertising hoardings transmitted in televised sporting events. At the heart of the product is Epsis, a software package developed by Lagadere Group, owner of Matra Hachette Multimedia and the ultimate parent of Matra, the defence, electronics and media group. It was based on work conducted for Matra Cap Systems for the aerospace industry. It processes broadcast images and inserts computer-generated equivalents in their place. The idea behind the new application - which cost several tens of millions of French francs to develop - was mainly to be able to help advertisers using hoardings in sporting events broadcast in more than one country. They might want to use different images, brand names or the local language in the places where the event is shown. There are also wider applications. Advertisers might want their ads to appear at certain times, such as at the start or end of an event. They might not want to reach an audience in all markets receiving broadcasts. Equally, advertising restrictions of some products, such as alcohol or tobacco, vary between countries requiring, variations in advertising treatments. Epsis offers a solution, by permitting substitution of any two-dimensional image broadcast during a sporting event. A hoarding or even a car number-plate can be altered, with the replacement fitting exactly in the space of the original. It can also create new 'virtual' billboards where none exists at the site of the sporting event. The technology uses the signals from a series of cameras located at the broadcast event. First, the software identifies and captures the image of the billboard identified by an operator. It tracks this image electronically as it moves across the television screen. It also isolates barriers or other images on the background to the billboard. These three elements then allow it to substitute the 'real' image for another. Arnaud Lagadere, head of Matra Hachette, said that one of the challenges has been to maintain the image even when it is obstructed by, for example, players moving in front of the billboards. Another was tracking images that were moving. In these cases, some of the substitution can still only be done using pre-recorded material. However, he says, these problems should be resolved within the next year, with the full system commercially available by 1996. During the first live test of the system in front of several hundred conference delegates in Monte Carlo, Matra was able to switch images comfortably - although there was some slight difference in resolution indicating that the replacement image was electronically imposed. The potential ramifications for advertisers are vast. The system could allow far greater volumes of advertising, with much greater differentiation in timing, positioning and geographical focus of images. The company estimates that the European market for sports advertising alone is worth more than FFr15bn (Pounds 1.8bn). It is also growing fast, with the airtime devoted to sport rising from 24,000 hours in 1989 to 55,000 last year. The markets have become so big, and the regulatory hurdles so complex, that it may make it more difficult than ever for all but the largest companies to be able to afford a global advertising campaign. Segmenting the market using Epsis, says Lagadere, makes the medium available to smaller advertisers. But the new system could also pose ethical problems In the words of Michel Hidalgo, a French sporting personality: 'This is a very impressive invention. But will athletes' rights be interfered with? Will they be able to protect themselves from being associated with products they are not familiar with or do not approve of? We have to avoid excesses.' A representative of the International Olympic Committee, which has no plans to permit advertising at its events, asked about the regulatory implications. 'When you change the image, the person watching will no longer know what is really happening.' He urged clear labelling to show that the picture received on television sets was not the same as that seen by spectators at the event. 'We are trying to deal with the technology. The rest is for someone else to cope with,' is Lagadere's response. His company suggests that those using the system will be given a copy of an 'Epsis charter' on ethical issues, and the company will provide events organisers with contractual clauses to help them negotiate terms with advertisers. Nevertheless, as Neal Pilson, former president of CBS, the US broadcasting organisation, puts it: 'This is wonderful and exciting, but the easy part was developing the technology. The hard part will be reconciling it into a very complex business context.'</p>

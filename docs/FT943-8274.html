			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / More pass A-levels in spite of smaller entry The number of school pupils passing GCE A-level examinations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland reached a record this year in spite of a 4 per cent reduction in the number of 18-year-olds, the government announced today. But falling applications for science subjects accentuated concern raised this week by a government inspectors' report which found that in England and Wales 'not all science and mathematics teachers have the skills and talents required to do their job'. The numbers taking physics at A-level fell 5.8 per cent following a fall of 9.6 per cent last year. Chemistry entries rose by 0.6 per cent, but this still left numbers short of their 1992 levels following a 4.5 per cent fall last year. Instead, there was an increase of 15.5 per cent in the 'all other subjects' category, which includes film, theatre, and media studies. Economics suffered the single greatest fall in applications, of 15.2 per cent, following 10 per cent last year, as students seem instead to be increasingly attracted to business studies, up 9.9 per cent. While the numbers attempting the exams fell only 0.4 per cent compared with last year's record high entry, pass rates improved significantly, meaning that there were more passes. The proportion passing with at least a grade C - usually the level required by universities - rose 2.2 percentage points, while the share of candidates managing at least a pass grade E rose 1.8 percentage points. Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, welcomed the result and made a strong defence of the qualification, in spite of calls for its abolition by the Labour party. He said: 'Today's results prove that GCE A-levels remain popular and are more successful than ever before. They are a world-renowned trademark of Britain's educational excellence.' He said the government remained committed to the exams, which would continue to be offered alongside general national vocational qualification (GNVQs). He predicted that more students would 'mix and match' A-level and vocational qualifications. Ms Kathleen Tattersall, chief executive of the Northern Examinations and Assessment Board who speaks for the GCE boards, said the better results had been driven by 'increased competition for university places and jobs, combined with improvements in the preparation and presentation of students for examinations'. But teachers gave the figures a more cautious welcome. Ms Gillian Wood, assistant general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: 'The number of young people who leave school or college with a qualification at 18 is still far too low. 'We not only need to maintain the quality of A-levels but also to widen the range of opportunities for youngsters to encourage them to stay on at school or college.'</p>

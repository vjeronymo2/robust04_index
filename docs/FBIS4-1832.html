			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] A so-called consensus reached between the leaders  of two semiofficial organizations in February [words indistinct]  impasse for the latest round of talks Taiwan and Mainland China.  Taiwan's chief negotiator Hsu Hui-yu, deputy secretary general  of the Strait Exchange Foundation, made a statement Thursday [31  March] upon his return from Peking. While there, he failed to  reach agreement on any topic with his Mainland Chinese  counterpart Sun Yafu. Sun is deputy secretary general of the  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits. Both  organizations are literally private and authorized by Taipei and  Peking, respectively, to tackle bilateral affairs in absence of  official links. The consensus Hsu referred to was the one  reached between his superior Chiao Jen-ho and mainland's Tang  Shubei during their meeting in Peking earlier this year on the  repatriation of hijackers and illegal stowaways and cross-strait  fishing disputes.</p>

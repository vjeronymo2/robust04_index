			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Broad Left wins in BT union poll GROWING unrest over changes in working practices and job cuts at British Telecommunications have led to an unexpectedly victory by the Broad Left in this year's executive committee elections in the 125,000-strong National Communications Union. The success of the left may threaten the union's policy of co-operation with BT over its plans to cut 15,000 jobs this year with a further 15,000 due to go in 1994. The election has left a group of leftwing Labour party members and members of far left groups holding 20 of the 35 executive seats. The rightwing Members First organisation suffered a loss of 10 seats, being reduced to only three places with the clerical group holding the other 12 executive places. One NCU official said the main reason for the sweeping victory by the Broad Left was the threat of compulsory seven-day shift working and extension of the existing working day under BT's customer improvement programme. Mr Tony Young, the NCU's moderate general secretary, said yesterday there were 'no viable options' to the NCU's current strategy towards BT. He added that any refusal by the union to work with BT would be 'unwise' and ensure it exercised 'less influence' in the company. The change in the executive's balance of power could also lead to a shift in its policy to the rejection of one-member-one-vote for the selection of Labour party parliamentary candidates. This would be a setback to the chances of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, winning a vote on the issue at the autumn party conference.</p>

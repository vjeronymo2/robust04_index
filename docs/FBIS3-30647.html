According to data released by the Socialists, the BSP has over  400,000 members and over 20,000 activists in its more than  10,000 local organizations. The BSP Supreme Council passed a  resolution prioritizing the personnel problem and describing it  as a key one for the BSP efficient work and the implementation  of its policy under the new conditions. This is an essential  problem of the democratization of the party and its intraparty  life, the resolution reads. It lists the immediate prospects  for the BSP participation in the government and points out the  necessity of building a consistent system for BSP organizational  and personnel work under the new circumstances.    10 percent of the electorate will vote for the New Policy  Centre (NPC), NPC leader Dimitur Ludzhev predicted at a news  conference in Kurdzhali, southern Bulgaria, today. Once again  he described the 1994 draft budget proposed by the cabinet as  unrealistic. [passage omitted]</p>

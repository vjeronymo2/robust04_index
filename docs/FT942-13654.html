			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Markets: Crucible caught in debt vice - The Bottom Line Morgan Crucible has had a ticklish problem over the past couple of years. The City has been uncomfortable with the level of its borrowings, which are equal to two-thirds of its net assets, but investors have been reluctant to support the obvious solution - a rights issue. During the 1980s, Morgan Crucible served up dollops of new shares to fund acquisitions and, after rights issues in 1990 and 1991, institutions felt they had had enough. For some time Morgan Crucible has been suggesting another solution - the sale of its Holt Lloyd car care subsidiary - and last week it hinted that a deal was close. The delay in consummating a deal has proved rather fortunate since Holt Lloyd has staged a very strong recovery pushing up its potential price. Last year its profits jumped from Pounds 4.1m to a new peak of Pounds 7.7m on sales of Pounds 99m, prompting some analysts to predict a sale price of around Pounds 80m. That would cut gearing to about 30 per cent and finally dispel the rights issue cloud hanging over the shares. Beneath the cloud the picture is of a company which has come through the recession pretty well and, thanks to the acquisitions of the last few years, is well-placed to prosper in the 1990s. The rights issues of 1990 and 1991 provided the funds to buy market share in its core businesses and have left Morgan Crucible the world leader in carbon brushes - used in electric motors - ceramic fibre and the eponymous crucibles, and a number of technical ceramic products. Indeed it is now so dominant in many of its markets in the US and Europe that it would be precluded from making further acquisitions by anti-trust regulations. Instead it is concentrating on rationalising the dozens of plants it inherited, which are scattered around the world. In carbon it is cutting back the number of plants in the US, and in Europe concentrating production on the two countries where its costs are lowest - the UK and Hungary. Bruce Farmer, chief executive, believes such restructuring and improvements in its manufacturing processes could increased margins from just over 10 per cent to 14 per cent within two to three years. At the same time, after several years of weak product prices, some increases are starting to stick, much to the relief of those smaller rivals which have survived the recession. As a result, some analysts are predicting that group profits will rise by almost a third over the next two years helped by a strong economic background in the Americas and east Asia which provide half its sales. But what of the longer term prospects? Some of the group's products, notably carbon brushes and crucibles, are in distinctly mature markets, at least in the developed world. But it has good exposure to less advanced economies in South America, the former eastern bloc and China where demand for its most basic products is likely to grow strongly over the next few years. Having set up a greenfield thermal ceramics plant in China six years ago and bought a stake in one of its largest carbon brush factories, the group is about to take a controlling interest in a speciality chemicals business. In Russia, it is still negotiating for the return of its St Petersburg plant which it abandoned in 1923. Morgan Crucible has also proved adept at developing new uses for ceramics - for example in artificial hip joints and safety air bags in cars - and calculates that 18 per cent of 1993 profits came from products it did not have three years ago. Two years of cash outflow were also reversed in 1993, thanks partly to tighter control of working capital, with a strong inflow recorded in the first half. That in itself helped to revitalise the share price which has outperformed the market by almost 20 per cent over the past six months. After rising 8 per cent to Pounds 66m last year analysts' conservative profit forecasts range up to around Pounds 73m for 1994. That puts the shares on around 17 times prospective earnings - a healthy premium to the market as a whole - and at this level new buyers would have to treat them as a long-term investment.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BOOKSHELF: RAISING KIDS: SOME INSIGHTS;  </P> <P> DISCIPLINING YOUR PRESCHOOLER AND FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT BY MITCH GOLANT AND  SUSAN K. GOLANT (LOWELL HOUSE: PAPER, $9.95).  </P> <P> Hindsight being the best kind of vision, the husband-and-wife authors recall  with 20/20 clarity their own successful methods in raising two lovely  daughters.  </P> <P> Where did they go right? Dividing their chapters into topics such as setting  limits, "time out" to resolve unfriendly exchanges, holding family conferences,  practicing consistency and following through are some of the familiar tenets of  this pleasant book.  </P> <P> As young parents, they once took their toddlers to a fancy restaurant after a  full day at Hearst Castle, resulting in cries and whimpers. A similar disaster  at Disneyland taught them to limit excursions to only an hour, entry price  notwithstanding; they learned too, and pass on the suggestion, not to stage  elaborate birthday parties, recalling when their 4-year-old guests failed to  open a pinata filled with melting Snickers bars.  </P> <P> College-educated parents may find most of the Golants' advice on the  featherweight side, but Chapter 7, stressing the importance of positive  reinforcement, holds insight for moms and dads of all backgrounds.

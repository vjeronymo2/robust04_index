Nevertheless, a parity will be established between the  Ufir and the URV so that when the URV is instituted as currency,  the Ufir may be equal to a certain fraction of the new currency.  There would thus be a rate of exchange between the Ufir and the  URV in the same way as there is a dollar exchange rate. The  proposal to let the Ufir continue along with the URV seeks to  head off legal actions. During the stage in which the URV will  only be a reference index, the Ufir will continue to be  effective with its present structure. However, once the URV is  instituted as currency, the Ufir will disappear.    The contention of Central Bank Foreign Area Director Gustavo  Franco is that this transition system to index taxes will do  away with all the legal impediments that prevented the adoption  of the URV for tax purposes. The great stumbling block  presented by the Federal Revenue Service was a provision  established in the National Tax Code stipulating that taxes  should be indexed to the past inflation, which ended up by being  incorporated into jurisprudence by the Federal Supreme Court  [STF]. According to the definition cited in the text of the  economic program, the URV would reflect the current inflation  and would not be used for indexation purposes.    Suggestion -- Special Adviser Edmar Bacha went as far as  suggesting that indexing taxes to the URV should be optional.  Taxpayers could then choose to index their taxes to the Ufir,  the value of which would continue changing, or to the URV, the  value of which would be adjusted but to a lesser degree.    The Federal Revenue Service questioned the use of the URV  for  tax purposes because it feared that a disaster similar to the  one that took place in 1991 would supervene. At that time the  government was defeated time and again at the STF due to the  obduracy of the team of former Minister Zelia [Cardoso de Mello,  economy minister under Fernando Collor] to use the TR [Reference  Interest Rate] as reference index.</p>

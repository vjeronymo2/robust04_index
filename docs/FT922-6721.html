			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Letter: Law change that would remove inequities in pension schemes Your leader ('Reform of the pension funds', May 11) rightly highlighted the need for reform of the current occupational pensions framework. I fear that tinkering with the existing structure, such as extending the 'Club' transfer model as suggested by Mr Redman (Letters, May 13) complicates matters. The final salary legislative framework that has evolved is already so complex that the vast majority of its beneficiaries do not comprehend it and it needs its own 'industry' to translate it. Potentially, money purchase schemes have the merit of simplicity - and do not suffer from the cross-subsidies and questions of ownership that plague final salary schemes. Investment risks exist but these can be minimised. More importantly, the members undeniably benefit from favourable investment performance. Unfortunately, occupational money purchase schemes remain subject to many of the final salary benefit restrictions and other legal requirements. Company-sponsored personal pensions plans, with freedom of investment, offer a far simpler and flexible solution - but a change to the Financial Services Act legislation is needed to enable employers actively to 'promote' such schemes. This step, along with the introduction of some safeguards such as restrictions on the marketing of high-cost products and controls on commission levels, would go a long way to solving the inequities and other recently exposed limitations of final salary schemes.

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures weaken FT-SE Index as account ends - Market Report The impending expiry in the stock index futures market struck hard at blue chip share prices in London yesterday, taking 10 points off the most recent gain in the FT-SE Index. The premium of the December futures contract to the underlying Footsie Index, which has helped drive equities ahead this week, opened strongly but was steadily erased during the session. With the equity trading account period closing tonight, the equity market followed the futures contract closely yesterday. After opening easier while awaiting the futures pricing and then drifting down by nearly 17 Footsie points, the market turned higher when the contract showed a 10 point premium. But the day's peak of 3,284.4 on the stock market was quickly wiped out when the December contract plunged from 3,293 to 3,268. At the close, the FT-SE Index showed a net loss on the day of 10.3 at 3,261.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, free from the direct influence of the stock index market, gained 5.1 to a new peak of 3,601.3. Private investors have turned to the Mid 250 Index sector in the search for growth stocks. Aggressive trading between the futures and the equity market held the day's Seaq volume at 862.5m shares compared with 884.3m in the previous session; Thursday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.96bn, confirming the presence of the big institutions in the London market this week. Last night the Footsie Index showed a gain of 4.8 per cent over the two-week trading account. The account has taken in the UK Budget from Mr Kenneth Clarke, which has been received very positively in London by both domestic and overseas investors. This week saw the Footsie extend its Budget gain by a further 27.1 points as global stock bourses have shown increasing optimism for cuts in interest rates across Europe. These hopes have buttressed expectations that UK interest rates will be reduced in the new year from the present 5.5 per cent to 5 per cent and, perhaps, below. Falls in the UK market yesterday were dismissed as little more than a combination of profit-taking as the equity trading account closed and frantic reshuffling by market-makers endeavouring to get positions straight before the December futures contract expires on Friday. The contract and the FT-SE Index itself must be in line at the expiry. A significant downward pull on the market yesterday came from the banking sector, which has risen strongly over the past month and now makes up an important statistical factor in index calculations. Oil shares, another important area for the market as a whole, continued to feel the effects of weakness in global crude oil prices. Consumer stocks, which have benefited from base rate optimism since the Budget removed fears of higher personal taxes in the UK, drifted easier yesterday but strategists saw no change in the positive views underpinning the sector. Next week brings a heavy list of data on the UK economy, led on Monday by the latest figures on producer prices and industrial output, and followed at mid-week by the UK retail price index, the prime indicator of inflationary pressure. In addition, the UK market faces the weekly meeting of the Bundesbank policy council, which will be watched keenly for any move on German interest rates in the wake of the cut this week in Bundesbank repo rates.</p>

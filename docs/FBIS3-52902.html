			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Future Efforts"] </F>   [Excerpts] Five years after the crash of a Pan American  airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, the Zionist-influenced mass  media has started fresh efforts to involve Iran in the issue.    The most important document that the Western mass media  refers to is based on former American spy Lester Coleman's  allegations that since former British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher implies in her book of memoirs that Libya is innocent,  therefore Iran is the main culprit in the explosion. [passage  omitted]    In weaving their tale, the Western press also alleges that  since the condenser on the time bomb used on the Pan American  aircraft was similar to a condenser that was sold to East  Germany by a Swiss company in 1985--three years before the  Lockerbie explosion--and since Ahmad Jibril--whom they believe  to be responsible for the crash--had good relations with East  Germany, Iran, and Syria, therefore Tehran and Damascus are  directly involved in the incident. [passage omitted]    On the basis of Zionist propaganda, the Islamic Republic of  Iran and Syria are the main elements behind the American plane  crash; and according to this propaganda, the reason why Iran and  Syria have not been prosecuted as the main culprits so far is  because this has not been deemed politically advisable because  the United States needed Syria in the war against Iraq and it  now needs Syria to advance the Middle East peace plan.  Therefore, this is why only Libya was the target of American  anger and UN sanctions. [passage omitted]    Political observers believe that the current propaganda is  directly linked with the Islamic Republic's defense of the  aspirations of the Palestinian people and that the fresh Zionist  propaganda against Iran after a five-year silence should be  discussed within the context of the intensification of the  Palestinian people's struggles and the continuation of the  Intifadah in the occupied territories.    The United States and world Zionism have always considered  Iran to be the main obstacle to the Middle East peace talks.  Also, the United States considers its major regional policy to  be the isolation of Iran and the portrayal of an ugly and harsh  face of Iran so that the way can be paved for isolating Iran on  the one hand and for perpetrating numerous crimes on the other,  especially when one analyzes the downing of the Iranian  passenger plane over the Persian Gulf. [passage omitted]    Apparently the Americans intend to pave the way for more  instigations in the region through the contrivance of their  agents. But the American statesmen should not forget the  disgrace they have suffered in Somalia.</p>

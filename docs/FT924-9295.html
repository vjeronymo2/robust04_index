			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers seek boost for housing projects NEW MEASURES to square the circle of helping the construction industry without adding too much to public spending will include changes to the arrangements for combined public-sector and private-sector funding for Housing Corporation projects. Ministers from the Treasury and the Department of the Environment are still agreeing the details of plans to 'stretch' the amount of public spending in grants to housing associations, whose public funding is administered by the Housing Corporation. At present, the balance is 75 per cent public funding to 25 per cent from the private sector, but that is set to tilt towards the private sector. Officials are conscious of the need to ensure that the arrangements are not so altered that private finance cannot be attracted. The Treasury is said to have been talked down from its original 'optimistic' estimates of the terms that would appeal to the private sector. One of the main aspects to ministers' consideration of how to allocate public spending on housing is its impact on the building industry. Officials have been told to carry out extensive studies on the effect on the construction industry of money spent on renovation and on new building. It is also likely that the fall in land prices will enable ministers to claim that the Tories' election manifesto commitment to the Housing Corporation, of Pounds 6bn over three years to build 153,000 homes, is being met in terms of the number of units rather than the cash figure. Whitehall departments have been hard-pressed to devise proposals to meet Mr John Major's commitment to a package of measures to help the economy in time for the Autumn Statement next week, and some officials say that some of the more radical suggestions will have to be wait until next year.</p>

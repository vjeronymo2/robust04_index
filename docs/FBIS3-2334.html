For the first  discussion in this series, see page 52 of the 3 March China  DAILY REPORT.]    [Text] Leading troops is a kind of learning experience  involving wide and expert knowledge. Militarists of the past  and present have done a lot of expositions on management of  armies and troops. In generalizing the four major functions of  commanders-- leading, maintaining, training, and using  troops--Mao Zedong and other revolutionaries of the older  generation explicitly put forward the idea of "putting leading  troops in the first place." This shows that leading troops is  fundamental and essential and sometimes racks the brains more  than using troops. In the new situation today, it is all the  more necessary and pressing to put consummate skill at leading  troops into management practice of the armed forces. In a  certain sense, making efforts to study the new constantly  developing and changing situations the armed forces are faced  with and studying with concentration how to lead troops in  keeping with the new situation are points at which to make a  breakthrough in strengthening and improving troop management at  present.    A correct understanding of the new situation the armed  forces  face is the prerequisite for the study and exploration of how to  lead troops in the new period. We should see that further  reform and opening up and the acceleration of establishment of  the socialist market economy structure have provided many  favorable conditions for the building of the armed forces and  have also set new and even higher demands on the management of  the armed forces. For example, the composition, concept of  value, and the changes and improvements of the cultural quality,  of officers and soldiers have set new standards for leading  troops in a scientific manner; the changes in the social  environment where the troops are garrisoned have an impact on  the traditional mode of management of the armed forces; and with  the growth of national strength and the constant updating of  weapons and equipment, many new tasks have cropped up the  management of the armed forces. All this needs great enthusiasm  and efforts to study and explore. In the new situation, it will  not do to one-sidedly exaggerate some negative factors and to  attempt nothing and accomplish nothing, and we should adopt an  attitude of making full use of favorable factors to educate and  manage the armed forces, skillfully changing negative factors  into positive factors, and skillfully summing up the laws of  activities in practice in order to lead the troops better.    To explore how to lead troops in the new situation, we must  further emancipate our minds, be courageous in conducting  reform, and grope new paths and create new ways in practice.  With the prerequisite of contributing to increasing combat  effectiveness, maintaining a high degree of stability,  centralization, and unity, and strengthening the adhesive force  of the armed forces and of contributing to maintaining the good  relationship between officers and soldiers, we should be  courageous and good at learning from, and making use as  reference, all advanced and useful experience and methods of  management in China and abroad and within and outside the armed  forces in a bid to strengthen and improve management work of our  armed forces.    Exploring ways of leading troops in the new situation is not  contradictory to inheriting and carrying forward the glorious  traditions of our armed forces in managing and leading troops,  and we should never set the two against each other. A whole set  of fine traditions characteristics of the people's armed forces  formed in over a long period of practice in managing of troops  remain to be magic weapons in managing and leading troops in the  new period. Recently, Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed: It is  necessary to properly study new things cropped up in the  relationship between officers and men in the new situation,  carry forward the fine tradition of respecting officers and  cherishing soldiers and unity between officers and men, and form  a close and good relationship of mutual care and mutual help  between officers and men. This is the essence of the traditions  of leading troops of our armed forces and is the fundamental  attitude which the new generation of troop leaders must adopt.  Only if we, while carrying forward fine traditions, explore new  ways of leading troops in accordance with the constantly  developing new situation can we deal with changes through making  changes, handle matters with facility, and raise the management  of the armed forces to a high level.    If a qualified commander, a commander in war, can adapt  himself to changing conditions, and make successful offensive  and defensive, he of course should be praised. Likewise, if, in  times of peace, a commander can skillfully manage the armed  forces under various conditions, has good ways of leading troops  so that the troops can always maintain a high combat  effectiveness, his contribution should not be left unrecognized.  Today, before a series of new situations and new tasks, troop  leaders at all level are required to go all out to explore the  art of leading troops to keep abreast of the new situation, to  display their talent in the vast field of troop management, and  to render meritorious services in their sacred posts of leading  troops!</p>

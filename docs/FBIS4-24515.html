			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- More than 14,000 pirated  video tapes and 6,000 laser discs were crushed Saturday [28 May]  to mark the government's determination to end intellectual  property rights (IPR) infringement in Taiwan.    The counterfeit tapes and discs, worth over NT [New Taiwan]  $20 million (US$740,000), were destroyed in an annual IPR  crackdown campaign sponsored by the Government Information  Office, National Bureau of Standards, and the Copyrights  Protection Committee of the Interior Ministry.    In a speech before the ceremonial destruction, Vice Interior  Minister Yang Pao-fa said Taiwan is entering a "users pay" era  after the country vowed to join the international community in a  campaign to eliminate IPR and copyright infringement.    Yang said it is particularly important for Taiwan to observe  IPR protection practices as the country is supposed to develop  intellectual property rights protection relations with 118  member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) upon joining the world trade regulatory body.    Yang urged the public to cooperate with the government in  achieving the ambitious goal of making Taiwan a  "counterfeit-free" country.</p>

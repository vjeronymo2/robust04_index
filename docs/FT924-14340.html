			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford warns of quarterly deficit SHARES in Ford Motor, the US motor manufacturer, fell sharply yesterday morning following a warning from the company of third-quarter losses which might extend into the final three months of the year. The profits warning came after the market closed on Thursday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a Dollars 1bn offer of perpetual preferred stock. Ford shares closed at Dollars 34 3/4 , down Dollars 2 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Ford said industry sales rates in the US, Europe and other markets remained low compared with long-term trend levels and these factors, coupled with seasonal dealer inventory adjustments, were expected to result in a third-quarter loss. Analysts had already been forecasting a loss for the period of around Dollars 150m. Ford added that its losses could extend into the fourth quarter, partially offsetting the Dollars 840m the company earned in the first half of the year. However, Ford said it still expected 1992 full-year results to represent a substantial improvement over its Dollars 2.26bn losses in 1991 and it expected continued improvement in 1993 earnings, 'assuming that US and European economic conditions and industry volumes improve'. The company said the issue of preferred stock, which will not be convertible into Ford common stock, represented 'an attractive opportunity to take advantage of strong individual investor demand and the present low level of fixed income yields'. The offering would be made in the near future after SEC approval. In November last year Ford sold Dollars 2.3bn of convertible preferred stock at an interest rate of 8.4 per cent. On Tuesday at the Paris Auto Show, Mr Allan Gilmour, Ford Automotive Group president, underlined the company's commitment to maintaining its product and technology investment programme despite market weakness. In the filing, Ford said it expected its second-half 1992 capital expenditures to exceed the Dollars 2.5bn in the first half of 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 8 (CNA) -- South Africa is not  expected to cut its longstanding diplomatic ties with the  Republic of China [ROC], the ROC ambassador to that country said  Wednesday [8 June].    Testifying before the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs  Committee, Ambassador Lu said South African President Nelson  Mandela personally assured President Li Teng-hui in May that the  South African Government under his leadership will continue its  formal ties with the ROC.    Mandela met with Li in Pretoria on May 11 after he was sworn  in as South Africa's first black president. Lu was present at  the Li-Mandela meeting.    During their 15-minute talk, Lu said, Mandela told Li not to  worry about relations between the two countries.    Mandela said his administration will follow the foreign  policy adopted by the previous white minority governments and  will continue its diplomatic ties with the ROC.    Lu quoted Mandela as stressing that unless the ROC does  something unfavorable to South Africa, Pretoria won't cut its  official ties with Taipei.    Mainland China is seeking to forge formal ties with South  Africa. It, however, wants Pretoria to first cut its ties with  the ROC.    Lu said although the new South African Government is willing  to develop ties with Beijing, it won't accept Beijing's  conditions.    The ROC has managed to improve its ties with the African  National Congress, South Africa's current ruling party, Lu said,  adding Taipei-Pretoria relations will remain solid in the years  ahead.    President Li attended Mandela's inauguration in May to  signify ROC's determination to strengthen its cooperation with  South Africa.    After his meeting with Mandela, Li told overseas Chinese  community leaders there that they can feel safe to "do big  business" in South Africa as Taipei-Pretoria ties will remain  strong.</p>

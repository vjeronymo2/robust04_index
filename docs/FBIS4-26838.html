			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing had a meeting here today with the full board of  directors of the recently-created Import and Export Bank of  China (CEIB).    He stressed the need to give the utmost help to promote  China's exports, particularly of machinery, electronics and  other equipment.    CEIB is China's second policy bank after the People's Bank  of  China, the central bank. Established in Beijing on April 27  this year, the bank is responsible for providing import and  export credits for capital goods, including large machinery and  electronic equipment.    It also handles credits as well as government and commercial  loans provided by foreign countries for their import of Chinese  capital goods.    Vice-Premier Li recalled that the bank was set up to meet  the  needs of establishing a socialist market economic system, speed  up the reform of the financial system, separate the policy  banking business from commercial banking business, enable the  country's foreign trade to develop in a sustained, steady and  healthy way, improve the structure, grade and quality of export  commodities, and increase exports.    Vice-Premier Li urged the CEIB to formulate strict rules and  regulations and establish a strict internal management system.</p>

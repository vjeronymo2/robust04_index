			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: THE DIRTY DOZEN HOPES TO KEEP 'EM ON  THEIR FEET  </P> <P> If you catch the Dirty Dozen Brass Band next Thursday night, Dec. 28, at the  Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, don't expect to spend much time sitting.  </P> <P> The New Orleans-based band has taken the instrumentation of a New Orleans  marching band and brewed a tangy gumbo for the '80s and '90s: pulsing bass and  sousaphone, with fast-moving rhythms, synchronized horn parts and plenty of  improvisation slathered liberally on top.  </P> <P> "I'm not satisfied until people are on their feet," said trumpeter and band  leader Gregory Davis.  </P> <P> The year has been busy for the Dirty Dozen, which took its name from a New  Orleans club but only has eight members.  </P> <P> Early this year, the band's new album "Voodoo," recorded in 1987, was finally  released on CBS Records after more than a year during which attorneys  negotiated a new contract for the group. Downbeat promptly accorded 4 1/2 of  five possible stars.  </P> <P> Financially, it was worth the wait; the band signed a six-record deal. But the  delay may have slowed their career in other ways.  </P> <P> "If you don't have name recognition, it helps to have records coming out,"  Davis said. "Then you have something for critics to talk about, and it gets you  out in the market and keeps you moving."  </P> <P> The band has been much in demand among musicians. Elvis Costello used them on  his last album, "Spike," and liked their work on the song "Stalin Malone" so  much he decided to leave off his vocals. He returns the favor by singing a tune  on the Dirty Dozen's new album, due for February release.  </P> <P> With rock stars such as David Byrne and Paul Simon warming audiences to the  possibilities of a variety of musical influences, the Dozen appears poised for  more success.  </P> <P> To its New Orleans roots -- including funeral marching bands, Louis Armstrong  and Sidney Bechet -- the band adds blues, be-bop, and improvisations ranging  from subtle twists of melody to unchained honking and screaming.  </P> <P> Although their eclectic sound is impossible to categorize, that's been a virtue  in the world of radio, according to Davis.  </P> <P> "Because we play a mixed bag of things, we're able to get on some of the blues  stations, some jazz formats, college radio.  </P> <P> "Lots of people still don't know what we do. They think they do, from pictures  or that scene in 'Live or Let Die,' the James Bond movie where we did a typical  New Orleans funeral scene. We have to overcome that. Call us what you want. We  play music you can dance to."  </P> <P> Five months ago, a group of San Diegans decided to form a serious salsa band.  Already, the 12-piece unit calling itself La Predilecta ("The Chosen One") has  drawn the attention of top Latin players. In recent weeks, the ensemble has  opened local shows for such spicemasters as Eddie Palmieri and Tito Puente.  </P> <P> This Saturday night, the group plays a dance benefit for La Casa de Puerto  Rico, a charitable organization that raised money for Puerto Rican hurricane  relief last October, helps feed the homeless and gives scholarships to needy  students, primarily of Puerto Rican background.  </P> <P> Martin W. Padilla, La Predilecta's lead singer and founder, says the music is  aimed at making people dance. The band's repertoire includes about a dozen  original tunes, plus several fresh Latin arrangements of jazz standards.  </P> <P> Admission to the Christmas dance at the downtown Marriott Hotel, which begins  at 8 p.m., is $10 in advance, $12 at the door. For information, call 461-6148.  </P> <P> Now that Liberace's gone, who will carry his flamboyant torch? One possibility  is San Diego pianist Peter Robberecht, who brings back memories of glittery  suits and giant candelabras.  </P> <P> "The way to define what I'm after is, I will be a New Age Liberace," said  Robberecht, who hopes to get a career break with some of his slow, dreamy demo  tapes, though his true love is cutting loose on stage.  </P> <P> Robberecht starts his audiences out low-key. But, halfway through his set, he  kicks away the piano bench, dons dark glasses and launches into his version of  Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire." The number peaks when Robberecht  executes his famous "bun run," a cheeky slide across the keyboard.  </P> <P> "That gets a hoot and holler," Robberecht said. "You spend your life trying to  become a major artist, then you slide your butt across the keys and people go  crazy."  </P> <P> Despite traces of Liberace, Barry Manilow and Elton John in Robberecht, his  musical background is classical. His mother plays classical piano, and  Robberecht cut his chops on Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart and such modern pianists  as Van Cliburn and Vladimir Horowitz.  </P> <P> Robberecht plays happy hours Wednesday through Saturday at the Catamaran, and  will also be on the night shift Fridays and Saturdays through January.  </P> <P> RIFFS: San Diego will gain another resident jazz giant in the New Year. As of  Jan. 1, guitarist Barney Kessel joins saxophonist James Moody and guitarist  Mundell Lowe in a line of recent immigrants. . . . Diego's Loft weekend:  Friday, John Best and Bobby Gordon; Saturday, Algo Caliente. . . . Mose Allison  will appear on KPBS-TV's "Club Date" program at 5 p.m. Friday.  </P></p>

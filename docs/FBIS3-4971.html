This news  conference is scheduled to last for approximately 20 minutes.    Mr. Prime Minister, you have decided to put off a reshuffle  of your cabinet. Mr. Prime Minister, I would ask you why you  have decided to put off a reshuffle of your cabinet. Mr. Prime  Minister, you have stated that your government will shift from a  government for political reform to a government for economic  reform and that you will work with this shift in mind. Mr.  Prime Minister, you have had difficulty handling the issue of  replacing the chief cabinet secretary. How are you going to  deal with these issues?    [Hosokawa] I have caused the people great worries. Yesterday  and today, I met with leaders of the ruling coalition parties to  ask them about their respective intraparty situation and their  views on the cabinet reshuffle. As you just said, I have worked  on political reform as a major item on my domestic policy agenda  for the past seven months since my government was inaugurated  last August. During that period, I have worked to deal with the  Uruguay Round and with a package of economic stimulus measures  and with the Japanese-U.S. framework talks. I think that all of  these have been major policy tasks for me.    Although the legislation for political reform has yet to be  completed, I think that in general, my government has completed  its first phase. From this point forward, my government will  enter its second phase. I think that during the first phase, my  government pushed for political reform. In the second phase, my  government will deal with Japanese-U.S. economic frictions and  will work on deregulation, which I believe is related to  Japanese-U.S. relations. Because of different tasks, the nature  of the government needs to be changed. In this context, I think  now is the time for a cabinet reshuffle. I officially mentioned  the issue of reshuffling my cabinet yesterday for the first  time. The issue of reshuffling my cabinet has been reported.    I yesterday met with leaders of the ruling coalition parties  to ask their views on a cabinet reshuffle for the first time. I  met with them yesterday and today to ask their views. I have  realized through a series of meetings with the leaders of the  ruling coalition parties that I should not do what might cause a  rift within the coalition government. Other leaders of the  ruling coalition parties said that it is not good to give the  impression that I am trying to oust a specific cabinet member.  In short, many leaders of the ruling coalition parties  expressed their opinion that the most important thing is to hold  the coalition government together.    I and many leaders of the ruling coalition parties have  considered the need to make the prime minister's official  residence function smoothly. As for the issue of replacing the  chief cabinet secretary, who plays the key role in the prime  minister's official residence, I have been concerned that the  ruling coalition parties have reacted against the chief cabinet  secretary's behavior. The chief cabinet secretary has worked  hard to support me.    There is the opinion that although Mr. Takemura is the head  of Sakigake [Harbinger], he should concentrate on his duties as  chief cabinet secretary. I said this straightforwardly to Mr.  Takemura today and asked him to take this into account. I asked  him to concentrate on his duties as chief cabinet secretary.  Needless to say, the duties of the chief cabinet secretary are  to coordinate views among the ruling coalition parties as well  as the opposition parties. I asked Mr. Takemura to concentrate  his efforts on coordinating views within the ruling coalition  parties on economic issues including Japanese-U.S. economic  frictions, which are emerging as a major item on the agenda of  my government. In response, Mr. Takemura told me that he fully  understood what I asked of him and that he will carry out his  duties keeping in mind what I have asked of him. As I said just  a while ago, in giving importance to the unity of the ruling  parties, I have decided to postpone a cabinet reshuffle.    [Reporter] You just said that you have postponed carrying  out a cabinet reshuffle at this point, but did you discuss with  the leaders of the coalition parties the possibility of  reshuffling the cabinet in the future, for example, after the  Diet passes the budget bill?    [Hosokawa] No, I did not.    [Reporter] You mentioned the treatment of the chief cabinet  secretary. Does your decision to postpone a cabinet reshuffle  mean that you will not remove Mr. Takemura from his post?    [Hosokawa] That is correct.    [Reporter] It may not be an appropriate expression, but from  what you have said, I understand that Mr. Takemura will not  resign voluntarily. Is my understanding correct?    [Hosokawa] I believe that he will not resign voluntarily.    [Reporter] You have planned to establish a new ministerial  post in charge of deregulation and to carry out a reorganization  of the cabinet to transform it into an economic reform  government. Thus, are you considering reshuffling the cabinet  around May?    [Hosokawa] I am not thinking about doing that so far.  However, because, as I said earlier, the government has to deal  with issues with a particular emphasis on economic problems, I  would like to tackle those issues by taking the initiative.    [Reporter] You mentioned that your relations with Chief  Cabinet Secretary Takemura are not smooth. He is not attending  this news conference. Do you think that you will be able to  improve relations concerning the operations of the cabinet over  the next several months?    [Hosokawa] He was originally scheduled to attend this news  conference, but I told him that it was better for him not to  attend because he was the person to be discussed. I would not  mind his attending, but because I thought that he would feel  uneasy, I recommended to him that he not attend. He has been  supporting me completely, and I have discussed things  straightforwardly with him. Because he told me that he would, I  believe that Mr. Takemura will continue to support me.    [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you said just a while ago  that  yesterday was when you first made an official proposal  concerning a cabinet reshuffle, but half a month ago you did not  deny a possible cabinet reshuffle in response to reporters'  questions. As a matter of fact, I think that your intention to  carry out a cabinet reshuffle invited a political vacuum for  more than half a month. The media has reported such a political  vacuum, and it can be said that the prime minister's office has  not been functioning. What do you think of this?    [Hosokawa] What I said a half month ago means that the first  task of the political reform-oriented government has been  carried out and that the situation now permits me a free hand.  I do not think that the prime minister's office has not been  functioning. Because the cabinet is composed of the coalition  partners, which are precariously balanced, I think it is  inevitable that I will undergo a twist-and-turns process in  making decisions on political issues -- such as the welfare tax  issue.    [Reporter] We have heard that Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] Secretary General Ozawa has persistently called for Chief  Cabinet Secretary Takemura to be replaced. Did he consent to  your decision when you met with him today, and what did you  discuss with him?    [Hosokawa] I think that Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa --  I want to refrain from mentioning specific parties -- must have  thought that, like the opinions mentioned earlier, it is time  for a cabinet reshuffle because one goal called political reform  has been achieved, and that it is necessary to consider the fact  that relations between the chief cabinet secretary, who is a key  person in the cabinet, and the ruling parties are rocky.    [Reporter] In view of a series of confusing incidents such  as  the welfare tax issue and the cabinet reshuffle, there is the  opinion that it is impossible for the coalition to run the  government, even though the government -- which originally set  political reform as its major goal -- plans to shift its  emphasis to economic matters following the attainment of  political reform. What is your opinion?    [Hosokawa] I know that there are various opinions. At the  meeting of top leaders of the ruling parties held just a while  ago, we confirmed the intention to maintain the unity of the  coalition government.    [Reporter] What is the reason for maintaining the unity?    [Hosokawa] The reason is that it is impossible to carry out  the reforms proposed by the government unless the unity of the  ruling parties is secured. We all keep this in mind -- although  there sometimes is an unpleasant atmosphere within the ruling  partners, and things can be awkward in running the government --  and we reconfirmed this at the meeting.    [Reporter] In addition to the fate of the chief cabinet  secretary, the focus of attention has been on whether Political  Reform Minister Yamahana will be appointed a minister  plenipotentiary. Are you thinking of giving him a new special  post?    [Hosokawa] At present, I am not planning to do so, but that  may be possible. I would like to study this later.    [Reporter] I believe that you planned a cabinet reshuffle to  deal with many issues. It is possible that because you  abandoned the plan for a reshuffle, your leadership will greatly  weaken. As a result, the government may lose its centripetal  force, and this would have negative effects on the Hosokawa  government, which has to tackle many problems. What do you  think about this?    [Hosokawa] As you know, it is the prime minister's arbitrary  right to reshuffle a cabinet. It is wrong to say that I failed  to carry out the plan. Because I think that the unity of the  ruling coalition is important, I have decided to postpone a  reshuffle. Some may not agree with me, but I do not think I have  failed.    [Dean of the press corps] We are running out of time. We  would like to conclude the news conference with one more  question. Are you confident that you can continuously get along  well with the chief cabinet secretary, who is opposed to your  exercising your right?    [Hosokawa] Even under former governments led by the Liberal  Democratic Party, cabinet reorganizations were decided after  hearing opinions from each faction, not to mention the fact that  it is more difficult for the coalition government to carry out a  cabinet reshuffle because it is composed of several parties.  Although it is the prime minister's arbitrary right, I have to  make a final decision on a cabinet reshuffle based on the  opinions of each party and on the political situation. I think  that this is the right way for the ruling coalition to do this.    [Dean of the press corps] Thank you very much.</p>

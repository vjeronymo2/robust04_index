			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / DTI report proves painful reading for Bank THE BLUE ARROW affair had a happy ending for National Westminster Bank yesterday with the publication of a 356-page Department of Trade and Industry report clearing the bank of allegations that it had behaved dishonestly. However, the final chapter in the affair, which has involved two criminal trials and two DTI reports, is less pleasant for the Bank of England. The report clears the Bank of allegations that it colluded with NatWest to prevent the first DTI investigation in 1989. The three inspectors, Mr Michael Crystal, Mr David Spence and Mr Victor Temple, are also careful not to make any direct criticism of the Bank. But their report gives a rare glimpse of the workings of the Bank's supervisory department, which is responsible for ensuring that banks are sound and honest. The picture will not be wholly welcome to the Bank, since it shows the supervisors as not very aggressive in investigating alleged wrongdoing at a leading bank, reinforcing the widespread criticisms of the Bank's supervision of the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International. In addition, quotations from Bank officials give weight to a second widely held concern about its role as a supervisor - that officials are somewhat removed from the real world. The inspectors asked Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, about his feelings in February 1988 on learning that the DTI was considering an investigation into NatWest's role in the Pounds 837m Blue Arrow rights issue, which had taken place the previous autumn. Mr Leigh-Pemberton said: 'I rather hoped we might avoid it, with all due respect to you, because I was very concerned about this in that here we had the National Westminster Bank, at the pinnacle of the financial establishment, possibly in difficulties, and I would have liked the matter to have been cleared up as quickly as possible. I knew from past experience that some of these inspections can take a long time.' An unusual insight into banking supervisory policy is also given by Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank director in charge of supervision. He said: 'We have - and I think I must say this - a preference for avoiding official investigations into banks. Banks are essentially about confidence, and the mere knowledge that there might be an investigation conducted on an official basis into a bank can have an effect on confidence that we think is damaging.' As a result, the Bank encouraged NatWest to carry out an internal investigation into its role in the Blue Arrow issue. The DTI delayed launching its own inquiry until the conclusion of this internal probe, carried out by Sir Philip Wilkinson, NatWest's deputy chairman. The most interesting part of the report relates to the Bank's involvement in events leading to the resignations from the NatWest board of three senior directors - Mr Charles Green, Mr Terry Green and Mr John Plastow - together with the resignation of Sir Philip from the Bank's Board of Banking Supervision, which oversees Mr Quinn's supervision department. Sir Philip's internal report was viewed in both the 1989 DTI report and the latest one as far too kind to NatWest. He is criticised for failing to take sufficient legal advice on NatWest's actions and for failing to pass on to the DTI the serious concerns of NatWest's inspectors, who had carried out much of the internal investigation on his behalf. The Bank was disappointed with Sir Philip and considered declaring that he was 'not fit and proper for his position as director and chairman of NWIB (the holding company of NatWest's investment banking activities)'. That quotation is from a draft letter of July 1989 which was to give notice to NWIB that its activities were to be restricted under Section 12 of the 1987 Banking Act. But it was never sent. The inspectors' report shows how Lord Boardman, then NatWest's chairman, conducted a successful rearguard action to prevent the Bank forcing Sir Philip's resignation from NatWest. The report says the Bank had the legal right to demand Sir Philip's resignation from his NatWest posts. Although Mr Charles Green, Mr Terry Green and Mr Plastow did resign their posts in July 1989 after criticism of them in the original DTI inspectors' report, Lord Boardman succeeded in getting the Bank's assurance that it would not force them to resign - their departure was a matter for NatWest's board. There is a fascinating passage in the latest report showing the immense political pressure upon the governor. In a note written in July 1989, he writes of the 'chancellor's desire for blood (at NatWest)'. Mr Leigh-Pemberton explained this note to the inspectors: 'I took the view that (the chancellor, Mr Nigel Lawson) expected us to require the resignation of senior people or persons, both from the board of (NatWest) or (County, its investment bank) and also from the Board of Banking Supervision. 'At some stage he had said to me he thought it unsuitable in the circumstances for Sir Philip Wilkinson to go on as a member of the Board of Banking Supervision.'</p>

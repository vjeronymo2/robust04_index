			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Work Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (d)(6) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be so organized and spaced that the actions of one employee will not create a hazard for any other employee. This paragraph also requires that each employee work in a position or location that is within visual or audible contact with another employee. These provisions were adopted from the proposed standard. The pulpwood logging and 1978 ANSI logging standards also recommended a two tree-length distance between work areas. Requirements similar to the final rule exist in various State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38J, 38K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be assigned so that trees cannot fall into adjacent occupied work areas. This provision also requires that the distance between adjacent occupied work areas be at least two tree lengths of the trees being felled. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard contained similar requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received comments supporting this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;41, 5&hyph;67, 5&hyph;70; Tr. W2 163). These commenters said that two tree lengths is already used in the industry to ensure safe spacing of work areas. Some commenters, however, said that the provision should be limited (Ex. 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). One commenter said OSHA should require minimum spacing requirements only when physical control of the timber was unpredictable, such as felling and skidding (Ex. 5&hyph;28). Other commenters recommended that the requirement be limited to slopes that are greater than 25 or 35 percent (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of these requirements is to protect employees in adjacent occupied work areas from being hit by misdirected trees. One of the major causes of injury in the logging industry is being hit by a tree. According to the WIR survey, almost one-quarter of all those injured were hit by a tree (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The State of Washington study showed that more than 65 percent of all employees were killed when they were hit by a tree or log (Ex. 4&hyph;129). In addition, the study showed that almost nine percent of that reported fatalities resulted from an employee being hit by a tree being felled by another employee (Ex. 4&hyph;129).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees can be hit by a tree that falls in the wrong direction or by one that rolls or slides down sloping terrain. There is no dispute that there is increased difficulty in directional felling on unlevel terrain. OSHA believes that these work spacing requirements in the final rule will help to prevent these types of accidents. Moreover, adopting any of the limitations that the commenters proposed would still leave employees exposed to other foreseeable hazards. Since the two tree-length distance has become accepted practice in the industry, it appears that industry itself recognizes the need for a minimum work spacing requirement and that the provision should not prove overly burdensome for any establishments in the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule OSHA is also requiring that employers assess conditions to determine whether additional spacing between adjacent occupied work areas is necessary. Some of the conditions that employers must examine include the degree of slope, the density of the growth, the height of trees, the soil structure, and other hazards reasonably anticipated at that work site. This paragraph also requires that additional distance be maintained between adjacent occupied work areas on any slope where rolling or sliding of logs is reasonably foreseeable. These provisions were also contained in the proposed rule and in various State logging standards (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters said greater distance should only be required when the slope is greater than 25 or 35 percent (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63). These commenters, however, did not provide any information on why such a limitation would provide adequate protection for employees. OSHA does not agree that greater distance may only be necessary on such steep slopes. OSHA believes there is a potential for trees and logs to roll and slide on lesser slopes when conditions such as snow and ice accumulation or wet soil are present. Therefore, OSHA does not believe that adequate protection would be provided if the commenters' recommendation were adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

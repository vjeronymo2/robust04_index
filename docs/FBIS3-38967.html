Belgium has  considerable numbers of blue helmets in Bosnia and Baranja,  which is why he remains very aware of what may follow, he  explained in substance to a journalist from the BELGA agency who  contacted him on Monday [7 February] during the minister's  working visit, accompanied by a parliamentary delegation, to  Belgian soldiers in Germany. The minister also believes it is  impossible to continue as we are: Something must change,  perhaps a more energetic intervention in order to once again  give the mission a perspective.    "I hope that the European Union and NATO will arrive at a  common point of view with respect to the three parties to the  conflict, possibly concerning a large area around Sarajevo or  perhaps more energetic intervention."    Mr. Delcroix believes that something must be done but doubts  whether air strikes will provide a solution, even if he does  understand the statements made on this subject by his colleague,  Willy Claes. Mr. Delcroix is considering certain questions. Is  it not possible that such bombings could lead to renewed  nationalism, also in other countries? Would air strikes in an  area around Sarajevo actually provide protection? Would it  subsequently be possible to provide humanitarian aid?    Mr. Delcroix expressed the hope that the European Union and  NATO will adopt a common position. In the meantime,  consultations are continuing to see what measures should be  taken. The defense minister did not, however, want to say what  this might mean in practice. Does it mean a strengthening of  the arms available to the blue helmets? "Allow me not to be too  expansive concerning concrete possibilities," he replied.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 24 TASS -- Russia's diesel-powered  submarines sold to North Korea for scrap metal cannot be  restored and used in combat, Vice-Admiral Viktor Topilin told  ITAR-TASS.    He rejected as groundless allegations that it is possible to  dismantle the submarine missile launchers and assemble them  again for use in land complexes.    The vice-admiral said the ballyhoo in Japan around the sale  of 12 disarmed Russian submarines to North Korea aims at  spreading disinformation. Many experts in the Russian Defence  Ministry confirm to ITAR-TASS that they shared the  vice-admiral's view. According to them, Japanese media reports  were published in order to alleviate the shock caused by the  fact that 70 kilogrammes of powdered plutonium were found in  Japan's atomic industry centre, an amount sufficient to  manufacture nine atomic bombs.</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE PASSES BILL TO CREATE AIRLINE CONSUMERS OFFICE  </P> <P> The Senate, most of whose members are airborne commuters, passed with relish  Monday a bill aimed at improving airlines' service in California by subjecting  the companies to public and state government pressure.  </P> <P> "They obviously don't give a damn about us up here," Republican Sen. Ed Davis  said of passenger airlines.  </P> <P> The Valencia lawmaker, usually an unflinching opponent of government  intervention into the affairs of private industry, added his voice to others  who have complained of higher air fares, shrinking schedules, long delays and  abrupt cancellations.  </P> <P> Davis charged that since federal deregulation of the airlines in 1978, service  has steadily deteriorated to the point "where we can appropriately harass"  airlines serving California.  </P> <P> The bill, sent to the Assembly on a 27-9 vote, would create a new airline  consumer office at the state Public Utilities Commission. The office would have  the power to investigate consumer complaints, scrutinize ticket price increases  that appear to be excessive and publicize air fares. But the office would have  no enforcement powers.  </P> <P> Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), the bill's author, conceded  that federal laws prohibit the state from taking tougher action such as  regulatory steps he proposed a month ago. But he said that making the  commission a public forum to vent complaints would put pressure on airlines to  improve.  </P> <P> In a preliminary report last month, the commission said that since deregulation  12 years ago, air fares have soared in California 40% above the rate of  inflation and demands for air service have doubled while the number of airlines  has fallen.  </P> <P> The undetermined cost of the new state office would be paid by a special tax on  intrastate airlines whose gross income exceeds $25 million a year. Roberti said  he believes the proposed tax could be levied by the state without violating  federal law.  </P> <P> The bill was opposed by the Air Transportation Assn., a major industry trade  organization, and by USAir. They contend that federal law preempts the state  legislation and that consumers are already protected by the airlines and state  and federal government agencies.  </P> <P> Roberti and Davis are among an estimated two dozen senators who regularly  commute between their districts in Southern California and Sacramento at least  once a week and sometimes more frequently. Currently, no state agency monitors  airline fares or performance.  </P> <P> Figures provided by the Air Transportation Assn. show that in 1980 it cost an  average of $55 to fly from Los Angeles to Sacramento, a sum that rose to an  average $97 in 1988, the last year for which its figures were available. The  organization said that during the same period the average one-way cost from Los  Angeles to Fresno increased from $35 to $91.  </P></p>

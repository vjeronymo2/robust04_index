			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Major blows hot and cold on growth pla - FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels On second thoughts, it's not so bad, PM decides It was a different audience. So Mr John Major adopted a different tone. After three days of pouring public scorn on Mr Jacques Delors' prescription for faster economic growth and lower unemployment, the prime minister remembered that Britain is supposed these days to be at the heart of Europe. Mr Major did not retreat from his central objection to Mr Delors' plan to raise an extra Ecu40bn (Pounds 30.5bn) over the next five years to finance new trans-European communications networks. There were economic and political objections. The so-called Union Bonds would transfer important new spending power to the European Commission. Britain would object to that at the best of times, but it was particularly illogical - in fact 'absurd' - at a time when all EU governments were engaged in a struggle to reduce national fiscal deficits. Mr Major repeated his government's irritation at the decision of the Belgian presidency and the Commission to exclude finance ministers from the substantive deliberations on the Growth, Competitiveness and Employment White Paper. He also tilted at the occasional windmill, condemning the 'defeatist fallacy' - that there was a fixed amount of work - said to be behind proposals for an expansion of work-sharing. It appeared not to matter that no-one, least of all Mr Delors, had ever suggested anything of the sort. But Mr Major's contribution to yesterday's debate on the report's conclusions had, on the advice of his officials, been stripped of the bad-tempered hyperbole of previous ministerial pronouncements. Facing an audience of fellow European leaders rather than one of awkward Conservative party Eurosceptics, he declared the cup that had been judged at the beginning of the week to be more than half-empty to be all of a sudden more than half-full. The volte-face of course could have had nothing to do with the fact that every other government around the Brussels table - including the Germans and the Dutch - had decided to give most of Mr Delors' proposals a fair wind. Reflecting the general view in the Treasury that the final version of the White Paper had taken on board many of the liberal ideas promoted by Britain, Mr Major praised the emphasis on competitiveness, labour market flexibility, and supply-side economic reforms. A paper which only hours before had been publicly ridiculed was discovered, in Mr Major's words, to 'have some very good elements in it'. It recognised that there were no 'miracle cures' for unemployment, it rejected protectionism, accepted the need to remove obstacles to employment, and reaffirmed the limits on the Community's own resources spending. It was only then that the prime minister came on to the problems. There was no need, he insisted, for the issue of Union Bonds when the European Investment Bank had used only half of the increased resources granted to it at last year's Edinburgh summit. Trans-European networks should also be private-sector-driven rather than mapped out by officials in Brussels. He told fellow heads of state: 'The key action is to use the large resources already agreed; not to invent new instruments.' By the time the summit closes, tomorrow Mr Major fully expects to be able to claim a victory on the issue. Even if Chancellor Helmut Kohl was loath to attack Mr Delors in public, his government has deep-rooted objections to such off-balance-sheet borrowing. The idea will be remitted to finance ministers for further study. But the victory will not be without its price. British diplomacy in Europe this week has lurched from a full-frontal attack to a begrudging partial retreat. Neither would have been necessary if Mr Major had adopted the constructive if sceptical approach of his partners.</p>

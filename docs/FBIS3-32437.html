			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The new ministers of President Guillermo Endara  Galimany's cabinet took office today. The ceremony took place in  the Yellow Hall of the Presidential Palace in the presence of  President of the Republic Guillermo Endara Galimany and Vice  President Guillermo Ford.    The main changes in President Endara's work team affected  the  Government and Justice Ministry, the Finance and Treasury  Ministry, the Labor Ministry, the Health Ministry, and the  Housing Ministry. This restructuring takes place after the  members of the Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican  Movement] party decided not to support the Arnulfist Party's  presidential candidate, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber.    [Begin recording] [Education Minister Marcos Alarcon,  identified by caption] You cannot govern with your enemies. I  think the president's decision was correct. He has surrounded  himself with those whom he believes due to the commitment they  have to the history and memory of Dr. [Arnulfo] Arias. They are  willing to give the best of themselves so that President  Endara's administration can end with great achievements.    [Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas,  identified by caption] Believe me when I tell you that the  president's request that I remain in my office as planning  minister has definitely flattered me. And that request was made  because at the Ministry we are dealing with affairs of the  utmost importance for our country. [end recording]    Three members of Molirena and two Arnulfists were replaced  in  President Endara's government team.    Jacobo Salas was appointed to the Government and Justice  Ministry; Jose Raul Mulino was appointed to the Foreign  Ministry; Marcos Alarcon to the Education Ministry; Jose Antonio  Dominguez to the Public Works Ministry; Victor Juliao to the  Finance and Treasury Ministry; Gregorio Ordonez to the Labor  Ministry; Jose Remon to the Health Ministry; Ricardo Fabrega to  the Commerce and Industry Ministry; Rodrigo Sanchez to the  Housing Ministry; Delia Cardenas to the Planning and Economic  Policy Ministry; Cesar Pereira Burgos to the Agricultural  Development Ministry; and Ivonne Young to the Presidency  Ministry.</p>

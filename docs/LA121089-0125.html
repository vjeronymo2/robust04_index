			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRESNO COUNTY;  </P> <P> DEPUTIES CHARGE JOB DISCRIMINATION  </P> <P> Two Fresno County sheriff's deputies and a former deputy are suing the  department and the county, charging they were discriminated against when they  were passed over for promotion. Deputies Linda Lee, Joe Rascon and former  deputy Pete Chavez charged that they were passed over for promotion to sergeant  because Lee is a woman and Rascon and Chavez are Latinos. Their suit seeks  recovery of lost wages and damages. The suit follows a determination last  summer by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the three were  discriminated against by the county and the Sheriff's Department in violation  of the federal Civil Rights Act. Lee, Rascon and Chavez were passed over for  promotion in favor of Anglo males or others who ranked lower.  </P></p>

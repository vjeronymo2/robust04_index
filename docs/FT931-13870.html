			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: No one answers for anything The first report of the new House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee is like a curate's egg: good in parts. It contains more quotable sharp remarks but is less consistent than the reports of its predecessor under Sir Terence Higgins. Nevertheless, the section on the departure from the ERM on Black Wednesday, September 16, is singularly unrevealing, as members were too credulous of official excuses, especially from the Bank of England. What needed to be explained was not the desperation-born increases in base rates to 15 per cent on September 16 itself, but the losses incurred in continuing to support sterling when, as the official witnesses themselves confirmed, they realised they were in the monetary equivalent of the Charge of the Light Brigade. The only excuse heard by protesting members of the inner cabinet is that suspending membership before the close of European markets might have been a breach of legal obligations - hardly an excuse that would have been used if officials' own personal funds had been at stake. The committee's recommendation that the losses from intervention (believed to be Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn) should be published is only the beginning of the required investigation; but even that is officially rejected. 'One of the world's least successful missions' Meanwhile, I can add a little nugget. On Monday, September 14, a high-level economic mission led by Alan Budd and Mervyn King, the chief economic advisers to the Treasury and Bank respectively, visited first Frankfurt and then Bonn to try to persuade their German opposite numbers that sterling, at its DM2.95 entry rate into the ERM, was 'not obviously overvalued'. The mission had arisen out of a conversation between Sir Nigel Wicks, UK second Treasury permanent secretary, and Horst Kohler, state secretary of the German finance ministry, and had been arranged the previous week - between the disastrous meeting of Community finance ministers at Bath and the weekend of the lira devaluation. One wag close to events decribed it as 'one of the world's least successful missions'. For it failed to shake the Bundesbank's belief that sterling was overvalued. Its members saw the high-powered Bundesbank economic adviser and board member, Otmar Issing, who listened carefully but did not regard the time appropriate for an academic discussion in view of the currency turmoil, and emphasised that the Bonn government was responsible for parity negotiations. The object of the Budd-King mission was: To explain the case for the DM2.95 sterling rate. To argue that sterling and the French franc were in the right relationship. In other words, to persuade the Germans not to drive a wedge between Britain and France in the degree to which their currencies were worth supporting. They also tried to persuade the Bundesbank to see the current balance of payments as a purely private sector problem which would take care of itself. The British team found that their German opposite numbers were not aware of some big UK economic changes, such as the slowdown in wages and the productivity take-off. The UK side was plainly right on unit labour costs. These were increasing in the second half of 1992 by 2 per cent per annum, much less than in Germany - although in France they were actually falling. On the payments deficit, the UK mission was out of date because of the arrival of the 'twin deficits' problem - payments and budget deficits. The British visitors were under strict instructions not to discuss exchange rate changes or realignments but to stick to long-term analysis. The emphasis was on 'graphs and charts' and exchanges between 'card-carrying economists'. This was surely something of a waste of officials of near permanent secretary level in a growing emergency. The idea of a combined high-level probe of fundamentals was a good one; but it was several months too late. During the discussions, the Germans behaved as if the British knew of the realignment offer - which makes all the more surprising the British official astonishment at Helmut Schlesinger's Handelsblatt interview and the selling pressure against sterling. The British government, in its innermost thinking, was prepared to support an upward realignment confined to the D-Mark and its satellite currencies. Crucial to such a realignment would have been French willingness to see the franc fall against the D-Mark. Some British policymakers thought this would happen if only the system could have pulled through until after the French referendum on September 20. In retrospect, close observers believe that the fatal mistake made at the Bath European finance ministers' meeting on September 6 was to leave each country to go its own way. The only chance of saving the ERM grid was to have concerted statements by all the major actors and concerted interest changes, including if necessary double or treble-digit day-to-day interest rates in the period up to the French Maastricht referendum. Where the franc is now The British government view that the franc should follow sterling rather than the D-Mark was always wishful thinking. Despite the unpopularity of Mitterrand and slowly rising unemployment, the currency fundamentals are more favourable to the franc than they ever were to sterling. France has lower inflation, a better budgetary and balance of payments position, and a less bad recession than Germany, let alone the UK. The French government has already withstood two speculative attacks on the franc in September and in January. A much larger attack is expected in the run-up to the March parliamentary elections; and the Bundesbank is fully on board for a combined defence. Any commentator who ever drops his guard and believes official statements on exchange rates is liable to end up with egg on his face, as I know to my cost. The difference between the franc now and sterling last September is that, if the French currency is forced into a temporary float, it may before long rise against the D-Mark. Indeed Bundesbank members have said it is a revaluation candidate. It is this knowledge, more than any government statements or currency intervention, that is supporting the franc and making speculators pause for thought. Glasnost, no perestroika The most quoted single phrase in the Commons committee's report was 'glasnost without the perestroika' to describe the the new economic information offered by the Treasury. This is not strictly accurate. For glasnost means openness. Yet despite the new publications, the present UK system of government is anything but open. As Norman Lamont told the committee: 'You will not know what advice is tendered by officials or anyone else.' Whether he knew it or not, he was simply repeating the orthodoxy of generations of permanent secretaries, who regard the confidentiality of advice to ministers as the Ark of the Covenant. I came across this orthodoxy when I was foolhardly enough to send the proofs of my book on the Treasury to the then permanent secretary. The upshot was a lunch with the then chancellor, Reginald Maudling (courtesy of The Observer) in which he jovially read me the riot act. That he had been put up to it became clear some years later when he reviewed the second edition very favourably and remarked that the text was accurate wherever he was in a position to know. The self-serving Whitehall view is that officials will not give honest advice unless it is secret. It is just as likely that the advice will be better if those giving it know it will be subject to public scrutiny. In a responsible system, the Bank would have one set of duties and the Treasury another set; and officials in both would account for their work. We would know if the chancellor received bad advice or refused to take good advice. By contrast, today everyone is responsible for everything and no one is responsible for anything. Hence Black Wednesday and numerous other disasters.</p>

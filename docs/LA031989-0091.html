			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Two teams of Soviet officials concluded their short-notice or "quota"  inspections of two U.S. missile facilities, bringing the number of such Soviet  tours of facilities cited in the INF Treaty to nine. On-Site Inspection Agency  Cmdr. Kendell Pease said one team toured the Martin Marietta facility in Middle  River, Md., and a second was dispatched to Ft. Sill at Lawton, Okla. Both teams  were accompanied by U.S. escorts. The inspection program was one of the terms  of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed in December, 1987, by  the Soviet Union and the United States. In the first three years of the treaty,  inspectors are allowed 20 quota visits a year.  </P></p>

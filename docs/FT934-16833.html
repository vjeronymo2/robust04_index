			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Miners turn meaning of Solidarity on its head: Poland's last government has passed on a nightmare THE MEN sprawled across the entrance hall of Poland's coal mining industry headquarters in Katowice know they have their backs to the wall. But these striking coal-miners from Zory, a town of 60,000 inhabitants south of Katowice in southern Poland, look set to present the future Polish government with its first headache - an unresolved dispute inherited from the outgoing government of Ms Hanna Suchocka. They are demanding that promises of new jobs in mines elsewhere, which were made last winter in the wake of a three-week stoppage, be honoured. Alternatively they want the planned closure of their loss-making coking coal pit by 1995 slowed or substantial redundancy benefits paid for two years. The coalition government, defeated in elections on September 19, failed to satisfy their demands. These were triggered again when the first 250 redundancies were announced last week. Now their protest threatens to spread as miners take over other management buildings in an attempt to paralyse the industry. The dispute is the first big test for the next - left-of-centre - government coalition, now in its birth throes as the Polish Peasant party (PSL) and the former communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) search for a consensus on policy and cabinet posts. The Zory dismissals are the first of a series planned to bring the number of miners down to 200,000 toward the end of the century from its present 320,000, matching falling output from 178m tonnes in 1989 to an expected 124m tonnes this year. The proposed cuts challenge a favoured workforce that has traditionally been at the top of wage scales and, in the late 1970s and 1980s, had guaranteed access to western consumer goods as a reward for working a six-day week. The strike could prove a stiff test for the SLD which has a massive faultline running down its 171-strong caucus in the 460-seat parliament. As many as 61 of those SLD deputies owe allegiance to the OPZZ, a trade union federation established in the 1980s under the auspices of the then ruling Communists, and which has won a measure of credibility, in opposition, in the past four years. This was when its rival, the Solidarity union, sought at massive political cost to itself to defuse shop-floor protests as it protected the reforming government's tight money policies. Now the roles are reversed as the SLD leadership adopts the reformist language of the new era, partly through conviction and partly because it knows it has to retain credibility with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Pay protests last spring led to the fall of the outgoing government and there is a queue of groups ready to renew their assault on a threadbare budget. The miners playing table tennis in the corridors and cards in the headquarter's conference rooms are non-committal about any new government. 'We are trade unionists and so we don't get involved in politics,' says Mr Ryszard Jaston, Zory's Solidarity leader whose rag-tag army is well versed in the art of protest. The strikes in 1980 to win trade union rights, then against martial law in the bitterly cold winter of 1981 and again in 1988 for Solidarity, are emblazoned on the Zory pit's battle standards. The strike by the 2,500 miners still employed at the pit and the occupation of the industry headquarters is being led by Solidarity. But it is also backed by the Contra union linked to the populist Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN) party. The KPN scraped into parliament on September 19 with 5.8 per cent of the national vote and 22 seats. But the party is strong among miners and won 18 per cent of the vote in the town of Zory itself against Solidarity's 3.4 per cent. The SLD also performed strongly, winning a 19 per cent share of the vote in Zory. Nevertheless the local branch of the OPZZ has failed to back the protest, even though Ms Ewa Spychalska, the tough and canny national head of the 4.5m-strong movement and an SLD deputy, has said 'we back the miners' and many of her members are occupying the headquarters. The dispute should help Solidarity, which just failed to win the 5 per cent of the national vote needed to get into parliament, repair its frayed credibility. Its national leader, Mr Marian Krzaklewski, has already said his movement will be 'more radical' than before in pursuing its demands. Indeed he talks of 'using all legal means to speed new elections'. Whatever government is installed in the next few weeks in Poland, its freedom of manoeuvre will be limited. One question is whether the miners' mood, once the hopes the elections have engendered are dashed, will turn to one of anger or apathy.</p>

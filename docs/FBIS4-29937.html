			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on ``exclusive interview'' with the King of </F> Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk, by Nate Thayer in Beijing; date not  given: "Last Act"]    [Text] From his self-exile in Beijing, King Norodom  Sihanouk is watching in exasperation as a polarised Cambodia  Government fumbles with a worsening civil war. And he is  planting the seeds to retake the reins of power. In an exclusive  interview with the REVIEW, the king unveiled a detailed plan for  a national unity government firmly under his control. He said he  would give high positions to the Khmer Rouge so the faction  would halt its guerilla war.    But Sihanouk stressed that he would only assume power with  the approval of parliament and the two leaders of the coalition  government, especially Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose  Cambodian People's Party (CPP) controls the bulk of the army,  security forces and apparatus of state.    Since it came to power through United Nations-sponsored  elections in May 1993, "the current government has shown that it  is not capable of stopping the process of deterioration of the  situation," Sihanouk said during the three-hour interview on  June 11 at his residence in Beijing, where he is being treated  for cancer. "How can I avoid intervening in a few months' time  or one year's time if the situation continues to deteriorate?"    Sihanouk, 72, was elected king and head of state last year  by  parliament, but the role carries little real authority. "If I am  not too weak physically, I will certainly say yes" to a request  from parliament to assume real power, he said.    "I have no plan to take power now," as the situation "is not  desperate enough," Sihanouk said. "In case the situation becomes  anarchic and desperate, I would have to take power for one or  two years. I did it in 1952 and 1953 to put an end to the  anarchy of the kingdom . . . so why not now before I die, the  last mission?"    Sihanouk's statements may tap a well-spring of popular  discontent shared by a number of influential figures within  Cambodia's government, military and parliament who are  frustrated by their leaders' inability to achieve peace and  stability following last year's elections. These figures,  according to political sources, have been quietly campaigning  for Sihanouk to assume more power to break the deadlock in peace  talks with the Khmer Rouge. Both Hun Sen and First Prime  Minister Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the royalist Funcinpec  party, refuse any political deal that would give the radical  faction a role in government.    The king recognised that neither Ranariddh nor Hun Sen would  be eager to be replaced as premier. "I know that Mr. Hur Sen  will be red in the face...when he will read your article,"  Sihanouk said. "He wil] say that 'we were absolutely wrong to  elect Sihanouk as king, it is extremely bad, extremely  dangerous, and now he wants to retake power and to take the  Khmer Rouge again in his government. It will be a catastrophe.'  Mr. Hun Sen will attack me very, very violently. I know that."    Sihanouk acknowledged that his bid for power would be doomed  without the acquiescence of Hun Sen and the CPP. "If he does not  support me, it is useless for me to go back to Cambodia, because  I do not want to shed blood to fight a secession led by Hun  Sen," he said. "I cannot return to power to go back to Cambodia  unless I have the assurance that Hun Sen and his party will join  me in my government."    "As far as Ranariddh is concerned, I am sure that my son  will  not betray me," the king continued. "He will accept certainly.  Not with joy. With sadness, certainly. With anger, certainly.  But he will, I am sure, not rebel."    Ranariddh has argued for more time in power, saying results  will be visible next year, Sihanouk said. "But there is another  opinion among the people and the politicians. The other opinion  is that if they allow this government to go on for one year,  Cambodia will completely collapse -- not just the government but  the country itself."    Sihanouk said his plan for a new government was "very  simple.  I will be the head of the government. Not just the head of  state, but the head of government. This means my own prime  minister." The regime would have four vice-presidents:  Ranariddh, Hun Sen, current Finance Minister Sam Rainsy and  Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan. "My government can only be one  of national unity with all parties," he said. "I will give  important portfolios to the Khmer Rouge."    Anticipating the objections of the two elected premiers, the  king qualified his remarks. "I stress to Ranariddh and Hun Sen,  I want them to know I have no plan to replace them. If one day  there is a necessity for Sihanouk to intervene, I wait for a  signal from the parliament, a request from the parliament, not  from demonstrations .... Even with a request from parliament, I  will not accept to take power unless Ranariddh and Hun Sen say,  'okay, we join you, we accept to be in your government of  national unity'."    Cambodia's constitution allows the parliament, by a  two-thirds vote, to give extraordinary powers to the king during  a time of crisis. This is what supporters of the burgeoning  movement to install Sihanouk in power are aiming for --  essentially a constitutional coup led by members of the two  major governing parties behind the backs of their own leaders.  In fact, Sihanouk noted in the interview that a number of senior  "politicians, figures in the military and in the administration"  had appealed to him to seize power in recent months.    Sihanouk said his programme would be much the same as that  of  the current government: "the rehabilitation and reconstruction  of the country." Parliament would also be maintained. "The only  difference is...no war with the Khmer Rouge and the Khmer Rouge  in my government. It is the only change! The only change! But it  is the very, very basis of my process of saving Cambodia."    Aides say that Sihanouk will try to come back to Cambodia in  July, depending on the outcome of medical tests to assess the  state of his cancer. He appears strong and lively to his many  visitors. "I still have cancer cells in my bone marrow, but I  feel quite normal," the king said.    Sihanouk said his wife and confidante, Queen Monique,  strongly opposed the idea of his resuming power. "So, you know I  will lose even my wife. But to lose my wife, to lose Mr. Hun Sen  is nothing compared to Cambodia. For me, Cambodia is my life. If  Cambodia sinks I have no reason to survive. I have no reason to  live. I prefer dying."</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (9): Catalyst for change - Privatisation and the new government In less than two years, privatisation, once anathema to Italian governments, has suddenly become a benchmark for judging Rome's commitment to modernising the Italian economy. The three-year programme launched by the Amato government in July 1992 seemed to move slowly or not at all at the start. But when Efim, the now defunct state holding company, completed the sale of its glass-making subsidiary SIV to the UK's Pilkington last June, it signalled an acceleration of the process. Since then, there have been at least seven substantial sales, raising more than L13,000bn, not to mention a number of smaller flotations and private sales, for example by Eni, the state energy and chemicals group. Earlier this week, the Treasury was completing the largest privatisation yet - the sale of 51 per cent of Ina, the insurance company. In theory, the market will soon have to digest the even larger privatisations of Stet, the telecommunications holding company, Enel, the electricity generator, and all or part of Eni. Everybody seems to agree that the process of Italian privatisation is now unstoppable. One of the first things Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new administration did in May, when confirmed in office, was to press ahead with the flotation timetable of Ina, as a signal of its willingness to carry out the programme outlined by Mr Giuliano Amato and pursued by his successor, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the new budget minister, said last month that the government's privatisation ambitions would extend to the contracting out of services. 'For this government, privatisation doesn't only mean selling state enterprises,' he told foreign journalists in Milan. 'The sales are only a small part of the privatisation programme.' Most of the reasons why the state sell-off is important to the Berlusconi administration are fairly orthodox. The proceeds of the sell-offs are channelled into reducing public indebtedness, helping to prevent a spiralling increase in the deficit and interest payments which could undermine all Mr Berlusconi's economic promises. Privatisation also helps public finances because it puts an end to most state subsidies. That, in turn, helps convince foreign governments and pan-European authorities that Italy is not going to slide back into its old trade-distorting habits. For example, in the case of Ilva, the loss-making state steel producer, the fact that the Ciampi government's plans involved a commitment to the division and sale of its main operations helped to persuade the European Commission to approve a final package of subsidies for the company. The final motive for continuing with privatisation is to encourage the Milan stock market. Apart from the interim Amato and Ciampi administrations, the Berlusconi government is the first in Italian postwar history that actively wants to stimulate the private sector through the stock market. Privatisation is one of the catalysts which the stock exchange and the government hope will encourage wider share ownership and the flotation of more private companies. As Mr Pietro Armani, a former deputy chairman of Iri, the main state holding company, said at a recent conference on privatisation: 'It is no longer possible today to think of a return to a mixed economy with direct state control of enterprises . . . That's not only because of the strictures of the EU, but also because the state can perfectly well control the economy indirectly, through 'golden shares'.' However, in practice, some of the government's ambitions have been thwarted by circumstances. It is proving difficult to sell certain parts of the state sector - notably the flat steel division of Ilva, and the GS/Autogrill supermarket and catering companies. In addition, the previous administration's privatisation of two banks, Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana, has sparked controversy about the control of such companies, casting a long shadow over future plans. Mr Romano Prodi, then chairman of Iri, has led protests that powerful corporate and financial allies - backed by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank - gained control over the boards of the two banks after privatisation, by pooling their shares to nominate directors. According to Mr Prodi and his supporters, this circumvented rules limiting individual shareholders to a 3 per cent stake in the company, and thus thwarted Iri's attempts to encourage wider share ownership. Neutral observers have pointed out that until Italy develops a pension fund and unit trust industry along Anglo-Saxon lines it will be difficult to guarantee small shareholders a voice in privatised boardrooms. In addition, Mr Prodi's opponents - such as Mr Paolo Savona, former industry minister - say the establishment of a nocciolo duro or hard core of shareholders helps privatised companies. But the new government has still felt moved to dispel the small shareholders' fears. In the case of Ina, a 5 per cent limit has been imposed on shareholdings, but the stakes of allies - for example, investors who are members of the shareholder syndicate of third companies - will be counted as belonging to a single investor. At the same time, a certain number of seats on the board will be reserved for small shareholders' nominees. Although it remains to be seen how these rules will work in practice, the government has indicated that they will apply to the much more sensitive sell-offs of Enel and Stet. These sales, and that of Eni, will be the real test for the new government's professed enthusiasm for privatisation, partly because they are larger than anything which has gone before. The Stet offer could set Mediobanca directly against supporters of wider share ownership, because the merchant bank wants to form a shareholder syndicate with Pirelli, the tyres and cables group, to take control of the telecoms company. Critics say links between Pirelli and one of its principal potential customers would hold back the development of Stet. There is also a running debate about how and when to privatise Enel and the oil and gas interests of Eni. In theory, Stet should be sold before the end of this year, and Enel shortly afterwards. But Eni is pushing hard for the government to consider selling its Agip and Snam oil and gas subsidiaries before Enel comes to the market. 'We've done everything to prepare for the government to take a final decision,' says Mr Franco Bernabe, Eni's chief executive. Critics of the government say it was not too difficult to take a quick decision about the sale of Ina, because it was uncontroversial and the ground had been well-prepared by treasury officials. It may prove more difficult to realise the high-sounding promises of Mr Berlusconi and his ministers to implement quickly the rest of the privatisation programme.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Recent and future privatisations  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company          % sold  Type of    Date      Amount      Industry                            sale               raised  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SIV                95    private  June 1993   L210bn      Glassmaking Fin Italgel        62    private  July 1993   L437bn      Foods Cirio Bertolli De Rica            62    private  Nov 1993    L311bn      Foods Nuovo Pignone      69    private  Dec 1993    L700bn      Engineering Credito Italiano   67    public   Dec 1993    L1,830bn    Banking                          offer IMI                33    public   Jan 1994    L2,200bn    Banking                          offer Esaote            100    private  Jan 1994    L60bn       Medical                                                           equipmt Banca Commerciale Italiana           54    public   Mar 1994    L2,891bn    Banking                          offer Ina                51    public   Jun 1994    c L5,000bn* Insurance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Still to come: GS/Autogrill (supermarkets/catering); Stet (telecoms); Enel (electricity generation); Eni/Agip (oil and gas) *Ina price not yet announced at time of going to print Source: FT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

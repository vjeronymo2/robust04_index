			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 18 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Nicaragua today denied  that it accepted terms "that harm national sovereignty" by  signing an agreement with the IMF. The government, in turn,  accused the Sandinists of having "mortgaged the country."    According to the government, the agreement with the IMF will  give the country access to some $600 million to be used in  structural adjustments and economic expansion over the next  three years.    Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said in a news conference  that "it can never harm national sovereignty to try to relieve  the burden of foreign debt," estimated by several sources at  more than $11 billion.    Lacayo, who is the son-in-law of President Chamorro and  heads  the economic and social cabinet, said the only government that  has harmed national sovereignty "is the one that mortgaged the  country," referring to the Sandinists, who governed the country  from 1979 to 1990. Lacayo added that Chamorro's ministers have  had to travel abroad to "rescue this sovereignty" by having the  United States write off Nicaragua's foreign debt. He  "categorically" rejected the Sandinists' accusations that the  contents of the agreement with the IMF "were harmful to the  country's sovereignty." Lacayo added: "We have also gone to  rescue the sovereignty that was pawned to Mexico, Colombia,  Argentina, Spain, the Nordic countries, and other Paris Club  member nations. Each child born in Nicaragua wears an  identification bracelet on one of his arms and a label saying  that he owes $3,000 in foreign debt on the other arm."    The head of the Presidency Ministry confirmed that the  agreement with the IMF was signed on Saturday and amounts to  $140 million to be disbursed over a three-year period. This  will allow the procurement of another $150 million, which the  World Bank will lend to Nicaragua, co-financed by the  Governments of Japan, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland and which  will be disbursed over the next 18 months. In addition, the  Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) will grant other credits  for health, education, and small enterprise, funds that would  not have reached the country if the agreement with the IMF were  not signed.    As for the other Sandinist charge that the agreement with  the  IMF violates the current Constitution, Lacayo said those who  believe this may file constitutional appeals before the Supreme  Court. The minister, who is sort of a coordinator for the  Chamorro government, added: "We are not going to judge that  because the government is not a judge in this matter."    Lacayo, as well as Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, Foreign  Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger, and Economy and Development  Minister Pablo Pereira, among others, said that the $660 million  that will reach the country this year will contribute to a  reduction of the high interest rates in the production sector.  They said that, although 13,500 bureaucrats will be dismissed  in the next three years, public investment and producer credit  will permit the creation of 84,675 new jobs in this country,  where the unemployment rate is estimated at 60 percent.    The ministers said that this year monthly devaluations will  be 1 percent, economic growth of 2 to 3 percent is expected, and  7,500 housing units will be built nationwide. They also pointed  out that signing the IMF agreement has led the Paris Club to  plan a trip to Nicaragua in the first week of June to  renegotiate the nation's foreign debt, the equivalent of more  than 36 years of exports.    Lacayo, on the other hand, warned that the government "is  prepared to respond to violent protests by those who reject the  agreement, noting "that this path is the wrong one."    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2310 GMT on 18 April in a  Managua-datelined report adds: "The Nicaraguan Government will  not pay the debt incurred by the Sandinist authorities to  finance the war of the last decade and holds them responsible  for the serious economic crisis that hinders the country,  Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo announced on Monday. He said  that `the government will not pay' the war debt, without  specifying the amount of the debt. He made the announcement  during a news conference offered by the economic cabinet to  explain the scope of an agreement signed with the IMF this  weekend."]</p>

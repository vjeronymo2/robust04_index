			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report under "Details" rubric by Natalya Barabash: "First </F> Victim of Maritime Kray Disaster Is Admiral Gurinov";  accompanied by Sergey Avdeyev report]    [Text] The catastrophic explosion at the Pacific Fleet  ammunition dumps (KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wrote about it yesterday)  took place exactly two years to the day after the famous  "fireworks" at the arsenal in Vladivostok. A coincidence?    Fire, as is known, is better than rain at removing all  traces. At any rate, the people of Novonezhino are sure: "Look,  it was the commander that did it.... He was selling guns, and  now everything has gone sky-high," an old lady, Praskovya  Ivanovna, lamented, as she was being evacuated with her meager  goods and chattels from her now roofless little home.    Thefts of weapons are the most widespread crime in the  military sphere. Dumps are poorly guarded, the buildings are  old and dilapidated, and instead of barbed wire often all you  find is a rickety fence. The results of the Vladivostok  disaster have never been published. There were rumors of a fire  to remove the evidence of thefts. There were some rather  garbled reports about seamen dropping smoldering cigarette butts  near projectiles.    The cigarette butts turned out to have a long fuse. What is  being peddled now, two years on, is theories about the  self-combustion of old projectiles, about a forest fire  encroaching from the taiga....    "There could not have been a forest fire. I flew over the  explosion area myself in a helicopter and the only black traces  of fire I could see were inside the dump. They did not cross  the strip of forest in front of it," Maritime Kray  Administration chief Ye. Nazdratenko said at a news conference.    But he refused to blame the fleet for what had happened,  putting it all down to the rampaging democrats who had broken up  the army.    But it is not the first time the Pacific Fleet has been the  main cause of disasters in the Maritime Kray. The mushroom  cloud over Chazhma Bay, the nuclear submarine that sank in  Bolshoy Kamen -- all that was in the eighties.    In 1991 Vladivostok came under fire during trials of the  guns  mounted on the warship Admiral Vinogradov. The shells overshot  the target and happened to expolode in the air above a  residential district. Later, two navy aircraft exploded in the  air as they were just reaching Vladivostok.    Maritime Kray is still literally crammed with military  equipment -- there are still around 15 similar ammunition dumps  there. One of them is in the very center of Vladivostok, on the  densely populated Egersheld peninsula. The fleet leadership  assures us that there is no possibility of its being removed.  Unless, of course, there is some assistance from cigarette  butts....    Meanwhile Maritime Kray is counting the cost. According to  the experts, there has been nothing in Russia before to compare  with the disaster in Novonezhino. The dump (four kilometers  long and 1.5 kilometers wide) is beyond recovery -- there is a  massive gaping creater where it used to be. The remaining  ammunition -- around 30 percent -- will be destroyed. Most of  the houses in Novonezhino are beyond repair. Thousands of  people were made homeless by the explosion and have now been  moved to other parts of Maritime Kray. Hectares of sown land  and neighboring villages have been showered with explosives.    So the kray leadership's optimistic statements about there  being "no casualties" could be premature, alas. Only a week ago  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wrote about a boy who was blown up by a  shell left over from the explosion of two years ago....  [Barabash ends]    Sergey Avdeyev commentary: "Concerning Which"    Yesterday fleet commander Adm. Georgiy Gurinov was added to  the list of victims. He was removed from his post by an edict  of the Russian president "because of continuing serious  incidents in the fleet entrusted to him and an overall decline  in combat readiness, and for personal negligence in his work."    The dismissal of the commander, who had been in this post  for  a little over a year, in itself seems somewhat strange. How  could the new admiral, appointed by an edict of the same  president only recently, in such a short time have ruined a  fleet which until recently was considered one of the best in the  country?    Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov has been appointed acting  commander. While in no way doubting his professional  capabilities and personal qualities, I will merely observe that  when commenting on the lessons of the 1992 Vladivostok arsenal  explosion Igor Nikolayevich gave the following firm assurance:  From now on all fleet arsenals will be safe.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US sets conditions for delaying sanctions against Japan THE US has agreed to delay sanctions against Japan in its dispute over government procurement of construction services, on condition that the Japanese agree to talk about opening the entire market to foreign contractors. Furthermore, the US wants Tokyo to agree to an extensive negotiating agenda designed to end the Japan's exclusive bidding system, increase its anti-trust enforcement and agree to a series of 'quantitative indicators' to measure progress. Several quantitative indicators have been suggested, such as: the number of foreign company contracts won in Japan compared with those in Europe; volume of exports; number of winning foreign bids; joint ventures in which foreign companies are the prime contractors; the number of foreign engineers assigned to joint venture projects. Under US law, sanctions are due to be announced next Wednesday. However, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has the flexibility to delay retaliation if the reprieve is seen to be in the national interest. A senior US Commerce Department official said sanctions at this time could severely damage the prospects for key talks to establish a bilateral trade negotiating framework and complete a tariff reduction package for the Uruguay Round. 'What we're asking for is within the power of the bureaucracy to agree,' he said. US negotiators were still waiting optimistically for their Japanese counterparts to respond to their proposal. The Clinton administration was not caught unprepared by last week's collapse of the Japanese government. It sees the possibility of long-term gains from the installation of a reform-minded regime. The next government is expected to be installed and operating by the end of July. Administration officials believe that, despite the 'dead body' in power, deals can be done with the powerful bureaucracy, but completion of pacts will be more difficult. Historically, it has been elected officials who usually pressure the bureaucracy to take the final steps needed for breakthroughs. If there is any consensus at all in Washington on trade, it is that Japan is the 'outlaw' in the world trading system. US officials say past bilateral negotiations produced few real market openings because Japan does not follow the operations of the free market in an orthodox way. 'Experience has shown that (the other trade agreements) didn't go far enough,' the senior official said. Intensive reviews of the pacts usually revealed that the Japanese met their commitments to take agreed steps, but what would work in a typical market system 'makes no difference' in trying to gain access to the Japanese market.</p>

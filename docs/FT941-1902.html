			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Acquisitions help lift Avonmore to IPounds 29.2m Avonmore Foods, the expanding Irish dairy and meat processor, lifted turnover last year by 35 per cent to more than Pounds 1bn, while pre-tax profits rose by 17 per cent from IPounds 25m to IPounds 29.2m. Turnover totalled IPounds 1.13bn (Pounds 1.09bn) against IPounds 831m. Mr Brendan Graham, group secretary, described passing the Pounds 1bn turnover mark 'as an important and significant milestone in the growth of Avonmore as an international food group.' More than 73 per cent of turnover was generated overseas, against 66 per cent in 1992. The company attributed the rise to organic growth and acquisitions, of which the most important was the purchase last July for Pounds 21.6m of the Birmingham area operations of Dairy Crest. This gave the group almost 8 per cent of the UK's liquid milk market. Total sales for the dairy group were up 35 per cent to IPounds 572m (IPounds 422m), helped by strong UK milk and US cheese sales. Operating profits on the dairy side increased from IPounds 18.5m to IPounds 24.2m, giving margins of 4.2 per cent. Operating margins in the meat division improved in the second half from 1.8 per cent to 2.8 per cent - still below the 1992 levels. Turnover for meat was 50 per cent ahead at IPounds 454m, reflecting the integration of the acquisitions. Earnings per share were 18.5 per cent ahead at 14.35p (12.11p). A final dividend of 2p is proposed (1.85p), bringing the total for the year to 3.55p (3.3p). Mr Graham said the group expected to make further advances this year as it continued to consolidate its acquisitions. COMMENT The tough conditions in its markets make this a satisfactory performance for Avonmore, which has grown rapidly through acquisition. It could be argued that although margins are tight, the company is still making returns and has plenty of room for improvement. The management runs a tight ship, but the company could be said to be driving towards the big league too hard and too fast. While the core dairy business looks good, the company has to negotiate the changes looming in the UK milk market. It is not so familiar with the meat sector, which appears to be giving some problems. Analysts are expecting earnings to increase by about 9 per cent this year as the tax charge rises, putting the company on a prospective multiple of around 10.5 - fair value in the sector.</p>

For the locals, admission is free and  drinks will be on the Americans. American businessman and party  organizer James Rothwell said it is a small way of thanking the  Vietnamese for persisting in their efforts to improve relations  with the U.S. despite the legacy of war. The announcement  coincides with preparations for the lunar new year and is likely  to be one of the memorable celebrations in decades.</p>

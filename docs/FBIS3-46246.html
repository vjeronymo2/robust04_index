This work is of strategic significance.    The cross-century science and technology leaders must have a  reserve force. In undertaking socialist modernization, it is  imperative to train and select young scientists and technicians.  Since the founding of New China, our country has trained and  nurtured a contingent of scientists and technicians of a  considerable skill level, and of all branches of the sciences  and specialties. The contingent consists of nearly 25 million  people of whom 17 million are natural science and technology  personnel. They have played an important role in promoting  scientific and technological progress, and economic development  in our country.    However, this is far from sufficient to meet our needs. Our  country has a large population, and the 17 million scientific  and technological personnel account for only 1.4 percent of the  population. In the late 1980's, such a percentage was way below  that of both developed and less developed countries. In the  meantime, we have been unable to keep up with increasing needs  with respect to quality, overall distribution, structural  composition, and rational use of manpower. A serious aging  problem exists among specialized advanced technology personnel,  particularly among academic and technical leaders.    In order to accelerate the training of young, specialized  technological personnel, in 1991 the General Office of the State  Council transmitted a document of the Ministry of Personnel --  "Opinions on How To Strengthen the Contingent of Specialized and  Technological Personnel, and Promote the Growth of Outstanding  Middle-Aged and Young Specialized and Technological Personnel"--  to the lower levels. Some localities and departments have since  successively promulgated the relevant policies. The State  Education Commission put forward a plan for nurturing  outstanding cross-century young talent; the Academy of Sciences  has set up a young scientist award; the State Natural Science  Foundation has established a special fund for outstanding  middle-aged and young people; Shanghai has been implementing a  young specialized personnel training plan; and Tianjin has  formulated a plan for building an echelon of cross-century  science and technology leaders.    However, these actions are far from sufficient to keep up  with the rapid development of the economy, and science and  technology at present. Recently, the Experts Department of the  Ministry of Personnel held a symposium in Tianjin to explore the  concept of and measures for nurturing cross-century academic and  technical leaders. Those present pointed out: At present, we  should further enhance our understanding of the importance and  urgency of nurturing academic and technical leaders, as well as  our sense of responsibility; and regard the task as a top  priority in strengthening the contingent of specialized and  technological personnel.    It has been reported that the Ministry of Personnel, working  in conjunction with other departments and various provinces and  municipalities concerned, is formulating concrete measures for  nurturing cross-century academic and technical leaders. We are  convinced that so long as policies are appropriate and measures  are effective, it is certain that outstanding young specialized  and technological personnel will constantly emerge, and the  overall skill level of our scientific and technological force  will certainly be raised.</p>

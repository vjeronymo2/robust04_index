			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Dutch MPs vote to legalise brothels The lower house of the Dutch parliament voted yesterday to legalise brothels and introduce permits for brothel-keepers to enable local councils to regulate prostitutes' working conditions, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The new law is likely to go before the upper house in the autumn. It will clear the way for the previously unenforced ban on brothels to be lifted in early 1993.</p>

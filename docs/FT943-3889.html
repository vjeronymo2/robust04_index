			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Germans on a slippery slope Why is it that the richest country in Europe has suddenly fallen victim to lottery fever? The odds against winning are 140m to one. Yet the Germans have become obsessed to the point of frenzy with their lottery. Enthusiasm has risen in tandem with the prize money, which multiplies in each successive week that the jackpot fails to attract a winner. So contagious is the disease that border crossing points have reportedly been jammed, as Austrian and Dutch hopefuls have flooded in to join the domestic punters. This behaviour seems at odds with the common perception of the Germans. Such hard-working folk should surely frown on an intellectually undemanding form of money making which is distinguished by a near-total divorce between effort and reward. And while the phenomenon will cheer the organisers of the forthcoming British national lottery, it can only give a headache to academic theorists who seek to rationalise the behaviour of gamblers. The fund-raising side of lottery economics poses few explanatory problems. There is a clear correlation between lottery activity and government deficits. In the days when church hostility to the payment of interest was reflected in tough laws against usury, lotteries, like tontines and annuities, constituted a politically correct form of state funding. The museums of the Vatican were financed by lotteries. Benjamin Franklin paid for canons for the city of Philadelphia in the same fashion. London owed its 17th-century water supply and its 18th-century bridge at Westminster to lotteries. Sydney Opera House could not have been built without them. Oddly uncreative While governments continue to run lotteries, companies (and the wider share-ownership movement) have become oddly uncreative in their use. If Ladbroke's dividend were payable by way of lottery, its cost of capital might be reduced; and the working-class customers of its betting shops who have no trouble grasping the mathematics of four-horse accumulators might take more readily to the share-owning democracy. The difficulty comes on the behavioural side. Lotteries have historically appealed to the poor, who spend a disproportionate share of their income on gambling despite the long odds against them. This has prompted accusations of fecklessness. A witness before a British select committee on gambling at the turn of the century declared: 'If the betting craze goes unchecked, the sober youth of Germany will take the reins of the commercial world.' Oh ho. Murderous instincts Prohibitions on gambling have often been justified in the name of protecting the poor. France's revolutionary government put a stop to the Loterie Royale in 1793 because it was seen as exploitative. Yet it was revived when it emerged that the people were simply punting elsewhere. The instinct becomes stronger when times are hard: the 1930s saw a tremendous gambling upsurge. Freud speculated that men were unconsciously bent on losing money to compensate for the guilt they felt over their murderous instincts towards their fathers. Surveys established, more plausibly, that Catholics gambled more than Protestants. The most convincing explanation for this haphazardly rewarding working-class behaviour is that it constitutes psychological insurance. For people whose opportunities for advancement appear blocked, the lottery offers hope, as well as fantasy and escape. But where does that leave the Germans? They are rich, as well as being predominantly Protestant. The unemployment rate in the west is lower than in Britain, France or Italy; and while the east is clearly different, the frenzy is a pan-German phenomenon. Moreover, recent research has established that a surprisingly high proportion of lottery users in Germany are not down-at-heel workers, at risk of losing their jobs and in need of hope, but civil servants. This, it seems, is their idea of living dangerously. Clearly we need a new behavioural theory, which the US campuses are well equipped to provide. As for Germany, the question is whether economic recovery will bring the country's sober youth back to earth.</p>

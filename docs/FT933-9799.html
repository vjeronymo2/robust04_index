			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Lotus writes off Pounds 24m against defunct Elan GROUP LOTUS, the sports car maker and automotive engineering consultancy, plunged to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m in 1992 on a turnover of Pounds 60.98m. General Motors of the US, which bought Lotus in 1986 for Pounds 22.7m, is negotiating - most importantly with Bugatti Automobili of Italy - to sell the company, following the breakdown of talks earlier this year with a Lotus management buy-out team. The group has been in loss for several years, but its financial plight deteriorated sharply last year with the commercial failure of its new Lotus Elan sports car, which has cost it a write-off of Pounds 24.4m, according to its annual report. Lotus ceased production of the Elan last summer after less than two-and-a-half years, making it one of the shortest-lived new cars launched on the world market in recent years. According to Touche Ross, the auditors, there is fundamental uncertainty over the future of the company, unless it can secure adequate refinancing arrangements or continuing support from GM. GM has already been forced to pump in Pounds 18m to repair the battered balance sheet in 1991, including Pounds 11.5m in new equity. It has been seeking to sell the company for more than a year. The pre-tax loss compared with Pounds 14.7m a year earlier, while turnover dropped 30 per cent to almost Pounds 61m (Pounds 87.5m). Net loss was Pounds 27.1m (Pounds 14.8m) after a Pounds 9.42m tax credit. There were exceptional charges totalling Pounds 27.1m (income Pounds 1.23m) comprising the Elan provision and a Pounds 2.73m write-off on the sale of Millbrook Proving Ground, the management company for its Bedfordshire test track. GM has taken over the proving ground, one of the leading vehicle test tracks in the UK. It is now held by General Motors Holdings (UK), the US group's British holding company, which also owns Vauxhall. Following the demise of the Elan Lotus has been forced to limit production to just one model, the Esprit luxury sports car, of which it is planning to build 350 this year. Car output fell to 688 last year including 495 Elans, from 2,241 in 1991 of which 2,060 were Elans. During the year the workforce was cut further from 1,602 to 1,154, with the production and sales staff being reduced by 36 per cent to 664. While the cars business has suffered heavy losses, the engineering consultancy has remained in the black with a profit of Pounds 5.97m (Pounds 5.95m) last year on a turnover of Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 44.3m). Group losses have grown rapidly in recent years from Pounds 2.1m in 1988 to Pounds 4.4m in 1989, Pounds 12.7m in 1990 and Pounds 14.7m in 1991. Under the impact of last year's heavy losses the net negative worth increased from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 32.4m by the end of 1992.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Dispirited publicans who are scraping the barrel - Landlords frustrated over what they claim are unfair practices MR ROGER McLoughlin has been landlord of the Golden Lion in Solihull for eight years, working his way up from a manager for Courage, the brewer, to a tenant. He said he ran a 'pretty good pub' and never had financial problems - until 'the trouble' started. In 1991 he switched from a tenancy to a lease with Inntrepreneur Estates, the property joint venture between Grand Metropolitan and Courage. Under the lease, his annual rent increased nearly 60 per cent from Pounds 52,000 to Pounds 83,000. He knew the terms of the lease were demanding, but he accepted them. 'It (the pub) isn't just my business, it's my home,' he said. He now wishes he had refused. His barrelage has fallen from 800 to 550 a year because of recession and his rent is equal to 24 per cent of turnover. He is making a loss, owes Inntrepreneur Pounds 34,000 and now faces losing the pub and the savings he invested in it. Mr McLoughlin was one of 30 publicans who met on Thursday afternoon in Hampstead. The mood was angry, but determined, and all those who spoke claimed to be victims of unfair or aggressive practices by Inntrepreneur. The meeting was arranged by the National Association of Inntrepreneur Lessees (Nail), an informal body which claims its membership is growing rapidly. It is difficult to know how many publicans are actively involved, but NAIL's lawyer, Mr Julian Maitland-Walker of Charles Russell, said he is acting for 80 Inntrepreneur tenants. They intend to argue in court cases that the leases are invalid under EC law. They also take issue in some instances with information given the lessees on a pub's likely profitability. GrandMet said it could not comment on its relations with licencees or the operation of the Inntrepreneur leases because of the pending court cases. Most of the complaints follow a similar pattern. Publicans claim they were persuaded to sign leases at very high rentals. Once recession started to hit business, the rentals became uneconomic. Inntrepreneur refused to arbitrate and usually sent the bailiffs instead. There are also complaints about some of Inntrepreneur's practices. For example, the company charges Pounds 100 unless leaseholders agree to pay by direct debit. Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet's chairman, told the annual meeting this week that unsuccessful leaseholders were 'generally individuals who have been unable to sustain the level of turnover'. Mr AG Cooper, a chartered surveyor at GW Cooper &amp; Co who is familiar with many cases, said lessees were victims of falling beer volumes and recession. 'The rents they are paying cannot be afforded today in a very large number of cases,' he said. The standard Inntrepreneur lease appears fair. Rent reviews, which take place every five years, can only be upward. But there is room for arbitration and an independent valuer if the two sides cannot agree on the increase. However, rentals are based on historical levels of profitability so some lessees' rentals do not reflect recession. Also, there are no provisions for arbitration when Inntrepreneur frees a pub from tied beer supply and increases the rent in compensation. Last October nearly 2,000 pubs were freed in this way to comply with the government's beer orders. Mr Martin Moore, licencee of the Bridge at Uckfield, was told his rent was being increased from Pounds 24,000 to Pounds 29,100. He said an independent valuation had put the rent at about half that amount. The original attraction of the lease was that it gave lessees security of tenure. In the late 1980s, when property prices were still rising and competition to take over pubs was often fierce, leaseholders also had the chance to share in a property's success by selling on, or assigning, the lease. For leaseholders now in trouble, there are few chances of assignment. Capital values and annual turnovers have fallen, making Inntrepreneur's rentals unattractive. Some leaseholders also claim Inntrepreneur's actions have blocked planned assignments. Mrs Pat Whybrow, of the Rose and Crown at Shorn, said she had lined up a purchaser in 1990. But the assignment, which needed Inntrepreneur's agreement, was called off after 'endless delays'. In a 1991 interview with the Financial Times, Mr Bob Williams, GrandMet's group property director, said Inntrepreneur was partly designed to create a more entrepreneurial spirit among its publicans. 'There had been this paternalism built up over centuries to tenants. Most were not businessmen, they were failed professional footballers or retired coppers,' he said. For people like Mr McLoughlin, who was neither a footballer nor a policeman, Inntrepreneur's brave new world has come as a tremendous, and unpleasant, shock. 'I was never a businessman. I was a publican,' he said.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Russia may restrict aluminium exports RUSSIA may temporarily restrict its aluminium exports in an effort to stop the European Community from taking tougher action against what the EC considers 'unfair competition.' Mr Maxim Medvedko, a senior official at the foreign trade ministry, said yesterday a conference of officials from major producing countries in Moscow this week had agreed to continue consultations next month or early December. But he said that while a multilateral solution could take months to finalise, Russian and European Commission officials would meet in Brussels next week before EC ministers decided whether to extend the European Commission's temporary restrictions on imports of Russian aluminium. If the EC ministers failed to restore free trade in aluminium, Russia might agree to some self-limitation in return for generous access to EC markets in what Mr Medvedko said would be 'a very difficult compromise'. Meanwhile, Interfax news agency reported that a tender scheduled for November 15 would offer 20 per cent of a major aluminium plant, at Irkutsk in eastern Siberia, to western and Russian investors.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Ingham makes recovery to Pounds 452,000 INGHAM, the worsted spinner and retailer of new parts for British classic sports cars, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 452,000 for the 12 months to end-December. The year-end has been changed to March 31 and the outcome compared with losses of Pounds 152,000 for the corresponding 12 months. Last month, when Ingham gave details of the proposed acquisition of Moss Europe and an accompanying rights issue, shareholders were told that the figures in the second interim statement would be meaningless for purposes of comparison. They included the results of Transtar for three months only; the period coincided with Transtar's traditionally quietist trading period. Ingham's earnings emerged at 6.1p (losses 4.7p). Payment of a 1.25p final dividend has been brought forward for a total of 7.25p (3p for the 12 months to December 31 1991).</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Records: Nostalgic compilations THE ART of the compilation album is an odd one. Consider Topic's collections of sea shanties, Blow the Man Down (TSCD464), and industrial songs, The Iron Muse (TSCD465). Both are CDs that have been expanded from original concept albums, of the early 1960s and the late 1950s respectively. Both are important collections of folk songs. However, from the perspective of the 1990s, The Iron Muse is the more vibrant. Blow The Man Down is imprisoned by the rhythms of the sea and the sound of the accordion and is severely limited in its potential villains. The rhythms of The Iron Muse are more varied and the stories more complex. Moreover as Theme Park Britain comes closer and closer, the description of work and its deprivations, originally complained off or protested about, take upon an almost nostalgic hue. Particularly affecting are the miners songs. White Country Blues (Columbia Legacy 472886 2) confirms the fact that though the American South was segregated for much of this century, culturally black and white musics were closely intertwined. The set's sub-title 'a white shade of blue', is also accurate, pointing to the fact that these white bluesmen of the 1920s and 1930s were more melancholic and rural and less mythic and impassioned than their black brothers. Particularly powerful are the performances by Frank Hutchinson, Charlie Poole and the Allen Brothers. Instrumentals (Hannibal HNCD 8302) seemingly lacks a similarly convincing raison d'etre: after all it is only a collection of instrumentals. In fact, thanks to careful selection it has an unusually strong presence and operates rather like a carefully routed tour of world music. Typically the haunting opening track which sets the feel of the CD, a seven minute didgeridoo-guitar combination 'Dance The Devil Away', is fake folk but the feeling is as real as that of the Bulgarian group Blakena, the Romanian Muszsikas or the British Fairport Convention. Mynd Excursions (Sequel NEXCD 237), Every Great Motown: The First 25 Years: Vol II, the 1970s (Motown 530 114-2) and Fontana, the Sixties and Nineties Collections (Fontana 515 892-2) are more straightforward examples of the compilers art. The Sequel offering collects together 30 essays in psychedelia from the Kama-Sutra label. Most are minor (The Tradewinds, The Innocence), a few terrible (The Mulberry Fruit band's version of 'Yes We Have No Bananas' is absolutely horrendous) and a few real finds. Best of the bunch is The Vacels. Their version of Dylan's 'Can You Please Crawl Out Of Your Window' is a superior example of pop psychedelia in which blue-eyed soul meets the Lovin' Spoonful. The result is a cult classic. With only 11 tracks the Motown offering is a little short. More intriguing is the Fontana offering, a three CD set, one devoted to the 1960s and two to the 1990s when PolyGram revived the label. The 1960s CD mixes British R'n'B (The Pretty Things, The Spencer Davis Group, Alexis Koerner) with pop (The Troggs) and cultdom (The High Numbers, ie the Who before they were The Who) with wild abandon in the manner of the times. As befits its time the 1990s set (which starts in 1987) is more calculated, mixing the Fall with le Mystere de Voix Bulgares and Tears For Fears with a knowing post modernism in which eclecticism is the norm. Sometimes compilations have the power to both surprise one and confirm a generally perceived view. Such an album is the perfectly titled The Genius Of Dave Bartholomew (EMI 8018421). Best known as the writer and arranger of numerous Fats Domino hits, Bartholomew, as this double CD of recordings produced by him and featuring his band from the late 1940s to the early 1960s confirms, had a far wider palette at his disposal. The central element of the Bartholomew sound is the relaxed beat of his band, but on such pared down productions as Archibald's 'Stack-a-Lee', Jewel King's 'Don't Marry too Soon', or Peew Wee Crayton's marvellously subdued 'Every Dog Must Have It's Day' or T. Bone Walker's hilarious 'Teen Age Baby', Bartholomew reveals himself as a master of all the musics of New Orleans.</p>

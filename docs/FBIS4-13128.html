			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Kasm, head of the National  Security Office, at 1300 today received the UN Middle East  fact-finding mission that comprises a number of journalists from  various world countries.    Dr. al-Kasm answered journalists' questions concerning  developments in the peace process and the Arab-Israeli conflict.  He emphasized the constants of Syrian Arab policy, and its  position on the just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    This morning, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' received the  mission, which includes ranking Western and Japanese media men.  The foreign minister answered their questions and said Israel  intransigence since the beginning of the peace process  obstructed the realization of substantial progress in the peace  process. Al- Shar' said the opportunity for peace is getting  narrower day by day because of Israel's insistence on continuing  its occupation of the Arab territories, contrary to the UN  resolutions on which the peace process was based.    The foreign minister expressed Syria's determination to  continue its objectives, which are identical with the  international community's objectives, to realize a just and  comprehensive peace in the region, in accordance with the Madrid  formula. He stressed the importance of the objective role of  mass media in the international arena in distinguishing between  those who want real, just, and comprehensive peace, and those  who block this peace.</p>

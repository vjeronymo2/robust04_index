			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo ex-chief to receive Pounds 2.7m DR Ernest Mario, former chief executive of Glaxo, the drugs group, will receive a Pounds 2.7m pay-off over the next three years following his ousting in March. The sum, revealed in the annual report published yesterday, is the largest-ever severence settlement in the UK. The payment generated little comment among institutional investors. Dr Mario, who had a three-year rolling contract, will receive his salary of Pounds 900,000 until June 1996. In addition, he will be paid long-term performance related bonuses for the next four years. These are based on the company's earnings per share growth compared with competitors such as Merck of the US and Wellcome of the UK. Dr Mario also retains his 526,186 share options which lapse on dates up to August 22 1996. At yesterday's share price of 642p, they were worth Pounds 3.3m. Dr Mario purchased Pounds 28,842 worth of furniture from Glaxo when he left. His remuneration for the year was Pounds 1.32m, which included a bonus of about Pounds 420,000. Sir Paul Girolami, chairman, received Pounds 1.44m compared with Pounds 1.19m the previous year. Dr Mario was ousted by Sir Paul after a boardroom bust-up over Glaxo's future direction. Dr Mario said he resigned because of differences of opinion over the running of the business. Although his Pounds 2.7m payment may appear a great deal for one man, it will have little impact on the company. The sum is equivalent to 11 hours worth of sales of Glaxo's best-selling drug, the ulcer treatment Zantac. During Dr Mario's tenure between May 11 1989 and May 12 1993, Glaxo's share price rose from 337p to 668p and its market capitalisation increased from Pounds 10bn to Pounds 20.1bn. It outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index by 50 per cent, and the health and household sector by 12 per cent. In August, Dr Mario became vice-chairman and chief executive of Alza Corporation of California. The company makes drug-delivery systems. If Dr Mario works for a direct competitor of Glaxo, he loses the right to the Pounds 2.7m payment.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Morsels from a groaning table: EC countries are reluctant to give eastern Europe freer access to their markets The former communist countries of central and eastern Europe have come in from the cold. Yet their exports are still frequently being frozen out of western markets. In the past few years, the principles and practices of western capitalism have streamed into eastern Europe. The European Community's exports to the region are booming. But the goods produced there are a long way from flowing westwards with the same momentum. The EC has decided on a partial liberalisation of trade with Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria under association agreements concluded during the last 18 months. So far, however, the Community appears to have received the better part of the bargain. The EC's trade surplus with the five core countries in the region (now six following the break-up of Czechoslovakia) rose to Ecu2.5bn last year from Ecu1.4bn in 1991. During previous years, up to 1990, the EC ran a deficit with the region. The association agreements, while setting down a 10-year timetable for dismantling trade barriers for industrial products, still contain a significant element of protectionism. In particular, limits remain in force on eastern exports of so-called 'sensitive' goods such as iron and steel, farm products, chemicals, textiles, clothing and footwear. In all these products, the west is suffering from overcapacity. These are, however, precisely the sectors - making up 35 to 45 per cent of eastern Europe's exports to the EC - where, on grounds of price and quality, the east has the greatest export potential. The barriers highlight the EC's apparent desire to keep out imports in any area where eastern Europe is competitive. Aware that freer trade has, up to now, mainly benefited the west, the EC Commission has launched an initiative to improve the terms of the liberalisation timetable. Combined with plans for greater political dialogue with eastern European countries, the trade proposals will be high on the agenda at the EC summit in Copenhagen on June 21-22. Under the proposals, pushed through by Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Hans Van den Broek, the EC's two external affairs commissioners, customs duties on industrial goods such as cars would be lifted by the end of 1994 - a two-year advance on the initial plan. Additionally, the Commission wants to shift from a quota-based system for imports to less restrictive ceilings, so that the east Europeans would not automatically face higher tariffs if they breached import targets. Although bolder than forecast, the plan, if implemented, would be relatively modest. Fundamental restrictions on agriculture and textiles would remain. The Community would also reserve the right to impose 'contingent protection'  -for instance, anti-dumping duties - against sudden surges in low-price imports of industrial goods. The Commission believes the proposed softening of trade terms represents the maximum that can be agreed by EC governments in view of recession-induced protectionist pressures. Last week, Mr Van den Broek pointed to 'reserve' among member states about the economic implications. Longer-term logic, however, points to the need for further liberalisation. Opening the door to eastern exports provides one of the best ways of stimulating the region's prosperity - and hence of securing its political stability. Many EC states, above all Germany, want to see more economic growth in the east as a means of stemming migration of dissatisfied easterners. Lower barriers would provide a means of satisfying western companies investing in the region that their output will find export outlets. Mr Jim Rollo, a trade policy expert from Britain's Royal Institute of International Affairs, who believes the Commission's latest proposals do not go far enough, highlights the potential benefits of more vigorous measures. High growth in the area could increase overall imports into eastern and central Europe by as much as Dollars 400bn a year (at 1990 prices) by 2010, he estimates. At least half of this would represent purchases from the EC, increasing demand for EC goods by Dollars 200bn a year - twice as much as the Community currently sells to the US. 'It would be like having two new US markets on your doorstep,' Mr Rollo says. For all the longer-term arguments in favour of liberalisation measures, the problems faced by specific EC industries greatly increase the political difficulty of pushing them through. Tomorrow, EC foreign ministers will discuss the Commission's package in Luxembourg. Most countries have voiced some objections. But the Danish presidency of the EC remains confident, declaring that package is 'the bare minimum for the Community to remain credible with these (eastern) countries'. Portugal remains the most obdurate. Although less than 0.5 per cent of its total imports come from eastern Europe, Lisbon argues that more liberalisation would squeeze its exports, particularly textiles, out of EC markets - a fear broadly shared by France and Belgium. Germany is now signalling unreserved support, increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome. Last year, Germany last year accounted for 56 per cent of EC trade with the five core eastern countries - twice as much as the combined eastern trade of France, Italy and the UK. Despite the severe economic downturn in Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's emphasis on the political stakes has tipped the balance in Bonn. Doubts among industrialists remain, however. Mr Ludolf von Wartenberg, general manager of the Federation of German Industry, says his organisation welcomes the proposals 'in principle'. But he points out that, for the first time in the industrial era, Germany now faces the risk that jobs will migrate to low-wage countries on its doorstep. Hourly wages in the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland are between one-tenth and one-twentieth of levels in western Germany. One Bonn government official says: 'It is as if we had Hong Kong just 80km from Berlin.' An EC compromise on steel imports from the Czech and Slovak republics, agreed in April, highlighted the importance of German views. Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC's industry commissioner, went to Germany to explain the agreement to steel executives. The volume of Czech and Slovak steel imported into the EC will be allowed to rise about 36 per cent this year compared with 1991 figures. But even this increase will still lead to a sharp cut in imports compared with 1992, when imports from the east were much higher than the year before. EC industrialists and farmers regularly underline the threat posed by eastern imports. Qualms about eastern competition were illustrated by EC anti-dumping action against eastern steel exporters last year. In April, the EC imposed a one-month ban on imports of live animals, meat, milk and dairy products from the east. Although the EC claimed this was aimed at stopping spread of foot-and-mouth disease, eastern Europe saw it as blatant protectionism. The measure was quickly rescinded after outraged eastern European countries took counter-measures. For specific products such as fertilisers and steel, relatively small extra volumes of eastern imports can squeeze loss-making western producers by causing large reductions in marginal prices. In overall foreign trade terms, however, opening of trade to the east has clearly brought net advantages to the west. In 1991 and 1992 the Community's exports to central and eastern Europe rose faster than its imports. Compared with 1988, the EC's exports to the region last year were up 130 per cent, while imports were up 82 per cent. An unpublished report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows that, even in some of the so-called 'sensitive' goods, the industrialised west has registered benefits in trade with the east. Based on a breakdown of 1991 figures (full product details for 1992 are not yet available), OECD countries that year improved their eastern trade balances in several areas of trade in this category. The report points out that exports of 'sensitive' products often represent the sole means for eastern countries to compensate for sharp falls in formerly staple exports to the old Soviet bloc. The EC's trade surplus has probably increased further this year. Exports from the east have been curtailed by the recession in Germany, as well as by overvaluation of eastern European currencies. The Czech Republic increased exports to the EC by only 1.9 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. Czech imports from the EC, by contrast, rose 40 per cent against the year-earlier period. Hungarian exports to the EC in the first quarter this year are reckoned to have fallen about 25 per cent compared with the same period in 1992. The growing trade gap in the EC's favour demonstrates one reason why the EC can afford more generosity. Another more fundamental argument in favour of liberalisation focuses on the large imbalance in the relative importance of trade between the two halves of Europe. 'A billion dollars of extra trade is trivial for us (the west), but it is highly significant for them,' says Mr John Flemming, chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Further liberalisation would have only a small impact on the west, he says, but could bring 'colossal' benefits for the east. The combined value of the EC's trade with central and eastern Europe last year made up only about 1.7 per cent of the Community's total exports and imports - less than the EC's trade with either Austria or Sweden. Central and eastern Europe is the source of only a tiny proportion of EC countries' overall imports of 'sensitive' goods. In 1991, according to OECD figures, the percentages ranged from 1.7 per cent for chemicals and 2.3 per cent for agricultural products to 2.7 per cent for iron and steel and 2.8 per cent for textiles. Following a sharp reduction in sales to the former Comecon area, central and eastern European countries, by contrast, now carry out about 50 per cent of their trade with the EC, compared with roughly 25 per cent in 1989. Eager to seize opportunities for western sales, east European trade representatives in Brussels have reacted favourably to the latest Commission proposals. The reception from governments at home, however, has been more grudging. Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech industry and trade minister, highlights 'serious obstacles' in export access to the EC. In Warsaw, however, one senior Polish official takes a more moderate line. The EC plan represents 'not five steps forward but half a step forward,' the official says. At least, the proposals show 'the EC is starting to speak the same language as we have been using'. Beyond the question of trade, the main preoccupation for central and eastern Europe is the question of joining the EC. As a fundamental part of the association agreements, these states have committed themselves to adapting their political and economic structures to the demands of eventual membership. Mindful of the cost of absorbing much poorer countries, the EC is, however, avoiding giving the easterners a firm date. Even the Commission's relatively vague plans for greater political dialogue with the east have caused concern among traditionalist member states such as Belgium, wary of opening the membership door. 'It doesn't make sense to speculate about any (membership) date,' Mr Van den Broek said last week. One senior EC official says pointedly 2000 is the year not when these countries can join, but when they can have free trade. The Community is implicitly making membership conditional on a reduction of the economic gulf dividing the EC and the eastern applicants. At present, GDP per capita in Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics is probably between one-fifth and one-tenth of the EC average. Without adequate eastern access to western markets, the gap in economic performance cannot narrow significantly - condemning the east to an indefinite wait. If, on the other hand, the Community can decisively accelerate trade liberalisation, the period in the EC ante-room would be shorter and less arduous. And the eventual rewards would be much greater - for both east and west.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Bush condemned to deliver the speech of his life THERE is a hyperbolic trap that journalists and politicians fall into all too easily. It is the tendency to describe a speech to be given by a particular politician as the most important that person will ever deliver. In the popular American imagination the big speech becomes a litmus test of purpose, toughness, leadership. It is often, these days, imbued with the muscular qualities which admiring Americans profess to see in Prime Minister's Question Time in the British House of Commons. These are the 'big speech' expectations that President George Bush and Vice-President Dan Quayle are expected to live up to tonight in their acceptance addresses. Four years ago the fighting speech Mr Bush gave to the New Orleans convention was considered an important step on his way to the White House; this time its content is supposed to provide the 'vision thing' he is normally so poor at supplying. As Congressman Vin Weber, the articulate conservative from Minnesota, said: 'The most important thing he has to do is to give the American people reason to believe his second term will be worth voting for.' Newspapers, liberal as well as conservative, write the same every other day. This has not been a bad year for political speeches in the US. Governor Bill Clinton gave a fine one on race in New Orleans in April, although a poor one to his own convention last month. Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, savagely witty, and former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, regally professorial, turned on their oratorical skills in New York. This week in Houston Mr Ronald Reagan and Mr Pat Buchanan have come up with stemwinders, although of a very different nature. The former president was perhaps kinder and gentler than in his 'evil empire' days. But the touches, the self-deprecating humour - 'I knew Thomas Jefferson' - and the evocation of a finer nation were, well, Reaganesque. Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, laid down his own effective marker on Tuesday night. But, in the end, does 'the speech' matter that much? The great addresses to Democratic conventions used frequently to be given by Senator Edward Kennedy, and he never made it all the way. On the Republican side Mr Reagan had to give a lot of good speeches before he ascended in 1980. If there have been words that have determined the outcome of elections, they have often not been contained in speeches. Three presidential debates - in 1960, 1976 and 1980 - mattered far more in defining to the general public the character and capabilities of candidates. The chaos of Chicago in 1968, exemplified by the soundless swearwords coming out of the mouth of Mayor Richard Daley, damned the Democrats Not that that matters for Mr Bush tonight. He is condemned to give 'the speech of his life.' Nothing less will do.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nissan Iberica losses deepen LOSSES at Nissan Motor Iberica, the Japanese carmaker's Spanish subsidiary, rose sharply to Pta11.1bn (Dollars 89.7m) in the first three months of the year from Pta1.2bn in the corresponding period a year ago. Nissan Motor confirmed yesterday that it is to inject Pta5.02bn in new equity capital to strengthen the balance sheet of the majority-owned Spanish subsidiary. The new equity will raise Nissan's holding in Nissan Motor Iberica from 67.7 per cent to 70.3 per cent. Nissan Motor Iberica, which suffered a loss of Pta14.37bn in the whole of 1992, said turnover had fallen by 22 per cent in the quarter to Pta32.35bn. Sales volume, including domestic sales and exports, also fell by 22 per cent to 18,552 units. Nissan Iberica has been hit hard by the drastic fall in demand in Spain, where sales of commercial vehicles declined in the first quarter by 40 per cent and car sales by 37 per cent from a year earlier. As part of a series of restructuring measures aimed at reducing losses Nissan Iberica said that it was seeking: to cut costs in vehicle assembly by 15 per cent this year and by 10 per cent a year in both 1994 and 1995, to reduce overhead costs 'drastically', and to cut its indirect and salaried workforce by around 600 jobs or 15 per cent. The company's financial performance has also been burdened by heavy investments in the development of new products and in the modernisation of plant and equipment in the last two years totalling around Pta100bn. Nissan is seeking to transform the offshoot from its role as a maker of light and medium duty commercial vehicles chiefly for the domestic market, into a producer of niche passenger vehicles to be sold across Europe. Nissan Motor Iberica expects production to rise to around 90,000 this year and to 130,000 in 1995 from 77,000 in 1992.</p>

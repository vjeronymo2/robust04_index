			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (3): Presidential caution is needed - Portugal is currently a little EC-mad THE OFFICE of Mr Sarsfield Cabral, director of the European Commission in Lisbon, commands fine views over the city from the top floor of a modern building. Its presence is an opulent symbol of Portugal's widening circle of influence. The country may be one of the most recent and remote members of the European Community, admitted in 1986. But its enthusiasm for the institution - now given an extra boost by its first presidency  - is clearly evident. It does not take a long walk across Lisbon before a flag, or a poster of the blue and gold flag of the EC, comes into view. The newspapers have devoted regular, substantial sections on news related to the presidential period. Portugal is currently a little EC-mad. Mr Cabral, himself an unashamed propagandist for the EC, concedes that perhaps it has all gone a little too far. 'This kind of euphoria has brought some problems,' he says, singling out the inflation which has accompanied the rapid economic growth since the mid-1980s. Other senior government officials admit that, while it is an honour, the timing of their presidency could hardly have been more difficult. Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the foreign minister, will have to tread carefully during the Portuguese EC presidency, while a number of important issues are considered. Substantial efforts are needed to complete the formation of the single European market by the end of the year. Delicate negotiations will be needed to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and to agree on a new package of EC structural funding and budget measures. In addition, foreign affairs are likely to continue to take up considerable time, including the situation in Yugoslavia, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Algeria. Portugal itself, given its colonial past, may also try to push more Third World issues on to the agenda, according to Mr Cabral. He says there has been tremendous change in Portugal since it joined the EC in 1986, and that perceptions of the Community have become much more positive. 'The first five years was a success,' he says. 'Portugal has changed completely, and the economy has prospered. The mentality of the people has changed from fatalistic to more optimistic and confidant as the standard of living has improved.' He cites the example of supermarkets, which he says have been transformed from drab stores offering few, poor-quality goods not much better than those in eastern Europe, into modern outlets stocked with a wide range of quality and cosmopolitan goods. Mr Cabral suggests that many factors fostered support for EC membership, including the contact the people had with relatives who had emigrated, particularly to France, and were enjoying greater prosperity there. Equally, he says, joining the EC was seen as a way to fortify the country's fragile democracy against both communism and the prospect of right-wing dictatorship. It has required a fundamental shift for a country which is geographically on the margins of Europe, and had historically focused outwards across the Atlantic, with its back deliberately turned away from Spain. EC membership has brought a sense of integration with the rest of Europe. It has also brought some very direct financial rewards: transfers to date from EC funds total about Es550bn (Dollars 3.9bn). Another Es900bn is planned up until 1993. That has helped to fund large-scale infrastructure projects, and fuelled rapid economic growth. Officials also defensively suggest that any frauds which have taken place are minor compared with those recorded in other member states. Mr Cabral says the country is well advanced on implementing many EC directives, ignoring those for which it has negotiated delays, such as capital movements. It has taken steps in the current budget to move towards harmonisation of VAT, for instance. But now the sacrifices are beginning to bite. An economic convergence plan, submitted late last year, commits Portugal to a series of tough measures to bring the economy more in line with the rest of its EC partners. It aims to reduce inflation and gradually cut the public-sector deficit through lower spending and reduced interest rates. Many industries nationalised in 1974 are now being privatised, and most commentators expect the process to lead to redundancies. The agricultural sector is still heavily subsidised, with a large number of uneconomic and inefficient farms. Economic openness is also likely to increasingly effect some of the country's traditional industries such as textiles. Many may not survive foreign competition. An important issue is the timing of membership of the exchange rate mechanism. It could happen this year, and some commentators have even suggested that, for political reasons, it might be announced during the presidency. To do so would bring the escudo in while inflation remains much higher than the EC average. In any event, it will bring greater discipline to the management of the economy. A recent OECD report on the Portuguese economy suggested that unemployment is now below sustainable levels; while growth would be impossible to sustain without more effective control of inflation and liquidity, a reduction in the size of government spending, and a freer reign on exchange rates. Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the Bank of Portugal, is critical of this report. He says a free exchange rate could jeopardise the restructuring of the economy. But he accepts that government expenditure must fall as part of a tough series of measures to improve the shape of the economy. The transition towards greater economic integration with the rest of the EC will not come without considerable further trauma. 'So far we have only had the benefits,' says Mr Cabral. 'Now we must pay the bills.'</p>

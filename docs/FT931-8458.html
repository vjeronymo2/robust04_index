			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Germany looks for business in India CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl arrived in New Delhi yesterday on a four-day visit, primarily to strengthen economic ties between Germany and India, and to explore the business opportunities afforded by India's new economic reforms programme. While in India, he and the 20 German businessmen accompanying him will visit the Indian Engineering Trade Fair. Germany was one of the first countries to send a business delegation to India when India opened up its economy to foreign investors last year. Germany is India's largest EC trading partner, accounting for about 8 per cent of its total trade. Germany's exports to India totalled Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.04bn) and imports Dollars 1.7bn in 1991. In the first half of 1992, trade was virtually in balance at about Dollars 900m each way. Finished goods, like leather products, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cotton and silk garments comprise some 85 per cent of India's exports to Germany; imports are mainly industrial machinery and fertiliser components. India has received more than DM10bn in financial and technical assistance from (West) Germany since bilateral development co-operation began more than 30 years ago. Mr Mr Hans-Georg Wieck, German ambassador, said his country was looking towards Indian companies as potential partners in the machine tools, equipment and manufacturing sectors. The fair, a biennial event, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, an autonomous association representing some 2,600 Indian companies in the public and private sectors, has generated business inquiries worth Rs17.16bn (Pounds 405m) in the first three days, a record for the fair. The fair's success, especially in industrial engineering goods and machine tools, reflects India's changed business environment, say the organisers.</p>

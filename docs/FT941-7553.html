			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television We are promised Britt Ekland, Lulu, Adrian Edmondson, Helen Lederer, Jo Brand and Zandra Rhodes all 'guesting' in Absolutely Fabulous. Can this really be a good idea? The opening episode of this series packed in a similar roster of star names, and turned out to be the least funny episode of the lot (9.35 BBC1). A newer and more conventional comedy, Nelson's Column, stars John Gordon Sinclair, the eternal juvenile lead from Gregory's Girl, as a lovelorn (well, randy) local newspaper reporter (8.00 BBC1). BBC2 begins a three-part series, In Search Of Our Ancestors, with anthropologist Donald Johanson returning to Ethiopia to re-tell the story of the 'missing link' (9.30 BBC2). Commando relies on the same exultation in military macho that used to sell 'Battle' comics to schoolboys in the 1950s. Tough chaps face fearful challenges and are driven to the limits of endurance (9.30 ITV). Will Late Picasso complete BBC2's Picasso season by facing up to the public contempt for the Modern movement? (11.15 BBC2).</p>

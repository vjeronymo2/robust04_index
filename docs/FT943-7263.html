			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Scramble for a slice of the nitty-gritty market: A look at the hotting up of competition between US long-distance telecoms operators The obsession with 'superhighways' and high-tech 'convergence' has obscured the dominant trend in the US telecommunications industry: the massive intensification of competition between operators vying to provide core telecoms services. This week's Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) purchase of WilTel, a US long-distance operator, by LDDS, the acquisitive US telecoms group, underlines that reality. LDDS's ambition is simple: to establish itself as the fourth force in US long-distance and international telecoms, challenging AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint. LDDS is elbowing its way into a crowded market. Long-distance telecoms in the US has been fiercely competitive for a decade, since AT&amp;T was forced to spin off its local networks and the remainder of its business was exposed to newcomers. AT&amp;T steadily lost market share until stabilising at about 60 per cent of long-distance traffic. The main beneficiary was MCI, which rose to about 20 per cent on the back of aggressive discounting and innovative marketing. Sprint took a 10 per cent stake, while hundreds of smaller resale operators  -WilTel being one of the largest - established themselves by discounting. LDDS has forged a profitable business in the past 10 years reselling leased telecoms lines at a discount to small and medium-sized business customers. Last year the Mississippi-based group merged with Metromedia Communications, the long-distance telephone and entertainment concern owned by Mr John Kluge, a billionaire businessman with ambitions to take on the 'big three' long-distance operators. Earlier this year, LDDS's first offer for WilTel was rejected by Williams Companies, the Oklahoma-based owner. LDDS paid Dollars 895m for IDB Communications, an international satellite phone carrier before returning for WilTel with a Dollars 2.5bn offer. With WilTel's 11,000-mile advanced fibre-optic communications network, LDDS becomes a fully fledged phone carrier. As an owner instead of a lessee of telecoms lines, it hopes to reduce its costs and offer lower prices and a broader range of services. It will target larger corporate customers of the kind traditionally served by the Big Three. What are its prospects? LDDS believes it has snatched a head-start on other operators angling to compete in long-distance services, notably the seven 'Baby Bell' regional companies which hope to enter the market on the back of regulatory changes expected to be enacted by Congress this year. It is debatable, however, how much of a market opportunity exists. AT&amp;T and its rivals will not yield business without a fight. Price differentials are already low: according to analysts, a 3 to 8 per cent margin separates the operators. Moreover, new services increasingly depend upon sophisticated network software, and the larger operators are to the fore in its development. AT&amp;T estimates that within five years half its revenue from business customers could come from services other than telephone calls. Nonetheless, LDDS starts with about 4 per cent of a Dollars 65bn market which is expanding rapidly. All customers are becoming used to switching operators, and many businesses are employing multiple long-distance providers. Much depends on whether Congress passes the current telecommunications bill, which would further open up the industry. Mr Stuart Conrad, analyst at CJ Lawrence Deutsche Bank Securities, says charges imposed by local operators are declining at an annual rate of 3-4 per cent and could fall by as much as 20 per cent within three years, if Congress permits greater local competition. If LDDS establishes a profitable niche, it might itself become a takeover target, particularly for the Baby Bells as they look for a short-cut into the long-distance business. Alternatively, a data information company might take a look: last week the company's shares were buoyed by rumours that Electronic Data Systems, the computer services company owned by General Motors, was considering merging with LDDS, although Mr Bernard Ebbers, LDDS's chief executive, denies that talks took place. LDDS is also developing an international strategy. Mr Ebbers says 'there may be an opportunity' in tying up with an overseas operator. Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecoms group, is keen to strengthen its position in the US market, where it has a small long-distance business. Mr Ebbers says his priority is to weld together the existing business. However, in today's telecoms industry, there is no such thing as a breathing space.

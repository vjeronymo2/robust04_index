			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KCET JUBILANT OVER INCREASE IN BUDGET, VIEWER RESPONSE  </P> <P> On a steadily bullish fiscal track, KCET Channel 28 says that its budget for  the fiscal year that begins Saturday will be $44.4 million -- a 15% increase  over the current year.  </P> <P> "I'm just really so up," William H. Kobin, the Los Angeles public-television  station's president and chief executive officer, said this week.  </P> <P> Adding to his list of happy statistics, in the midst of KCET's 25th anniversary  celebrations, are a 6% increase in viewership and a 5% increase in subscribers  over the previous year.  </P> <P> Those numbers, Kobin said, are even more dramatic when measured over the last  five years. In fiscal 1984, an average of 1.5 million households watched KCET  for at least 15 minutes a week; today the figure stands at 2.6 million  households. In 1984, there were 200,000 financial contributors; today there are  325,000.  </P> <P> The consistent improvement in the station's financial picture follows a  dramatic turnaround in 1986, when Kobin, then three years on the job, was able  to help pull the station into the black, where it has been ever since. KCET had  been in severe debt for several years.  </P> <P> According to Barbara Goen, vice president for public information, the breakdown  of the new budget is: 56% for production and broadcasting; 17% for fund raising  and marketing; 12% administrative; 8% building facility support and 7%  promotion and advertising.  </P> <P> At the annual board meeting last week, where the new budget was approved, Kobin  reported that more than half of the area's households watch KCET every week and  more than 70% watch the station every month.  </P> <P> The movie "Stand and Deliver," a PBS "American Playhouse" production, turned  out to be KCET's "most-watched program of the year," said Kobin. The movie  registered the second-highest rating in the station's history, behind a  "National Geographic" special on tigers.  </P> <P> "Stand and Deliver" has particular relevance to the station's leadership, which  is trying to increase ethnic viewers and subscribers.  </P> <P> "It's interesting to note," Kobin told the board, that "Stand and Deliver,"  which aired with a Spanish simulcast on radio, "produced 3,000 pledges for  $162,000, with over a third of the pledges coming from people with Hispanic  surnames."  </P> <P> The $44.4 million projected in the coming fiscal year includes an estimated  $1.4 of capital expenditures to purchase equipment, Kobin said.  </P></p>

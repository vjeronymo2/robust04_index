			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of three in a series of unattributed reports: </F> "Self- Portrait of Party Programs 2."]    [Text] To make our readers' job easier in making a  decision, our editorial staff has put a set of question to the  parties that were able to set up national lists. Our questions:    1. What are the three major political, economic, social, or  welfare tasks facing the governing forces in the next four  years, tasks that your party accepts and will give preference to  even at the cost of other problems?    2. What are the three larger-than-average economic,  political, social, or moral burdens facing the society or some  strata of the society in the next four years, burdens connected  with or independent of the aforementioned tasks that you do not  accept or accept only partially, and which you force into the  background compared with other similar problems?  <H5>  Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] </H5>   1. Out of the next four years' most important welfare  measures, developing the state support for child rearing has a  major importance. To a large extent, even now, it is the task  of family help centers to support the families. The development  of this network is justified. In addition to this, the  financial transfers in society -- the tax system, social  security, and welfare benefits -- have to be formed in such a  way as to make it clear for everyone that society does not only  emphasize the importance of families in words. The tax system  will also have to be changed: During the four years of  government, it has to be achieved that only the freely  disposable income is taxed. For single parents, a fair  possibility has to be guaranteed to reduce their tax basis. We  wish to develop the tax system in a direction that will take the  number of dependents into consideration. We have to develop  further the institute of full-time maternity.    In the area of the economy, one of our main goals is to  establish a financial and tax environment that fosters economic  growth. Of the main tools of market stimulation, we think it  necessary to change some important elements of the tax and duty  systems in the interest of a more proportionate sharing of taxes  and economic development. It is also necessary to reexamine the  product structure of the general trade tax to improve the  situation of the poorer groups in society. Parallel with the  beginning of economic growth, we consider reducing the upper tax  limit to stimulate the demand and to protect the domestic  producers' interests to be justified. We suggest the abolition  of the minimum tax. We only accept the temporary maintenance of  the source tax if the budget uses it for development and  investment purposes.    Economic development is impossible without cultural  development. The KDNP wishes to implement a pluralistic cultural  policy, we wish to support programs, rather than institutions.  Our goal is to establish the dual system of support for culture  that exists in Western Europe: a state and economic sponsorship  structure.    2. According to the KDNP's economic policy, our task is to  make increased incomes possible while maintaining the balance  (without significantly increasing inflation, the budget deficit,  or the balance of payments deficit) that:    -- on the supply side, stimulates investments by enterprises  directly from their own incomes and indirectly through using the  population's savings;    -- on the demand side, creates an effective demand that does  not induce inflationary pressure or increased imports of  consumer goods.    Due to balance problems, this increased income can only be  implemented:    -- if we accept a temporary deficit of the budget and  payment  balance,    -- and if we use a very carefully designed, selective, and  targeted tax system, budget reform, and credit policy.    If our program is implemented, the increase of consumer  prices cannot exceed 14 to 16 percent.    However, in the interest of market stimulation, we cannot  make it our goal to reach one-digit inflation in such a short  time. In accordance with this, and in the interest of social  peace, in the medium term, we can only expect that the budget  deficit in proportion to the gross domestic product [GDP] will  not decrease, or only to a very small extent.  <H5>  Liberal Civic Alliance Entrepreneurs' Party </H5>   1. For three years, since we accepted the program called  "Bourgeois Transformation," our party's goals have not changed:  competitive market economy, socially solidary society, and two-  chamber parliament. We want to replace the state-centered  economic policy with a "streamlined" economic policy. Economic  stabilization is impossible without capital investment, which in  turn needs a predictable economic environment and lasting laws.  The reform of state finances cannot be delayed any further, tax  payers can only finance the truly necessary tasks rather than  budget labels without any function. Instead of self-interested  and bureaucratic state privatization, we give preference to a  privatization strategy based on public consensus with the  involvement of the interest representations bodies. It is  impossible to protect the domestic industry and trade without  suppressing the black economy. We must guarantee price security  for the agricultural producers through changing the subsidy and  taxation systems.    The state, the local governments, the employers, and the  employees have to make a new social pact. Out of the ways of  handling unemployment in accordance with the local  circumstances, investments from privatization revenue, tax  allowances given to enterprises launched in crisis regions, and  leaving the greater part of personal income tax with the local  governments are important measures. We can handle the regional  differences of unemployment through small-area crisis management  programs. It is enterprises that can mostly create new  workplaces.    We need a new constitution and a two-chamber parliament.  Politics that unites and balances the interests is the only  viable way for the future, for modernization.    2. We do not wish to spend too much energy on debtor,  credit, and bank consolidation because this method will not  reach the desired results without creating certain guarantees.  The primary task to be solved would be bank privatization.  Naturally, to achieve this, stabilization is necessary, even  through the method of bank consolidation, however, if this is  not concomitant with privatization then the capital pumped into  the banks has to be seen as money down the drain.    Unemployment is a burning and tense problem. At the same  time, the huge body of unemployed can be divided into two, well-  distinguishable groups. One consists of truly unemployed people  while the other group abuses the possibilities provided by the  legal system and is possibly an active participant in the black  economy. We only wish to deal with the latter group when we make  it impossible for them to remain on benefits because their equal  treatment with the truly unemployed people evokes serious moral  aversions, and our shaky economy cannot support the burdens,  either. We do not wish to deal with the issue of further  compensations in the future, we respect the already existing  compensations but do not support new ones.  <H5>  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] </H5>   1-2. Politics is an art of compromises. Rather than the  politicians and political parties having to make compromises  with each other, this means that balance has to be found and  maintained between society's needs and values. Only the extreme  and radical parties would annihilate or suppress all other  values or interests for the sake of one particular value or  interest. In the past four years, the government led by the MDF  has shown that it is possible to maintain stability, namely to  establish a balance extending to the whole society between the  interests and goals, even under extremely difficult  circumstances. We did not implement the shock therapy that had  been recommended by other parties and some experts, however, we  did not continue the peaceful inaction and dilapidation that had  characterized the previous regime. We can promise this balanced  policy for the next four years, too. We act, but with  moderation, without endangering people's lives and material  security with experimentations and short-term solutions.    The most important values and the price to be paid for them:    -- The preservation of social security in the growth period,  too. The framework of the social market economy has been  established, the economy has entered a growth period. In  legislation and in the state's activities we have to concentrate  on patching up the welfare net, we have to achieve that none of  the needy people are left without any support. We would mainly  like to improve the situation of pensioners and young people;  the latter group is especially important because the burdens of  setting up a family and rearing children also rest on the  younger generations.    It is possible that the probably very fast growth will not  reach its maximum speed because of the resources spent on social  security, but we are convinced that, this way, the growth will  have a better foundation and this is profitable in the long run.    -- The state has to promote economic growth. Economic growth  is vitally important for the country, because living standards  have not improved in the last 15 years. An improvement can only  be achieved through growth.    According to the experience of economic history, growth is  always concomitant with minor budget imbalances, the same way as  an enterprises is also forced to take on loans if it wants to  invest and expand. However, enterprises that are worried about  taking on loans and therefore do not develop, will certainly go  bankrupt, because the old saying about capitalism that states  that you have to run to stand still is true. (In other words,  one has to develop even just to maintain the current situation,  because the competitors are also developing).    We have to make our contacts with Western Europe tighter in  all areas. There is only one solution to our economic  development and security situation: To return to Europe. To  join the European Union [EU] and NATO. Many things might still  happen to the east and south of us. It matters a lot what kind  of government a country has at the time of a possible radical  change and whether it has international security and economic  defenses. Neutrality would expose the country to a possible  radical nationalist or communist danger.    Returning to Europe also requires sacrifices. We cannot  conduct a protectionist policy, we cannot introduce customs  duties as we wish, because, if we did, our Western partners  would do the same to keep out Hungarian goods. We succeeded in  that Hungary will open its markets to the European Union later  than the European Union to Hungary.  <H5>  Hungarian Socialist Party </H5>   1. The most important task is to achieve that society's best  forces cooperate with each other in the interest of solving the  country's problems and reducing the divisions in society. A new  social agreement has to be established between the employers,  the trade unions, the interest representation bodies of  employees, the civic organizations, and the government that will  guarantee peace in the country. The decision-making system has  to be changed in such a way as to make it possible to learn  about a broad range of views and to create a consensus.    The decline of the economy has to be stopped, the  deterioration of the balance and the increase of indebtedness  have to be curbed, the development of the Hungarian economy has  to be put on a modernization course that will establish the  conditions for lasting economic growth. In the interest of  this, we have to implement the reform of the state finances, we  have to complete bank consolidation, and we have to put  agriculture back on its feet. The state has to take an  organizing role in recapturing the eastern markets and in  developing the infrastructure.    In the interest of the economy's sound development,  privatization has to be placed on a new footing in which  longer-term economic considerations, and leaders and employees  interested in the future of the enterprise, would receive a more  prominent role instead of the current bureaucratic control.    In the interest of ensuring the country's external peace, we  consider a balanced foreign policy necessary. In addition to  getting closer to the European Union, we strive for balanced and  good relations with all our neighbors, and for strengthening  these relations. Our solidarity for the Hungarians living  beyond the borders is part of our solidarity for the Hungarian  nation and, at the same time, it is part of a future European  system of protecting national minorities.    2. In the next four years, although we will do everything  sensible we can to achieve them, we can already now see that we  will only be able to achieve partial results on some points of  our program.    -- Unemployment cannot be ended because we are still to face  the problems related to the structural change, however, there is  a realistic chance to reduce it.    -- The burdens of debt servicing will not be reduced because  another peak of debts was created in the past four years,  however, if we manage to improve our economy's ability to  compete and its export performance, then the burdens will be  better shared through the bigger turnover.    -- Inflation cannot be reduced to a single-digit figure due  to the delay in the reform of state administration and the again  wide agrarian price gap, but inflationary pressures can be  avoided and inflation can be pushed down to around 15 percent.  <H5>  Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP] </H5>   Welfare care should provide a safe point for everyone who  happens to be swept too far from the will of society through no  fault of their own. The support and welfare system should be  based on needs and the task is to draw this up and to implement  it. In other words, the various provisions have to be separated  (a hospital is not an old people's home), the support has to be  targeted to the individual (rather than the family or the school  or institution, it should be the person in need who receives the  support and the right to dispose of it), the goal should be  prevention and preparation for adjustment, and welfare care  should be made part of the small communities.    To change the social system, the current centralized and  redistributive system of collecting the social revenue has to be  broken down again. Changing the system of state finances is the  first step. In the framework of this, we can implement the  following: Lessening the centralization of tax revenue and its  spending, separating the state finances from the budget, placing  the government and the state-owned organizations under the rules  of the private sphere -- rather than the state's power -- thus  separating and requalifying them from the "tool of executive  power" to the rank of participants on the market. We also have  to thoroughly simplify the production and the collection system  of incomes from taxes, duties, and of fiscal sources.    In the course of reconstructing our society and the economy,  the guiding principle is our linking to the European practice on  an equal basis, in which the major task is to establish the  institutional, group, and personal requirements of cooperation.    The basic conflict lies between modernization and its  rejection (conservation, return to the feudal estate), and this  creates counter-movements that are even noticeable on a  political level (yearning for the past, and so on).    The structural change and the ensuing work mobility are not  two different sides of the challenge of modernization, rather,  they are the same phenomenon, and they only appear to be  separate from the work's and the employee's point of view. In  our position, it is obvious that the tasks we undertake should  be adjusted to the market requirements rather than to our old  abilities. However, this is only a matter of priorities rather  than of bearing the burdens. [sentence as published]    2. In the interest of what has been said above, and in  accordance with our priority system, we do not support, for  example, the actions that are being conducted now and for whose  maintenance there is much pressure. One such area is financing  the deficit -- which resulted from the unsuitability and  inability shown in solving the problem of international  cooperation and foreign markets -- through convertible (or  domestic) debts. Another is the budget support --  "consolidation" -- of losses and indebtedness of banks and large  enterprises that resulted from unprofessional (state) management  and private control. Finally, another such area is the  diversion of tensions arising from the unresolved nature of  social and interest coordination problems, state spending, and  the unchanged distribution system to a political level.    This is the subject and goal of a possible social contract,  rather than the polishing of the representative and declaration  system and statutes of various "forums." [sentence as  published] Because this only creates the possibility for  covering up the lack of social peace, rather than creating the  road for social peace.    We do not accept the moral burden of the repetitious  mentioning of outdated ideas in politics, the promising of false  stability in the economy, the beautifying "powdering" in the  social situation, the cherishing of illusions (third road,  separatist showing of being Hungarian, or rejection of world  standards) and, all in all, provincialism and its twin sister,  populism, with its superficiality, aggressiveness, and shunning  of responsibility and tasks. The MSZDP will undertake to  establish solidarity, justice, and equality of opportunity.</p>

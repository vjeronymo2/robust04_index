			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rikkyo University Professor Shinichi Kitaoka] </F>   [Excerpts] Under the new election system, elections  will definitely be party-centered. However, these parties will  not be organized parties, nor will they be groups of like-minded  people. These parties will have a structure of a leader and a  machine which automatically accepts the leader.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The political reform bill was passed at the end of January  after a great struggle. Needless to say, the core of the bill  was reform of the election system. As Professor Takeshi Sasaki  points out, this is the most major system reform carried out  under the Japanese constitution. With the exception of the  general election of 1946, the traditional medium constituency  system has lasted since 1925, when it was first established.  This reform is the first in 69 years.    A total of eight national elections were held under the  small  constituency system. Six of them were held between 1890 (22d  year of Meiji era), when the first general election was held,  and 1898 when the sixth general election was held. The 14th and  15th general elections, in 1920 and 1924, were also held under  this system. However, these elections were restricted elections;  the number of eligible voters in the first election was 450,000  (total population was 39.9 million), and in the 14th election,  3.06 million (total population was 55.39 million). These figures  cannot compare to the number of eligible voters today, which is  93 million.    Under the Meiji constitutional structure, the House of  Representatives was just another national organization, and  there were many powers, such as the House of Peers, the Privy  Council, not to mention the Army and Navy, which the House of  Representatives could not effectively control. Elections in  those days were not given much weight.    Above all, Japan during the Meiji and Taisho eras was  basically a poor agricultural country, in comparison with  today's Japan, which has achieved a high economic prosperity and  is highly urbanized. It is unnecessary to reemphasize that this  is a major difference when it comes to elections. By the way,  the main issue in the first six elections was the reduction of  land tax. In short, the election system based on small  constituencies is a totally new experience for the rich Japan  under democracy and under the parliamentary cabinet system.    Furthermore, since 1955, fairly unique party politics  existed  in Japan, where no real competition took place between the  overwhelmingly powerful main party and powerless nongovernment  parties. Many arguments about political reform showed lack of  understanding of the dynamism that party politics should possess  by nature. They believed that what they had had since 1955 in  Japan was genuine party politics.    This election system reform will bring a substantial change  to Japan's party politics. As I stated before, this will be a  new challenge for Japan. In order to identify its direction, it  is necessary to study the nature of party politics and the  situation of today's Japanese society. Through this task, this  article is to discuss political reform, which is expected in the  near future, and party politics, which goes beyond the reform.  First, we will discuss some arguments about the recent election  system reform.  <H5>  Parties With No Name </H5>   First, we want to look at the criticism that new parties do  not have names that correspond with their ideologies and  principles. This is true with the Japan New Party, Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger].    However, this is an unavoidable phenomenon when the age of  ideology is coming to an end. Examining Japan's existing  political parties, the policies of the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] or the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] cannot  necessarily be called general terms, such as liberal democracy,  or socialism. The Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] is not solely  democratic socialist, and the Japan Communist Party [JCP] is  trying hard to explain that it is not communist. Komeito's name  [Clean Government Party] has nothing to do with its ideology.    When looking around the world, we find that many parties  have  "liberal", "democratic" and "national" in their names. There are  also religious names, such as Christian. Many still use  "social", "people," and "labor"; however these will not be  popular anymore. Among all these, "liberal" and "democratic" are  still popular, and even the extreme rightists in Russia are  naming themselves the Liberal Democratic Party. "Liberal" and  "democratic" must be good names. But these names do not function  to distinguish one party from another anymore.    As you can see, it is difficult to ask new political parties  for names that suit their ideologies and principles. The  existence of criticism about party names means that there is a  belief that a political party must be a group of people who  share common ideology and belief. However, this belief is false.    As Max Weber said, there are two types of political parties.  One type is those whose members share a certain idea, ideology,  and world view. The other is those whose goal is to obtain a  government position. We can call them the shared-ideology type  and power-oriented type. (As you will see, this does not mean  the former is good and the latter is bad.) Parties possess both  aspects more or less. But, theoretically there are these two  types. In addition, I think there is a third type, if parties  exist, that represents strong subgroups characterized by race,  language, or religion.    U.S. political parties are typically the power-oriented  type.  Compared to major parties in Europe, there is very little  difference between the two major parties in the United States.  The little difference between them exists due to the  small-constituency system. This means that parties have  conflicts in the small-constituency system, and this system  works in conjunction with the national presidential election to  create the bipartisan system in the United States. Therefore, it  is of no use to criticize parties that they have no ideologies  or beliefs that run through them.    In Japan's case, we have very few class, racial, or  religious  differences. When the ideology aspect is weak, it is natural  that power-oriented parties will become the main players. With  the SDPJ bidding good-bye to socialism, major parties, which had  tended to be the shared-ideology type, will disappear.  <H5>  Party, Ideology, Power </H5>   I want to mention here about the idea of "modernization of  parties" which once was advocated in the LDP by Mr. Takeo Miki  and some others. This opinion also had the idea behind it that  the basis of parties and other political groups is sharing of  ideologies. Their image of a modern party was that it had many  members and had a structured organization. Based on this idea,  it would be difficult to call the LDP, which had diverse  politicians from the rightist to the leftist, a political party,  and they would be extremely out of date having several leaders  who led factions.    This criticism of factions came from misunderstanding what  political parties were. First of all, factions are based on  common ideas, policies, and political beliefs. Only for the sake  of simplification are they divided into the so-called "right"  and "left." When we compare the mainstream conservative  factions, we can say that the Ikeda-Maeo-Ohira-Suzuki-Miyazawa  faction is the left, the Kishi-Fukuda-Abe faction is the right,  and the Sato-Tanaka-Takeshita faction is the middle-of-the-road.  You rarely see a hawk (hardliner) in the Miyazawa faction or a  dove (softliner) in the Fukuda faction. It is a surprising fact  that this form has been lasting over a long period of drastic  changes.    This has something to do with the fact that the major  factions in the LDP had been after power. Major factions have  been organized by influential members in order to obtain the  office of LDP head. The influential leaders would gather their  supporters, help them in their local precincts, and assign them  posts. To return the favor, faction members always worked  together for their leaders' pursuit of power.    However, faction leaders have their own ideas, policies, and  political beliefs. These might have come from their educational  backgrounds and experiences, or from particular situations.  Anyway, they do have some ideas of their own. Furthermore, a  political leader would be asked to speak in various situations,  and the accumulation of these words would create an overall  image. His faction would come to share this image. Thus, the  idea of a leader becomes the idea, policy, and political belief  of his faction.    For example, people who share the same idea as Mr. Shinsuke  Kishi tend to flock around Mr. Kishi, and as they act with Mr.  Kishi, his ideas tend to become those of his faction. Also, Mr.  Kishi had Mr. Toshio Fukuda in mind as his successor, and this  was based on the closeness of their ideas, and their shared  experience reinforced this closeness. Thus, the Fukuda faction  possessed similar ideas and policies to those of the Kishi  faction. The same thing happened to some extent in the  transition from the Fukuda faction to the Abe faction. Thus, a  faction tends to carry on the same ideas and policies even  though the leadership changes.    However, this depends on how the leadership is passed on.  When the Sato faction became the Tanaka faction, there was an  intense power struggle, and naturally there is a substantial  difference between before and after the struggle.  <H5>  Factions Becoming Like Guilds </H5>   In recent years, factions have been changing from  power-oriented groups, which are after the office of the LDP  head, to guild groups, which have the distribution of posts as  their objective and which value harmony within the faction. A  group that fights to make its leader the prime minister and a  group to maintain faction unity are completely different from  each other. The latter trend began in the 1980's in the  establishment of the Suzuki cabinet and the Suzuki faction,  following the sudden death of Prime Minister Ohira, and it  spread among the other factions. With these changes in factions,  cartelization of LDP politics progressed. However, because I  have discussed this point in another article, I will not go into  it. ("Bid Farewell To Cartel Politics," CHUO KORON March 1993;  "From Cartel Politics to Competitive Politics," CHUO KORON  September 1993) [passage omitted]    The LDP's factions used to be power-oriented groups. They  were not based on solidarity of policies and ideas. However,  this is the very reason why they came to be unified on policies  and ideas. But, when a faction becomes like a guild,  coordination (or harmony) within the faction comes before  everything else and its unique ideas and policies disappear. If  factions are power-oriented groups now, one or two of them might  have withdrawn from the LDP, justifying themselves. The factions  have weakened this much.  <H5>  The Time for Leaders To Compete </H5>   In short, when open power struggles cease to exist in the  LDP  or the whole political parties, conflicts on ideas and policies  grow weaker. Contrary to this, what is happening now is the  revival of open power struggle--which is party politics--and  conflicts about ideas and policies are becoming clear. However,  this conflict manifests itself as a struggle between leaders.    Since the establishment of the Japan New Party by Mr.  Morihiro Hosokawa a year ago, and especially since publication  of Mr. Ichiro Ozawa's Blueprint for Building a New  Japan, more and more politicians are publishing books. Some  are well done, and some are poorly done. But, this is a good  thing. We are able to learn the ideas and policies of our  national leaders, and are able to choose. It is also true with  the SDPJ, which is the last ideology-based party, that the  leader stands out.    Until now, the SDPJ officially has had a socialistic world  view to bring socialism to realization. However, this view was  strongest among party activists. The top officials, who are  members of the Diet, were more realistic. General socialist  supporters were merely anti-LDP. This shows that there were  three layers in the structure of the SDPJ party. Therefore, when  summarizing the party members' (activists') opinions under the  name of party democracy, the left would always win. The fact  that the SDPJ is in power, though only partially, changed the  meaning of the leftwing spring, and made the Diet members lean  toward their parties. As a result, parties are divided into the  power-oriented part and the part which has criticism of those in  power as its motive. (The next generation leftist would be the  latter.) This would cause an even greater impact than the  worldwide decline of socialism.    This break from being a party with a world view, naturally  demands a leader. Their hopeful argument to make Mr. Takahiro  Yokomichi the leader comes up often, showing this trend.    One criticism of the small constituency system was that they  cannot choose candidates, while it is possible to do this under  the medium constituency system. At the first glance, this may  sound correct. Under the medium constituency system, people  could choose whom they liked among the LDP candidates, A, B, C,  and D. Or one could vote for candidate E because of his  personality, while he might not particularly like the JCP.  However, the problem was that there was no telling whether those  chosen had any influence within their parties.    For example, it is very rare that one votes for Miyazawa  faction candidate A because he wants to support Kiichi Miyazawa.  For this vote to work effectively, it requires a roundabout  route.    In comparison, last July's election was simpler. The parties  that made great strides forward were the Japan New Party and  Shinseito. There might have been various motives, but it is  safe to think that those who voted for the Japan New Party, in  essence, voted for Mr. Hosokawa, and those who voted for the  Japan Renewal Party, voted for Mr. Hata and Mr. Ozawa. In the  last analysis, it is a matter of whom one wants to support as  the national leader, as in the presidential election in the  United States. In fact this is a desirable way to be for the  national election. This is much healthier than an election  influenced by local interests.    Under the new system, the election will definitely be party  oriented. However, the parties will not be organized parties nor  groups of those who share the same ideologies. Their structure  will be that of a leader and the machine that automatically  accepts the leader.    I would like to mention here, in relation to this, that  there  was criticism that the prime minister should not come from the  number-four party among the coalition. However, this is common  among coalition governments, and happens all the time in  countries such as Italy. What is unusual about Japanese  elections is that it is hard to know who are the heads of the  parties. The LDP kept its party leader Miyazawa out of the  public eye, and it fought the election campaign using Shintaro  Ishihara, Yohei Kono, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had completely  different political orientations. This was very unusual. When  the coalition government is established, it would be against the  rules for Shinseito to support Mr. Ozawa rather than Mr. Hata.  However, it is not strange that they choose a leader from among  the heads of individual parties.  <H5>  Campaign and Parties </H5>   When tahe political party-oriented time came, a problem  would  arise about the relationship between parties and other groups.  What is interesting about this issue is the criticism that the  small constituency system makes it hard to produce female  representatives. When the political reform bill was voted down  in the House of Councilors, one female Diet member said that it  was difficult for female candidates to be elected from a small  constituency. There were also similar criticisms, such as that  the small constituency system would choke off citizens'  movements or concerted actions by residents. In short, these  criticisms mean that the party-centered small constituency  system would act against minorities and citizens' movements.  Some went even so far as to say that the small constituency  system was against democracy. However, many democratic nations  in the world have the small constituency system, and this  particular criticism can be ignored.    It is a simple misunderstanding that it is difficult for  female candidates to be elected from a small constituency. This  is clear when you see the numbers of female candidates elected  from medium constituencies and small constituencies. The reason  why the LDP has an extremely small number of female members in  the House of Representatives is that it is under the medium  constituency system. The other nongovernment parties have a  relatively large number of female members. This is due to the  fact that they do not put up more than one candidate per  constituency. For nongovernment parties, a medium constituency  is similar to a small constituency.    It is also a mistake to criticize that the small  constituency  system would work against concerted actions by residents or  citizens' movements. Today's election, unless there is a great  difference in ideologies, is a competition among political  parties that are more or less alike. People can demand that  individual candidates make their positions clear concerning the  environment, consumers' movements, or whatever the issue may be.  Especially, a nationally organized group movement may allow the  group to obtain the deciding vote in many constituencies. If the  competition is close, each candidate would try hard to get their  support, and these group movements would have increased  influence on the outcome of the election.    This may pressure these citizens' movement groups themselves  to change. Various campaigns in the past have been unified with  the SDPJ and the JCP, and this prevented them from spreading. If  these groups would obtain the deciding vote, their narrow view  might be corrected.    In the past, single-issue politicians could be elected, but  it was difficult for them to have influence in the national  government. The largest constituency (opposite of small  constituency) has been the House of Councilors' national  constituency and proportional constituency. It was possible  there to include representatives from minorities and citizens'  movements, and to make sure that one or two of them were  elected. However, this could only serve to inform the whole  country that there are problems in the welfare, tax, sports, or  whatever field it may be. How much influence it could have was  questionable. In reality, most policies depended on the  bureaucrats in Kasumigaseki.    In fact, this answers the question why the consumers'  movement is weak in Japan. Consumers' movements used to have  close connection with the political reformists. But this  prevented the movement's expansion. Very few representatives who  were included in the SDPJ or the LDP, could do very little.  Movements are movements. Politics is politics. By regaining its  role, the consumer movement can expand.    This is also the key to solving the problem between  professional politicians and amateur politicians. The complex  political administration of today cannot be handled part time.  In order to handle this on site, there are enormous number of  bureaucrats who work full time. In fact, only the full time  politicians are able to control these bureaucrats. It may be  more effective to influence these politicians by citizens'  movements, rather than having one of the movement leaders become  a politician.  <H5>  Problem of Candidates </H5>   As you can see, it is crucial for a political party to put  up  good candidates. Some say that the small constituency system may  give too much power to headquarters of parties. They may become  powerful, but it does not mean that they can do anything.  Democracy is a system of competition, and if the party loses  because they could not put up good candidates, the party  headquarters will be responsible. Ichiro Ozawa, when he was  secretary general of the LDP, resigned his post because his  party lost in Tokyo gubernatorial election. Although the  Shinseito-Komeito coalition seems strong, they may be labeled as  a "a party for which people would not vote for any reason,"  them), and it is very possible that they may lose the election.    If the parties would eagerly look for good candidates, one  big problem would be solved. It is the problem of an increasing  number of second-generation Diet members.    The increase in the number of second-generation Diet members  is making it difficult for new politicians to enter the  political world. The same thing is happening in the other  Japanese industries, also. When Eisaku Sato, Hayato Ikeda, and  Aiichiro Fujiyama came into the political world, each of them  was instantly the leader of the party. It is highly desirable  that people like these three men, who have experience in fields  outside politics, come into the political world. However, we  cannot expect that to happen in today's political world.  Instead, in order to compete with second-generation candidates,  some candidates do anything to be elected. This is a bad side  effect of having so many second-generation politicians.    However, there is a strong demand for the political world to  have new politicians. The victory of Rengo in the House of  Councilors election in 1989, and the last year's victory of the  Japan New Party was due to the fact that each party provided a  way for newcomers to enter the political world. If the victory  depends on whether they can gather enthusiastic, capable men,  party leaders would try very hard to do that. This would lead to  finding more talent in Japan.  <H5>  Political Parties and Bureaucrats </H5>   Another important thing is the relationship between  political  parties and bureaucrats.    It is true that the new administration's slogan was to break  the iron triangle, which represented the connections between the  bureaucracy, zoku Diet members, and industry. However, some  criticize that the bureaucrats are getting more powerful.    What is being overlooked here is the fact that bureaucracy  was already at a deadlock. It is true that their Kasumigaseki  headquarters had a great power, which no other power came even  near. There, all the ministries and agencies held one another in  check, each swayed by its own interests. They had lost their  direction. When this structure falls, it is no wonder that some  reformist bureaucrats begin more liberal activities.    Overthrow of bureaucracy takes a long time and much energy,  and cannot be accomplished overnight. However, as a start some  bureaucrats will gain more power, and the rest will gradually  lose power. Kasumigaseki is still a brilliant think tank. There  is no other organization that has such detailed knowledge about  political administration. Overthrowing bureaucracy should mean  more effective utilization of bureaucrats' great ability.    However, this alone is not enough. The limitation, which is  fatal for bureaucracy, is that it cannot be comprehensive nor  creative. This is because bureaucrats are to act within the  rules and precedents, and are not supposed to go beyond them  easily.    In this sense, the Prime Minister's Official Residence needs  to gain more power, and it is desirable that a solid,  comprehensive policymaking structure be established in party's  center or around influential politicians. With the pressure on  leaders to present their policies, establishment of this  structure may rapidly progress.  <H5>  Coming Framework of Conflict </H5>   What will the framework of coming conflict between parties  be  like? The argument often comes up concerning this is the  argument whether it should be the lenient multipartisan system  or the bipartisan system. This is not a very appropriate  argument. When they say lenient multipartisan system, there are  five to six parties at most, including the LDP, Sakigake and  others (anti-Shinseito bloc), Shinseito-Komeito-plus others, the  SDPJ's left wing, and the Japan Communist Party. Even under the  bipartisan system, there will be the LDP and unified new  parties, and the SDPJ's left wing and the JCP will remain.  Therefore there will still be four parties. There is not much  difference between the multipartisan and bipartisan systems. The  bottom line would be whether they want two primary parties or  three.    It is very funny to ask party members whether it is going to  be bipartisan or multipartisan. Whether it will be two parties  or three parties, is a result. If party members have confidence  and a strong sense of responsibility in their policies, they  should try to get the majority, if not, they are being mere  observers.    What could cause parties to oppose each other? One of the  deciding factors would be whether Japan will willingly play a  role in the international security or not, that is whether Japan  is a so-called "normal nation" or not. However it is hard to  tell if this will be the point of conflict. As I mentioned  earlier, you cannot explain the difference between the Democrats  and the Republicans on the basis of ideology. Each of the two  parties may possess an aspect of "normal nation" and an aspect  that is not normal. This depends on the future political  situation.    I think Japan should take a nonmilitaristic approach and  become an "normal superpower." I will not touch this subject  here, since I have already written an article concerning this  ("Normal Countries and Countries That Are Not Normal" in THIS IS  YOMIURI February 1994). I just want to mention the minimum  requirements when policies and ideas are presented.  <H5>  Ideas and Policies </H5>   What should parties or leaders present to the people? Many  say that it is their responsibility to clearly present their  ideas. However, as I wrote before, it is difficult to present  clear ideas that will distinguish one from another. Take for  example, an often talked about idea of "protection of the  Constitution." There are various ideas in the Constitution, and  it is difficult to distinguish one party from another solely on  the basis of protection of the Constitution. The "idea of  constitutional pacifism" is also vague. The argument that, since  pacifism is advocated most clearly in the Preamble, Japan should  act positively for peace, and therefore we should participate in  PKO [UN peacekeepig operations] more fully can be valid. What  so-called constitutional protectionists advocate is different  from this. When they say protection, they mean protection of  Article of the Constitution. No one is against Paragraph 1 of  Article 9, and many nations of the world support this principle.  What is at issue is Paragraph 2 of Article 9. When parties (or  leaders) present their ideas, I would like them to be very  specific. For example, they should say that they advocate the  idea of demilitarization of Paragraph 2 of Article 9.    Second, ideas are important, but policies and programs are  more important. For example, some are insisting, "let's export  Article 9 of the Constitution to the world." This is good. But I  have a request. They need to clearly present the way to export  it. Unless they have a concrete way to make the world "import"  Article 9, and know how long it will take for the whole world to  adopt it, and unless they have a program to protect the  countries from aggressions of other countries during the  adopting period, it will just be an ideal, a play of words. They  should clearly present a concrete plan, especially the cost and  the risk without ignoring time factor, along with the idea.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   Political reform is expected to accelerate in the near  future. However, this article went beyond that and attempted to  take a midterm view. My suggestion that the time will come when  leaders will compete on the basis of their policies may sound  too optimistic. Even if my prediction comes true, this does not  guarantee a good result. Leaders may fall so low as to be only  concerned about their popularity, and we cannot deny the  possibility of people electing such leaders.    However, I feel that this is a phase that we must go through  in the development process of democracy. We must bid farewell to  the age when even though the voters make a poor choice,  bureaucrats, the LDP, or the United States will do something to  take care of it. In this sense, those who are faced with most  the serious choice are the people themselves.    The mass media carry a great responsibility. They must  change  their habit of reporting only the criticisms of those in power,  or basing their report only on human relationship or power  struggle. They must report politics, which is a mixture of  ideologies and power, viewing from a proper distance. Their  attitude since the birth of the Hosokawa administration also has  leaned too much toward exposing the inner workings of the  politics and political technique.    Finally, quoting Mr. Weber one more time, it is a job of  very  few top leaders of parties to present the list of their  candidates and to present their party policies (New Order  Germany's Diet and Government). This is where party leaders  compete, as well as parties. This is the foundation of  competitive democracy. Then, journalism must devote itself to  judge political policies and candidates. The future of the party  politics depends on whether the mass media can fulfill this  responsibility.</p>

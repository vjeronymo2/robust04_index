			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia network] </F>   [Excerpts] [Unidentified correspondent] The National  Defense Ministry, which is beginning the spring conscription  today, believes that more than half the conscripts want to avoid  doing their military service. Commissions are to check about  250,000 19-year-olds.    Doctors say that an increasing number of young men suffer  from psychological disorders. [passage omitted]    Among those who attend the consciption commissions, less  than  half, about 120,000, actually reach the Army. The remainder  manage to avoid military service thanks to postponements or on  medical grounds.    [Begin Colonel Kazimierz Cieslik recording, main Military  Medical Commission] In the past three years, personality  disorders were the main reason for being unfit to undergo  military service. Whereas in the 1980's this reason was recorded  in 15 percent of cases, the figure has now risen to 27 percent.  [end recording]    [Correspondent] On the list of ailments, second place  belongs  to eye defects, and third to bad posture and hearing problems.    More than half the conscripts think that their time in the  Army is time wasted. They also fear the discipline and  harassment from soldiers from earlier conscriptions. [passage  omitted]    The majority of young men believe that the Polish Army  should  be a professional army. They think that those serving should be  those who want to be in the Army and who are predisposed toward  it. But there are not many chances of such an army being  created in Poland. [passage omitted]    Just a few years ago, basic military service in Poland  lasted  two years; service in the Navy could be as long as three years.  Today military service lasts 18 months. The General Staff has  announced that, as early as next year, it might be possible to  shorten it to 12 months.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PIPER AEROSTAR CRASH: HOW IT HAPPENED  </P> <P> 1. A twin-engine, six-seat Piper Aerostar PA-60 from Camrose, Canada, took off  from John Wayne Airport at 8:33 a.m. A witness said the plane was flying  abnormally low, and an engine was backfiring just after takeoff. Soon  afterward, smoke came from at least one engine.  </P> <P> 2. Air traffic controllers radioed the pilot, who responded by saying, "We have  to come back." The pilot gave no indication there was any problem, and  </P> <P> controllers received no other transmissions. The plane  </P> <P> started to bank left to return to airport.  </P> <P> 3. During the turn, the plane dove steeply toward Eastbluff and the Newport  Beach  </P> <P> Tennis Club, less than 2 miles from the end of the runway. It then nosed nearly  straight down and crashed. The family of five aboard the plane was killed as  the plane exploded in the corner of Court 4, 20 yards from the clubhouse,  narrowly missing several people. No one on the ground was injured.  </P></p>

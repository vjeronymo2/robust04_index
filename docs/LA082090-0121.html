			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOB ARTHUR TO LEAVE KABC'S 'KEN AND BOB'; BARKLEY WILL JOIN SHOW  </P> <P> Bob Arthur, the quieter co-host of KABC-AM's "The Ken and Bob Company," one of  the most popular radio programs in Los Angeles, announced today that he will  leave the station next month to help set up a controversial group of care homes  for Alzheimer's disease patients in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Arthur, who will broadcast his last show with Ken Minyard on Sept. 14, will be  replaced by another local radio veteran, Roger Barkley. Barkley co-hosted the  popular "Lohman and Barkley" show on KFI-AM (640) for 25 years, then served as  morning host for KJOI-FM until last year. He filled in for Arthur twice this  year when Arthur was ill.  </P> <P> "The Ken and Barkley Company" will premiere on Oct. 1.  </P> <P> The departure of Arthur, 69, will break up his longtime partnership with  Minyard, the other co-host on the news/entertainment program. The duo have been  together on KABC (790) for 17 years and have been among the top three in the  morning ratings since the "Ken and Bob Company" premiered in 1980.  </P> <P> Arthur told listeners of his decision during this morning's program. Barkley  also appeared on the show.  </P> <P> Arthur said he had a "financial and moral" interest in setting up the care  homes, which he said are being opposed by several residents and city officials  who fear the homes will lower property values. The seven single-family  facilities are being coordinated under the auspices of Rose Chateau Inc., in  which Arthur has a part interest.  </P> <P> "This is obviously a long and agonizing decision because I've got a good career  going," Arthur said in an interview. "But I can't use the airwaves of KABC to  fight this battle because it would be a conflict of interest." He said the  project would require his "complete attention."  </P> <P> Minyard, 51, said he regretted Arthur's decision, but understood it. "When  you've been together for so long, it's never nice when something like this  ends," Minyard said. "But I understand it. Bob has a real commitment to this,  and this is something he feels he has to do."  </P> <P> KABC President and General Manager George Green said: "Bob is an integral part  of this radio station. By the same token, when you have a guy with the name and  reputation of Roger Barkley, someone who is a household name, you're thankful  to get a guy of that caliber."  </P></p>

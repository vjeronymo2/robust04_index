			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> As I lie here in bed listening to the malathion-spraying helicopters flying low  overhead, I can't help thinking: How ironic it is that with all the concern for  and pains taken to preserve the thousands of forms of animal life, from the  huge elephant to the tiny insect in some remote desert pond, we meet with only  limited success.  </P> <P> Yet when we reverse the procedure and attempt to exterminate one member of the  animal kingdom (i.e., the Medfly) we find it near impossible.  </P> <P> AL MEHLMAN  </P> <P> Rosemead  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The long-overdue fiscal  1994 state budget became law Thursday [23 June], nearly three  months after it should have come into force.    The House of Councillors gave a stamp of approval to the  73.1  trillion yen budget for the year that started April 1 at a  plenary session after its budget committee cleared it earlier in  the day.    Only three budgets took longer to enact than the fiscal 1994  budget during the postwar period.    The government's budget plan was tabled in the Diet on March  4 but had been left undebated for 80 days due to the political  maelstrom over former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  personal financial affairs. The turmoil forced Hosokawa to step  down in April.    But once deliberations started, the budget took an unusually  short 23 days to become law.    The budget earmarks 40.9 trillion yen, or 2.3 percent more  than the fiscal 1993 budget, for general operating expenditures,  the core part of the budget that includes most outlays other  than debt-servicing costs and tax allocations to local  governments.    It features 5.5 trillion yen in income and residential tax  reductions and sets aside 8.98 trillion yen, a 4.0 percent rise,  for public works spending, both designed to shore up the ailing  economy.    Outlays for defense are allowed to rise a scant 0.9 percent  to 4.7 trillion yen while official development assistance was  budgeted at 1.0 trillion yen, a 4.4 percent increase.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 100m Guinness warrant issued THE LONDON stock market's appetite for covered warrants was further whetted yesterday when NatWest Securities issued a Pounds 100m warrant on Guinness, the brewing group. NatWest is the third stockbroker in the past two weeks to take the unusual step of using warrants as a means of tempting investors into areas of the market they might otherwise avoid. A warrant gives investors the option to buy the underlying shares at any time during the exercise period at the price on the day of the warrant's purchase. The Guinness warrant, which can be exercised on a 2-for-1 basis over the next 18 months, yesterday opened at 22 1/2 p. The move comes at a time when Guinness shares have been under pressure. There has been concern over the fortunes of LVMH, the French luxury goods group which has a 24 per cent cross-holding in Guinness. Dull global spirits trading has also dampened investor enthusiasm. Guinness shares have slipped steadily from a 1992 high of 558p. Yesterday, they closed 8p up at 413p. NatWest said it believed the shares had reached a nadir, and the warrant was an opportunity for investors to tap into the recovery potential of one of the drinks sector's worst performing stocks. Two weeks ago, BZW issued a Pounds 100m warrant for the food retail sector, followed by SG Warburg last week on multi-media stocks. Although warrants have the advantage of being tradeable, the market being made by the issuer, their rarity owes much to the culture of UK fund managers who complain that trustees are generally wary of using derivative instruments.</p>

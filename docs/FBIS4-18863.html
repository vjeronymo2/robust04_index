			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ADB: "Rwanda -- `Evacuation Will Take </F> Several Days,' Says Delcroix"]    [Text] Brussels, 11 Apr (BELGA) -- "I hope that the  evacuation of Belgian nationals in Rwanda will be completed in  three or four days," Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix  stated on Monday morning [11 April]. "The timing of the  operation, known as Silver Back, depends however on local  security conditions," he added on BRTN [Dutch-language Belgian  Radio and Television] radio.    The minister also confirmed that the first plane bringing  Belgians home from Kigali is expected in Melsbroek during the  night of Monday to Tuesday. This plane is due to leave the  Rwandan capital at around 1000 GMT on Monday, traveling first to  Nairobi (Kenya) and arriving in Belgium during the night (at  around 2300 GMT, according to a Sabena spokesman -- editor's  note).    Priority is now being given to the evacuation of Belgians  living in the interior of the country. Belgian paratroopers aim  to assemble the Belgian nationals at Kigali airport throughout  Monday, and possibly Tuesday. Belgians living in the capital  have already assembled.    The minister also pointed out that the Belgian blue helmets  have been charged with taking part in the evacuation operation.    Finally, he confirmed that both civil and military  cooperation with Rwanda would probably be reviewed after the  evacuation. He added that this question will be on the agenda  of the government and Parliament in the coming weeks.</p>

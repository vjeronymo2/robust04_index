			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Arts: New series freshen up the summer - Television High summer, and the heat coming off the London pavements is phenomenal. In years past this would have been a signal to the television critic to open the garden doors, half close the curtains, and settle back on the old green sofa to watch hours of sport, hymning the beauty of blue skies and green pitches in the coverage of cricket at Lord's, extolling the excitement of Channel 4's daily reports from the Tour de France, and enthusing over the BBC's expertise at Wimbledon and the British Grand Prix. Not this year, though. Whatever the reason - fiercer competition perhaps, or shame at the avalanche of repeats in summers gone by - the broadcasters have been launching almost as many new series as in an autumn season. It would, anyway, have been hard to sustain the enthusiasm for summer sport programmes now that dear old Johnners has gone from the cricket commentary box, Dan Maskell and Harry Carpenter from Wimbledon and, above all, James Hunt from the motor racing circuits. The sense of loss left by Johnners, Maskell and Carpenter was foreseeable, but the vacuum created by Hunt's death is a bit of a surprise. There is nothing wrong with his successor, Jonathan Palmer, who seems highly professional. But Hunt provided such a telling counterpoint to Murray Walker's high pitched scream. In the old days you would see a ghastly crash with smoke and flames and wheels hurtling off the track and Hunt would drawl 'Bit of a shunt there. Charlie Farnsbarns must have missed his heel-toe racing change' or some such technical insight. Hunt would have been in his element analysing Damon Hill's winning drive at Silverstone on Sunday and is much missed. But what of the new series? Monday brings two. All Night Long on BBC1 is a sitcom set in an all-night bakery, staffed by life's flotsam and jetsam. There is a kissogram girl who is periodically called out ('Time and a half for whip work'), a novelist in a wheelchair, the shortest man who ever worked for British Rail, Wally the cab driver, and a Romanian termagant named Wanda. The pudding may be a little over egged, but opening episodes are notoriously difficult and there were more laughs than in most recent comedies. Room 101 on BBC2, hijacked (like so much that is good on television) from radio, is a counterpart to 'Desert Island Discs'. Here the guests nominate their pet hates and, human nature being what it is, hearing what people detest can be a lot more entertaining than hearing what they like. Guest number one was Bob Monkhouse, a man revitalised by a couple of impressive recent television performances. He did the host of Room 101, Nick Hancock, proud, choosing splendid hate objects such as the French, Cilla Black's singing, and two television series which Monkhouse himself has presented. The drawback is that Hancock is determined to make the host as important as the guest and, for no good reason, rejects most of the guest's choices. There are two more new series on Tuesday, both on BBC2. We have, of course, seen cook Keith Floyd on screen before, but Floyd On Italy is new. He is now driving a gold Aston Martin and being very tetchy with his new film crew. Perhaps the weather, clearly atrocious, is to blame. You have to admire a man who will set up a picnic table in an ancient market square and cook for the cameras on a camping stove while a Wagnerian thunderstorm thrashes around him. However, while past programmes suggested Floyd has a good grasp of French and English cookery, he seems much less at home with Italian food and Italian habits. Heretic which looks at 'unorthodox' scientists began well with Jacques Benveniste, whose research suggested that homeopathic theory was right and that water had some sort of 'memory', or could work like recording tape. The sequence showing the editor of the famous British scientific journal Nature visiting Benveniste's lab with a team of 'fraud busters', led by a conjuror, was eye opening and saddening. Science may have moved on since Galileo but the small mindedness of the doctrinaire seems to go on forever. A valuable series. It is the BBC once again which brings us two new series on Thursdays. The Imaginatively Titled Punt And Dennis Show (oh dear) is a half-hour comedy sketch programme which opens, ill advisedly, with a front-of-tabs sequence that seems to be modelled on Morecambe and Wise. Smith and Jones tried it and never really pulled it off, and the efforts of Steve Punt (the smaller of the pair and uncannily like Eric Idle) and Hugh Dennis do not look much more promising. It painlessly passes half an hour, but if this is the best that a major channel can offer in peak time then comedy is, indeed, in a trough. The surprise series is State Of The Ark on BBC2. These days we have enough natural history series to sink an ark (which, according to Richard Digance on ITV on Sunday was not at all what God told Noah to build: the idea was actually to make a park for the animals, but being 600 years old and hard of hearing Noah missed the 'p') yet this is rather different. Episode 1 showed pictures of the ill treatment of animals in zoos which were enough to enrage the most cynical of viewers. Episode 2 showed model zoos whose owners had utterly different beliefs about their purpose: that they should concentrate on the human onlooker; that they should concentrate on re-stocking the wild, and so on. Excellent so far. On Friday, ITV finally contributes a new series. Freddie Starr looks like some ancient demo tape which might have been studied by Benny Hill at the start of his career. Starr is keen on sight gags: the unobserved petrol nozzle which fills up an entire car, the girl whose dress is sucked off by a vacuum cleaner to reveal black underwear, the clockmaker who reads The Times. He croons 1950s songs in tribute to Elvis Presley, and last week managed to get guest Frank Bruno into a kilt . . . albeit over his trousers. It is deeply traditional and unsophisticated stuff, but then so is Britain's favourite form of theatre: the pantomime. The quality of these new series varies; much is below what we might expect from new series in the autumn season. But having complained for years about summertime repeats we ought, surely, to acknowledge that the broadcasters (or the BBC, anyway) have at last responded. Two cheers: hip hip . . .</p>

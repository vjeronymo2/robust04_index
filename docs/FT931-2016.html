			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (24): Looking to the next century - Research: future systems will feature full motion video, graphics, sound and voice recognition, virtual reality, text and data processing - with a global communications capability THE COMPUTING and telecommunications industries are combining with a third sector, consumer electronics, to spend billions of dollars a year in research and development, creating a worldwide web of instant infotainment for the next century. Infotainment systems 20 years from now will combine multimedia facilities far superior to today's primitive devices - featuring full motion video, graphics, sound and voice recognition, virtual reality, text and data processing - with a global communications capability based largely on fibre optics. Miniature models will be wristwatch video-diary-communicators, linked into the network by radio. Until now, domestic consumers have had virtually no influence on the technical development of computing and relatively little on telecommunications, compared to business users. So the new participation of consumer electronics companies, particularly the Japanese giants such as Sony and Matsushita, in information technology represents a fundamental change that could turn out to be as important as the convergence of computing and communications. During the 1980s, when sales of personal computers into American homes were disappointing, Apple gave priority to its commercial customers, in R&amp;D as well as marketing. Now John Sculley, Apple's chairman, is redirecting the company's Californian research centre to prepare for what he predicts will be a Dollars 3,000bn combined global market in consumer electronics, computing and communications by the year 2000. Even executives of IBM, the archetypal business-oriented corporation, are now talking enthusiastically about the coming consumer market. IBM's personal computer laboratories in Florida are racing to develop a Personal Digital Assistant. PDAs (alternatively known as PICs - Personal Intelligent Communicators) are often seen as forerunners of the convergence of the three Cs. Apple's forthcoming Newton is the best publicised example so far. This year the first PDAs will be launched - hand-held mobile devices capable of simple data communications as well as voice telephony and fax. They will include an electronic diary and address book. The user 'writes' information into a PDA with an electronic pen, instead of a miniature keyboard. The three-way convergence is made possible, of course, by the rapid advance of technology in computing, communications and electronics. But the pace of progress is far from even. On the whole, hardware is developing more quickly than the software required to control and make use of it. As Peter Cochrane, head of systems research at BT Laboratories in the UK, puts it, 'the biggest single problem with software science and engineering is the almost total lack of any science and engineering.' There are no fundamental principles underlying software development, comparable to the laws of science and mathematics that hardware designers can follow. The consequence is that hugely complicated software is required to achieve relatively simple tasks. Cochrane points out that the line code for a simple telephone switchboard today runs to about one kilometre of paper  - more than twice as long as the complete works of Shakespeare. Software is therefore becoming less and less reliable (as the increasing frequency of telecom network failures shows) while hardware becomes more reliable. Even within the general area of hardware, some technologies are moving much faster than others. A serious constraint on the development of mobile communicators is the failure to improve significantly the energy storage capacity of batteries. Display screens are advancing faster than batteries but they also represent a frustrating bottleneck. The mainstream computer technologies are making spectacular progress, though data storage capacity and ease of access are not advancing quite as fast as processing power. But perhaps the greatest leap forward of all over the past decade or so has been in bandwidth - the carrying capacity of communications channels - as optical fibres replace copper cables. Recent discoveries in opto-electronics make it possible to transmit information equivalent to billions of telephone conversations in light pulses down a single glass strand as thin as a human hair. In contrast, the twisted pairs of copper wires that still connect most of the world's telephone subscribers to the network cannot carry much more than one conversation. They are incapable of transmitting full-motion video, however cleverly the information content of the pictures is 'compressed.' Telecoms companies in industrialised countries are rapidly replacing their trunk cables with fibre but it will be many years before all individual subscribers are linked in. Then, at last, everyone will be able to abandon what Cochrane calls our 'copper mind sets' and make imaginative use of instant infotainment. The dominant flavour of convergence research is inevitably Japanese-American, though European companies are playing important subsidiary roles, such as Philips in multimedia and GEC in videoconferencing. The US telecoms giant AT&amp;T - resurgent commercially and scientifically in the 1990s after a disappointing patch in the 1980s - is emerging as one of the most important players. It spends Dollars 3.2bn a year on R&amp;D at its world-famous Bell Labs, based in New Jersey, and turns out patented inventions at a rate of more than one a day, focusing on micro-electronics, photonics (light-based communications and computing) and software. AT&amp;T's strong technical position has been strengthened by recent mergers, particularly the take-over of NCR in 1991. The company is a leader in the PDA movement through its stake in EO Inc, a Californian start-up company also backed by Mitsubishi of Japan. The EO Personal Communicator uses a processor chip designed by AT&amp;T, called the Hobbit, which will be incorporated in similar products from NEC and Toshiba. As the EO-Hobbit alliances show, the technical development of infotainment is underpinned by a growing web of international collaboration, involving corporate giants and innovative start-ups. Not even the strongest companies like AT&amp;T and IBM can cover convergence with their own R&amp;D resources.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Reduced interest income leaves Cape 9% lower REDUCED interest income depressed profits at Cape, the building products and industrial services company, by 9 per cent to Pounds 6.52m for the first half. At the operating level, Cape returned virtually flat profits of Pounds 6.39m (Pounds 6.37m). However, a Pounds 665,000 drop in interest gains to Pounds 131,000 left the pre-tax line Pounds 650,000 lower on sales 31 per cent ahead to Pounds 128m. Mr Keith Jackson, finance director, said profits had been bolstered by strong growth in the industrial division, which offset a decline in building services. Industrial operating profits were 36 per cent ahead to Pounds 4.1m, enhanced by the inclusion for a full six months of the Cleton Insulation business in the Netherlands. Since being purchased for Pounds 4.4m in July last year it had 'performed extremely well,' Mr Jackson said. However, growth in the industrial services activities - which supply insulation and scaffolding to the power and petrochemical industries - was beginning to flatten out. On the building and architectural products side, operating profits fell 24 per cent to Pounds 3.2m on turnover just 5 per cent down at Pounds 35.5m. Mr Jackson said there was no sign of an improvement in this division, particularly in the UK. Cape continued to reduce its dependence on the recession-hit UK, with overseas sales amounting to some 44 per cent of group turnover, against 32 per cent last time. Since the previous year, two industrial services companies had been purchased for a total of about Pounds 2m - one in the UK and the other in Germany. This, along with increased capital expenditure for the year of Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 7.5m), was partly behind the decline in cash balances from Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 6.9m. Mr Jackson said at least one further bolt-on acquisition was planned before the end of the financial year. The dividend was maintained at 3p, on earnings per share down from 9.3p to 8.2p.</p>

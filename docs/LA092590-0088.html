			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN SMOKER DEATH CASE, FAMILY WINS BUT GETS NO AWARD  </P> <P> In a stunning verdict Monday night, a jury here found American Tobacco Co.  liable for the lung cancer death of a longtime smoker but awarded zero damages  to his family.  </P> <P> The decision, seen as a victory for the tobacco industry in its fight to  discourage smoker death lawsuits, shocked the lawyers, Wall Street consultants  and reporters who packed the courtroom in the 150-year-old courthouse.  </P> <P> The jury deliberated 5 1/2 hours before rendering its verdict on the wrongful  death claim brought by the family of Nathan H. Horton, a carpenter and  contractor who died in 1987 at age 50 after smoking American's Pall Mall brand  for more than 30 years.  </P> <P> "It's sort of a baffling decision," said a litigation consultant for a Wall  Street investment firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It sounds like  it's continuing to protect the industry."  </P> <P> Immediately after the verdict was read by Circuit Judge Eugene Bogen, lawyers  for American Tobacco asked him to "reform" the verdict, contending that since  no damages were due to plaintiffs, judgment should be entered for the tobacco  company.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the Hortons, who had been seeking punitive damages of $15 million,  moved for Bogen to award at least nominal damages or to set a new trial on the  issue of damages alone.  </P> <P> Bogen said he would take both motions under advisement and left the courtroom  without further comment.  </P> <P> The verdict came just before 7 p.m. on a 9-3 vote. It was uncertain whether the  three dissenters had favored a clear judgment for American or a damage award  for the Hortons.  </P> <P> Reached at home Monday night, jury foreman David G. Roach said the verdict was  a compromise between jurors who were about evenly split between plaintiffs and  defendants. "It was a very high likelihood of a hung jury," said Roach, 41,  deputy director of computing and information systems at the University of  Mississippi. "This was a verdict that nine out of 12 could accept."  </P> <P> The outcome could prove discouraging to plaintiffs' lawyers since it shows they  must contend not only with the tobacco industry's high-powered legal defense  but with the hostility of jurors toward smokers who ignore health warnings yet  seek damages for smoking-related disease.  </P> <P> Kurt Feuerman, a tobacco analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Monday night  called the verdict "very positive" for the industry "because it basically  confirms the industry's long-term record" of defeating smoker death claims.  </P> <P> Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University in Boston and  chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, which encourages lawsuits  against tobacco companies, said: "The upside of this is that the tobacco  companies, even in the Deep South, even with six smokers on the jury, can't  come up with a verdict anymore. The downside is, we're still waiting for our  verdict."  </P> <P> The number of smoker death claims against the industry has dwindled from about  120 two years ago to about 55 today.  </P> <P> The jury of eight women and four men included six smokers, of whom five  reportedly stated on jury questionnaires that they could kick the habit if they  tried. That was seen as a negative for plaintiffs, who said Horton had tried  but was unable to quit smoking.  </P> <P> Monday's verdict actually makes it three trials out of the last five that the  industry failed to win. Still, the tobacco companies' 35-year record of never  paying a nickel to a customer who contracted smoking-related disease remains  intact.  </P> <P> In June, 1988, a federal jury in Newark, N.J., awarded $400,000 damages in a  smoker death case, but the verdict was overturned on appeal last January and a  new trial is pending.  </P> <P> In January, 1988, the first Horton trial ended in a hung jury when bitterly  divided jurors, split 7-5 in American's favor, refused to continue deliberating  with each other.  </P> <P> Lawyers for American declined comment after the verdict in the retrial Monday.  </P> <P> Horton attorney Don Barrett, obviously disappointed, said: "The longest journey  must begin with a single step. That's all I have to say."  </P></p>

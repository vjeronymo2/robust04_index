			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Nymex chairman named by CFTC Mr Lou Guttman, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, and his former partner, Mr Harold Magid, were named yesterday in an administrative complaint by the enforcement division of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. The charges are associated with allegedly pre-arranged sugar options trades made on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in 1989. Mr Guttman stepped down from Nymex chairmanship in July when the CFTC notified him civil charges were pending. When no action had been taken by December, he resumed his post. He is campaigning for a third term.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Strike called in Uttar Pradesh The north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh was braced yesterday for a general strike called by the state government amid growing inter-caste violence and political turmoil. Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, the state's chief minister, rejected a call from Premier P V Narasimha Rao to cancel the strike for fear it might provoke violent demonstrations. Mr Yadav, who came to power last autumn at the head of a lower-caste alliance of parties, is the first politician to rule Uttar Pradesh in the name of the lower castes. His avowed policy is to promote their interests at the expense of the upper castes. His intentions are important because Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, is regarded as the cradle of Indian politics. Success for caste-based politics there could threaten other states' stability. The Uttar Pradesh crisis has come from Mr Yadav's efforts to implement job reservation policy. Under Indian law, up to 50 per cent of public-sector jobs and places at many colleges must be reserved for lower castes. But the law has rarely been fully implemented. Mr Yadav's attempt to hasten this has caused widespread unrest in northern Uttar Pradesh, where 74 per cent of the population is upper caste. In the last month, about 10 people, including one senior police officer. have been killed in violent demonstrations. Yesterday, crowds burnt vehicles in the hill town of Dehra Dun. Mr Yadav's government last night was verging on collapse. The ruling alliance of the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party commands only 198 of 425 state assembly seats, and has been ruling with the support of 32 Congress(I) members who joined Mr Yadav to keep the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party out of power. But local Congress leaders have asked Mr Rao's permission to quit the coalition.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Securities dealer pleads guilty to misuse of funds AN AUTHORISED securities dealer misused clients' funds to prop up his business while pretending to carry out their instructions and issuing them with false contracts notes, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday. Mr Andrew Kimmins admitted two charges of fraudulent trading. They stated that between November 1986 and December 1988 he was knowingly party to the carrying on of the businesses of Blade Securities and Blade Investments, both of Brompton Road, London, with intent to defraud creditors. Another 23 charges were left on the court file. He will be sentenced later. The two companies have been wound up with combined debts of Pounds 2.9m. Mr James Curtis, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said Mr Kimmins had obtained Financial Services Act authorisation for Blade Investments from the Securities Association and the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers by making inaccurate declarations about Blade Investments' capital and funding. He had omitted the fact that it was assuming substantial debts of Blade Securities, which was insolvent. Blade Investments traded for eight months before being served with preventive orders by the regulatory bodies in December 1988. Mr Curtis said the prosecution accepted that Mr Kimmins had set up the business honestly and tried to run it as a genuine business venture. His business practices had, however, been inappropriate and unprofessional. By the end of 1986 Blade Securities was being run negligently. From mid 1987, when Mr Kimmins had been aware the position was worsening, he had become reckless in handling existing company obligations and incurring new ones. Mr Curtis said: 'In late 1987, when the position was irretrievable and both companies insolvent, Kimmins resorted to specific acts of misuse of clients' money or stockholdings, albeit for the purposes of the business.' The prosecution accepted this had been done in the hope of rescue. No rescue had come, though Mr Kimmins maintained that well into 1989 he had treated the rescue proposal as realistic and been led to believe that others did also. He had persisted in commercially unsatisfactory settlement practices, caused clients' holdings to become depleted and incurred heavy bank debts, Mr Curtis said. Instead of using clients' money to buy shares, he had applied it for other purposes, such as security for trading debts, while maintaining the pretence of having carried out clients' instructions. Late in 1988 he carried out a series of acts of fraudulent trading in relation to a Standard Chartered rights issue.</p>

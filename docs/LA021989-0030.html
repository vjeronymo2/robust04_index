			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'RAVENS VS. TORTOISES'  </P> <P> Thank you for the excellent editorial "Ravens Vs. Tortoises" (Jan. 23) on the  raven-control project initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S.  Bureau of Land Management, and the California Department of Fish and Game. As  the editorial indicates, the service believes that the numbers of ravens using  portions of desert tortoise habitat need to be reduced so that young tortoises  have an opportunity to reach adulthood.  </P> <P> You have also correctly noted that ravens are not the only problem facing the  desert tortoise, indicating that control of off-road vehicle use would also  benefit the species. However, more than ravens and ATCs need to be controlled.  In addition to numerous housing developments being constructed in the  Palmdale-Rosamond portion of the tortoise's range, loss of habitat has occurred  through the development of solar energy plants, utility lines, sheep and cattle  grazing, and mining activities. Projects that my staff are currently working on  include a low-level radiation waste disposal site and the expansion of the  Army's Fort Irwin National Training Center. These projects could destroy  hundreds of square miles of tortoise habitat.  </P> <P> I would also like to take this opportunity to correct one factual error in your  editorial. The service has not proposed the tortoise for listing. We are still  evaluating the need to list the species.  </P> <P> In response to a petition to list the tortoise from the Desert Tortoise Council  in 1984, the service issued a finding that listing of the species was  warranted, but precluded by other listing proposals of higher priority. In  other words, personnel and funding limitations have not permitted us to develop  a listing for the tortoise. These findings must be updated annually. The  priority for listing the tortoise becomes higher as a decline in tortoise  numbers and habitat continues.  </P> <P> The fact that the California Fish and Game Commission has recently voted  against providing protection to the desert tortoise by making it a listed  threatened species is not viewed as a positive step in interagency cooperation  to save the tortoise. In fact, the vote only increases the pressure on the  federal agencies, the BLM and the Fish and Wildlife Service, to demonstrate  that protection, not just planning, is being accomplished for the tortoise.  </P> <P> NANCY M.

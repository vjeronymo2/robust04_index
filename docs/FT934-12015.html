			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Visa head quits as banks urge leadership change MR Charles Russell, head of the Visa International payments organisation for nearly a decade, was dethroned yesterday after a quiet coup by some of the world's biggest card issuers. Mr Russell, 63, helped cement Visa's position as the world's biggest payment-card brand name, taking the number of Visa cards around the world to 318m by the end of June. More than Dollars 500bn was billed on Visa cards in the 12 months to June, compared with Dollars 4bn in 1984, when Mr Russell took the top job. But some of the biggest US banks had become impatient for new leadership at the payment group. 'It's a big bureaucracy: they don't manage with an eye on the bottom line,' said one Visa issuer. Another added that Mr Russell had said many times in recent months he intended to retire, but had shown little sign of actually doing so. Mr Russell will be replaced as president and chief executive at the start of next year by Mr Edmund Jensen, chief operating officer of Oregon-based US Bancorp. The appointment of an outsider brings new blood to the senior management, one bank said. The Visa board has agreed Mr Russell will stay with the company to work on strategic issues until the company's annual general meeting next June. Mr Russell's departure is the latest high-level change at the San Francisco-based payment group, which is owned by more than 18,000 banks. In August, Mr Carl Pascarella - a protege of Mr Russell - was brought in to head the US card business in preference to Mr Robert Heller. Visa denied that the decision over the timing of Mr Russell's retirement had been taken out of his hands. 'Chuck has had an extremely good relationship with the board,' the company said.</p>

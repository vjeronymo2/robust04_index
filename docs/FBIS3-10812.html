			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sonia Rodriguez from "The Midday Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Commenting on the surrender today of Julio Fabio  Urdinola Grajales, a man described by Colombian and U.S.  intelligence corps as a prominent figure in the Cali Cartel,  Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said it did not involve any  concessions or special negotiations.    [Begin de Greiff recording] [Word indistinct] this man's  surrender. He came forth and said he surrendered. The Attorney  General's Office participated in this process, which is  appropriate and in accordance with the law. Urdinola said he  wanted to surrender, and the processes involved in the  Prosecutor General's charges against him will continue. In his  confession, Urdinola said he will calmly and seriously follow  legal procedures without anything unusual, as it must be in a  civilized society. [end recording]    Urdinola Grajales is facing three charges within the  Colombian legal system. Prosecutor de Greiff explained:    [Begin recording] [de Greiff] Drug trafficking, illegal  enrichment, and conspiracy.    [Rodriguez] With the surrender of Urdinola Grajales, do you  expect Cali Cartel members to surrender en masse? Who is Jesus  Ancizar Porras, who also surrendered today?    [De Greiff] I have no idea. Nor do I have any idea if Mr.  Urdinola belongs to a cartel. That is part of the  investigation. General Octavio Vargas, director of the National  Police, told me that Mr. Urdinola was accompanied by a man named  Jesus Ancizar Porras. My office has no information regarding  the latter's activities; that is, illegal activities. The  prosecutor handling the case may provide you with more  information, but with the restraint the case warrants.    [Rodriguez] Recently there have been many contradictory  views  about the way you are implementing the surrender policy [five-  second break in reception] how do you feel about it?    [De Greiff] The country must remember that I do not have  sovereign power to implement those provisions because they are  dictated by law. The accord was approved by judges and the  National Court.    [Rodriguez] Do you know if the government assured Urdinola  he  will remain in Palmira Prison?    [De Greiff] As far as I know -- of course this has just  happened -- there was no agreement or conditions for the  surrender of those men.    [Rodriguez] Do you think this surrender will end the  opposing  views that have been expressed recently in the government?    [De Greiff] I think we must set aside the hysteria of this  past week on differences between the government and the  Prosecutor General's Office and continue ahead with a policy  that can -- and I stress can -- be successful.    [Rodriguez] Why do you think the government is not allowing  Pablo Escobar's five bodyguards to be moved to Itagui Prison?    [De Greiff] What do I think about it? I do not think the  problem of guarding 25, 25 [repeats himself] criminals or less  is something that cannot be controlled and solved. We would be  extremely inefficient [words indistinct] if we could not control  25 criminals. [end recording]    Regarding the counts of drug trafficking, illegal  enrichment,  and conspiracy Urdinola is facing, I must tell you that a few  days ago the U.S. Justice Department forwarded evidence against  Urdinola and (Hernado Angel Garnet) to the Deputy Prosecutor's  Office.</p>

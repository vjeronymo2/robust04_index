			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): The week investors scented freedom - London Markets NEW ERAS are the stock in trade of equity analysts and newspaper columnists. New dawns, crucial turning points, decisive breaks with history - they rest, shiny and inviting, on the well-stocked shelves of the Cliche Department. To have one new era in a 12-month period might seem enough, two surely excessive. Yet that is what we have been offered since last autumn. First, a new era of low inflation, low equity returns, and German-style investing patterns. Now, a second new dawn is promised, looking suspiciously like the dawn-before-last: falling interest rates, rising equities, and - ultimately  -inflation-eroded fixed income securities. The plausibility of this outlook is discussed by John Plender and other FT writers elsewhere in today's Financial Times. Whatever its merits, it had become a stock market article of faith by the end of Friday afternoon. The FT-SE index closed at 2567.0, up 83.1 points on the day, and up 196.1 on the week. From Wednesday's low point of 2,291.3, at the moment when the government first put up interest rates, it had risen 12 per cent. The completeness of the market's conversion to this view is borne out by the nature of the rally. You only have to run your eye down the list of sectors which did best on Thursday to get the measure of this particular new era: Contracting and construction up 12 per cent; Banks up 11 per cent; Metals and metal-forming up 10 per cent; Building materials up 9 1/2 per cent. These are the battered cyclical stocks, the worst sufferers from the recession of the past 2 1/2 years. The shares that did worst out of the day's 100-point rise in the FT-SE index are also familiar: electricity and water utilities, the defensive stalwarts of the recent past. The electricity sector fell by  1/2 per cent on Thursday, the water sector by 2 per cent. All self-respecting new eras must be born from the wreckage of the old. Traditionally, this process used to take several decades, giving plenty of time for fin-de-siecle musings and lavish quotations from that Yeats poem about things falling apart, centres not holding, rough beasts slouching towards Bethlehem, and so on. The pace of modern life, however, has reduced the shelf-life of the new era to a matter of months; and technologists are now working on bite-sized new eras which can be consumed between meals. Although the collapse of the old era is now a swifter process, the scale of the wreckage has, if anything, increased. Consider the events of this week. On Sunday, the lira devalued. On Monday, there was a small cut in German interest rates. The pound edged up, the stock market rose 51 points. On Tuesday, both reversed course, with shares down 52 points. On Wednesday, with the pound on the edge of the abyss, interest rates went up first to 12 per cent, then to 15 per cent. Each time interest rates went up, the stock market dropped. But sterling was still falling, kept within its ERM band only by unprecedented central bank intervention. As that thought sank in, a vast electronic gale of laughter convulsed the stock market. You could see it sweep across the Topic screens: share after share turned blue, indicating that the price was rising. The old era had reached its accelerated moment of crisis: no-one now believed that the policy of pushing interest rates ever higher to defend the pound was sustainable. The damage that 12, then 15 per cent interest rates had done to equities was swiftly undone, and the market closed serenely up 8.3 points on the day. Given the scale of the drama, it was a remarkably unremarkable figure. The next two days' share trading saw the acceptance of the new dawn, by the government as it dropped out of the ERM and by investors generally. Shares moved upwards in heavy volume, suggesting that some serious buying was taking place. By the end of the week, with shorter-term interest rates indicating that the market was expecting something like a half-point cut in base rates in the not-too-distant future, the new era was in fall swing. City economists were calculating the impact of a low-interest-rate, cheap-currency policy; equity analysts were coming up with lists of shares that stood to do well out of an escape from the strait-jacket into which the government had clamped the economy for the past two years. From Bank to Edinburgh New Town, people were digging out graphs such asthe ones that illustrate this piece, which show that almost all recent devaluations have been followed by rising equity markets. Once new-era fever strikes, history is bunk, historical statistics little better. Thus, the figures reported this week, depressing though they were, had little impact on the market's thinking. They illustrate the cage from which investors now hope to break free: rising unemployment - up in August to a five-year record of 2.8m, with a 47,000 rise on the month - together with flat order books and a stagnant money supply. Two striking corporate events of the week were, arguably, relics of the old era. One of them dated from the era-before-last: a profits warning from Body Shop, the last of the high-performing niche retailers that had provided so much excitement in the pre-recession era. Anita and Gordon Roddick, who run the company, announced that pre-tax interim profits would fall from Pounds 9m to 'not less than Pounds 8m'. The suggestion that the company's spectacular growth might be slackening sent its shares down 41 per cent on the day, and they closed the week at 181p, down 85p. The other event was an echo of all that single-market euphoria of the past couple of years. (Indeed, in some respects it was a reversion to a pre-war concept: the Anglo-Dutch cross border merger.) Reed International, once a newspaper and newsprint group but now a magazine and business publisher, announced that it was merging with Elsevier, which publishes scientific journals and Dutch newspapers. The market had no doubt whose shareholders were getting the better of the deal. Reed shares rose sharply, ending the week at 541p, up 55p from the moment of the announcement, Elsevier's closed at Fl 102, down 12 per cent. Corporate news could scarcely grab the attention, however, when there were grand strategies to be drawn. After all, this week's new era might itself be outdated by the time the markets opened on Monday, depending on the outcome of the French referendum. For City analysts and newspaper columnists, there is much more scope for astonishing insights. As usual, however, WB Yeats had the last word. In that very same poem that everyone quotes, obviously reflecting on a bruising experience with the Dublin traded options market, he gave his considered verdict on the trade of financial analyst. 'The best lack all conviction,' he mourned, 'while the worst//Are full of passionate intensity.' And now they're on television, too . . .</p>

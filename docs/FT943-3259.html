			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Nintendo alleges Taiwan piracy Nintendo of America, the US arm of the Japanese video game manufacturer, has filed a suit in California against Taiwan's largest semiconductor manufacturer, alleging counterfeiting of proprietary video game chips. The suit against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) of Hsin-Chu, Taiwan and its US subsidiary seeks damages and an injunction to prevent future US sales. An estimated 61 per cent of TSMC's worldwide sales are in the US, according to Nintendo. 'Our investigation discovered counterfeit chips manufactured by TSMC contained in illegal Nintendo video game products in at least nine countries across three continents,' said Ms Lynn Hvalsoe, Nintendo's general counsel. 'The discovery of these counterfeit chips clearly demonstrates that Taiwan remains a worldwide centre for video game counterfeiting, despite its government's repeated pledges to halt the manufacture and sale of these illegal products.' Mr Donald Brooks, TSMC's president, said the company was 'shocked and disappointed' at the allegations. 'We're a foundry, which means we manufacture integrated circuits for other companies based on designs which they provide us,' he said last night. 'If there's been an infringement of intellectual property rights, we're not aware of it.' TSMC had not been contacted by Nintendo, he said. Nintendo said it had discovered counterfeit semiconductor chips in illegal copies of its Super Nintendo and Super Famicom home video game machines being sold in Colombia, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In addition, counterfeit video game software and security chips allegedly manufactured by TSMC were found in games being sold in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Nintendo said it had asked the US government to request Taiwan closely to scrutinise TSMC's exports to prevent the export of semiconductor chips that infringe on Nintendo's intellectual property rights.</p>

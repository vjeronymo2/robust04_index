			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR: LORENZO'S OUSTER A START FOR STRIKERS  </P> <P> There just might be some justice soon for the thousands of Eastern Airlines  workers fighting a long, discouraging battle against the company's recently  ousted chairman, the combative Frank Lorenzo.  </P> <P> Talks are under way to negotiate new union contracts and restructure Eastern,  either through a merger with another airline or a buyout by private investors,  with participation by the employees.  </P> <P> The workers' struggle against Lorenzo's efforts to break their unions and force  them to make even more financial sacrifices has achieved only two goals,  neither of which materially helped them:  </P> <P> * Their strike was a critical factor in a federal judge's decision to remove  Lorenzo as Eastern's chairman, although the direct cause was pressure that was  finally applied by the company's creditors and shareholders.  </P> <P> His departure should help workers in the rest of the industry because it means  that no longer will other airlines point to Lorenzo's devastating cuts in the  wages and benefits of his employees as an excuse for trimming their own labor  costs.  </P> <P> * The court's action also brought some emotional satisfaction to the strikers  and their allies since the court finally agreed with them that, as Bankruptcy  Court Judge Burton R. Lifland put it: "Eastern's owner/manager as personified  by (Lorenzo) is not competent to reorganize this estate."  </P> <P> There was a nice bit of irony when Lorenzo, who hired thousands of new  employees to replace strikers, was finally himself replaced as Eastern's  chairman on April 19 by Lifland.  </P> <P> Until then, Lifland's rulings in Eastern's bankruptcy case had consistently  helped Lorenzo hang on as chairman despite whopping losses of $1.2 billion  suffered just since the carrier filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago.  </P> <P> Equally surprising was Lifland's choice of Martin Shugrue as trustee to run  Eastern. Only last year, Shugrue, who believes in a cooperative approach to  labor relations, was unceremoniously dumped by Lorenzo as president of  Continental Airlines, which, like Eastern, is owned by Lorenzo's Texas Air.  </P> <P> Now, intriguing private talks have started that might give the strikers and  their allies more than a Pyrrhic victory. There is an outside chance that the  behind-the-scenes maneuvers will restore many of their jobs even though Lorenzo  "permanently replaced" them with strikebreakers.  </P> <P> One possibility being explored is to keep Eastern flying as an independent  airline through a buyout made by a combination of employees and one or more  outside investors who have indicated renewed interest in the idea since the  court action.  </P> <P> A key ingredient in that approach involves new union contracts that Shugrue  says he wants to negotiate. Contract negotiations between the unions and  Shugrue are beginning this week, and everyone involved in those talks insists  that they want agreements based on compromises Lorenzo refused to make.  </P> <P> An alternative once again being actively explored is an Eastern merger with  another carrier, perhaps Northwest Airlines, which would hire many of Eastern's  displaced union employees -- not the strikebreakers -- to operate Eastern's  part of the merged company.  </P> <P> Lorenzo's ouster at Eastern could be the least of his troubles. At risk is his  entire airline empire because his Texas Air, the parent company, may be forced  to assume financial responsibility for losses suffered by Eastern under his  leadership.  </P> <P> For starters, Eastern's creditors, its unions and Shugrue himself may take  court action to try to make Texas Air pay up to $400 million that the  bankruptcy examiner said Lorenzo may have illegally siphoned from Eastern.  </P> <P> Shortly before the court's ax fell on Lorenzo, David Shapiro, the examiner,  concluded that the airline executive might justifiably be charged with looting  Eastern of both money and assets.  </P> <P> Such a loss could be a major blow to Lorenzo because it could force his already  ailing Texas Air into bankruptcy if it had to repay Eastern for losses suffered  by the alleged looting.  </P> <P> And then there is the giant problem of Eastern's pension plan that has more  than $1 billion in unfunded liabilities that are guaranteed by Texas Air. If  Eastern goes under, the federal Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. says it will go  after Texas Air to make the costly guarantee good.  </P> <P> For Lorenzo, the troubles stemming from the battle he started with Eastern's  workers are far from over. But neither will the workers have an easy time  regaining what they have lost.  </P> <P> For one thing, to negotiate new contracts with Shugrue, they must find a way to  deal with Lorenzo's strikebreakers.  </P> <P> For instance, worried that Shugrue might negotiate a new contract with the Air  Line Pilots Assn., a group of strikebreaking pilots have formed the Eastern  Pilots Assn. as an instrument to eliminate ALPA, which has represented the  company's pilots for more than 45 years.  </P> <P> That battle between pilots could last for months, and even if the pilots who  went on strike win, the fight won't help restore much needed public confidence  in Eastern's reliability.  </P> <P> The International Assn. of Machinists, the only union still officially on  strike, will also have problems with strikebreakers, but its leaders believe  that they can get a contract agreement with Shugrue.  </P> <P> The courts have held that workers, although free to strike, can be permanently  replaced -- as though the difference between being fired or being permanently  replaced has any meaning to workers who are put out of their jobs because they  exercised their right to strike.  </P> <P> If Eastern's corporate structure problems can be resolved, and ways found to  undo the mischief done when Lorenzo hired those "permanent replacements,"  Eastern's workers may win their battle with Lorenzo, who epitomizes the  destructive confrontational approach to labor-management relations.  </P></p>

Did you know that on 5 February, Long Sopheap ordered  his henchmen to kill 23 soldiers who refused to enter the  battlefields around Anlung Veng. [passage omitted]    2. This barbarous killing shows that the Vietnamese  communists, their allies, and Vietnamese communist puppets are  very fascist and have always been fascist towards the people,  their troops, and the Para soldiers.    3. For this reason, for your own survival and in order to  protect your parents, you should turn your guns at and shoot  Long Sopheap and his henchmen.    You know well that Long Sopheap is not a Cambodian. He is a  Vietnamese. He has forcibly recruited many people's sons to  fight and die in his place. Moreover, Long Sopheap is very  fascist and cruel. He shot dead several hundred of the soldiers  of the two-headed government on the battlefields. [passage  omitted]</p>

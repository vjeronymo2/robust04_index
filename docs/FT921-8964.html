			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa touches 6-month lows COCOA PRICES touched six-month lows in both London and New York yesterday. The London May contract closed at Pounds 694 a tonne, down Pounds 8 on the day and Pounds 14 on the week. The market's continuing decline (last week May fell Pounds 48) has taken traders by surprise. Prices had been expected to advance on forecasts of the first production deficit for eight years. However, arrivals at ports in the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, have continued to be higher than expected. In addition, market talk suggests that manufacturers are selling nearby positions to force prices down ahead of West African price fixing for the 1992-93 season. Under an IMF agreement the Ivory Coast has to sell two-thirds of next year's crop before summer. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, said large numbers of speculative and fund 'longs' who were anticipating a price rise had been forced out of the market, further increasing the downward pressure. This week's meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation's working party on a new agreement finishes today but little progress is expected. The ICCO Council meets next week, but the market is likely largely to ignore the proceedings. 'The most important decision taken at one these meetings now is to fix the date of the next meeting,' said one observer.</p>

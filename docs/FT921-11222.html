			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Books: Rich mosaic of wartime memories WRITERS ON WORLD WAR II: AN ANTHOLOGY edited by Mordecai Richler Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18.99, 727 pages THE ESSENTIAL experience of the first world war was epitomised in comparatively few books, by writers who were also soldiers - prose-books by Edmund Blunden, Robert Graves, Guy Chapman, Frederic Manning, David Jones, poetry by Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Isaac Rosenberg among others. A good anthology like (say) Ian Parsons' Men Who March Away, even though restricted to poetry, sums up what it felt like to have fought in that war. With the second world war, the job of putting within the covers of a single book a selection that can stand for the war-experience as a whole seems like an impossible task. Yet this is what the Canadian novelist Mordecai Richler has just done and he has included writing relating to the period between 1939 to 1945 by poets, novelists and journalists from anywhere and everywhere. Some of the extracts were penned while the crucial events of the war were actually unfolding, like the American war correspondent William L. Shirer's account, from his Berlin Diary, of the impact in Germany of Hitler's invasion of Poland. Other pieces, like the poet George Macbeth's description of how as a small boy he woke up on the cellar floor with his hair full of grit after the family home had been destroyed in 1940 by blast from an air-raid, were set down as recently as 1989. Richler's aim was to make a mosaic. It is in the event a wonderfully rich mosaic but one from which no single pattern or overall impression emerges. There is only the feeling throughout that war concentrates the mind wonderfully and causes people to write well, that war encourages heroism and brutality, self-sacrifice and sadism, in equal measure. We begin on the first of September, 1939 with Auden sitting, 'in one of the dives/ On Fifty-second Street/ Uncertain and afraid/ as the clever hopes expire/ Of a low dishonest decade.' We conclude on the second of September 1945 with General MacArthur aboard the battleship Missouri flanked by Admirals Nimitz and Halsey, greeting Yoshijiro Umezu, chief of Japan's imperial general staff and his naval operations officer, as they climb aboard to sign the document of capitulation. William Manchester, author of that extract, served with the US Marines during the war. Earlier in the book, in the 1942 section, he gives an equally vivid account of his training period at the 'boot' (recruit) camp on Parris Island, South Carolina. The process of indoctrination - he confesses he loved it - included such joys as getting concussed on the forehead by a rifle-butt. This eloquent piece is mirrored on the other side of the Atlantic in J. Maclaren-Ross's recollection of the Infantry Training Camp at Blandford, Essex. During his time there Private Ross J observed a demonstration of the strength of a tin-helmet. A recruit was instructed to strike the corporal with the butt of his rifle as hard as he could on the head. Unfortunately under the impact of the blow a loose screw inside the helmet caused the poor corporal to slump instantly to the ground, spurting blood, followed by the recruit fainting in horror. The hazardous violence of training is as nothing beside the violence of the fighting and bombing and the cruelties of captivity and conquest with which the book is full - the fall of Singapore (JG Farrell); repercussions in Prague after Heydrich was assassinated (Joseph Skvorecky); Southern GIs from Kentucky taken prisoner in Manila (Studs Terkel); the Jewish Council rounding up boys to send to the labour camps after the annihilation of the Warsaw ghetto (Chaim Kaplan); aircrew in the New Hebrides making lethal sorties during the battle of Guadalcanal (James Michener) - and much, much more. As one extract follows another the degree of suffering meted out by the war changes in ferocity in the most arbitrary fashion. On the one hand there are heart-rending holocaust memories by Elie Weisel and Primo Levi, on the other the mood of irritation reflected in diary extracts by Noel Coward ('Dined at Ivy. Conversation with Bobbie Helpmann about how difficult it is to keep the Ballet going with people being called up all the time.') I was disappointed not to find some of my favourite descriptions of the war as it affected people in Britain. Plenty of Orwell and pieces from the obvious names, Pritchett, Connolly, Woolf, Bowen, Waugh, MacNeice and Dylan Thomas, but the fireman writers who described the blitz so well like Henry Green and William Sansom are notable for their absence. Lots from Richard Hillary, but nothing from Rattigan's Flare Path. But Richler says he assembled three times as much material as he had room for. And even when so much was discarded what remains is a big book in every sense, global in scope, and illuminating people's ability to make a truthful record of their experience after they have been stretched to the limits of their endurance.</p>

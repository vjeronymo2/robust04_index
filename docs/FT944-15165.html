			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: APV active APV, the food processing equipment group which took the market's breath away last month with a profits warning and a dividend cut, shed 1 1/2 to 72 1/2 p on 3.1m turnover following the resignation of Mr Clive Strowger, its chief executive. The shares, 138p earlier this year, are now just 1 1/2 above their 1994 low and on understandable tenterhooks ahead of the completion of an internal operating report due to be submitted to the management towards the end of next month. Household products group Paterson Zochonis tumbled 51 to 438p as the group warned that future profits would be hit by problems in Nigeria. Focus on the latest CBI survey of retail trades lay behind the moves of several stores stocks, with Boots, the chemists chain, turning around from being 5 up to show a net loss of 4 at 527p as it was reported that sales volume in the sector had fallen. But Lloyds Chemists was boosted by 8 to 321p as the company held presentations in London. At the other end of the scale, a boost in clothing and shoe sales lifted Sears 2 to 107 1/2 p. Bank shares attracted heavy interest throughout the session, with NatWest Securities promoting a bull story in the sector by upgrading its stance to outperform and recommending the 'lower rated domestic stocks' - National Westminster, TSB and Bank of Scotland - and shifting Abbey National from 'reduce' to 'hold'. NatWest bank ratings are at their lowest levels since the mid-1980s, the operating environment is improving and there is increasing scope for value to be passed to shareholders through increased dividends or share buy-backs. TSB was the best performer of the group, moving up 2 to 220p, while Bank of Scotland settled 3 off at 205p and NatWest 6 lower at 501p. Royal Bank of Scotland, up 6 at 431p, outpaced the rest of the banking sector and was one of the best performers in the FT-SE 100 after buy recommendations from Credit Lyonnais Laing, the bank's own broker, and UBS. HSBC rallied a penny to 717p after the bout of selling pressure induced by the recent weakness of the dollar. Dealers noted heavy switching from the Hong Kong-registered stock to the UK-registered stock, where the spread came in from around 22p to 5p, the narrowest margin for around six months. There were some hefty losses across the board in the 'recs', with the market reacting to suggestions that a big switch programme, involving big blocks of most of the 'recs', was about to be activated, with one big institution looking to move large sums into gilts. Property group Artesian Estates, part of the Business Expansion Scheme and introduced by broker Peel Hunt, closed at 71p in the first day of dealings. P&amp;0, which has had a strong run since the middle of last week, ran out of steam yesterday following a negative move by James Capel, which switched its stance from 'hold' to 'sell' and pushed the shares down 23 to 615p in 4.1m turnover. The stock now looks to be subject to a significant two-way pull, with UBS and Panmure Gordon known to favour P&amp;0, which with debt gearing roughly double the Footsie average is looked upon as an interest rate-sensitive play. British Aerospace, up 28 on Monday on speculation that GEC was teeing up a takeover bid, retreated 14 to 484p in spite of the fact that the marketplace continued to place some store in the rumour. GEC slipped 8 to 287p. BAe has made an agreed all-share offer worth 1335p for submarines group VSEL, a deal that has flushed out GEC has a declared potential counter-bidder. The feeling in the market is that GEC could comfortably leap-frog this situation and aim straight for BAe. VSEL eased 8 to 1315p. Europe's largest aircraft and passenger handling group, Servisair, held its ground on the first day of share trading in London. Sixty per cent of the shares were floated at 135p apiece by Securum, the Swedish asset management group. The stock began trading at a 3p premium and closed unchanged at 138p. Carlton Communications added 3 at 844p as Goldman Sachs published a note pointing out the short term value in the stock. Other statistics, Page 43</p>

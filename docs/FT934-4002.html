			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Chechens find life chilly outside the bear's embrace: 'Independence' has benefited few Chechnya, on Russia's southern fringes will be the only region to boycott next weekend's parliamentary elections. It is a gesture of defiance, which, according to one local newspaper, will mean it 'automatically falls out' of the Russian Federation. The region declared its independence in 1991, but has gone unrecognised. 'It is useless to try to intimidate us. We can be good friends but very bad enemies,' says Chechnya's leader, General Dzhokhar Dudayev, recalling Chechens' past as indomitable warriors until their conquest by imperial Russia in the last century. All that the region's defiance has achieved so far is a painful economic blockade by Moscow. Chechens have a history of grievances against Moscow, the most serious of which was the deportation in 1944 of most able-bodied men from their homeland to central Asia, by Stalin, for alleged collaboration with the Nazis. They were allowed to return home only 13 years later. But Chechnya's 1m inhabitants are now finding their enthusiasm for independence difficult to sustain when heating in many homes has been switched off, pensions and state sector salaries have remained unpaid for months, and crime is rife. Having been promised that independent Chechnya, with its oil wealth, would become a new Kuwait, they see that only a minority have got rich trading everything from stolen Mercedes 600s to oil products from Grozny's refineries. President Dudayev, a flamboyant mustachioed former Soviet air force commander, skirts around the problems, however. Claiming he has got things under control, he hastens to explain away the gunshot that rings out during an interview as 'a wedding'. He blames western and Russian pressure for the fact that not even 'brotherly Moslem states' such as Iraq and Turkey, have recognised his 'republic'. But Mr Hamzat Salaam, imam of Grozny's central mosque and one of the few opposition figures left in Grozny after the suppression of anti-government demonstrations this summer, dismisses both Mr Dudayev's threats and his talk of setting up an Islamic state. 'Nobody will go and fight. . . . our ancestors fought for their land and their religion. But what will people fight for today?' Although officially Sunni Moslems, most Chechens pay only lip-service to Islam, which was officially discouraged during seven decades of communism. What they do genuinely embrace is a fondness for weapons and a long-standing tradition of blood-vengeance - avenging a life for a life. Rather than any fears of Mr Dudayev declaring a holy war, the fact that so many Chechens now own weapons is enough to explain Russia's reluctance to use force to regain control of its 89th province. When Mr Yeltsin tried to crush the first stirrings of independence by declaring emergency rule over Chechnya two years ago, his order was rescinded two days later and all Russian troops were withdrawn from the area overnight. But if all else fails, a now more confident Moscow may be prepared to try military force once more. Gen Dudayev has been invited to join other Caucasian leaders for talks with Mr Yeltsin in Nalchik today, but is unlikely to attend. Meanwhile, aware of the dangers of sagging support at home, the Chechen authorities are trying to restore morale by 'activising' law enforcement and paying the pensions and salaries halted by Moscow's suspension of subsidies and cash deliveries. Colonel Saipudin Hassanov, the deputy interior minister, says that officials who sold off 'tens of thousands of tonnes' of state-owned oil for personal profit have been sacked. He also says police, who went unpaid for several months, now plan to tighten up on the proliferation of weapons. However, his assurances seem less convincing than those of a beady-eyed arms trader, who, toying with a Makarov pistol during a street-side interview, declares: 'The police won't touch us.' Recognising the scale of the law and order challenge, Col Hassanov replies: 'Our people are used to having order imposed on them under totalitarian rule. But they don't understand that it is much better for us to restore order ourselves than to have somebody from outside do it'  - an unmistakable reference to Russia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Analysis" by Political Editor Chip Tsao: "Power Pagoda Is </F> Not Immune to its Own Divisions"]    [Text] China made another move yesterday to tighten the  web of tungzhan - the Maoist ploy of producing a so-called  united front -- by appointing another batch of 50 Hong Kong  affairs advisers. With this "magic weapon", as Mao proudly put  it, the Communist Party conquered the Kuomintang and won the  civil war. This time the Chinese used it on Chris Patten, yet  whether it still functions as convincingly as it did 50 years  ago looks less assured.    The most remarkable feature of the latest round of the  united-front battle is the winning over of 15 legislators -- a  quarter of those who sit under the dome of Hong Kong's  legislature. Beijing also claimed the trophy of one former Hong  Kong government civil servant, although the names of the most  precious -- John Chan, former secretary for education and  manpower, and Yeung Kai-yin, former secretary for the treasury  -- are still missing. It has been reported that they declined  offers to become advisers.    As the 1997 handover approaches, the strength of Beijing's  united front seems to be growing impressively. Beijing has  managed to build a pagoda of a powerbase, which is designed to  make every inhabitant happy. While the professions of all these  members -- ranging from pig farmer to retired Supreme Court  judge -- remain comparable to those in Canterbury Tales, the  political message is clear.    The district affairs advisers form a grassroots base, a  shadow of the Hong Kong government's district boards and  regional councils. On top are the Hong Kong affairs advisers,  who comprise an impressive number of politicians, businessmen  and academics. One stair up from that is the more ambitious  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), a group of 30 Hong Kong  members rumoured to be the pool of rising stars from which the  potential future chief executive of the Special Administrative  Region (SAR) is to be chosen. Apart from these new residents,  there are the supposedly more respectable veteran patriots: the  Hong Kong deputies of China's National People's Congress (NPC)  and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Not  only does this huge institutional structure provide the training  ground for the post-1997 power struggle among locals, it also  enables Hong Kong people to glimpse the cumbersome bureaucracy  of politics in the SAR.    The solicitor and NPC deputy Liu Yiu-chu is not the only one  to be openly bitter about some former colonial servants, such as  Sir S Y Chung, who has jumped the "patriotic" queue to become a  Hong Kong affairs adviser. Asked what he could achieve as a  Hong Kong affairs adviser, David Chu, an electrical engineer and  businessman trained in the United States, complained that much  "advice" he offered fell on deaf ears. Henry Fok, a top  pro-China Hong Kong tycoon, said humbly that he was too "lazy"  to participate in much work. Wu Kang-min described his own  performance as "so-so". "The title of Hong Kong affairs adviser  was little more than that of a British gong," he said.    But a British honour is still not quite the same thing. The  Queen is always less generous about giving too many away at one  time, knowing that the value will slip if the market is flooded.  Many PWC members and Hong Kong affairs advisers, such as Rita  Fan and Lau Wong-fat, have never declared their intentions to  return their CBEs or OBEs -- although they know it would help  their political futures.    Commentators might hail China's "tolerance" in appointing a  small number of moderates -- notably the legislator Fung  Kin-kee, leader of the Association for Democracy and People's  Livelihood, and Anthony Cheung, chairman of Meeting Point. The  objective is clearly to divide the democratic elements in the  Legislative Council in order to, as Mao said, "unite the great  majority and conquer the tiny minority" -- the "tiny minority"  being Martin Lee's United Democrats. Such a divide-and-conquer  ploy could indeed turn into a double-edged knife. Liu Yiu-chu  has already caused enough division within the troops of the  united front.    People like Fung and Cheung, with their eyes fixed on the  1995 Legco election cannot afford to behave in too obsequious a  manner towards Beijing. That might look offensive to the  electorate. The result is they will blow the fresh air of  democracy by speaking for Hong Kong's interests in the group.  This, in turn, will have an effect upon the others, who might  join the race to be seen as outspoken. The Xi Yang case is one  example. Tam Yiu-chung's call for a cap on Chinese speculation  in Hong Kong's property market is another. And there will be  more.    Even those who prefer to say what Beijing loves to hear are  now giving their future master a dose of trouble. Some PWC  members "advised" Beijing to ask civil servants to biao-tai --  declare one's position before 1997 -- but this was dismissed by  Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.  Other proposals to add "objective standards" for returning Hong  Kong emigres to re-establish their right of abode have been met  with indifference from China.    So the united front does not look that united after all. It  has still to be seen who is the master at playing the  divide-and-conquer game, a pastime that Beijing has always  accused Britain of indulging in. At least for the time being,  there is every reason to believe the British are enjoying some  quiet satisfaction.</p>

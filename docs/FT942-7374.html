			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Clinton firm on Bosnia arms President Bill Clinton yesterday declared himself flatly against a unilateral lifting by the US of the arms embargo on Bosnia. He told the graduating class at the US Naval Academy that 'we simply must not opt for options and actions that sound simple and painless but which will not work in this era of interdependence'. US unilateral action would 'kill the peace process, sour our relationships with our European allies in Nato and the UN, and undermine the partnership we are trying to build with Russia across a whole range of areas'. UN embargoes 'that we like' against Iraq, Libya and Haiti would also be undermined. Mr Clinton spoke on the day after the House postponed until June 9 planned votes on the arms embargo similar to those approved by the Senate earlier this month.</p>

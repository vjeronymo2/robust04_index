			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Attack on Iraq: Attack may awaken Arab resentment FEW Middle East governments have any sympathy for President Saddam Hussein, but the resumption of allied air attacks on Iraq is likely to reawaken smouldering Arab resentment against what is seen as a selective western response to the enforcement of UN Security Council resolutions. The fault lines that divided the Arab world during the Gulf war nearly two years ago already show signs of re-emerging. Even before the attacks were launched the lower house of the Jordanian parliament was voicing concern. 'The new provocations are a continuation of the injustice inflicted on the Iraqi people since the start of the 1991 Gulf war,' said lower house speaker, Mr Abdul-latif Arabiyat. We hope this abuse against Iraq and the Arab nation will stop soon.' The government was more cautious in its response. Officials said a carefully-worded statement by Mr Kamel Abu Jaber, the foreign minister, reflected a desire to avoid opening old wounds. 'We are still calling for the settlement of any dispute through dialogue and negotiations, not through resorting to force to solve conflicts,' he was quoted by state-run television as saying. King Hussein's efforts to persuade the US and its allies not to launch an all-out attack on Iraq two years ago cost him temporarily the respect he had enjoyed in Washington and placed the monarch in the same camp as the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Libya, Sudan and Yemen. However the king's position accurately reflected the sentiments of many Jordanians who revelled in Saddam Hussein's willingness to stand up to the US and to fire missiles at Israel. The Iraqi leader may not be able to count on quite such public sympathy on this occasion. But with more than 400 Palestinians suffering on a hillside in southern Lebanon and Israel defying a UN resolution to take them back, the US-led action against Iraq is bound to inflame radical opinion. How strong and widespread that opinion is will in part depend on the extent and severity of the allied attacks and whether there are civilian casualties. Egypt, which helped the US assemble the Gulf war coalition, said it regretted the renewed use of force against Baghdad. However, state television said President Hosni Mubarak also 'called on the Iraqi regime to stop its policy of adventures which is damaging the people of Iraq, their rights and their future.' It said that Mr Mubarak told Egyptian newspaper editors with him on a visit to Syria 'that he received the news of the attack on Iraqi military targets with deep regret and that the situation should have escalated to the point of using force. 'President Mubarak expressed his hope that the use of force would stop as soon as possible, to preserve the people of Iraq, who have already suffered much from the misery of war and destruction.' The Egyptian leader's views will be shared elsewhere in the region, not least in the Gulf itself, where hostility to Mr Saddam is tempered by deep anxiety over Iraq being dismembered as a result of the two air exclusion zones. The US, Britain and France took many days last summer to persuade Saudi Arabia of the necessity of sending allied aircraft back to the kingdom in order to police the southern no-fly zone. Bahrain, home for the British Tornado aircraft during the Gulf war, has since made clear its desire not to cut all links with Baghdad, and remains deeply troubled by the rash of border disputes which have broken out in the region, particularly among the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council  -Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar and Oman. The six came together impressively following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait but there is likely to be less unanimity over whether the latest challenges by Mr Saddam to the UN warrant a renewal of military action. Only Kuwait appears to be unreservedly behind the US-led response. A senior Kuwaiti official told Reuters he hoped that the allied military action against Iraq would prevent any further 'miscalculations' by the Baghdad regime. 'What I hope is that the Iraqi regime will avoid their continued miscalculations,' Mr Suleiman Majed al-Shahin, the Kuwaiti foreign ministry under-secretary, said in a telephone interview. 'As a small country, that is what we are hoping for.' Lurking just beneath the surface in many Arab countries is the impact renewed western intervention will have on populations where Islamic fundamentalists appear to be gaining strength. Egypt, where the tourist industry has been damaged this winter by extremist terrorism, has launched large-scale police actions to root out the dissidents which it says are being supported by Iran. Elsewhere, such as in Algeria and in the Arab territories occupied by Israel, there is some evidence that fundamentalist factions are gaining ground. For them, just as for Iran after the overthrow of the Shah, the US is seen as a vital element in maintaining the regimes against which they are struggling.</p>

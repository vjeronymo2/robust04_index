			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Wine: Consumers can call the tune - Is this the time to buy the 1990 clarets? UNTIL last month's devastating frost, the excellent, record-size 1990 Bordeaux vintage had the disadvantage of being the third such in as many years and the fifth of the past six. Although this would have presented no problem for the generic reds and the dry whites in moderate supply, there is not an unlimited demand for clarets of the higher appellations, from cru bourgeois upwards, nor for Sauternes and other sweet whites which have had a third fine vintage in succession. There can be too much of a good thing. So, whereas the 1989 clarets met with near-hysterical reception almost before the grapes were picked, those of 1990 arrived in a publicity silence that persisted until after Easter when the wines could be tasted. Yet the omens were highly favourable although, after an early budding, varying weather led to protracted vine flowering, irregular ripening and harvesting. What marked out the vintage was the exceptionally hot period from July 21 to August 31. An important factor in a Bordeaux summer is the number of days when the temperature exceeds 30 degrees C (86 degrees F). Last summer there were 25, compared with 11 in 1989 but with almost no rain. This resulted in a precociously ripe Merlot, picked rapidly early in September, but a Cabernet-Sauvignon (vital in the Medoc) that lacked juice and ripeness until revived and swollen by a weekend of rain two-thirds through the month. Those who had the courage to wait until the end of September and picked late made the best wine, combined with those who thinned the grapes in July (vendange verte) which more estates did than ever before. Otherwise, the quantity of grapes could not support sufficient juice. The Sauternes were exceptionally rich and concentrated and, unusually, the vintage there was more or less complete before that of the reds began in the Medoc. Whether '88, '89 or '90 will turn out the finest vintage in the Sauternes could become a matter of enjoyable, consumable controversy. Immediately after Easter - under the aegis of the Union des Grands Crus, headed by Peter Sichel of Palmer and Angludet - 120 of the new wines could be tasted and the fine quality of the vintage was confirmed. The clarets are notable for their very deep colour: some, such as Pichon-Lalande, are almost black. They have great concentration and are long in the taste. The Medocs and red Graves are very tannic, although these tannins are claimed to be 'soft' and not aggressive like the '86s and '88s. The Merlot-dominated St Emilions are less tannic, and I found some excessively oaky. The '90 Medocs are probably less regular than the '89s, but some growers have the reverse view - and the wines are only six months old. Unfortunately, the first growths are not members of the Union (although Cheval-Blanc was available for tasting) but I was able to visit all the others separately except Petrus which, like other Moueix-owned or managed properties, was not shown. Nor did M Delon open his Leoville-Las-Cases or Podensac, M Prats his Cos d'Estournel, or M Borie his Ducru-Beaucaillou, Grand-Puy-Lacoste or Haut-Batailley, although I was able to taste these at Ducru-Beaucaillou. Of the first growths, Cheval-Blanc did not have exceptionally deep colour nor, at the moment, a big aroma, but there was considerable flavour and length. The Haut-Brion seemed less concentrated than the very rich '89 but was fruity, elegant and typically Graves, with a certain reserve. Ch Margaux was bigger and more tannic, with high colour and, compared with the '89, very concentrated. Mouton-Rothschild, put into cask immediately after the fermentation instead of being retained in vat for the second, malolactic fermentation, was more difficult to taste but proved rich, ripe, herbaceous and more oaky than the others. The Lafite had a better structure and more acidity than the elegant '89. Latour had a markedly deep colour and was very tannic but with great depth of flavour. A typical Latour. Tasting notes are not possible here, but the opportunities afforded for comparison in the Union des Grands Crus tastings were very instructive. All, of course, were cask samples which often are subject to variation. So I mention only those which appealed particularly to me. Red Graves: Dom de Chevaliere, Fieuzal, Haut-Bailly, La Louviere, Larrivet-Haut-Brion, La Mission-Haut-Brion, La Tour-Martillac, Pape Clement, Clos Fourtet. St Emilion: L'Angelus, Balestard la Tournelle, Canon-La Gaffeliere, Figeac, Pavie, Troplong-Mondot. Pomerol: La Conseillante, L'Evangile, Gazin, La Pointe, Petit Village, Trotanoy, View-Ch Certan. Margaux: I missed most in order to visit the first-growths but I sampled Palmer and Angludet, both big-coloured and fruity wines, with the former more elegant. Growths spoken of particularly well included Rausan-Segla, Issan and Monbrison. St Julien: Beychevelle, Ducru-Beaucaillou, Granaud-Larose, Leoville and Langoa-Barton. Pauillac: Clerec-Milon, Grand-Puy-Lacoste, Haut-Batailley, Lynch-Bages, Pichon-Longueville, Pichon-Lalande. St. Estephe: Cos Labory, Montrose. Haut-Medoc: Beaumont, La Tour-Carnet. Medoc: La Tour-de-By. White Graves: Chantegrive, Dom de Chevalier, La Louviere, Larrivet-Haut-Brion, La Tour-Martillac. Sauternes: Climens, Doisy-Vedrines, Rayne-Vigneau, Suduiraut. We will soon be flooded with 'opening offers' of these '90 clarets. Obviously, this is not a vintage to pass by, but should we buy them now? No, if you hope to make a profit. Since the much-publicised '82s, investment in wine has been played out. For example, a typical duty-paid/delivered opening price for the excellent Chx Margaux and Mouton-Rothschild '83s, was Pounds 365 a case apiece, and Pounds 465 for their '85s. The most recent top prices at Christie's were Pounds 480 and Pounds 360 for the '83s, and Pounds 340 and Pounds 380 for the '85s. This does not allow for considerable inflation, and later vintages and rather lesser classed-growths may fare little better. There is, though, always a good case for prompt buying of petits chateaux and clarets at Pounds 40-Pounds 70 a dozen in bond for, once sold out on merchants' lists, they are unlikely to reappear. For what may be designated as the Grands Crus, had it not been for the frost there would have been little reason to buy now, especially for those who have reserves of fine vintages. It is different, of course, for those entering the opening offer market for the first time. That the chateaux owners were nervous about selling their crops was shown by the 10-15 per cent drop in prices, compared with the '89s. Some typical examples per bottle with the '89 prices in brackets are: Mouton-Rothschild (and other first growths) FFr205 (230), Pichon-Lalande 100 (125), Duhart-Milon 60 (72), Haut-Bailly 66 (70), Clerc-Milon 57 (62), La Lagune 56 (62), Haut-Batailley 50 (57), and Chasse-Spleen 50 (57). The Bordeaux merchants, anxious to hold no stocks, cut their margins except for the first growths where they took their usual 25 per cent for a mere book-keeping transaction. Obviously, the frost has changed the situation. It is unlikely that the fine '90s will be cheaper in a few years. But there is a great deal of unsold, unconsumed claret all over the wine-drinking world and, in real terms, they may not be more expensive - remembering that claret, or even other French reds, are not the only wines in the bin these days. There is, though, no call for panic buying. It is not the prolific '90s that have been hit but the '91s that - good or bad - no one will want except for a very small quantity of exceptional quality wine, as in '45. Before choosing classed-growth '90 'futures', existing reserves, liquid resources and likely demand 10 years hence should be taken into account; and those apparently giving the best quality/price value should be considered first. For this is the first year in 10 in which the consumer can call at least part of the tune.</p>

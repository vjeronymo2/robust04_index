			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Freedom near for Palestinians ISRAEL yesterday prepared to release a first batch of Palestinian prisoners in a gesture of goodwill towards the Palestine Liberation Organisation, but the move was overshadowed by the killing by Islamic fundamentalists of two Israeli soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip. Mr Shimon Shetreet, economics minister, said yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting had agreed to start a gradual release of 760 prisoners over the coming days. Under an agreement negotiated between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last week, the first batch will include the old, sick, women and children. The PLO, seeking to boost its support among Palestinians who remain sceptical of the self-government peace agreement, said the freed prisoners would include members of the Hamas fundamentalist group and would mark merely the beginning of the release of up to 14,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The PLO said it would continue to press for the release of more prisoners at talks which resume in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba tomorrow. The PLO is demanding the immediate release of all prisoners held for membership of a banned or 'hostile' organisation or imprisoned for minor activities such as demonstrating, rock throwing or hoisting of the Palestinian flag. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday sought to reassure anxious Israelis about the release of prisoners, saying the PLO had kept its word to suspend violence against Israelis and attacks had been reduced by 50 per cent in the occupied territories since the peace agreement was signed last month. But continuing attacks by Hamas will anger Israeli public opinion and raise opposition to the release of Hamas activists. Mr Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a right-wing opposition member of parliament, yesterday criticised the release programme and said Israel was rushing to free 'terrorists' without demanding anything in return. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said after talks with President Hafez al-Assad that Syria was not hardening its line on Middle East peace and Damascus wanted a peace pact with Israel, Reuter reports from Damascus. 'I am impressed by the seriousness here and I am sure that Israel is serious, it is a matter of finding the right time for them to come together again and have the right flexibility on both sides once they come together to reach an agreement.'</p>

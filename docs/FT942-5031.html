			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 2: The skill not to turn its back on the basics - Tony Jackson on Danisco, a big fish in its pond The trouble with the Danish food industry, according to one of its most senior executives, is that its output is just too basic. Take meat and animal products, says Mr Elvar Vinum, chief financial officer of Danisco, the food group. 'We're still selling raw materials too much. We have to do more to develop them.' Since Danisco makes much of its money from such basic activities as refining sugar beet and freezing peas, it might seem open to the same criticism. Not at all, says Mr Vinum. There is a lot of skill in freezing and distributing vegetables to the standards required by international food companies such as Unilever and Nestle. As for sugar, the company has more than 120 years of experience. It is a business in which efficiency is all: and Danisco, Mr Vinum says, is one of the two or three most efficient sugar refiners in Europe. Danisco was formed at the start of 1989 through the merger of three publicly quoted Danish companies: Danish Sugar (much the biggest of the three), Danish Distillers - almost the monopoly Danish producer of spirits, especially aquavit - and Danisco itself, a maker of food ingredients. The motive, says Mr Vinum, was simply one of growth. Taken together, the three companies would have 'more momentum'. The rationale of the new group was that it should be in 'food-related' industries. This involved a lot of pruning: some 43 per cent of the original group by turnover, chiefly in engineering, has been got rid of. At the same time, the group has been expanding in packaging, both in corrugated board in the UK and Denmark and in flexible plastic packaging around the world. This apparently paradoxical broadening of the portfolio is defended by Mr Vinum. 'We've been in packaging for a very long time,' he says. 'It's a business we felt we knew something about.' The packaging is mostly for food products, and the great bulk of it is for outside customers. It is not, in other words, an old-fashioned case of vertical integration. 'We're not in packaging to provide it for our own products. It's a business on its own.' Although unusually large for a Danish company - comfortably among the top 10 quoted companies in market value - Danisco counts only as a medium-sized food group in global terms. In 1992-93 its sales were DKr13bn (Pounds 1.3bn), and its market value is about DKr10.71bn (Pounds 1.1bn). However, it is plainly ambitious. Since the merger, and not counting the financial year 1993-94 just ended, it has spent DKr5.5bn on acquisitions and the same amount again in capital expenditure. The largest part of the investment, says Mr Vinum, has been in sugar. Besides being the Danish monopoly producer of beet sugar, Danisco paid DKr2.2bn in 1992 for its opposite number in Sweden, making it the fourth biggest producer in Europe. Also two years ago, it bought eight small sugar refineries in Germany and is just finishing the task of combining them into one European-scale plant, at a total cost of a further DKr1bn. Acquisitions apart, a lot of the expenditure has gone on the food ingredients subsidiary Grindsted, which grew out of the original Danisco. This is a truly global business, with new capacity recently installed in Denmark, the US, Mexico, Chile and Malaysia. Grindsted, says Mr Vinum, is one area where 'we can see a lot of growth around the world'. The trick, he says, is to work very closely with the customers, the food manufacturers. 'For instance, we are one of the world's biggest producers of pectin' (used in making marmalade). 'That's a very specialised field, where the customer wants to be absolutely sure the pectin produces his marmalade every time.' Another Danisco subsidiary, Taffel, is itself a marmalade producer. 'It took Grindsted quite a long time to break into that company with their pectin after the merger. The customers know exactly what they want, and to change may be very difficult.' Yet another area still offering scope for expansion is packaging: both in northern Europe - taken to include the UK - and in the US. Danisco, says Mr Vinum, is particularly interested in the US because the sale of its engineering businesses reduced its activities there, so that almost its only activity now is food ingredients. 'We're open to acquisitions,' he says. The one part of the business which looks decidedly unglamorous at present is distilling. Eighteen months ago, in an event which has distinct echoes in the UK at present, the Danish government cut the duty on beer by some 40 per cent to protect local brewers from German imports. Duty on wine was cut as well, but not on spirits. As a result, Danisco complains bitterly, alcohol drunk through the medium of its products is taxed at six times the rate of that on beer or wine. Given that Denmark has the highest duty on spirits in the European Union, this was predictably damaging. Last year, Danish consumption of spirits fell 11 per cent, while the markets for beer and wine went up 2 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. The result, as Danisco points out, is to distort competition. Whether the government is prepared to forgo yet more revenue to set that right is not yet clear. Either way, the company's attention is devoted much more to the international arena these days. At the start of this year, it undertook an international offering of DKr1.15bn worth of convertible bonds, with around 70 per cent taken up by foreign investors. The goal, Mr Vinum says, is to get foreign ownership of the company's equity up to around 20-25 per cent. At present it is half that. The company, in other words, is showing signs of outgrowing its native financial system. As it expands on the world stage, it seems not impossible that it will one day attract the unwelcome attentions of one of the real giants of the food industry. So far, however, it remains a big fish in a respectably-sized Scandinavian pond.  -------------------------------------------------                  EMPLOYMENT             Denmark: 1992 figures  ------------------------------------------------- Total                                 1,918,000 Agriculture, fisheries                  119,000 Manufacturing                           389,000 Food processing                          61,000 (Abbatoirs, meat processing              27,000) (Milk processing                          8,000) Services to industry, food processing    51,000  -------------------------------------------------                     INVESTMENT*  ------------------------------------------------- Total food-related                      248,000  ------------------------------------------------- *In building and machinery for agricultural sector  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Danish Farmers' Union  -------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> SOLIS SCORES SECOND STAKES VICTORY  </P> <P> Although Chris McCarron has been Southern California's hottest rider recently,  Alex Solis is holding his own.  </P> <P> Wrapping up the best year of his career, the 26-year-old Panamanian has won two  of the first four stakes offered at Santa Anita. Four days after he brought  Pleasant Tap from far back to win the Malibu, Solis directed Brought To Mind to  an easy victory in the $110,000 La Brea Stakes Sunday.  </P> <P> In winning her third consecutive since returning from a five-month layoff,  Brought To Mind pushed Solis' earnings past $8 million. He ranks 10th  nationally.  </P> <P> "I've been working real hard hoping my business would get to where it is now,"  he said after Brought To Mind's 5 1/2-length victory over A Wild Ride and six  others.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy with the way things have gone. I've been watching all the good  riders here and when you watch them, you can't help but learn. I'm still  learning and I want to continue to learn. (Agent) Craig (O'Bryan) has done a  great job. He has the experience and he's really been picking up the right  horses."  </P> <P> Brought To Mind, a 4-year-old Ruthie's Native filly, paid immediate dividends  for new owner Tadahiro Hotehama. He bought her from Lindsey Semple for $250,000  and she earned $65,000 for her success in the first leg of Santa Anita's La  Canada Series. She will be back for the next step, the Jan. 12 El Encino Stakes  at 1 1/16 miles.  </P> <P> Content to stalk Mahaska off the moderate pace (22 3/5 and 45 2/5 for the  half-mile), the 3-1 third choice took command into the stretch and drew away in  the final furlong. She covered the seven furlongs in 1:21 3/5.  </P> <P> A Wild Ride, the 8-5 favorite while coupled with Chandelier, was two lengths  ahead of 9-1 shot Mama Simba. Aishah, the 5-2 second choice who was a  multiple-stakes winner in New York, was last in her California debut.  </P> <P> "After she won (the Senorita Stakes) at Hollywood Park last May, she had a  little splint and we had to stop on her and fire it," said trainer Ron McAnally  after Brought To Mind's sixth victory in 13 tries.  </P> <P> "I don't understand the big price today. She had the best post. (Wayne Lukas'  entry) was down inside. Her last win at Hollywood was most impressive. Of  course, she had everything her own way that day. I figured she would come from  off the pace today.  </P> <P> "We'll go through the La Canada Series with her. The 1 1/8 miles (of the La  Canada Stakes) is questionable for her, but you never know. I didn't think  Bayakoa would go that far originally."  </P> <P> Solis said the gray filly is better now than she ever has been. "She's more  relaxed and more into racing," he said. "You can rate her or do whatever you  want with her. When you ask her to go, she really runs."  </P> <P> Kanatiyr, who hasn't been worse than second in his last six starts, is one of  12 entrants for today's $114,100 San Gabriel Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the  turf.  </P> <P> A huge son of Chief Singer, Kanatiyr has a victory, a second and a third in  three starts over the Santa Anita grass. He beat allowance rivals in his U.S.  debut March 16, was third behind Golden Pheasant and Fly Till Dawn in another  allowance race April 22, then was second to Notorious Pleasure in the Col. F.W.  Koester Handicap Oct. 7. Chris McCarron will again ride for trainer Rick  Mettee.  </P> <P> Kanatiyr will race coupled with Colway Rally, who was the upset winner of the  Citation Handicap at Hollywood Park in his last start. The 6-year-old Final  Straw horse drew the outside post for trainer Julio Canani, who again will be  ridden by Corey Black.  </P> <P> Others in the lineup include Robinski, who won the Bay Meadows Handicap at 17-1  earlier this month, The Medic, Aromatic, Rouvignac, In Excess, Chestnut Freeze,  Edipo Rey, Silent Prince, Theatrical Charmer and Louis Cyphre.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Gary Stevens, who has clinched his first money-winning title, won twice Sunday  and surpassed his previous best total when France Soir finished second in  Sunday's third race. By the end of the day, his total was $13,795,973,  bettering his 1988 figure of $13,744,003. Stevens won two for trainer Wayne  Lukas -- on Tomorrow's Song, who was impressive in her debut in the sixth race,  and Farma Way in the seventh. . . . Speaking of France Soir, she's certainly  one of the most consistent horses around. She now has finished second in five  consecutive races after losing a photo to longshot Phil's Illusion.  </P> <P> Valiant Pete, who was second to stablemate Frost Free in Saturday's Palos  Verdes Handicap, grabbed a quarter in the race and will miss two to three weeks  of training. . . . Chandelier was fourth in the La Brea, then came She's A  V.P., Fly Gaelic, Mahaska and Aishah. Nasers Pride was scratched in favor of a  race Tuesday.  </P></p>

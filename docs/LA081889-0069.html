			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEJM CONDEMNS 1968 CZECHOSLOVAK INVASION  </P> <P> The lower house of Poland's National Assembly on Thursday condemned the 1968  Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, echoing a move by Hungary and further  straining relations between reformist and conservative East European states.  </P> <P> "The intervention breached the inalienable right of every nation to  self-determination and its natural desire for democracy, freedom and respect  for human rights," the lower house, known as the Sejm, said in a resolution  passed 335-1, with nine abstentions.  </P> <P> Communist deputies overwhelmingly supported the resolution -- even though their  former party leader, President Wojciech Jaruzelski, was Poland's defense  minister at the time of the invasion and allowed Polish troops to take part in  it.  </P> <P> The measure, similar to one adopted last week by the Senate, also resembled a  statement issued Wednesday by Hungary's Communist Party, whose leadership said  it does not identify itself with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Aug.  21, 1968. The invasion ended the "Prague Spring" reforms of Alexander Dubcek.  </P></p>

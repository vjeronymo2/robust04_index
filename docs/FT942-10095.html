			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Arts: Charmed by a scatterbrain hero - Cinema FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (15) Mike Newell GERMINAL (15) Claude Berri THE PUPPETMASTER (15) Hou Hsiao-Hsien MY NEW GUN (15) Stacy Cochrane A DANGEROUS WOMAN (15) Stephen Gyllenhaal M. BUTTERFLY (15) David Cronenberg In America Four Weddings And A Funeral, a British comedy about love and death, is the 'Have you seen?' film of the season. Standing Woody Allen-like in cinema queues, all I heard during my recent visit - forget the latest Dollars 100m Hollywood action films - was 'Such a delight],' 'Best British film in years]', 'It did make me laugh,' 'Shall we take Aunt Millie?' and 'Isn't Hugh Grant wonderful]' Let us have a memory check. Mr Grant was the young deb's delight in Maurice and the spineless lover in A Handful Of Dust: performances that seemed to mark him out for a short forgettable career, except perhaps as a matinee idol version of Griff Rhys Jones. Then he was funnier and more interesting in Polanski's Bitter Moon. Now with Four Weddings he begins to look the drollest, most appealingly scatterbrained hero in Western cinema. Charles (Grant) is the eternal best man. Always late for weddings, he is inclined to lose the ring, but will solicit last-minute substitutes from his chunky-jewelled Hampstead friends in the church run by the Rev Rowan Atkinson. Our hero also has an infectious smile, a laugh that sounds like steam escaping and the blissful assurance of a man who will 'never marry'. Then he falls in love with visiting beauty Andie McDowell, the movie's American box office insurance. That is it plotwise. But the script by Blackadder's Richard Curtis and direction by Mike (Dance With A Stranger) Newell give this comical-romantic froth such an eager whisk that it stands up and assaults the taste buds. The visuals are modest and the sound somewhat semi-detached, as if glued on in a hurry in the dubbing room. But technical deficiencies bother us surprisingly little and probably helped to charm an America bored with hi-tech, low-content hellraisers - that and the movie's ability to mix drops of darker emotion into the mirth. When Grant's pal Simon Callow dies of Aids, Callow's gay lover delivers a funeral speech at once blithely disrespectful  -'His recipe for duck a la banana fortunately goes with him to the grave' - and powerfully moving. A lot of giggling people around me at the AMC cinema, Century City, were also clutching surreptitious Kleenexes. The supporting cast - James Fleet, John Hannah, Charlotte Coleman - is almost frighteningly assured, as if fresh from a crash course of watching Noel Coward plays. But it is Grant's show. He seems to be taking over the 'silly ass' franchise and making it vibrant and human: he is a Hugh Laurie or Richard Briers (Good Life vintage) with large-screen charisma. Even his language - many an F-word in scene one, many a 'Bugger]' in the last scene when he Samson-wrestles with a church pew to steady his own pre-wedding nerves - seems part of this tousled ego exploding with banked-up Britishness. France's Germinal and Taiwan's The Puppetmaster are two contrasting ways to present the sweep of history. I felt swept up by neither. The first is Claude Berri's film of Emile Zola's mining saga, pouring mud, coal-dust and music over us for 2 3/4 hours. The second film is so minimalist that the truth-based tale of an ageing puppeteer, his family and his perspective on Pacific history seems like education by audiovisual drip-feed. The best thing about Germinal is Gerard Depardieu. It is now impossible to imagine a French film, and probably impossible to finance one, without the presence of this human whale soaring and spouting all over the script. Watch Depardieu take a miner's bath and you have a Portable Theatre version of Moby Dick. Watch him stomp through the streets with his striking army of workers crying 'Bread]' and you see a sight at once absurd - this man needs bread? - and wonderful. When Depardieu's character dies, so does the film. Everyone else is merely human. They recite the lines while the vast mining sets wait for the next crowd-stirring stunt by fire, water or Zola-esque sermon on humanity. The Puppetmaster takes an admired technique, Hou Hsiao-Hsien's jewelled-tableau style as seen in A Time To Love And A Time To Die and City Of Sadness, and turns it into an instrument of torture. Almost every interior scene is shot through a doorway by a scarce-moving camera, as if by an eavesdropper paralysed by a blow-dart. Years of Sino-Japanese history are microdotted into vignettes of social or domestic miniaturism. And when the 'puppeteer' himself makes a late personal appearance, adding a wacky, wizened face to his singsong voice-over, we recognise a favourite old actor of Mr Hou's. It is Li Tianlu, here playing master of ceremonies to his very own pre-movie life story, but not tempting one to rush out for the tie-in biography. For light relief you may turn to Stacy Cochrane's My New Gun, a lithe black comedy about a young New Jersey housewife (Diane Lane) whose life is transformed when she is given a gun by her security-conscious yuppie husband (Stephen Collins). She does not want it, so what will she do with it? More to the point, what will the attractive, mad boy next door (James LeGros) do with it when he 'borrows' it one fateful night? 'We live in a very sick world,' the husband points out in a self-fulfilling prognosis. Soon there are two woundings, one near-fatal case of food poisoning, the discovery of a lost Country and Western singer in hiding (Tess Harper), an adulterous romance and a wedding modelled on one of those bloodbath nuptials once beloved of TV's Dynasty. The film is sly, wise, funny: a first feature that makes us vigilant for Cochrane's second. A Dangerous Woman and M. Butterfly are earnest meditations on sex, passion and identity. If a smile crossed the faces of either of these films, they would crack like a mirror. In Woman Debra Winger gives an 'Oscar, please' performance as a gauche, mentally troubled woman who falls in love with handyman Gabriel Byrne, despite the steely resentment of her 'aunt' and guardian Barbara Hershey. Since Hershey's real age is 46 and Winger's 38 this takes some swallowing: but no more than other toxic hyperboles and whimsicalities in Stephen (Waterland) Gyllenhaal's direction or his wife Naomi Finer's script, based on a novel by Mary McGarry Norris. During M. Butterfly I kept hearing the ghostly voice of Henry Higgins, re-scripted for the age of PC: 'Why can't a man be more like a woman?' Jeremy Irons dons his distraught prune expression as the French diplomat who falls for a Peking Opera star without realising that 'she' is a man. But surely the rugger player shoulders and off-blue jawline of John Lone were hint enough? David (Naked Lunch) Cronenberg brings David Henry Hwang's truth-based play to the screen without allowing for the camera's greater power in microscopically sexing actors. A story impossible to resist on stage is impossible to believe on screen.</p>

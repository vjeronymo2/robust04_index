			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARMINE BELLINO; PROBED TEAMSTERS AND WATERGATE  </P> <P> Carmine S. Bellino, the doggedly determined congressional investigator who  played a major role in the downfall of Teamsters James R. Hoffa and Dave Beck,  has died of prostate cancer.  </P> <P> The soft-spoken former FBI agent and one-time aide to President John F. Kennedy  was 84 and died Tuesday in Coconut Creek, Fla., where he had retired in the  early 1980s.  </P> <P> From the 1950s investigations of Beck and Hoffa by the Senate Select Committee  on Improper Activities in the Labor and Management Field, to the Senate  Watergate Committee where he was a leading investigator, Bellino served a  single self-avowed purpose:  </P> <P> "To make the figures talk."  </P> <P> He had followed the complicated trails of illicit funds since receiving his  accounting degree from New York University. He became a special agent for the  FBI in 1934 and had risen to administrative assistant to J. Edgar Hoover by  1945.  </P> <P> But the man whom Robert F. Kennedy once called "the best investigator in the  country" grew restless in Hoover's vast bureaucracy and retired to his private  accounting firm before Congress called upon him. For the next three decades he  would serve as a staff aide or consulting investigator to the Joint Committee  on Atomic Energy, the House Health Education and Labor Committee, the House  Public Roads Committee, the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, the Senate  Agriculture Committee and more.  </P> <P> He disclosed a "skimming" operation involving slot machines in West Germany  played by American servicemen; the smuggling of millions of dollars in  black-market currency out of Vietnam during the war and discovered that Maj.  Gen. Bennett E. Meyers, deputy chief of procurement for the Air Force during  World War II, had owned a war factory.  </P> <P> Meyers went to prison and so did John Maragon, a White House aide in the Truman  Administration who was convicted of perjury during an investigation of 5% fees  being assessed businessmen who were awarded government contracts.  </P> <P> During the time he was chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee in  1973 -- which investigated the break-in at Democratic national headquarters in  1972 -- Bellino himself was accused of having ordered electronic surveillance  of Republican offices to help the Democrats in 1960, the year John F. Kennedy  defeated Richard M. Nixon.  </P> <P> The charge was made by George Bush, then Republican national chairman.  </P> <P> The Washington Post reported that Bellino was so thorough that he once  determined the gross income of an Atlantic City hostelry that figured in an  illicit sex operation by determining from a laundry the number of towels  delivered there each week.  </P> <P> Between congressional posts he served as an adviser to President Kennedy and  the Bureau of the Budget.  </P> <P> He was hired by municipalities across the country and, in 1976, the Los Angeles  Board of Supervisors brought him in to audit the tax rolls in a disagreement  over the assessment policies of the late County Assessor Philip Watson.  </P> <P> Bellino's first wife died in 1979. He is survived by his second wife,  Catherine, seven children from his first marriage and 31 grandchildren.  </P></p>

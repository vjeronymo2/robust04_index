			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONS, FIRMS ITCHING TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAQ;  </P> <P> GLOBAL ECONOMY: IN MESSAGES BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, THEY LET IT BE KNOWN THAT  THEY ARE EAGER TO RESUME LUCRATIVE DEALS WITH BAGHDAD ONCE THE GULF CRISIS IS  ENDED.  </P> <P> An odd counterpoint to the grim march toward next month's war ultimatum is the  optimistic urge among Iraq's global economic partners to ensure that, after the  Persian Gulf crisis ends, they will be able to resume lucrative business deals  that developed here during the past decade.  </P> <P> The hopes, expressed both publicly and in private messages from businesses and  governments, are perhaps the only glimmer on the otherwise gray horizon of  Iraqi foreign relations.  </P> <P> Given the apocalyptic scenario painted by both Washington and Baghdad in the  event the conflict over Kuwait turns into full-scale war, it has been difficult  to imagine making plans for the future. The United Nations has set a Jan. 15  deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and authorized the use of military  force after that date to liberate the sheikdom.  </P> <P> Indications that there may be life after the crisis are important to Iraq,  diplomats speculate, and might encourage Baghdad to compromise on its decision  to hold on to Kuwait at all costs.  </P> <P> The optimistic ones among foreign observers here believe that Iraq's primary  concern is no longer to keep Kuwait, but to survive the crisis intact -- this  despite the unbroken string of defiant announcements that Iraq will never  abandon what it has designated as its 19th province.  </P> <P> "Iraq will not budge if it believes it is going to be destroyed no matter what  it does," said a Western diplomat here. "There must be some sign that its  relations abroad can be normalized."  </P> <P> A few soothing messages from abroad have come to light in recent days. Toshiki  Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, sent a personal letter to Iraqi leader  Saddam Hussein urging him to obey the U.N. Security Council order and retreat  from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Kaifu included in his message a promise that Japan would resume its "previous  cooperative relationship" with Iraq once the crisis has dissipated.  </P> <P> A visiting Soviet delegation is discussing the issue of Soviet technicians who,  because of the contracts they signed with Baghdad, have not yet been allowed to  leave despite the threat of war. But the meetings are also laying the  groundwork for future economic relations between the two countries, Eastern  European diplomats say.  </P> <P> The delegation from Moscow includes the head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's  Middle East department, the deputy chairman of the governing Council of  Ministers and the deputy minister of oil and gas.  </P> <P> Part of the dealings involve a joint agreement for up to 600 Soviet technicians  to stay in Iraq despite the danger and the effects of the U.N. embargo on trade  with the country. The Soviets "welcomed Iraq's decision to allow Soviet experts  to leave or stay in the country as they wish," said a communique issued after  the most recent meeting.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Iraq had indicated that the Soviets must fulfill their  contracts. But 900 Soviet workers have flown home during the past week, leaving  about 1,400 in the country.  </P> <P> The economies of Turkey and Iraq are tightly bound, and both countries have  sent messages of assurance that long-range relations can be friendly once the  crisis is over, diplomats say. Iraq is especially eager to reduce tensions with  Turkey: In the event of war, its neighbor might serve as a springboard for a  U.S.-led attack from the north. Also, the sources of one of Iraq's main rivers  lie in Turkey. With a new dam that was completed in the fall, Turkey can  literally turn off the tap that would affect much of Iraq's water supply.  </P> <P> "Iraq is mad at Turkey, but in the long run, it must promote good relations,"  said an Arab diplomat.  </P> <P> Before its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq had offered a rare Third World  bonanza for industrialized countries.  </P> <P> During its eight-year war with Iran, Iraq was a major international weapons  purchaser. It bought millions of dollars of arms from the Soviet Union as well  as France and the United States. Over the years, it has tried to buy the means  of producing chemical weapons -- from Germany and Switzerland -- and nuclear  weapons -- notably from France.  </P> <P> Baghdad also has bought missiles from the Soviet Union, China and Argentina.  </P> <P> After the Iran-Iraq War, Baghdad engaged in a hasty scheme meant to rebuild an  economy strained by the drawn-out conflict and to dive headlong into  industrialization. It dusted off ambitious development plans, and several  European countries along with Japan rushed to help finance and participate in  them.  </P> <P> A contract for a new $1.5-billion oil refinery to supply fuel to Baghdad and  central Iraq was set to be signed early in 1991. Japan and Italy were to  provide designs and equipment, and Czechoslovakia skilled labor.  </P> <P> Japanese companies were helping modernize Iraqi telecommunications and along  with Italy were constructing a new oil pipeline that would pass through Saudi  Arabia.  </P> <P> European countries, notably France, Italy and Germany, modernized power plants,  oil pipelines and steel mills. The Soviet Union was involved in developing oil  fields and updating power plants.  </P> <P> The United States was a relative latecomer to the Iraqi market, but Washington  had signaled an intention to compete by participating in the November, 1991,  Baghdad trade fair, especially in development of Iraqi oil production.  </P> <P> The bulk of U.S. exports to Iraq during 1989, the last year for which full data  is available, consisted of agricultural goods, mainly wheat. In 1989, the  United States exported $1.2 billion worth of products to Iraq and imported $2.4  billion in oil.  </P> <P> Even less-developed countries found a place in the Iraqi sun. Turkey,  Yugoslavia and India won contracts for road, bridge and dam projects and, along  with poorer nations like Egypt and Bangladesh, exported cheap labor to work on  them.  </P> <P> "It is hard for countries doing business with Iraq to just turn away," said a  European economist. "Everybody would like to come back."  </P> <P> Iraq was something of a 1980s rarity among Third World countries. Unlike most  Latin American and African countries, it had money to invest, or at least a  steady source of oil income to help finance big projects.  </P> <P> "The war with Iran left Iraq running behind the other gulf states," said a  Western European diplomat.  </P> <P> Iraq's vision of itself as a kind of Ruhr Valley of the Arab world also led to  headlong efforts to industrialize with all the latest technology -- a windfall  to eager Western and Japanese traders. "Even the Soviets would sublet contracts  to Western firms in order to satisfy the Iraqi demand for the latest," said the  West European diplomat.  </P> <P> Thousands of foreign businessmen and workers fled Iraq after Saddam Hussein  decided to set them free rather than detain them as a shield against attack.  Now, individual companies, regardless of their home country's stand on the gulf  crisis, are finding ways of signaling a willingness to return.  </P> <P> Businessmen are phoning government contacts to discuss how to resume operations  and negotiate the terms of possible penalties they might incur for late work,  diplomats say. Some have left a skeleton staff of local employees to staff  their offices rather than close.  </P> <P> "These are signs of good faith," said a Western diplomat. "Some companies spent  20 years trying to build a working relationship here. They don't want to throw  it away in a couple months."  </P></p>

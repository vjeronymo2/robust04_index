			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: German metals group falls heavily Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial conglomerate, yesterday blamed a combination of falling metals prices, difficulties in the motor industry, and restructuring costs for a swing from profits to a pre-tax loss of DM347m (Dollars 204.1m) in the year ended September. Last year's figure was DM245m. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, group chief executive, warned that Metallgesellschaft would probably omit its dividend for 1992-93. This would make the group one of several leading German companies to pass their payout this year. However, pessimism on the dividend was offset by the prediction that the group would return to profit this year, reflecting extensive cost-cutting and further disposals. Mr Schimmelbusch defended his ambitious acquisition strategy - which culminated in 1992 with the DM1.45bn purchase of the non-paper activities of Feldmuhle Nobel - saying the impact of the downturn in Germany would have been far more severe without the deals of recent years. He said the disposals programme of the past year was not designed to correct the earlier diversification. It was, rather, aimed at focusing on five, well-defined business areas, ranging from metals trading to plant construction and environment services. Mr Schimmelbusch said sales of non-core businesses led to a book profit of DM378m in 1992-93, and were set to bring in another DM600m this year. The chief executive said he was confident of reducing costs by DM1.1bn in the three years to 1995. Half of this will come by cutting more than 10,000 jobs. In the last two years, the group has cut 7,400 jobs, 12 per cent of the workforce. The reported loss for the year - achieved on group turnover unchanged at DM25.5bn - included losses of DM290m on the Schiess machine-tools company which has subsequently been sold. Metallgesellschaft published for the first time a divisional breakdown of profits and turnover. Pre-tax profits from metals trading rose to DM147m from DM129m; at plant construction they were DM45m, against DM21m; in metals and mining there was a loss of DM174m after a DM65m deficit last time; environment services made DM31m; industrial activities made DM111m against DM114m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marek F. Klimek: "Dangerous Union; Marian </F> Krzaklewski Says: I Know People Take Part in Strikes...."]    [Text] "Really, you do not need to persuade people too  hard to get them to strike," Piotr Zak, Solidarity National  Commission spokesman, insists. "The authorities refuse to  recognize the truth that social discontent does exist in real  life and is not something our union has conjured up."    For two weeks now, strike action organized by the NSZZ  [Independent and Self-Financing Trade Union] Solidarity has been  carried out on a nationwide scale. To date, no other major  central union (except for Kontra, which, as its very name  suggests, can probably be expected to endorse all protest  actions) has come out in support.  <H5>  "Society Will Pay" </H5>   "We are definitely against strikes because their political  objectives are hard to conceal. Solidarity leadership has  launched yet another attempt to impose its political will on  enterprise work forces on the pretext of defending their  interests, but, in fact, it is society that will pay for the  present strikes--and not for the first time, either," the Mining  Industry's Trade Unions Confederation, which groups all of the  major miners' unions outside Solidarity, declares in an official  announcement. "I know that people are taking part in strikes,"  Solidarity chairman Marian Krzaklewski attempts to explain. "It  must be that there is not sufficient control between the central  union administration and union members here."    Solidarity, led by Krzaklewski, has put all of its money on  one horse in organizing the nationwide strike action. Chairman  Krzaklewski has been touring the country attempting to incite  people to strike or to fan the flames of those strikes that have  already been started. It seems, however, that his efforts are  not particularly effective. Whereas on the first day the strike  organizers were successful in stopping the work of more than  1,000 enterprises, the second day brought only half that number,  and, during the following days, only a dozen or so work places  were still going on with the protest action.    The number of striking coal mines has also remained  constant.  They are for the most part quite weak enterprises, some of which  are even destined to be liquidated. Despite vigorous attempts  by the Solidarity Silesia-Dabrowa Regional Board, coal mines  belonging to the most powerful Katowice Coal Holding concern  have resisted invitations to join the strike and stop  production. Yesterday's attempts to start a railroad strike  proved that people nowadays are beginning to think of the  consequences before stopping work.    In many enterprises, the strike is carried out in a purely  symbolic manner. For example, at the Defuma plant in Dabrowa  Gornicza, which is the only enterprise in Silesia apart from the  coal mines to have joined the strike, the protest action lasted  all of two hours, while the organizers cheerfully declared that  they would soon make up for the stoppage. At the Czeczott coal  mine, all 22 strikers--that is, less than 1 percent of the crew  working the first shift--gathered at the mine's Solidarity  headquarters and, after assessing the situation, returned  promptly to work. At the Piast coal mine, the strike was  limited to the mechanical coal-processing plant, which  nevertheless stopped the work of the whole mine because the coal  extracted underground was not taken up to the surface.   <H5>    Will We Have Another Panama? </H5>   The demands announced by Solidarity cannot be met quickly,  and some of them are even impossible to implement in practical  terms. For example, Chairman Krzaklewski interprets the demand  to "enfranchise all society" as follows: "The government  oligarchy intends to share the privatized enterprises among  themselves. We will have a similar situation to the one they had  in Panama, where 20,000 people took over 70 percent of the  national assets. But, if you hang on to your privatization bonds  and pool them, you will be able to outbid any red capitalist!"  That was a fragment of Krzaklewski's rousing address to the  striking miners at the Jastrzebie coal mine, who greeted it with  tumultuous applause.    "Now we can appreciate the importance of studying psychology  and sociology in relation to the sphere of ownership  transformations, and the significance of cooperation between  specialists in these fields and experts in economic  restructuring," Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol remarked  after signing the agreement that led to the miners' ending their  10-day strike.    "The government has been familiar with the union's demands  for a long time," Piotr Zak insists, "at the very least since  the end of the experts' talks on 26 March, when eight demands  were officially recorded at the Council of Ministers Office  [URM] and entered, neatly and perfectly legibly, into the URM  computer. I personally checked it as it was being done. I  believe that ministers have had more than enough time to  acquaint themselves with the document."    Zak's own declarations can dispel anyone's illusions about  Solidarity's long-term aims. "I was amused to hear Minister  Miller claim that parliament is working on a pact. A similar  situation in the recent past led, among other things, to the  collapse of Hanna Suchocka's government, and now another  government, which has been in office for seven months already,  claims that it needs still more time."  <H5>  To Regain Lost Positions </H5>   The union's decisionmakers, who still remember the old  left-wing government's traditional inclination to be severe and  tough in its treatment of strikes and strikers, are trying to  recapture the remains of the ethos of the great strike wave of  the 1980's and thereby regain their positions as public leaders.    After all, on the other side of the barricades, they no  longer have a poor but honest government hailing from the  "polystyrene" era [reference to striking shipyard workers  sleeping on blocks of polystyrene during the Gdansk shipyard  occupation in 1980], but the much-hated postcommunists, who  batten on the working men's misery. It is true that they were  elected in a democratic process, but they still represent the  last chance for Solidarity as the latter continues to lose its  membership and its influence because, if Solidarity fails to  successfully "galvanize" the country against the present  government team, the ones that follow it will easily withstand  every future protest action.</p>

The LDP decided Friday morning to submit the motions Friday  evening, party officials said.    The party decided to exclude Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa  from the motions, saying including him would have a "serious  affect," the officials said.    The party officials said they decided to submit the censure  motions because the two ministers violated Diet resolutions  calling for a ban on foreign rice imports.    The two ministers gave deceptive answers to the Diet and  failed to exert enough diplomatic effort, they said.    The government decided in December to end its decades-long  ban on rice imports as part of the Uruguay Round of multilateral  trade talks and agreed to give foreign growers minimum access to  Japan's rice market, importing 4 to 8 percent of its annual rice  consumption over a six-year moratorium, starting in fiscal 1995.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference the two Hatas fulfilled their duties as ministers in  charge of the Uruguay Round and therefore need not take the  blame.    "Under the leadership of the prime minister, the government  dealt with the issue, and both of the ministers also devoted all  their energy to tackling the years-old formidable task," the top  government spokesman said.    "In this regard, I see no reason for them to be censured,"  he  noted.</p>

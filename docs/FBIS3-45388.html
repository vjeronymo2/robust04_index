Chong Kwee-sung, an  employee of a Hong Kong based trading company who has been held  in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, since August 1991, stopped eating  a week ago, hoping to draw the attention of the Chinese  authorities to his ordeal.    Neither Chong nor his family has been told which law he is  accused of breaking and whether he will ever be brought to trial.    Sources said Chong still maintained his innocence and had  complained of the great pain he had to endure in detention.    The hunger strike was the only piece of news in 2 and 1/2  years that showed the 56 year-old businessman was still alive.  He disappeared 29 months ago when he was taken into custody by  Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau officials in Shenzhen.    The family said they were greatly distressed by the  information and feared for Chong. "My father is a stubborn man.  He always does what he says," said Chong's daughter, Ivy Chong,  who lives in Oregon.    Another informed source confirmed that Chong had started the  hunger strike but said he could not ascertain his condition now.    Chong travelled to the mainland on a, Home Return Permit and  is still a Hong Kong resident, although his family long ago  migrated to the U.S. The daughter was worried that the hunger  strike might worsen her father's stomach illness.    Zhengzhou police were adamant that Chong be held responsible  for a commercial dispute involving the Central China  International Economic and Trading Corp in the city. According  to documents available, Zhengzhou police claimed that Chong was  behind a "fraudulent case" which involved the shipment of about  1,000 defective bicycles to the U.S. The corporation declined  to accept responsibility when the American buyers rejected the  merchandise on safety grounds. Chong, broker of the deal, was  then detained by Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau officials,  apparently as "collateral".    Repeated efforts by Chong's employer in Hong Kong to solve  the dispute through mediation have been unsuccessful.    Although Chong's case has been brought to the attention of  top officials in both Beijing and London, there has been  virtually no progress in the past 29 months. Requests by the  family to visit him in Zhengzhou have been rejected.    Ms Chong said Central China International Economic and  Trading Corp executives who were on good terms with Zhengzhou  Public Security Bureau officials had persistently lobbied  Beijing not to intervene although they were unable to find  enough evidence to convict her father. The corporation had made  no demands. "What puzzled us is that despite the long detention,  they still haven't told us what they want? Do they want money?  We have no idea," she said. Ms Chong said the family was  seeking legal advice as to whether they can take the Zhengzhou  Public Security Bureau to court.    Chinese University expert on mainland law Chang Hsin, said  Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau officials might have violated  China's criminal law. He said since Chong was arrested over a  fraud case, Zhengzhou officials might have broken their own law  which allows them to only hold him for three months without  further authorisation. But Mr Chang cautioned that there could  be "dozens of unpublicised internal rules and regulations".</p>

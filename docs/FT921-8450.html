			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Bundesbank puts pressure on pay deals GERMAN steelworkers' pay deal should not be used as a yardstick for forthcoming wage settlements, the Bundesbank said yesterday, adding that moderate wage agreements could help speed economic recovery in east Germany. Its criticism of the steel settlement strongly suggests that it intends to keep interest rates high in the near future, having raised them by half a point in December. Citing the recent New York meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers, it said: 'Other countries also see scarcely any scope for Germany at present to ease monetary policy.' In its monthly report the central bank said that unit wage costs in Germany were 7.5 per cent higher in the fourth quarter of last year than in the same period of 1990. Current wage claims of 10 per cent or more contained 'considerable risks for growth and employment, as well as for the price climate'. The west German economy had already entered 'calmer waters,' it added. Gross national product was an estimated 0.5 per cent lower in the fourth quarter of 1991 compared with the third quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis, and only 1 per cent higher than in the fourth quarter of 1990. 'Nor does the outcome of the wage dispute in the steel industry suggest a reduction of the wage cost burden,' the Bundesbank continued. The steel settlement comprised an increase of 5.9 per cent on basic pay and a one-off payment of DM175 (Pounds 61), which brought it up to 6.35 per cent. The bank said it viewed the agreement as a carry-over from the 1991 wage round. 'But the danger that the steel settlement will be seen as a signal for the next pay round cannot be dismissed.' The Bundesbank has not specified what level of pay increases it envisages, although it has indicated that settlements of between 5 and 6 per cent would be acceptable. Last year's pay deals were around 7 per cent. Both the public sector and banking unions have taken a hard line over their present wage claims and the most important pay talks will come in the engineering industry, whose contract expires at the end of March. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, made clear earlier this month that he was unhappy with the steel settlement. It would be 'highly questionable', he said, if the steel pay deal was used as the measure for other wage agreements. The bank linked its concern about pay to trends in east Germany, where it said economic recovery was making definite progress. While manufacturing output had been assisted by state guarantees for exports to eastern Europe and liquidity transfers from the Treuhand privatisation agency, it said production would have to match market conditions in the long run. 'Wage settlements which are more in line with productivity improvements than in the past two years could help considerably to speed up economic recovery in east Germany.' Manufacturing industry still lagged behind the construction and service sectors in the east German upturn. Existing companies in east Germany were mostly uncompetitive and new ones needed time to build up production.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Ensor raising Pounds 1.5m to cut debt Ensor Holdings, the USM-quoted building materials and motor group, is raising about Pounds 1.5m through a rights issue and capital subscription. Recent losses - Pounds 2.1m in the six months to September 30 - have prompted 'strong demands' from the group's bankers to reduce debt by means of disposals. Ensor has agreed with Mr Kenneth Harrison, formerly chairman and chief executive of Harrison Industries, that he will underwrite the rights issue and subscribe for 10.4m shares. He will be invited to join the board as chairman and managing director. The rights shares are offered on a 3-for-5 basis at 10p each.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Barclays closes the book on an unhappy chapter: John Gapper reports on how the UK bank hopes to avoid the lending mistakes of the past The senior Barclays executive in charge of approving many of the poor loans which led to a Pounds 242m (Dollars 367m) pre-tax loss at the UK bank last year is to leave. Barclays said yesterday that Mr Mark Deverell, 52, the director of risk management, had 'agreed to leave'. The bank is also announcing today a new structure to control and balance its lending. The reforms include the breaking-up of the 'central advances department' which Mr Deverell headed. Mr Deverell, former chief executive of Barclays' subsidiary in Australia, took over risk management in 1989. The property lending which contributed to Pounds 1.96bn provisions for UK bad debts last year rose rapidly in 1989 and 1990. Barclays' management has faced sustained criticism by investors. Mr Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman and chief executive, has announced that it will appoint a new chief executive from outside the bank this year. The bank will disclose its new structure for controlling risk - along with Mr Deverell's departure from May - to its managers today. It has appointed Mr Brown, 47, and formerly chief executive of Barclays in Japan, to take charge as director of group credit policy. Mr Brown said he intended to reduce lending to property, construction and hotel companies. He said executives had been too rushed by the growth of loans in the late 1980s to balance the lending properly. 'We undoubtedly feel that we were too aggressive in that period. That means you take on business at a speed which makes your executives so busy that they cannot be as thorough as they could be before,' said Mr Brown. He says the balance of loans was distorted towards property, construction and hotels because the 500 managers and staff under Mr Deverell were swamped: 'We had the classic business dilemma of choosing between things that are important and things that are urgent. The balance was wrong.' Barclays' past lending errors can be seen by comparing its portfolio and provisions with those of National Westminster, the second largest British bank by assets. The banks have lent in roughly the same proportions to most sectors, but Barclays has much more exposure to property and construction. Barclays was always strong in property and construction. But the two sectors proved far more risky than in the past. Together, they accounted for only 11.9 per cent of its loan book last year. But 38 per cent of its Pounds 1.96bn provision against UK lending in the UK related to them. A second problem was over the approval and monitoring of individual loans. Each loan of more than Pounds 5m was approved by at least one executive in CAD, and monitored by the bank's risk management committee. This comprised senior directors and executives which reviewed bad debts and exposures. Mr Brown says that this committee - despite the emphasis placed on it in Barclays' annual report - met infrequently. 'They did not meet on individual loans unless there was a special reason. They passed the proposition around. The first person signed, and then the second, and so on,' he says. 'There was a danger that because the first person said yes, so did the others.' Under Barclays' new structure - which will be put in place this month - there will be three changes. The first is that Mr Brown will head new 'group credit policy unit' which will monitor exposures and balancing the portfolio. Mr Brown says this means there will be a smaller proportion of property lending, as well as shifts in country exposure, and the re-pricing of loans in some other lending areas. 'We have still got a big business here. We are not talking about dumping whole categories of customers, but of lightening the load in certain areas,' he says. He expects that over two years, the bank will be able to rebalance its portfolio to match a new computer model of credit risk it is developing. The model is expected to be applied to all but the smallest loans within a year. It rates risk according to factors such as industry sector, company size and history, and financial information. Barclays has drawn it up using data on large loans dating back six years in the UK. The second change is that the loan approval responsibility of the CAD will be broken up. Instead, there will be separate risk management departments within the banking and investment banking divisions. This is intended to give a greater sense of responsibility for loans to those who make them. All loans which would have had to be approved within the CAD previously will be allocated to a single 'responsible executive' within the line divisions. This executive - drawn from a group of about 150 around the world - will have to follow each loan through to the end. The third change is that the rarely-meeting risk management committee is being scrapped, and a 'group credit committee' will be put in its place. This will be chaired by Mr Humphrey Norrington, a vice chairman of Barclays, and will meet daily to discuss individual exposures of above Pounds 150m. Will this new scrutiny leave a bank that just looks like all the rest? Mr Brown says it wants to remain distinctive, but its traditions will be under scrutiny. 'Where we are different, we will want to have asked ourselves why in a diligent, professional manner,' he says.</p>

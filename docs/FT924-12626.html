			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Euro doubts 'put inward investment under threat' A NUMBER of international companies are no longer considering locating their headquarters in Britain because of uncertainties over the country's role in Europe, according to a report published yesterday. The study, compiled by Ernst &amp; Young, the international business advisers, and Corporate Location magazine, says the UK's success in attracting companies wanting a foothold in the European Community is under threat. Its conclusions follow a recent warning from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that Britain could lose its position as a favourite location for inward investors into the EC unless it appeared to be an enthusiastic supporter of the Community. Mr David Rees, director of Ernst &amp; Young's European location advisory service, said that by 'tending to be on the sidelines' of the European debate, the UK risked presenting the wrong image to international companies. He said a number of companies were no longer interested in acquiring a base in the UK as such a decision would create 'the wrong impression about their European credentials'. He added: 'If this uncertainty continues, then the UK's considerable past successes in attracting a third of all US and Japanese investment in Europe may be a lot harder to sustain in the future.' The report emphasises that the UK remains an attractive location for international companies in spite of strong competition. It is highly rated for its telecommunications links, its good supply of labour with reasonable skill levels and good physical communications. The Commission for New Towns announced yesterday that it had raised Pounds 177.5m from the sale of property and land to the private sector during its most recent financial year. The total compares with Pounds 151.6m in the previous 12 months and with a peak of around Pounds 300m at the height of the commercial property boom. The commission, which disposes of assets previously held by the town development corporations, said sales in 1991-92 were achieved 'in one of the most difficult and challenging of all years' since it was established in 1962. Sir Neil Shields, commission chairman, said the recession and its impact on the property market had led to comparatively low levels of sales. Regions of the New Europe.

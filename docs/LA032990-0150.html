			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> BEACH PARKING CHEATING  </P> <P> People who have been parking in beach parking lots with so-called honor boxes  without paying the fee may soon find themselves paying the cost of a citation  instead.  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday night directed the city attorney to draft an  ordinance that would allow police to ticket vehicles whose drivers fail to  deposit fees in the unattended honor boxes.  </P> <P> The item is expected back before the council in about a month.  </P> <P> There are honor boxes at three beach parking lots: 810 Pacific Coast Highway,  and 1670 and 1750 Appian Way.  </P> <P> Early last year, the city installed the honor boxes to generate income from  those lots, which were deemed too small to pay for a staffed operation.  </P> <P> But the private operator, Executive Parking Inc., reported that many people  were parking without paying. Police patrols of the three parking lots are  expected to increase the annual revenue from $39,000 to nearly $90,000.  </P></p>

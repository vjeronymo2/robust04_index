			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bradford Smith: "Budget Boost for Critical </F> Issues"]    [Text] A shift of research priorities but no more total  money is the dominant characteristic of the 1994 budget of  France's atomic energy commission, the CEA. At 18.98 billion  French francs [Fr] (2.15 billion pounds), the new budget is just  1.2 percent above the 1993 figure of Fr18.76 billion -- less  than inflation.    In keeping with worldwide trends, the proportion of CEA  funding coming from military sources is falling, although both  military and civilian funding from government agencies show  slight increases, at Fr8.85 billion (+0.9 percent) and Fr6.54  billion (+1.6 percent) respectively. Funding from external  sources, such as contract work for the nuclear industry, is up  2.5 percent to Fr3.56 billion.    Of Fr10 billion for civilian projects, Fr8.57 billion is  devoted to research and Fr317 million to teaching, education and  international collaboration. The remainder will meet financial  needs such as interest charges and anticipated retirements.    Nuclear-related research now accounts for 59.6 percent of  the  1994 budget (58 percent in 1993), with pressurized water reactor  (PWR) safety (Fr509 million), laser enrichment (Fr447 million)  and the renewal of civilian power plant installations (Fr566  million) as major items.    Other allocations reflect the CEA's current strategic aims  in  fuel storage and disposal: Research on the separation and  incineration of actinides and long-lived fusion products (the  SPIN programme), gets a 20 percent increase to Fr257 million;  and the CAPRA programme, which is studying the use of fast  neutron reactors to reduce plutonium stocks, goes up 12 percent  to Fr217 million.    Research into the temporary and long-term storage of  radioactive waste sees a record rise of 31 percent to Fr134  million and, in line with the aims of the nuclear industry,  R&amp;D  programmes on the next generation of PWRs and on MOX [mixed  oxide] nuclear fuels also get funding boosts -- up 24 percent  (to Fr172 million) and 18 percent (to Fr115 million)  respectively. But all service activities relating to  engineering and production are to be transferred to the  industrial sector once they are sufficiently near-market. This  particularly affects nuclear fuel cycle pilot installations,  where the budget falls 27 percent to Fr204 million.    There is also a dramatic decrease in funding for fast  neutron  reactors (FNRs), coinciding with the closure of the European  Fast Reactor (EFR) programme. The CEA notes with satisfaction  the technical progress made through the EFR studies and has cut  the FNR budget by 44 percent to Fr74 million.    Nuclear topics allied to the environment, biology and  health,  will receive about 10 percent of the total research budget.  There are substantial increases in several key sectors: About  10 percent for radiation protection and radiobiology (to Fr188  million), and Fr133 million for the Protein 2000 programme,  which aims to study, design and made proteins for medical and  industrial applications.    Materials science gets 14.7 percent of the total budget,  down  1 percent from 1993. There are rises of 8 percent for atomic  physics (to Fr53 million) and 5 percent for fundamental and  particle physics (to Fr218 million), but a 13 percent cut (to  Fr468 million) for large-scale facilities. This drop  corresponds to the slowing down of research at the Saturne  accelerator in Saclay, the completion of repairs and  refurbishing at the Institute Latre-Langevin in Grenoble, and  completion of work at the European Synchrotron Radiation  Facility, also in Grenoble. Technological development -- a  major activity at the CEA -- suffers a small drop in budget  share, from 16.3 percent in 1993 to 15.7 percent. By  concentrating its efforts on strategic sectors, CEA has found  increased money for work on integrated circuits and  micro-systems (+3.6 percent to Fr375 million), photonics and  electro-optics (+4.5 percent to Fr157 million) and for ionizing  radiation measurements (+10 percent to Fr61 million).    In a final gesture of efficiency, the number of  administrative staff will be reduced by 250 by the end of 1994  -- how much money this will save is not revealed in the budget.</p>

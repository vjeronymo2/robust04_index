			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Slow economy restrains Corning CORNING, the US specialty glass group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent improvement in underlying fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 91.6m, or 47 cents a share. During the quarter, Corning adopted new accounting standards which reduced reported net income by Dollars 45.3m. Corning's post-retirement benefits expense increased by Dollars 5.1m. Including these items, net income fell to Dollars 41.2m, or 21 cents a share, from Dollars 85.6m, or 45 cents last year. Sales rose 21 per cent to Dollars 996.2m from Dollars 826.3m. Mr James Houghton, chairman, said: 'The strong improvement in consolidated operations was led throughout the year by growth businesses, primarily optical fibre and cable, laboratory services and environmental products. 'However, we continued to be restrained by a sluggish world economy, particularly in Brazil, Europe and Japan.' For the full year, Corning posted a net loss of Dollars 12.6m, or 8 cents, on sales of Dollars 3.71bn, against net income of Dollars 316.8m, or Dollars 1.69, on sales of Dollars 3.26bn in 1991. Stripping out one-time items in both years, Corning's 1992 earnings rose 10 per cent to Dollars 343.4m, or Dollars 1.81. The company's Dow Corning 50-50 joint venture with Dow Chemical, which was once the largest maker of silicone gel breast implants, continued to hurt Corning's earnings. Weak operating results and one time-charges at Dow Corning reduced equity company earnings significantly in both the fourth quarter and full year. Corning said the decline was moderated by strong earnings from Samsung-Corning, which more than doubled its earnings.</p>

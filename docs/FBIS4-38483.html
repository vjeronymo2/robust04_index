			<p>BFN     [Text] On 25 May, information sources of Abkhaz leader  Vladislav Ardzinba's regime spread a new falsehood through  Russian press and television. It claimed that the Georgian side  had opened artillery fire on Abkhaz positions in the Dali Gorge  and had even gone into attack. In reality, the Abkhaz  separatists had subjected Georgian villages in the gorge to  howitzer and mortar fire.    In this connection, the Ministry of Defense of Georgia  states  that this is another attempt by the Abkhaz junta to falsify the  truth, present itself as a victim of aggression and conceal its  crimes against the local Georgian population. This method has  always been used by the Abkhaz side as a means of avoiding  responsibility for the escalation of military confrontation and  the wrecking of peace talks. The Ardzinba regime has failed to  reconcile itself to the idea that the signing of the agreement  in Moscow may become the first stage in the restoration of the  territorial integrity of Georgia and is using any means to  prevent its implementation.    The Georgian Ministry of Defense states that unless the  self-styled regime in Abkhazia stops its provocations against  Georgian civilians -- thereby thwarting all attempts by the  Georgian Government to achieve stability in the region by  peaceful means -- the Georgian Government will be left with no  other way to solve the problem of Abkhazia but to take up arms  to (defend) the country's territorial integrity.</p>

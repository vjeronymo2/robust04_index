			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Artificial Obstacles Before </F> Opposition Newspapers"]    [Text] At the 13 January meeting of press and information  service leaders of a number of party and public political  organizations active in the republic, an appeal was sent to the  National Assembly and the Permanent Representative of Azerbaijan  at the UN. In is stated in the appeal: "After a decree was  issued on 6 December 1993 on the application of military  censorship in connection with the wartime conditions, political  censorship was also reinforced. Recently the printing of  newspapers was stopped under the pretext that they were  obligated to do so. Printing permits were not issued to some  newspapers to meet this obligation. We believe you will aid us  in eliminating artificial obstacles which have been thrown in  the way of the publication of opposition newspapers."</p>

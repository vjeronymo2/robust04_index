			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Indian police make big explosives haul INDIAN police yesterday seized nearly 1,500kgs of plastic explosives, five times the amount used in a bombing blitz earlier in the month that killed 250 people and injured 1,400 in Bombay, Reuter reports from Bombay. The explosives, found in a locked apartment at Kausa town in Thane district northeast of Bombay, were probably meant for a second round of attacks on the city, Mr Amareet Singh Samra, the Bombay police chief said. He said the bombers had apparently wanted to trigger a new round of Hindu-Moslem clashes in Bombay, which was swept by communal bloodshed in December and January. Mr Samra said the explosives were traced on information disclosed by one of four key people involved in carrying out the attacks, in which 13 bombs ripped through the port city in the space of two and a half hours on March 12. Police have so far arrested 17 people, including some suspects who have told police how the RDX explosive was smuggled into Bombay, and how they were trained to plant it. Authorities have identified a wealthy Muslim family, the Memons, as key suspects in the case. Some of them are believed to have fled to Karachi in Pakistan. Pakistan said it has been unable to catch the primary suspects because India provided too little information too late.</p>

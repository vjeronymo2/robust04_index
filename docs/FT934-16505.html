			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Timber watchdog ready to bark  -The launch of the Forest Stewardship Council The world's first independent body which will help control the trade in forest products, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), will be operating within a year. This emerged at an assembly in Toronto, Canada, at the weekend, following a tortuous two-year process that brought together business, environmental and human rights groups from around the world. But the effectiveness of the FSC is already in doubt after some influential western environmental pressure groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, withdrew their support in protest, when business was granted voting rights and seats on the FSC board. 'It is a dangerous and unnecessary compromise to involve industry in the process of determining the environmental standards by which industry is judged. We have withdrawn from the FSC because it has accorded industry such a decision-making role,' said Simon Counsell, forests campaigner at Friends of the Earth. The FSC was set up to verify the authenticity of environmental claims made by producers of forest products. Such assurances - that wood products and wood pulp come from sustainable forests - have grown, following widespread concern about the destruction of the world's forests. The idea behind the FSC was ambitious and its creation has been difficult. Organisers, including the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), the US-based Woodworkers' Alliance for Rainforest Protection, non-governmental organisations from around the world and business, have had to create a body that reflects the conflicting interests of social, economic and environmental groups from rich and poor countries. The Toronto meeting divided itself into three factions, representing environmental campaigners, human rights groups and business interests. But even within these groups there were splits. A Brazilian environmental coalition, for example, refused to support the arguments of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. 'We are in uncharted waters, but we have definitely taken an important step forward in verifying certification. We have got a compromise. Industry has a say but it does not have control of the FSC,' said Francis Sullivan, forestry officer at WWF UK. 'The writing is on the wall for those among the timber trade who do not pay attention to the social and environmental issues affecting their business,' he said. Torbjorn Sjodin, project manager for forest and timber at the Ikea furniture retailer, said the formation of the FSC was good news for his company, its employees and the customers. 'It means a lot to us. The FSC is unique because it has brought together social groups, environmental groups and business,' he said. Mark Eisen, manager of environmental marketing at Home Depot, the US's biggest home improvement chain, said the FSC will help its company's policy of buying wood products from properly managed forests. 'The FSC will legitimise the process of certification. It will clear some of the uncertainties felt by our suppliers. It will give us more credibility in our efforts to get our supplies from sustainable sources,' he said. Alan Knight, environmental co-ordinator at B&amp;Q, the UK's biggest DIY chain, was on the FSC's interim board. He hopes the environmental groups will eventually support the council. 'For the first time it has been shown that enlightened environmental organisations and the trade can share the same objectives in achieving socially beneficial and environmentally benign forestry.' But some of the more extreme environmental campaigners do not agree. Rosalind Reeve, a consultant to the German-based Rettet den Regenwald, said: 'At best the FSC initiative is naive, at worst it provides a framework for the timber industry to achieve a much-desired green veneer and defuse pressure to attack the real issues of illegal trade, indigenous peoples' rights and overconsumption.'</p>

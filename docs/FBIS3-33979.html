Addressing the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva today,  she described the gross human rights violations against innocent  and unarmed Kashmiris as reminiscent of the darkest days of the  Nazi Germany. She said the situation there is intolerable. The  people of held Kashmir are demanding just their freedom. They  cannot be suppressed indefinitely. She pointed out that despite  its repression, India has failed to impose its will on the  indomitable people of Jammu and Kashmir, and intensity of their  resistance has grown. The Kashmiri political leadership,  representing over (?30) parties and groups, has unanimously  declared not to contemplate any solution involving the  continuation of Indian rule.    The prime minister's address was warmly and repeatedly  applauded by the audience.    Referring to the recently held Pak-India talks, the prime  minister said Pakistan had hoped to meaningfully address all  aspects of the dispute. Pakistan stressed upon India to seek a  peaceful rather than a military solution to the Kashmir dispute,  and take visible steps to reduce repression. Instead the  repression increased. Over 40,000 Kashmiri men, women, and  children have been killed so far.    The prime minister demanded that the representatives of  Kashmiri people should be allowed to come and inform the  commission of the repression to which they are being subjected,  and the commission should investigate these violations of human  rights. Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto said: It is time for the world  community to prevail upon India to remove its additional forces  from held Kashmir, in order to put an end to its repression. It  is also time for the world community to force India to free the  imprisoned Kashmiri leaders, lift the Draconian emergency laws  and stop its army to commit all forms of atrocities in Kashmir,  and, finally, allow international human rights organizations,  humanitarian organizations, and media men to visit Kashmir to  ascertain the facts and provide help to the suffering Kashmiris.    She said the settlement of the Kashmir dispute based on the  wishes of the people is the key to peace and progress in South  Asia, reiterating that Pakistan is committed to seeking a  peaceful solution of the Kashmir dispute, as it would pave the  way to normalization of relations between Pakistan and India.  [sentence as heard]    The prime minister also urged the world community to help  preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and  demanded that the consequences of ethnic cleansing must be  reversed. She said the genocide in Bosnia has been continuing  for the past two years. The Security Council has failed to help  the victims of aggression. Humanitarian help has become an  excuse to avoid collective action against the aggressor. The  European Community approved high sounding principles but failed  to stop the aggressor. This state of affairs should end in order  to ensure peace, freedom, and justice for the Bosnian people.    The prime minister said Pakistan's aim is to provide a life  of dignity to its people by banishing poverty and illiteracy,  ensuring the rights of women and their full participation in  society, providing full protection to our children and  safeguarding the basic rights of minorities.    Later, addressing a news conference, the prime minister  urged  India to reduce its level of repression in occupied Kashmir.  This would be a visible signal from New Delhi that it is  sincere in holding talks over the Kashmiri dispute.    Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan cannot afford to  ignore  what is happening in held Kashmir, because it is our common  responsibility to ensure that the Kashmiris get the right of  self determination.</p>

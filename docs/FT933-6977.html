			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Bosnian peace plan under fire OPPOSITION to international peace proposals appeared to be mounting in Bosnia yesterday after leaders of the Moslem-led government lambasted the proposed plan to divide their republic. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, denounced the proposed map put forward last week at the Geneva peace talks for 'rewarding the aggressor, and punishing the victim'. The plan is due to be debated by the Bosnian assembly later this week. Speaking on behalf of Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, he said that it was unlikely that an agreement would be accepted unless there were big concessions. He cited towns where Moslems had comprised the majority before the war until Serb forces expelled or killed them. In an attempt to step up pressure on his Moslem adversaries, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic yesterday reiterated warnings that if the Bosnians rejected the deal they would face more war. However, Mr Miro Lazovic, speaker of Bosnia's parliament, dismissed the need to endorse the proposals by the August 30 deadline set by the international peace envoys, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg. Meanwhile, United Nations' efforts to take an aid convoy into the contested city of Mostar failed yesterday. Croat forces refused to let the convoy into the east of the city, where some 55,000 Moslems have been trapped for more than two months with little food. A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that the Croat forces had refused to let the convoy pass until various demands were met. However, Croatian radio yesterday reported that when the convoy was due to set off, Croat forces launched an offensive around Mostar, and seized the city's hydroelectric plant. A UN protection forces spokesman in Zagreb said that fighting was continuing yesterday between Croat and Moslem forces around Mostar, although the UN could not confirm reports by Serb, Croat and Moslem press agencies that fighting had flared up again in central Bosnia and other regions. Amid mounting international outrage over the fate of Mostar, Washington continued to raise the tone of its warnings to the Croats. US officials have said that a warning of possible air strikes issued by Nato applied not only to the Serbs besieging Sarajevo but also to other groups preventing the delivery of humanitarian relief.</p>

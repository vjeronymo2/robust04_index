As a part of this showing, an institution must establish that it has the ability to meet all of its financial obligations, including refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary considers the institution to have sufficient resources to ensure against precipitous closure only if the institution formerly demonstrated financial responsibility under the standards of financial responsibility in its preceding audited financial statement and that its most recent audited financial statement indicates the following (if no prior audited financial statement was requested by the Secretary, the institution must demonstrate in conjunction with its current audit that it would have satisfied the following): (a) All taxes owed by the institution are current; (b) The institution's net income, or a change in total net assets, before extraordinary items and discontinued operations, has not decreased by more than 10 percent from the prior fiscal year, unless the institution demonstrates that the decreased net income shown on the current financial statement is a result of downsizing pursuant to a management-approved business plan; (c) loans and other advances to related parties have not increased from the prior fiscal year unless such increases were secured and collateralized, and do not exceed 10 percent of the prior fiscal year's working capital of the institution; (d) The equity of a for-profit institution, or the total net assets of a nonprofit institution, have not decreased by more than 10 percent of the prior year's total equity; (e) Compensation for owners or other related parties (including bonuses, fringe benefits, employee stock option allowances, 401(k) contributions, deferred compensation allowances) has not increased from the prior year at a rate higher than for all other employees; (f) The institution has not materially leveraged its assets or income by becoming a guarantor on any new loan or obligation on behalf of any related party; (g) All obligations owed to the institution by related parties are current, and the institution has demanded and is receiving payment of all funds owed from related parties that are payable upon demand. The regulations clarify that, for purposes of these provisions, a person does not become a related party by attending an institution as a student. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in order for the Secretary to consider the institution to have sufficient resources to ensure against precipitous closure, the institution would also have to demonstrate that (1) there have been no material findings in the institution's latest compliance audit of its administration of the Title IV, HEA programs and (2) there are no pending administrative or legal actions being taken against the institution by the Secretary, and other Federal agency, the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency, or any State entity. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16400 Filed 7&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4000&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

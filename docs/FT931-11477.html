			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Matra-Hachette claims sound profit MATRA-HACHETTE, the newly-created French media-to-missiles group, yesterday reported that its divisions made a profit 'in the region of' FFr350m (Dollars 63.3m) in 1992. Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the flamboyant president and controlling shareholder of the group, forecast a rosy future for the merger, formalised last December, which linked the Matra defence and transport business with the Hachette publishing company. He promised 'a very substantial increase' in profit this year. He forecast that Matra-Hachette's turnover, which totalled FFr55bn last year, would rise by an average annual 5 per cent to 1996, while profits would increase by 30 per cent a year over the same period. 'By 1996, at the latest, we will be making FFr1bn profit a year', he told a press conference. In its last year as a separate entity, Matra reported a FFr191m profit for the first six months of 1992. For its part, Hachette, weighed down by the collapse of La Cinq television station, which was wound up last November, recorded a FFr39m loss over the same period. Conceding his mistaken venture into TV, Mr Lagadere yesterday prided himself and his team on the speedy merger, which takes the unusual form of a 'societe commandite par actions'. It entails other shareholders delegating considerable responsibility to Mr Lagardere who, in return, carries unlimited personal liability. Mr Lagardere claimed that, despite past problems with La Cinq, Matra-Hachette was not starting married life with a millstone of debt around its corporate neck. Without counting its convertible bonds, it had FFr7bn in funds and a net debt of FFr3bn, he said. The new group was able to generate a cash-flow - after paying for investments and dividends - of FFr3.8bn a year and would be able to repay an average FFr900m a year in debt, he said. Mr Lagardere bridled at the description of his group as a conglomerate, saying this implied it would be constantly buying, selling and shifting activity in search of maximum capital gains. He stressed that, instead, the group's nine divisions were all in 'solid areas' - defence, space, telecoms, rail transport, cars, newspapers, books, distribution, and audiovisual.</p>

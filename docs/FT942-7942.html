			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Portuguese bank ahead so far Caixa Geral de Depositos, Portugal's largest bank, registered a 4.9 per cent increase in net income during the first quarter of 1994 to Es10.7bn (Dollars 62.8m), compared with Es10.2bn during the same period last year. Net assets grew by 17.5 per cent to Es4,434bn and cash flow by 2.8 per cent to Es28.6bn, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. CGD, a state-owned bank that focuses on mortgage lending and savings instruments, attributed the growth largely to an increase in deposits. Total deposits rose 13.4 per cent to Es3,177bn over the 12 months to March. Loans grew 6.6 per cent to Es1,804bn. House-purchase lending was the fastest-growing credit category, rising 9.3 per cent to Es1,074.2bn.</p>

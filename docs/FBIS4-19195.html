			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Roy MacLaren, Canadian </F> international trade minister, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter:  place and date not given]    [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  reporter on the eve of the ministerial talks to be held soon [in  Morocco] to sign an accord hammered out at the Uruguay Round,  Roy MacLaren, Canadian international trade minister, made clear  his view on the next international trade rule. Commenting on  the establishment of a new labor standard that the United States  and other nations have demanded, the Canadian minister in charge  of international trade took the position that it is necessary to  cautiously negotiate its establishment, saying: "Developing  countries are concerned that the establishment of such a new  labor standard could result in control of their exports to  industrialized nations."    The United States and France have insisted that a new  standard for international trade be established to protect the  rights of workers in developing countries where wages and labor  conditions are problematic. Developing countries have guarded  against their insistence as an attempt to deprive them of the  upper-hand in trade shored up by low wages that are a source of  their competitiveness.    In the interview, Minister MacLaren went on to say: "There  is not enough time left to reach an agreement on the  establishment of the labor standard and conclude an accord on it  at the Uruguay Round. Developing countries are concerned that  the establishment of such a new labor standard and any social  standard could result in regulations on their exports to  industrialized nations. Canada is cautious about establishing  such a standard." In this way, the Canadian minister indicated  that all the industrialized nations are not in agreement on the  labor standard's establishment.    In the interview, Minister MacLaren criticized the United  States for reviving the Super 301 Provision, saying: "We are  concerned about all one-sided trade measures taken by the United  States."</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Technology: Beer casks obey the new barcode Losses of empty beer casks and kegs costs the UK brewing industry an estimated Pounds 10m a year. The brewers have managed to cut the losses from more than double that amount over the past five years by alerting police, pub staff and metal dealers to the organised theft and smelting of the aluminium and stainless steel containers for their scrap metal value. But about 200,000 kegs, with an average replacement value of Pounds 50 each, are still lost every year. Many are 'borrowed' for use as mooring buoys and supports for fences at local gymkhanas. Mountain bikers use them as obstacles. Building tradesmen erect working platforms on them. Others are merely stacked in forgotten corners by customers who cannot be bothered to return them to the brewery. As the distribution networks of the brewers have extended well beyond their own pub estates in the UK and into export markets, keeping track of the whereabouts of individual containers has become more difficult. But Charles Wells, the family-owned Bedford brewery, and management consultants P-E International, of Egham, Surrey, have devised a computerised system of monitoring the movement of the kegs using barcode technology. Charles Wells labels each of its casks and kegs with a barcode which identifies the brewery, the size of the container, and the date and place of its manufacture. This basic information is fed into the computer database along with the manufacturer's serial number stamped on each keg. A computer terminal at the production line is used to key in details of each day's brew - brand of beer, brew number and date. Then automatic scanners read the barcodes of the kegs as they are filled. When the containers are moved to the loading bay, the make-up of each load is fed into the computer by radio-linked portable data capture units. Any other brewer's products included in the load are also identified. Draymen with portable scanners again identify each container after it is loaded and add in personal identity codes and information about the time and place of loading and the vehicle in use. All deliveries and collections at each outlet they visit are similarly recorded. The portable unit is plugged into a printer in the cab of the vehicle to produce delivery notes for signature by the landlord or manager. When the drays return to the brewery, the data from their portable units are down-loaded to the central computer. The brewery thus has a daily record of every container delivered to, and returned by, each customer. Undue delays in returning empty casks can be spotted and action taken to recover them. The system has cost about Pounds 250,000 to develop. But Jona-than Harrison, Charles Wells's finance director, says: 'We have about 66,000 containers, and we reckoned that if our losses were in line with the industry average, they were costing us more than Pounds 150,000 a year.' After a year's operation, he says, losses are less than 2 per cent compared with an estimated 5 per cent for the industry as a whole. Apart from combating theft, the system has brought other benefits. Containers are being used more efficiently by speeding the return of empties to the brewery and reducing stockholding. Other cost savings are likely to flow from the analysis of data that the system provides on keg repairs, usage patterns in different trade sectors and the return of spoiled beer. Brand marketing and sales are expected to benefit from the flow of information; and the system provides extra insurance in any contamination emergency by enabling the brewer to trace and recall the affected product quickly.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS PULL LAST UNITS OUT OF AFGHAN CAPITAL;  </P> <P> WILL NOT SURRENDER, NAJIBULLAH VOWS  </P> <P> The last Soviet soldier left this besieged capital city Sunday, Soviet media  reported, and President Najibullah vowed that his fragile government will not  succumb to the rebel onslaught expected after the Soviets complete their  withdrawal.  </P> <P> In a report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London, Moscow Radio  quoted today's edition of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda as reporting  that "on Sunday, the last Soviet soldier left Kabul." It said Soviet soldiers  remain in other parts of the country, including at the airport just outside  Kabul, but that they are moving toward the border.  </P> <P> In Iran, representatives of the Afghan resistance meeting in Tehran signed a  cooperation pact Sunday, clearing the way for a united front against the Kabul  regime, Iran's foreign minister said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Soviet news agency Tass said Kabul is "effectively under martial  law," adding that some new security measures had been taken in the capital. It  said tensions had begun to rise as Soviet troops pulled out, just 10 days ahead  of the Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawal.  </P> <P> In Kabul on Sunday, Najibullah told members of the ruling People's Democratic  Party that his Marxist government will survive the rebel onslaught despite the  Soviet pullout after a decade-long occupation.  </P> <P> "God is with us. The people are with us. We will win the war," Najibullah told  about 10,000 party members who gathered in bitter cold near the presidential  palace.  </P> <P> The crowd chanted "Down with imperialism" and brandished thousands of unloaded  Kalashnikov assault rifles.  </P> <P> Weapons have been distributed among party organizations in Kabul "so that every  one of us could defend the cause," said Daud Razmyar, first secretary of the  Kabul city committee of the ruling party.  </P> <P> "The Russian armies are leaving the country, and we will defend ourselves,"  said the 43-year-old Najibullah, dressed in combat fatigues. "We have to be  strong. We have to unite."  </P> <P> As he spoke, more than a dozen Soviet transport planes streaked off in  different directions, spewing flares designed to deflect heat-seeking missiles  used by the guerrillas. Artillery fire could be heard in the distance.  </P> <P> Soviet officials in Kabul said today that the last troop convoy left the  capital Saturday. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that  a battalion of about 1,000 Soviet soldiers will remain at the airport, on the  outskirts of the city, to assist the supply airlift into the capital. They are  not expected to pull out until Feb. 12 or Feb. 14, the officials said.  </P> <P> In Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said the Afghan moujahedeen  delegates "finally signed an agreement for cooperation about a future  government for Afghanistan." He refused to give details of the accord.  </P> <P> The Afghan resistance movement is split into two groups: the minority Shiite  alliance, based in Iran, and the larger Sunni coalition in Pakistan.  </P> <P> The pact came after weeks of negotiations and clears the way for a united front  against the Kabul regime, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said.  </P> <P> The news agency said it is believed the two sides agreed on the number of seats  each will take in a proposed national representative council, which they hope  will lead to an interim government to replace Najibullah's regime.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December, 1979. Under a  U.N.-mediated accord, Moscow agreed last year to withdraw all of its estimated  115,000 troops by Feb. 15.  </P></p>

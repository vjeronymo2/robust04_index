			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed E.F.: "Treatment of Waste Water Reduces </F> Production Costs"]    [Text] The recuperation, in waste water, of 80 percent of  acids used in the manufacture of capacitors is allowing Siemens  to make savings of up to 6 million French francs [Fr] per year  with the added bonus of environment protection.    Environment protection is no empty claim for Siemens, whose  waste water treatment system is proving that an  environment-friendly process does not necessarily cost more than  traditional methods. The aluminum capacitor production plant of  the Siemens Matsushita subsidiary in Heidenbeim, Germany has  recently put into operation a dialysis system which enables  about 80 percent of the acids used in manufacturing to be  recuperated and reused in the production cycle. The investment  required to set up this system amounted to 1.2 million German  marks [DM] (Fr4.3 million), which is less than for a traditional  system (DM1.7 million). In addition, the annual production  costs have almost been reduced by a factor of four (DM0.6  million instead of DM2.3 million).  <H5>  Eliminating 6,000 Tonnes of Acid Sludge </H5>   When waste waters are recovered after the aluminum etching  stage in an aluminum capacitor production plant, they have  strong concentrations of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids.  Traditional water treatment systems include a neutralization  phase followed by the separation of the liquid and solid parts.  The liquids, which represent about 18,000 cubic meters per year  in the Siemens Matsushita plant, are then drained via  traditional sewers, while the solid matter, 6,000 to 7,000  tonnes per year, is dumped on a waste belt.    The new system is based on the same principle as dialysis,  with a membrane which directly separates the waste water into  two parts, one rich in HCL and H2SO4 acids (up to 80 percent can  be recuperated) and the other rich in metals. The former (460  liters/hour) can be recuperated for use in acid baths during the  capacitor production cycle. The latter (470 liters/hour),  composed essentially of alumina salt and a low percentage of  acids, can be used in organic filtering stations where it acts  as a bacterial precipitating agent.</p>

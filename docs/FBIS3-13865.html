			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat  'Abd-al-Majid has said that the establishment of a Middle East  market should not scare the Arab states because it is contingent  on Arab approval. He said that reaching a settlement of the  Middle East crisis does not mean giving Israel economic  advantages.    In a study on this issue, the Arab League said that reaching  a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East implies  ordinary commercial relations with Israel but does not  necessarily mean linking the Arab states with Israel by a free  trade zone.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the ability of the Arab states  to  deal with the Middle East market basically depends on ensuring  their unity and preserving their identity. He described Israel  as a small area in the world with limited resources amid a large  Arab world with big resources. He noted that the establishment  of a Middle East market should not scare the Arab states because  it is basically contingent on Arab approval. Reaching a  settlement of the Middle East crisis does not mean granting  Israel economic advantages.    'Abd-al-Majid stressed the need for the Arab states to  coordinate their stands on this market and to prepare a unified  strategy that adopts the [word indistinct] Arab interests. He  noted that the Middle East Market may include other countries in  the region, such as Cyprus, Turkey, and Iran.    A study of the Middle East market prepared by the economic  department in the Arab League emphasized the need to look for  new methods to back the Arab economy by developing an agreement  on facilitating and developing trade exchanges and establishing  an Arab free trade zone. The study attributes the weakness of  the Arab economy to the weakness of its production bases, the  low technological level, and the competition among Arab  economies in producing similar products, in addition to the low  level of Arab investments in Arab countries.    The Arab League sent this study to Arab finance and economy  ministers late last month in preparation for presenting it to  the next session of the Arab League's foreign ministers' council  in late March. The study defined the factors of [Israel's]  economic strength due to its high level of technological  development in the field of manufacturing industries and in the  agricultural sector, the private sector's responsibility for  running the Israeli economy, adopting export-oriented policy,  the increase in the accumulation of capital, and the high  production level of the Israeli worker.    The study sheds light on the weak points of the Israeli  economy, especially its dependence on external assistance, lack  of raw materials, and the reduction of the future development  growth.    [Words indistinct] UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali the  developments of conditions in the occupied territory following  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the situation in Bosnia and the  Gulf, and the UN stand, and Israel's refusal to be committed to  any international resolution on occupied territory during their  attendance of the international law symposium to be held in  Qatar 21-23 March.    A responsible Arab League source said that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid  will discuss with Butrus-Ghali the developments in the  Arab-Israeli peace talks and the Israeli obstacles, beginning  with Israel's noncompliance with the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles and ending with the Hebron massacre.  The source added that the repeated attacks on southern Lebanon  and the displacement of thousands of Lebanese families will also  be discussed. The source said that [words indistinct] issues  discussed on the Arab League council on 26 March.</p>

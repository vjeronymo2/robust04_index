			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT DEFENDS PASADENA MINORITY HIRING  </P> <P> The city's affirmative action efforts place it on a par with other California  cities that have large minority populations, according to a city report  released last week.  </P> <P> The report, by Affirmative Action Director Ramon Curiel, was prepared after  black and Latino activists complained that Pasadena has failed to aggressively  hire and promote minorities and women.  </P> <P> Curiel compared the city's work force to municipal labor forces in Fresno,  Glendale, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Pomona, Riverside, Sacramento and  San Jose.  </P> <P> With a minority population of 53.7% and a minority city work force of 50.4%,  Pasadena ranked fifth among the 10 cities surveyed in terms of population  parity.  </P> <P> Population parity is the placement of minorities in city jobs in percentages  equaling their percentage in the city's population.  </P> <P> Among the four cities with a 50% or higher minority population -- Los Angeles,  Pasadena, Oakland and Pomona -- only Los Angeles made more progress in  population parity than Pasadena, the report said.  </P> <P> As in most of the other 10 cities, Pasadena's minorities are not equally  represented in all types of jobs, the report said. Pasadena reached parity in  only three of eight federally defined job categories for all its minorities:  service-maintenance, paraprofessional and office-clerical.  </P> <P> From his analysis, Curiel concluded that the city's affirmative action progress  "is as good as, and, in other cases, much better than other California cities  with significant minority populations."  </P> <P> But the city's affirmative action efforts were dubbed as only "adequate" by  Ibrahim Naeem, director of the Pasadena-Foothill Branch of the Los Angeles  Urban League and one of those who appeared before the council two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "I compliment the city for the improvements they've made, but they certainly  have some areas they need to work on," Naeem said, referring to the lack of  women and minorities in certain job categories.  </P> <P> "The city doesn't appear to have the right commitment to give promotions and a  career track to those people," Naeem said.  </P> <P> The report was a response to demands made two weeks ago before the Board of  Directors. The speakers addressed concerns that they said had previously been  brought up and inadequately answered in August during a board meeting at the  Jackie Robinson Center.  </P> <P> Among the demands was a request that the city expand a proposed count of  Armenian-Americans to include other minority groups. The special count was  recently approved by the board because the 1990 U.S. Census will not list  population numbers for Armenians, a group included in the city's affirmative  action efforts.  </P> <P> Blacks and Latinos, who say they are typically undercounted by the Census, fear  they will be shortchanged on social services if Armenian-Americans are  accurately counted.  </P> <P> In his report, Curiel suggested that the city's Affirmative Action Commission  review the issue for later recommendations to the board, a suggestion approved  by the board last week.  </P> <P> Curiel also addressed concerns expressed by Antonia Darder, a Latina, who  questioned the city's affirmative action commitment after she failed to secure  an interview for an entry-level administrative job.  </P> <P> Out of 55 applicants for the position, Curiel reported that 67.9% were  minorities. In addition, eight of the 10 finalists were minorities and the  three final candidates were minorities.  </P></p>

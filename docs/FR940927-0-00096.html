This rule codifies in part 282 the prior approval of Kansas' underground storage tank program and incorporates by reference appropriate provisions of state statutes and regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This regulation is effective November 28, 1994, unless EPA publishes a prior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  notice withdrawing this immediate final rule.

EPA published a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document announcing its decision to grant approval to Kansas. (59 FR 29201 June 6, 1994). Approval was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective on July 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA codifies its approval of State programs in 40 CFR part 282 and incorporates by reference therein the state statutes and regulations that will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. Today's rulemaking codifies EPA's approval of the Kansas underground storage tank program. This codification reflects the state program in effect at the time EPA granted Kansas approval under section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a) for its underground storage tank program. Notice and opportunity for comment were provided earlier on the Agency's decision to approve the Kansas program, and EPA is not now reopening that decision nor requesting comment on it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This effort provides clear notice to the public of the scope of the approved program in each state. By codifying the approved Kansas program and by amending the Code of Federal Regulations whenever a new or different set of requirements is approved in Kansas, the status of federally approved requirements of the Kansas program will be readily discernible. Only those provisions of the Kansas underground storage tank program for which approval has been granted by EPA will be incorporated by reference for enforcement purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To codify EPA's approval of Kansas' underground storage tank program, EPA has added &sect;282.66 to title 40 of the CFR. Section 282.66 incorporates by reference for enforcement purposes the State's statutes and regulations. Section 282.66 also references the Attorney General's Statement, Demonstration of Adequate Enforcement Procedures, the Program Description, and the Memorandum of Agreement, which are approved as part of the underground storage tank program under subtitle I of RCRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency retains the authority under sections 9005 and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions to undertake inspections and enforcement actions in approved states. With respect to such an enforcement action, the Agency will rely on federal sanctions, federal inspection authorities, and federal procedures rather than the state authorized analogs to these provisions. Therefore, the approved Kansas enforcement authorities will not be incorporated by reference. Section 282.66 lists those approved Kansas authorities that would fall into this category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public also needs to be aware that some provisions of the State's underground storage tank program are not part of the federally approved state program. These non-approved provisions are not part of the RCRA subtitle I program because they are ``broader in scope'' than subtitle I of RCRA. See 40 CFR 281.12(a)(3)(ii). As a result, state provisions which are ``broader in scope'' than the federal program are not incorporated by reference for purposes of enforcement in part 282. Section 282.66 of the codification simply lists for reference and clarity the Kansas statutory and regulatory provisions which are ``broader in scope'' than the federal program and which are not, therefore, part of the approved program being codified today. ``Broader in scope'' provisions cannot be enforced by EPA; the State, however, will continue to enforce such provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule codifies the decision already made (59 FR 29201 June 6, 1994) to approve the Kansas underground storage tank program and thus has no separate effect. Therefore, this rule does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Thus, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Federal agencies must consider the paperwork burden imposed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any information request contained in a proposed or final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

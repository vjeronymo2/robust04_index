			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Biographies of business Sir, Consolation for Mr Zealander (Letters, March 17) re his complaint about the absence of biographies of modern business leaders. I am finishing a book called The Birth of BT - PO Telecoms and BT 1964-84. It details the achievements and approaches of Sir William Ryland, Sir Edward Fenessy, Sir William Barlow and Sir George Jefferson while they led BT and its predecessor. Like Mr Zealander, I am Post Office - that is public sector - trained and bred. Do our two letters tell you anything about public sector attitudes? We want to learn. John M. Harper, 11 Lullington Close, Seaford BN25 43H</p>

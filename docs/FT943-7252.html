			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Friendly Hotels ahead 42% Friendly Hotels yesterday announced a 42 per cent increase in interim profits as trading improved after a slow start to the period. On turnover ahead 19 per cent to Pounds 16.1m, the pre-tax line for the six months to June 12 rose to Pounds 963,000 (Pounds 679,000), helped by associates' contribution of Pounds 525,000 (Pounds 396,000). Mr Henry Edwards, chairman, attributed the better showing to the 27-strong hotel chain. Improved trading was being maintained in the usually stronger second half, he said, and the group was still seeking 'suitable' acquisitions. The group's 18 serviced offices were encountering competitive trading conditions but maintained occupancy rates. The interim dividend is held at 2.2p on capital increased by last September's Pounds 10m rights issue. Fully diluted earnings were 3.5p (3.3p) per share.</p>

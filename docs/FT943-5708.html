			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Life with Tiny (contd) It would be understating things to say that Mr Roland 'Tiny' Rowland of Lonrho is an anachronism in the sanitised entrepreneurial world of the late 20th century. Despite the mushroom growth of rules, regulations and codes of corporate conduct he is still there, defiant, at the age of 76, even as the remuneration committees roam and the audit committees delve. Yesterday, despite reports of an impending boardroom coup, he emerged with his expenses uncut, his position intact and his life expectancy almost certainly enhanced. It is, of course, an act to which he has devoted some practice. The directors who are hostile to Mr Rowland can console themselves with the thought that he is (probably) mortal. But they will have to hone their skills at corporate trench warfare if they wish to procure any other denouement in the near term. For outside observers the question is whether there are wider lessons to be drawn from the continuing saga surrounding this most durable of maverick entrepreneurs. That seems doubtful because Lonrho is sui generis, even if Mr Rowland is not. But it remains worth asking how the man who built up this huge international conglomerate has been able to run it down again over such a protracted period without anyone pre-empting the process. It is not as if Mr Rowland has had a controlling interest in the company. Yet he has had a remarkably free run in capital markets where the penalties for poor performance have grown harsher in recent years. If he is now under threat from his fellow joint managing director and chief executive, Mr Dieter Bock, it is only because he himself chose to bring him into Lonrho as a potential successor. Straight eight One explanation for Mr Rowland's laissez-passer stems from the outcome of the earlier, notorious boardroom row in 1973, when the so-called straight eight directors failed to unseat him over several issues of corporate governance including excessive expenses. From then on Mr Rowland became a pariah with the big investment institutions, the insurance companies and pension funds responsible for most of the net inflow of cash into the equity market. Yet because he retained the support of small shareholders, Lonrho was transformed into a perfect illustration of the thesis advanced by the American academics Berle and Means, who pointed out the consequences of the divorce between ownership and control. In contrasting the situation in the early 1930s with the days when proprietors held enough stock to exert proper control, Berle and Means showed that the fragmentation of shareholding in the 20th century had deprived shareholders of power and influence. That was certainly the case at Lonrho, where earnings stagnated between 1976 and 1987. Today Lonrho has still not returned to the level of earnings achieved in the upturn that came to a peak in 1988. Yet Mr Rowland hangs on regardless. Dismal performance Elsewhere this dismal performance might have prompted institutional pressure for boardroom change, because the growth of collective investment is helping close the gap between legal ownership and control. Yet without enough large shareholdings at Lonrho until institutional interest recently started to revive, this was never a possibility. As for the alternative discipline of the hostile takeover, Lonrho is a highly indigestible target. With so much of its profits in Africa, and a marked difficulty in generating cash flow, it would never have been an easy business to refocus. The recent rise in the share price on hopes of Mr Rowland's enforced departure suggests that the market regards Lonrho as a vastly more valuable prospect without the man. Yet, historically, potential bidders who have been prepared to contemplate heavy exposure to an economic disaster zone like Africa have always worried about a uniquely African poison pill: the possible dependence of profits on Mr Rowland's personal relations with black African leaders. The broad message, if there is one, is that wider share ownership entails weak accountability and poor corporate governance. The narrower indisputable one is that Mr Rowland is a spent force in business, but not in the boardroom.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al- Sahhaf </F> by Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from the "Arabs' Home"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Hijazi] Your Excellency Iraqi Foreign Minister  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, Iraq recently announced it might  reconsider its stand on Kuwait if the air blockade of Iraq is  lifted. What is your comment?    [Al-Sahhaf] As you know, Iraq has sent the Security Council  a  letter signed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz. The letter  factually explains Iraq's implementation of the measures  required of it in accordance with Resolution 687. The letter  asks the Security Council to implement Paragraph 22 because the  Security Council is responsible for its implementation. The  Security Council is committed to implementing this paragraph  after Iraq implements what is required of it. Paragraph 22  calls for lifting the economic blockade of Iraq. However, if  there are pressures on the Security Council and Iraq implements  its commitments but the Security Council does not implement its  commitments, it is the right of Iraq and the Iraqi people to  take measures that keep them alive and ensure their future.    [Hijazi] Regarding the stand on Kuwait, what is meant by  this  stand on Kuwait? Is it the border or the issue of the prisoners?    [Al-Sahhaf] During contacts between Iraq and a number of  governments that are members of the Security Council, the  representatives of these governments raised the subject of  Kuwait with the Iraqi delegations. Iraq's answer was and still  is based on the paragraphs of the UN Security Council  resolution. In other words, this subject is not connected with  the economic blockade. Paragraph 22 says that if Iraq implements  certain paragraphs dealing with weapons of mass destruction, the  Security Council will implement Paragraph 22 and lift the  embargo on Iraqi exports. The subject of Kuwait has no  connection with this paragraph. If the Security Council member  states want to talk about this subject, Iraq believes that  movement toward implementation of Paragraph 22 should not stop.  If Paragraph 22 is implemented and the economic blockade of  Iraq is lifted, then a positive atmosphere will be created that  will help talks to take place on this subject. Iraq has  expressed its readiness to begin discussions with the Security  Council on this subject.    [Hijazi] The Arab League secretary general has sent two  envoys to the Iraqi Government on the subject of Kuwaiti  prisoners. Recently, it was reported that if Kuwaiti authorities  release the defendants in the attempt to assassinate former U.S.  President Bush, then Iraq will reconsider the subject of  prisoners, in the sense that Iraq has some prisoners.    [Al-Sahhaf] First of all, this issue is completely  groundless. It is a fabrication. The secretary general sent  three envoys: 'Abdallah Adam, Rashid Idris, and Mayhub  al-Bayhubi. The three envoys came to Baghdad in the past two  years only as part of an attempt or an initiative by Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al- Majid to help resolve this problem,  which he describes as hurting the general atmosphere. We  reiterated to all three envoys--as we explained to the Security  Council and the International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC--that there are no prisoners or detainees in Iraq at all.  This issue concerns missing people. We are ready to cooperate  with all parties to probe and investigate to discover the fate  of these missing people. Iraq received the files on 625 missing  people. We have formed special committees that are searching  for and gathering information on these missing people. We are  ready to share any information we gather on any individual whose  name is mentioned and who has a file, with the ICRC and the Arab  League secretary. And, as I said in the news conference, we are  prepared to cooperate with the Gulf states on this subject.</p>

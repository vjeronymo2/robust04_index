			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Japan's MoF in bid to stop equity sell-off by banks JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance has instructed banks not to sell stock market securities as a means of shoring up profits ahead of the March 1993 year-end. The ministry is reviving a directive, issued last August, when it announced a package of measures aimed at restoring confidence in the banking system and the stock market. These included guidelines for banks not to sell stocks ahead of the half-year. Despite brief euphoria over the crown prince's engagement last week, the leading Nikkei stock index has fallen 2.3 per cent on meagre volume since the new year, and investors are growing increasingly worried over a potential sell-off as an increasing number of companies have started to liquidate shareholdings ahead of March. Corporations not under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry are selling stocks in an attempt to prop up faltering profits in the current economic downturn. Japanese companies sold a net Y210bn worth of stocks last month, rising above the Y200bn level for the first time since October 1991. Selling pressure is also expected to increase in March through a potential Y650bn in unwinding of stocks bought on margin, and Y1,000bn in investment trust redemptions. Stock sales by companies may undermine efforts by financial authorities to prevent a 'vicious circle' such as last year when the Nikkei average plunged on stock selling by banks to realise profits on holdings. This eroded unrealised gains on share investments, and created a further need to raise profits by selling shares. Aside from public money from postal savings and the national pension, genuine buying interest seems to have dried up. Nikko Securities said the market now hoped for buying by foreign investors, who in the past have been leading buyers of Japanese shares. The ministry's guidance is likely to prompt criticism from the country's ailing brokers. One securities house official complained that additional regulatory interference to help the banks could further undermine investors' appetite for Japanese shares, which remain expensive at an average price/earnings ratio of 52 times. Last year's trading volume was the lowest since 1975, with activity declining after the government implemented emergency measures to restore investor confidence in August.</p>

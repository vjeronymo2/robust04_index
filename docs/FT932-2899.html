			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Business Post founders paid Pounds 1.3m Business Post, the express parcel and mail business coming to the market later this month, yesterday revealed that Pounds 1.28m was paid to the Kane Brothers, who founded the company, in 1992. Mr Peter and Michael Kane, chairman and managing director respectively, received the money in the form of discretionary bonuses and contributions to their pension funds. When the exceptional non-recurring directors remuneration is excluded from pre-tax profits for 1992, the group made Pounds 2.9m which rose to Pounds 4.2m for the year ended March 1993. Sales rose by Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 33.7m. The pathfinder prospectus also shows that Peter and Michael Kane are on an annual salary of Pounds 105,000 and Pounds 95,000 respectively. Both are entitled to annual bonuses determined by the board. Business Post was formed in 1971 by Mr Peter Kane, who along with family trusts, owns 85 per cent. He was joined three years later by his brother Mr Michael Kane, who owns the remaining 15 per cent. The float is expected to capitalise it at more than Pounds 50m.</p>

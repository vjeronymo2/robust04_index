			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> TEACHERS UNION VOTES TO ACCEPT CONTRACT WITH 5% SALARY INCREASE  </P> <P> Two weeks after they threatened to walk out of classes, members of the Whittier  Elementary Teachers Assn. have approved a new two-year contract with the  14-campus Whittier City School District that includes a 5% wage increase for  the next year, union leaders announced.  </P> <P> The two sides reached a tentative agreement last week, union President Marilyn  Stapleton said. About 87% of the 265 unionized elementary and intermediate  school teachers approved the contract in voting last Thursday and Friday, she  said. Results of the vote were released Monday.  </P> <P> The teachers had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a walkout early in May after  a fact-finding report recommended that the union accept most of the  administration's last offer before the two sides hit an impasse. The walkout  never materialized, however.  </P> <P> Teachers and administrators had been negotiating since the last one-year  contract expired last June.  </P> <P> The two sides reached an impasse this spring, with teachers demanding a 7%  salary increase for the next two years and full fringe benefits for early  retirees.  </P> <P> The district had countered with a 5% wage increase. Under a state mediator,  however, the two sides agreed on a 5% wage increase and a 1% across-the-board  bonus for the first year of the contract. Salary increases for the second year  will be tied to the yearly cost-of-living adjustment. The district has agreed  to provide full fringe benefits to early retirees.  </P> <P> "No one is dancing" about the contract settlement, Stapleton said. "But  everyone is relieved that (the dispute) is over. The teachers feel they made  some headway. That's how we all feel. We made some headway, but not as much as  we would like."  </P></p>

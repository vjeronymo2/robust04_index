			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): The moment of truth is approaching  -Big change, including full disclosure of charges, are imminent / Life insurance If the life insurance sector was being advised by one of its own sales agents, one of the first items to check would be that it had an income protection plan in place. The difficulty might be finding an acceptable premium to cover the short-term risk, given the industry's immediate past record. As the chart shows, shares in the quoted life sector have already been underperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share index for more than a year. But this sector does not give a full picture of the industry. Although it includes two of the giants - Prudential and Legal &amp; General - others, such as Norwich Union and Standard Life, do not feature because they are mutual organisations owned by their policyholders. It also excludes such subsidiaries as Allied Dunbar, which is owned by BAT Industries, and Barclays Life, which is part of the Barclays Bank group. Neither of these is quoted separately, and nor are the life operations of composite insurers. Yet, even if the picture is not a full one, it does not mislead in indicating that the industry as a whole has been finding life hard over the past year or so. And the sector knows it must face fresh uncertainties in the coming months. From January, there will be new rules requiring life companies and independent advisers to give customers more information about policies, charges and commissions. These rules are expected to have a short-term, disruptive impact on sales, although the longer-term implications for new business are harder to read. Some results for life insurers themselves, however, are already becoming clear. Over the past few months, company after company has announced re-structuring of policies, cuts in costs, or changes in paying sales agents and advisers. Sun Alliance today becomes the latest to announce a new range of policies to be sold from January in response to the new rules. It is introducing nine new products, including six personal pensions with a common core and intended to be simpler and more flexible than present policies. (The company is keen to build up its pensions business, where its market share is low compared with its other sales areas.) One aim of the changes is to provide customers with better value if they have to stop making payments early in what should be a long-term policy. This is one of the elements highlighted by the new rules. The improved value is achieved by spreading the commission paid to the sales agent more evenly over the duration of the policy, rather than taking all the charges from the initial payments as often happens now. This cuts sharply how much can be invested early on, and so reduces the amount building up in a fund for the customer. Take a man of 36 who buys a Pounds 200 a month Sun Alliance personal pension plan now with the aim of retiring at 60. He would get only Pounds 1,392 - scarcely more than half of the amount he had paid - if he decided to transfer out of the policy after two years. Under the new arrangements, he would get Pounds 4,710. Life companies hope that higher surrender values will not lead to early lapses of long-term policies. Instead, one theory is that larger amounts invested early on should mean higher values as well when the policy matures. Sun Alliance's plans differ in some ways from the route taken by Standard Life, which believes that customers will be ready to accept a slight dip in maturity values as the price for higher early surrender values. But Standard has sought to minimise this aspect by cutting its own margins so that, in some cases, the maturity values for the new policies are slightly higher despite the change. While companies are adopting various approaches to improving surrender values, at least one aspect of Sun Alliance's plans reflect themes common across the sector. The company says it will move straight to meeting the entire range of disclosure requirements from January, even though companies need not bring in all of them until the summer. Last week, the Prudential also announced it would give each customer full information at the start, and many other companies are taking the same stance. But it might be a mistake to see this as a rush of altruism: making one change to computer systems is cheaper and less disruptive than three successive ones.</p>

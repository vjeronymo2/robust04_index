			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Electricity generators In marking up PowerGen and National Power by 2 and 3 per cent respectively, the market is assuming that Offer's latest intervention further reduces the likelihood of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission reference. Though Offer denies any direct pressure from Whitehall, the government is unlikely to relish another inquiry into a privatised industry so soon after its awkward experience with British Gas. Not only would that get in the way of the government's plans to sell its remaining 40 per cent stakes; the outcome would also be unpredictable, especially if the generators managed to have the inquiry broadened. That may help explain why Mr Stephen Littlechild, the regulator, couched his message in the form of an offer of a deal rather than a threat. It is difficult, though, to see him striking anything other than a weak agreement with the generators. To stimulate competition would require plant sales. Without such disposals, a switch in pricing mechanism may not make much difference to pool prices. Yet Mr Littlechild stressed that plant sales would be voluntary, as if he assumes the generators would happily cede assets that might be used in competition against them. The real shock for the equity market would be if these arguments prompted Mr Littlechild to opt for a reference after all. National Power has out-performed by 30 per cent this year, PowerGen by 50. In contrast to British Gas, investors have never been inclined to fret about the possibility of a reference.</p>

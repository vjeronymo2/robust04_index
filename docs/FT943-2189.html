			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Portugal trims rates as inflation eases Portugal's central bank yesterday cut two important money market rates by half a point in a reversal of the European trend towards higher interest rates. The measure, triggered by falling inflation, will support government efforts to stimulate economic recovery. The Bank of Portugal lowered the emergency lending rate for overnight funds from 12 to 11.5 per cent and the liquidity absorption rate from 9.25 to 8.75 per cent. The variable repurchase rate for seven-day funds was cut by 0.25 points to 9.25 per cent. Lowering these rates will reduce the cost of funds to banks and should filter through the economy as lower lending rates for corporate financing and investment, as well as reductions in personal mortgage and borrowing rates. The repurchase rate is the average rate at which banks trade on the money market. The emergency rate is the cost of funds for banks whose reserves are short at the close of trading. The absorption rate is the rate at which banks can place excess funds with the central bank. Falling inflation, a lower fiscal deficit and a stable currency have enabled the central bank to cut money market rates gradually since they were reintroduced in early July. They had been suspended two months earlier to help fight speculation on the escudo. The central bank's decision to cut the compulsory cash reserve requirement for banks from 17 per cent of deposits to 2 per cent from November 1 should lead to further rate cuts. Existing reserves will initially be absorbed by special bonds. Mr David McWilliams, senior European economist with Union Bank of Switzerland, said Portugal was bucking the trend in the rest of southern Europe by lowering rates and securing a non-inflationary economic climate. 'It is an indication that the Portuguese financial system is becoming increasingly market-oriented,' he said. Year-on-year inflation fell from 6.3 per cent in January to 4.8 per cent in August. The fiscal deficit is forecast to fall to about 6.1 per cent of gross domestic product from 6.9 per cent in 1993. From a low of Es104.5 to the D-Mark during the currency crisis of May, the escudo has appreciated to a current level of about Es101.7. Lower interest rates will help foster recovery from last year's recession, when GDP shrank 1.3 per cent. The government is forecasting growth of about 1 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent in 1993. Analysts said the Bank of Portugal had been under 'moral pressure' from the government to lower interest rates but yesterday's move appeared to reflect supply and demand on the money market. They expect the central bank to halt rate cuts at the first sign of renewed pressure on the escudo.</p>

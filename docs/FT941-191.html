			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Manila agrees deal with IMF The Philippines yesterday completed negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on a three-year financing to support a growth-oriented economic programme, writes Jose Galang in Manila. Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the central bank, said the government would sign a letter of intent to the IMF in April. New credits worth Dollars 650m are being sought from the IMF's Extended Fund Facility. The Philippines is aiming for an economic growth this year of 3.5-4.5 per cent, on a projected inflation of 8.5-10 per cent. If the Philippines meets all targets specified in the letter, this package will be its 'exit programme' from the IMF, according to Mr Singson.</p>

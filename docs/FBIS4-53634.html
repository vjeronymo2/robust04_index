			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yukihiko Machida; from MAINICHI SHIMBUN 21 May Evening </F> Edition]    [Text] Vienna, 20 May -- On 20 May, a councilor at the DPRK  (North Korean) Embassy in Vienna commented on a 19 May proposal  by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to send a  delegation to North Korea in connection with the issue of  inspecting fuel rods at a nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The  councilor said: "We have not yet received a reply from  Pyongyang. However, I expect that a positive answer to the IAEA  proposal will come." He thus disclosed North Korea's intention  to accept the IAEA proposal. In reply to MAINICHI SHIMBUN  questions, the councilor stressed North Korea's positive  attitude toward accepting the IAEA delegation, and clearly said:  "The scale of the delegation is an issue that should be decided  by the IAEA. We have no intention of making any requests on  that."    Moreover, in discussing an IAEA request for the picking of  sample fuel rods, the councilor said: "It is clear that we are  ready to provide basic materials to the IAEA to comply with  safeguard obligations by accepting nuclear inspections." Thus,  he hinted at an intention to take a flexible stance on picking  of the samples.    However, regarding a 19 May IAEA request that the exchange  of  fuel rods be postponed, the councilor said: "I do not think  (North Korea) will accept it." North Korea is expected to  submit an official reply to the IAEA in a day or two.</p>

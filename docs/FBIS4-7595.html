			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The Serbian police have started a new  wave of repression against Albanians in Kosova. Reports confirm  dozens of arrests and cases of maltreatment, as well as many  raided homes. Here is a telephone report by Mehmet Haziri from  Prishtina:    [Haziri] The raiding of Albanian families in Kosova under  the pretext of searching for arms has intensified in the last  few months. Punitive expeditions have been more frequent in the  Llape and Drenice regions.    During the last five months alone, under the pretext of  searching for arms, Serbian police raided 530 Albanian families  in the Podujeve commune, 230 of which were raided as of 1 March.    The Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance  [LDK] branch in Podujeve informs that during March,  approximately 50 persons were brutally maltreated at the city  police station, while 80 others received summons to appear at  the police station and hand over weapons.    LDK activists and Albanian teachers were targets of the  police. Lessons were interrupted many times due to police  intervention, while many elementary school headmasters were  summoned to the police station.    The LDK also reports that 22 peasants from Strovci in  Vushtrri were summoned to the police station for such talks  under the pretext of handing over weapons.    Raids and harassments have been reported in the villages of  Skenderaj, Gjilan, Prishtina, Kline, and Prizren communes. In  Qubrel in Skenderaj, Serbian police attempted to recruit four  Albanian youths for the Serbian Army. The Albanians consider  the Serbian Army foreign and did not respond to the recruiting  summons.</p>

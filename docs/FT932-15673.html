			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Indices to monitor equity returns - At a glance More advanced information will be made available to equity investors from July 1 with the introduction of total return indices for equities. The new indices will take account of dividend income as well as capital growth and will allow investors to compare more closely the performance of their unit and investment trusts (and indeed the building society) with the market. The figures will be calculated gross of tax and will assume that the dividend and tax credit are reinvested on the ex-dividend date. Total return indices will be available for the FT-SE 100, the FT-SE mid 250, the FT-SE Actuaries 350, the FT-SE SmallCap and the FT-A All-share.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks between the government and the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continue in Lusaka.  After a busy morning by the negotiating sides, observers and UN  Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, this afternoon the  government and UNITA delegations met unexpectedly. Our  correspondent Alves Antonio reports:    [Begin Antonio recording] Everything happened unexpectedly.  Although the press knows nothing concrete, it is presumed that  the government and UNITA negotiating teams to the Lusaka peace  talks have reached an agreement on issues relating to specific  principles and ways of implementing the presidential elections.  As the public knows, the general principles on this point were  approved and signed on 15 April. However, there are still  strong differences on specific principles.    Today's tete-a-tete is by itself a positive sign, since by  late this morning the UNITA delegation was still intransigent  and irresolute on its early positions in view of the document  presented by mediator Blondin Beye. Should an agreement be  reached on this issue, a plenary session will be held to approve  the aforementioned document, otherwise the mediators will try to  approach the government and UNITA negotiating teams as they have  been doing. Afterward it will just be a matter of concluding the  document on national reconciliation, as well as reaching an  agreement on ways to implement the approved principles which  include delicate issues, such as the status of UNITA leader  Jonas Savimbi.

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Fleas carrying bubonic plague have been found on squirrels at two campgrounds  in the San Jacinto Mountains near Idyllwild, said Riverside County health  officials. James Lang, public health entomologist for the county health  department, warned campers and hikers not to feed, touch or even get close to  squirrels in the area. The two campgrounds where 10 squirrels tested positive  for the plague-carrying fleas during the last two months were Boulder Basin and  Stone Creek. Boulder Basin is about six miles north of Idyllwild and Stone  Creek is four miles north of the mountain town. Symptoms of the disease are a  reddening of the area around a flea bite, followed by flu-like symptoms. The  plague can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COIN DEALERSHIP SLAYINGS;  </P> <P> POLICE BELIEVE MARINE ACTED ALONE IN DEATHS  </P> <P> An Orange County prosecutor said Friday that a young Tustin Marine appears to  be the only suspect in a "robbery gone awry" that left two people dead and a  third wounded at a Newport Beach rare coin dealership in March.  </P> <P> Eric Jon Wick, a 20-year-old son of a Reno-based FBI agent, made his first  appearance in an Orange County courtroom Friday to answer charges that he  murdered two people and wounded another during a robbery at the Newport Coin  Exchange on March 14.  </P> <P> Wearing Levi's and a white T-shirt, and sporting a traditional Marine Corps  crew cut, the young lance corporal asked to be represented by a public  defender. His scheduled arraignment was postponed one week.  </P> <P> He is charged with murder, attempted murder, robbery and burglary in the deaths  of Clyde Oatts, 45, of Irvine, Renee Ratoon King, 38, and the wounding of her  37-year-old husband, William D. King, owner of the coin business. The Kings  lived in Orange at the time of the shootings. Police said at the time that all  three were shot execution style in the back of the head.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Borris said he will seek two special-circumstance  charges of murder during the commission of a felony, and a third  special-circumstance charge of multiple murder. Those charges mean Wick could  face the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole.  </P> <P> A Nevada attorney who said he will be assisting in the defense of Wick said  they will seek to prove that police have apprehended the wrong man.  </P> <P> "Identification is absolutely a factor," Fred Gibson III, a private attorney  who said he has known the Wick family for several years, said in a telephone  interview from Reno.  </P> <P> Newport Beach detectives have sought to link Wick to the slayings through his  fingerprints, which they say were found on a receipt for the purchase of some  coins and on a display case at the scene of the crime.  </P> <P> But Gibson, a former federal prosecutor in Nevada, dismissed that evidence.  </P> <P> "The place where the shooting took place is a publicly available facility and  just because a person's prints were found doesn't mean that person perpetrated  a crime," Gibson said.  </P> <P> The shootings occurred in the coin exchange offices on MacArthur Boulevard near  John Wayne Airport. Wick is being held without bail in Orange County Jail.  </P> <P> He was arrested June 8 by military investigators at his family's Reno home  after he left the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Station without leave,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Gibson, who said he expects to arrive in Orange County next week, said he has  talked to Wick several times since his arrest but would not characterize his  attitude.  </P> <P> The suspect's father, FBI agent Bruce Wick, mother and two younger sisters were  left "terribly distraught and shocked" by the arrest, Gibson said. "The family  is together and are doing their best to put themselves back together."  </P> <P> Police have said they believe robbery was the motive for the attack and are  trying to link several valuable coins and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic weapon  found in Wick's possession to the slayings.  </P> <P> Wick has no record of convictions for any previous offenses, Borris said. Steve  Merrill, Marine spokesman at the Tustin base, said Wick has never been  court-martialed. Any instances of lesser disciplinary action would not be made  public, Merrill said.  </P> <P> On active duty since May 4, 1988, Wick was a small-arms repairman assigned to  the armory. Merrill said Wick had never been a member of a military shooting  team and did not have the qualifications to use a handgun.  </P> <P> "Most lance corporals are not (qualified for using handguns) and there is no  requirement that you need to be an expert shot to be a weapons repairman," he  added.  </P> <P> Merrill said the Marine Corps will not act to discharge Wick unless he is  convicted of the civilian charges.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Borris said it is not known whether William King will be able to  testify for the prosecution if the case comes to trial.  </P> <P> King is recovering at home from gunshot wounds to the head and chest suffered  during the assault.  </P> <P> "He suffered severe head wounds and we haven't pressed him a lot (in the  investigation)," Borris said. "We have no idea if he will be well enough to  testify."  </P></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: MTM chief departs as TVS starts streamlining MR MEL Blumenthal, chief operating officer of MTM, the US production subsidiary of TVS Entertainment, is to leave the company this week. Mr Blumenthal, who joined the group that made programmes such as Hill Street Blues and Lou Grant in 1977, was a significant shareholder in the production company and made about Dollars 40m from the Dollars 320m sale of MTM to TVS Entertainment in 1988. Management changes will be announced in Los Angeles later this week. Mr Bob Klosterman, chief finance officer of the Hollywood company, will become chief executive. Further job cuts are expected after his appointment. The changes come as TVS starts to prepare its bid to retain its south of England ITV franchise which has to be submitted on May 15. The management of the ITV company, which took MTM off the market in the past few days after failing to find an acceptable buyer at the right price, is now trying to streamline the US company. The great danger is that MTM will be seen as a source of potential financial instability when the Independent Television Commission decides on the bids. The purchase of MTM was the most dramatic diversification of Mr James Gatward, the former TVS chief executive who won the original franchise. It also turned out to be his undoing. He left the company earlier this year after the arrival of Mr Rudolph Agnew as chairman. TVS is one of the strongest advertising regions in the country and the company is likely to face opposition from at least three serious bidders - Carlton Communications, MAI, the advertising and financial services group, and a consortium which brings together David Frost and Richard Branson.</p>

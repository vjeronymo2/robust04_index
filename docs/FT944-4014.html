			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Buy-backs boost the recs - The week ahead MONDAY/TUESDAY WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY: Dividends will be on everyone's minds when seven of the 12 regional electricity companies (recs) report. Analysts are expecting average growth of about 20 per cent. One reason for such healthy increases is that most of them have been busily buying back their shares over the past year. By spreading the same amount of cash over fewer shares, they have found a reasonably economical way of enhancing shareholder returns. A few companies such as Eastern (Monday) and Southern (Tuesday) have not been as active in share buy-backs, so their dividend increases will be of special interest. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 85m for Eastern and Pounds 92m for Southern, and dividend increases of almost 20 per cent. Eastern's propensity for surprises has some market observers hoping for news of a special pay-out. Yorkshire (Thursday), which is forecast to report profits of about Pounds 98m, is also a promising candidate for special payments. The failed bid for a Swedish energy group has left it with a cash pile of about Pounds 100m, which it had not expected to have. Needless to say, investors are hoping for an early Christmas present. Northern Electricity (Monday) is expected to show one of the larger dividend increases with a rise of about 22 per cent. The market is anticipating pre-tax profits of about Pounds 61m. South Western (Thursday) and London (Wednesday) are likely to trail behind with dividend increases of about 18 per cent. Forecasts are for interim profits of Pounds 46m at South Western and Pounds 85m at London. Some investors are hoping for a little clarification from Manweb (Wednesday), which is expected to report profits of about Pounds 53m. Questions are likely to be asked on the abrupt departure of its finance director earlier this year. TUESDAY: Greenalls Group is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year to September of about Pounds 76m (after Pounds 9m of reorganisation costs), against Pounds 68m a year earlier. The diverse group with pub, off-licence, hotel and drinks distribution interests will be boosted by the first full-year contribution from the Devenish pub estate. WEDNESDAY: Southern Water is expected to report interims of about Pounds 68.5m, a 6 per cent increase on last year. The dividend could rise by almost 10 per cent to 8.45p. Southern is one of the few water companies to enjoy earnings enhancement from its non-regulated businesses. This is likely to show further improvement. WEDNESDAY: Chubb Security, the electronic alarms and locks group, is forecast to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 38m-Pounds 41m (Pounds 34.2m) for its first six months. WEDNESDAY: Half-year results from British Land could be overshadowed by events at Stanhope, the troubled developer from which it is hoping to acquire a half share in the City of London's Broadgate office complex. If Stanhope goes into receivership when its banking facilities run out next Monday, British Land will lose its 29.9 per cent stake in the developer. Analysts are expecting the interim figures to show profits before tax of about Pounds 20m, against Pounds 13.1m last year. THURSDAY: The City will pay close attention to the core engineering activities of Trafalgar House, the UK-based group with interests ranging from property and construction to ocean liners. Analysts forecast full-year profits of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 55m, after a Pounds 16m restructuring charge, against losses last time of Pounds 347.2m after Pounds 397m exceptional costs.</p>

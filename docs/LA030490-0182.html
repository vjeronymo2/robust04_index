			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CCAA COACHES OPPOSE THEIR FRIDAY-SATURDAY SCHEDULES, POLL SHOWS  </P> <P> By an overwhelming margin, the men's and women's basketball coaches of the  California Collegiate Athletic Assn. favor a return to a Thursday-Saturday  basketball schedule next season, a Times poll shows.  </P> <P> The conference, which includes Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, played  Friday-Saturday contests this season, except for women's games played on  Thursdays at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The change had been spurred by a vote of  the conference's college presidents, who expressed concern that basketball  players were missing too many classes on travel days. Previously, most contests  in the eight-school league were held on Thursdays and Saturdays.  </P> <P> Ten coaches from the 13 men's and women's teams returning to the CCAA next  season said that students did not suffer severe loss of class time with a  Thursday-Saturday schedule because most road trips did not involve overnight  stays. Several also charged that administrators at Cal State Bakersfield and  Cal Poly San Luis Obispo had duped the presidents into voting for a travel  schedule that served to enhance the home court advantage of the CCAA's two  northernmost schools.  </P> <P> Those in favor of Thursday-Saturday contests said the presidents were not aware  of all the facts when they voted last spring. They cited the hazards of a lack  of preparation time for Saturday opponents and the increased risk of injuries  inherent in back-to-back games. The coaches also noted a drop in the quality of  performances in Saturday games because athletes do not have a day off to  recover, and they complained of the emotional strain on young players and an  unfair advantage to home teams because they do not travel.  </P> <P> Friday games also present increased competition for space in the local  newspapers and media outlets. Friday night is traditionally prep night, when  local high school games are the primary focus of coverage by local media. In  addition, Saturday editions are traditionally some of the smallest sections of  the week, which leaves little space for college games in some towns.  </P> <P> Both Chapman College in Orange and Cal State Dominguez Hills experienced more  than a 50% drop in media coverage this year as a result of playing Friday  games. UC Riverside officials said they also noticed a drop in coverage.  </P> <P> The Division II CCAA consists of Dominguez Hills, San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly  Pomona, Chapman, Riverside, Cal State Los Angeles, Bakersfield and Cal State  Northridge, which will leave the conference this fall to move to Division I.  Bakersfield does not have a women's basketball team.  </P> <P> Conference coaches and some athletic administrators have charged that San Luis  Obispo President Warren J. Baker used an emotional plea of lost class time to  unfairly influence the other conference presidents. Coaches also complained  that the sport of basketball is being unfairly singled out, saying athletes in  sports such as baseball and track miss much more class time.  </P> <P> (The Times survey indicates that officials at only San Luis Obispo unanimously  favor Friday-Saturday games. Coach Pat Douglass of CCAA champion Cal State  Bakersfield said he would support Thursday-Saturday games next year, although  he felt back-to-back weekend contests spur more fan interest.)  </P> <P> Baker reportedly used a fax machine to lobby fellow presidents. Ironically, San  Luis Obispo's basketball teams made just three CCAA overnight road trips this  year.  </P> <P> Both Baker and Mustang Athletic Director Ken Walker were out of town and  unavailable for comment, but Associate Athletic Director Marilyn McNeil  confirmed that the college has long been "against having to play  Thursday-Saturday games."  </P> <P> In the Times survey, the 13 returning coaches were asked: "Given a choice for  the 1990-91 (season), on which days would you prefer to play your games?" Only  men's Coach Steve Beeson and women's Coach Jill Orrock of San Luis Obispo  wanted to play Friday-Saturday games, citing missed class time.  </P> <P> Said Beeson: "For us, every trip is an overnight trip; it takes away from  classes."  </P> <P> Women's programs at other conference members have their own travel problems,  however. Because San Luis Obispo played all of its women's home games on  Thursdays and Saturdays this fall, the other six women's teams in the  conference had to drive an average of 3 1/2 hours from the Los Angeles area on  the afternoon of a night game, or leave a day early, thereby causing players to  miss classes.  </P> <P> Most vehemently opposed to the Friday-Saturday setup was UC Riverside Coach  John Masi, who called the presidents' decision "bogus." He said the presidents  were not made aware of all the ramifications of their vote.  </P> <P> "There is no way you can ask these players to play on back-to-back nights and  have them be successful," said Masi, the most victorious coach in CCAA history.  "Friday should be a rest day. Just about every conference in the country does  it."  </P> <P> In a memo written by Pomona basketball coaches Dave Bolwinkel and Darlene May  and sent to McNeil of San Luis Obispo and the CCAA scheduling committee, the  pair said a day of rest between games lessens the chance for injury and  improves the quality of games.  </P> <P> "The effort level has not been what it has been in the past," Bolwinkel, a  third-year coach, told The Times.  </P> <P> First-year Coach Bob Boyd of Chapman said back-to-back road games put L.A.-area  teams at a disadvantage when traveling to play at Bakersfield and San Luis  Obispo. To save on travel expenses, teams from L.A., such as Dominguez Hills,  have always played at the two northernmost schools in the CCAA in a single road  trip. That is expected to change temporarily next season, with the exit of  Northridge, but may return in 1991-92 season when the CCAA adds Cal State San  Bernardino.  </P> <P> Third-year Coach Henry Dyer of Cal State L.A. says basketball has been singled  out because of its popularity with fans.  </P> <P> "It's an overkill on the visible sports. (The presidents allow) baseball to  play 63 games a year and track and field to go to Europe for three weeks, but  they don't want us to go from here to Bakersfield."  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai, a 13-year veteran of the conference who was  recently appointed to be the assistant coach for the West team in this summer's  Olympic Festival, said a good compromise would be playing on Friday nights and  Sunday afternoons.  </P> <P> Meeting in Pomona Thursday in conjunction with the annual CCAA postseason  tournament, the women's coaching group voted to return to a Thursday-Saturday  schedule next year. The men's coaches, meeting in Bakersfield at the men's  finals, are expected to follow suit. The recommendation will then be forwarded  to the CCAA Executive Committee.  </P></p>

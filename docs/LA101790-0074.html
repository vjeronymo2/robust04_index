			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTDOWN AGAIN? FORGET ABOUT IT;  </P> <P> IDEOLOGY, NOT COMPROMISE, IS ENEMY OF PEOPLE  </P> <P> There they go again. Congress, still a house divided on the budget, and the  President, still threatening to shut down the federal government again at  week's end if a budget accord isn't reached. When will it end?  </P> <P> Maybe not before the November congressional elections, sad to say.  </P> <P> Shutting down Washington a weekend ago may have narrowed the political gap  between President Bush and Congress over how to cut the federal deficit. And it  certainly got everyone's attention. But the gap actually widened again Tuesday,  despite White House hints that Bush would veto a new Democratic budget plan. So  even his own party's leaders in Congress think he should forget about closing  down the federal government again. The joke's growing stale -- and the trick  just isn't going to work.  </P> <P> THE PROBLEM: The urgency of hammering the deficit down by $40 billion in the  next budget remains. That is still Congress' job. A poll last week suggested  that by about 2 to 1, people thought Congress would do better at cutting the  deficit than Bush. Four months of summit meetings between Congress and the  White House have at least settled the question of whether deficits can be cut  deeply enough without a combination of higher taxes and lower spending. They  cannot.  </P> <P> Congress rejected the summit version of a budget because the mix of tax  increases and spending cuts did not suit the members, and they've been  searching for a new mix ever since. But if Congress misses the new Friday  deadline for a budget Bush can live with, its failure will involve ideologies  and politics so rigid that leaving federal government at half-mast into next  month probably would not budge anyone much.  </P> <P> Common Cause, a citizen's lobby in Washington, is right about one thing.  Because campaign financing laws tilt so far in their favor, incumbents leave  only when they die or get a better job offer. But for most members Congress  becomes such a career that their fear of offending voters and losing their jobs  borders on paranoia.  </P> <P> THE SOLUTION: For House Republicans, the greatest fear lies in raising taxes,  so they put together their own budget of spending cuts without tax increases  Tuesday. It fell one-third short of its deficit target and did not make it to a  vote.  </P> <P> Democratic paranoia stems from cuts in spending for social programs, increases  in Medicare premiums and tax increases that fall more heavily on middle-income  Americans than on the wealthy. They, too, put together a package, and while  they have the numbers to pass it despite their Republican colleagues'  objections, they may not have enough votes to get it past Bush's putative veto.  </P> <P> But for Washington to get a budget before election day, it must split the  difference between Tuesday's diverse approaches. As we've argued before, a  practical budget deal will involve some give on both sides of the aisle --  Republicans will have to accept new taxes and Democrats will have to give Bush  and the GOP a capital gains tax cut, or some such concession that they require.  </P></p>

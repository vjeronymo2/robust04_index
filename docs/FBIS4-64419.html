			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evin Goktas: "Prosecutors Issue Statement on </F> Secularism"]    [Text] Antalya--The summit of prosecutors, which was held  under Minister of Justice Seyfi Oktay, adopted a joint statement  against antisecular activities. Stressing that the statement  represented the joint voice of jurisprudence in the country,  Yusuf Kenan Dogan, under secretary of the Ministry of Justice,  said: "All the enemies of the nation, be they fundamentalists  or separatists, must heed that voice."    The statement, which was signed by all the Republic's  prosecutors and chief prosecutors, was disclosed by Ertem  Turker, chief prosecutor of Mugla. It included the following:  "The Republic's chief prosecutors and prosecutors have very  carefully assessed the recent irresponsible activities that are  aimed at changing the secular form of our state and basing it on  fundamentalist principles. Legal measures will definitely be  taken against those activities. The Turkish people must have  confidence in the Republic's prosecutors in that regard.  Secularism is one of the state's inalienable and undeniable  principle that cannot be ignored. Consequently, any concession  on that principle will be tantamount to renouncing democracy and  the republic. Therefore, vigilance must be maintained against  the antisecular inclinations and activities more than ever  before. The Republic's prosecutors have expressed their  resolute will to continue to support and protect the secular  system."  <H5>  Demiral Warns Politicians </H5>   Nusret Demiral, chief prosecutor of the State Security Court  in Ankara, has assessed the joint statement. He warned the  politicians to adopt a cautious approach. Stressing that the  statement was crystal clear, Demiral said: "Our politicians and  all the officials must realize the meaning of the views we have  expressed to avoid pushing the state toward an unfavorable  direction or representing it in a negative way. We shall take  action against them if they ignore that. We can take action  against anyone, including Prosperity Party Leader Necmettin  Erbakan. We have taken action against many officials in the  past."    Ahmet Koksal, chief prosecutor of the State Security Court  in  Istanbul, expressed his views: "The meaning of that statement  is exactly what you understand from it. Our message is quite  clear. Those who fail to comply will definitely be confronted  with the sanctions that are called for by the laws. As in the  case of all the other forces, the Republic's prosecutors and  judicial officials maintain a steadfast stance on the question  of protecting democracy and the free system. No one must worry  in that regard."    Nazmi Sarvan, chief prosecutor of Ankara, described the  statement as a "memorandum." He said: "The reaction in the  community reached a peak in the summit. The joint statement we  have issued is the expression of the final form of that  reaction. The statement is the joint voice of the secular  republic's jurisprudence. I am convinced that it is an  effective lesson and warning to those who are opposed to  secularism. They may draw conclusions from the joint statement  if they wish."</p>

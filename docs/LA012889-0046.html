			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMNIST'S VIEWPOINT IS WAY OFF THE MARK  </P> <P> I seem to be one of the few who support John Thompson's walkout. Thompson acted  on his beliefs. Other coaches were vocal but would not dare leave the fate of  their teams in the hands of an assistant coach. . . .  </P> <P> But the point everyone seems to be missing is the fact that a football or  basketball player cannot make it to the NFL or NBA without going to college. Is  it right to deprive these athletes of a chance at realizing a dream because of  a test?  </P> <P> I say keep Proposition 48 the way it is. Make the kids study and get their  grades up to gain eligibility.  </P> <P> SCOTT BURKS  </P> <P> San Bernardino  </P></p>

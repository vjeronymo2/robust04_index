			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lower credit costs boost Chemical Bank result FALLING credit costs and a one-off tax benefit pushed post-tax earnings at Chemical Banking Corporation ahead to Dollars 502m, or Dollars 1.84 a share, in the third quarter, compared with Dollars 381m in the previous three months. Chemical also announced the appointment of a new president, Mr Edward Miller, who will take over when Mr Walter Shipley becomes chairman at the end of the year. Mr Miller, 52, was one of three candidates who had been in contention for the job, which arises because of the retirement of chairman Mr John McGillicuddy, 62. Leaving aside the tax benefit, which added Dollars 140m more than had been anticipated to earnings, and a Dollars 115m pre-tax charge (Dollars 67m after tax) to reflect costs associated with the merger with Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical's net earnings for the period would have been Dollars 429m, or Dollars 1.55 a share. Mr McGillicuddy said the quarter had seen strong increases in revenues in many of the bank's businesses. Due to improvements in credit quality, non-performing assets at the end of September had fallen to Dollars 4.1bn, from Dollars 6.6bn a year before. The loan-loss provision during the period fell to Dollars 298m, from Dollars 330m a year before. Third-quarter figures at Wells Fargo also reflected the benefit of improvements in credit quality, as net income rose to Dollars 165m, or Dollars 2.74, from Dollars 24m, or 21 cents, a year ago. The loan-loss provision, at Dollars 120m, was down from Dollars 140m in the preceding three months and Dollars 400m in the third quarter of 1992.</p>

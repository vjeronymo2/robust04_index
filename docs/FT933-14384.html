			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Lull in French franc drama ALL EYES were on the French franc when the European markets opened yesterday, but those expecting high drama were disappointed, writes Stephanie Flanders. The currency was still weak in early European trading, but was able to fluctuate between FFr3.410 and FFr3.415 to the D-Mark for most of the day without any concerted effort by speculators to take it lower. The franc ended at FFr3.414, slightly better than Monday's close of FFr3.416. The only visible move by either the French or the German authorities was the Bundesbank's announcement of a variable repo rate for today's German market trading. This had been widely expected, leaving the markets to wait to see whether the German central bank would ease policy in the coming days. Most traders thought that there would have been little point in further interventions yesterday by the Bank of France or the Bundesbank. This was because pressure on the franc was not at a critical point where strategic defensive purchases by the authorities could turn a currency's prospects around. If anything, speculators were suspending judgment on the franc until later in the week. 'What we are seeing is the same old war of attrition between the markets and the authorities,' said Ms Alison Cottrell at Midland Global Markets. Many traders expect the Bundesbank to reduce the repo rate tomorrow by 4 to 5 basis points, but Ms Cottrell does not think that many traders are lining up to make dramatic assaults on the franc before the Bundesbank council meeting tomorrow. 'There is too much chance of getting one's fingers burnt,' she said. Sterling received an unexpected boost yesterday from favourable domestic output figures released during the morning. Immediately following the announcement, the British currency gained more than a pfennig against the D-Mark, and it closed even higher at DM2.5700, against the previous day's DM2.5550 finish. It was also strong against the dollar, climbing more than 1 1/2 cents to close at Dollars 1.4935, against Dollars 1.4780 previously. Meanwhile, the dollar had lost ground during the day, thanks to some relaxing of tensions within the ERM and official data showing a surprise 0.3 per cent decline in US wholesale prices for June. 'The US data showed that concerns about an imminent tightening by the Federal Reserve were misplaced,' said Mr Julian Callow of Kleinwort Benson in London. 'This has taken some of the gloss off the dollar, but the knowledge that European rates are set to fall makes a bigger fall against the D-Mark unlikely.' The US unit closed at DM1.7200, down from Monday's DM1.7285. In New York it ended at DM1.7185. The Danish krone suffered alongside the French currency. Dealers in Denmark said they did not expect central bank intervention unless the krone fell to its floor.</p>

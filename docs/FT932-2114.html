			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Europe's Jobs Crisis: Don't blame the service economy .. - Why is unemployment so much worse in the European Community than in the US or Japan? Is it the recession, or are there deeper factors?  / FT writers report as EC leaders seek answers at today's summit IN A REGION as large and diverse as the EC, it is risky to generalise about unemployment. Whatever the headline figure, the patterns vary widely between countries and economic sectors. But one basic fact needs to be taken into account. The jobless total is not just the product of recent events such as recession and German unification. Europe's unemployment has been rising for decades. At the peak of the economic cycle in 1979, EC unemployment stood at 5.4 per cent. At the next peak in 1990 it was 8.3 per cent. In the US and Japan, this pattern is reversed. Between the two cyclical peaks the rate fell. It is tempting to attribute this to the relative decline of European industry. In most EC countries, the industrial workforce has been falling for years. Recently another phenomenon has been added: a shake-out of jobs in service sectors such as banking and finance. The resulting argument has a certain instinctive appeal. European industry, it is said, is being priced out of work by developing countries. Industry is basic to the economy, and services depend on it. If services are deprived of an industrial base, they are not robust enough to fill the jobs gap. The argument does not quite fit the facts. Granted, there has been a marked shift away from manufacturing over the years. The OECD calculates that in 1970, blue-collar workers outnumbered white-collar workers in all 12 EC states except the UK, Germany and Holland. By 1990, white-collar workers were in the majority in every country except Spain. But the same shift has happened elsewhere, notably Japan. The steady fall in industrial employment is common to most developed countries, as a consequence of factory automation. Provided industrial output carries on rising, a falling level of industrial employment need not damage the economy as a whole. In the EC, 62 per cent of jobs are now in services. But in the US, where unemployment is lower, the figure is 72 per cent. Nor is it true that services have failed to provide employment. In the decade 1981-91, the EC lost 3.1m jobs in industry. In the same period, farming lost 3.3m jobs. Employment in services rose by 14.9m, producing a net increase in jobs of 8.5m. Unfortunately, this was more than offset by a rise of 12m in the EC workforce; but that can hardly be blamed on the service sector. But recent employment trends in services are slightly worrying. It used to be argued that productivity gains were harder to obtain in services than in manufacturing, since no amount of automation could do much to improve the output of a barber or a lawyer. Recent events in the UK, for instance, have put that in question. BT made 35,000 workers redundant last year, 19,000 of them on a single day. The main retail banks lost 10,000 workers, partly because hole-in-the-wall cash machines replaced cashiers at the counter. But the trend should not be exaggerated. As the OECD remarks, while the service sector has been hit harder in this recession than in previous ones, the worst job losses have still come in manufacturing and construction. And if there are more white-collar workers out of work now than in previous recessions, that is simply because there are more of them around than before. On the other hand, that fact helps to explain one curious aspect of the present recession in regional terms. In previous recessions, the worst-hit regions within countries were regularly those with the highest unemployment to start with. In this recession the opposite is true. The accompanying map, compiled from the latest comparative data from last year, illustrates the trend. In the two years to end-1991, according to OECD calculations, the unemployment rate in UK regions with the lowest rate to start with rose by 4 percentage points. In those with the highest starting rate it rose 1.5 percentage points. Regional differentials have been compressed in this recession, where previously they had widened. In the UK's case, the reason is obvious: that a disproportionate number of jobs were lost in financial services in London and south-east England. Again, though, generalising about regions or countries is dangerous. Portugal, for instance, should logically be suffering badly. At the start of the 1980s it had 28 per cent of its workforce in the most endangered sector of all, agriculture. Sure enough, by 1991 its farm workforce had plunged by a quarter. But its industrial employment had risen by 15 per cent and jobs in services by 65 per cent. Portugal's unemployment rate is now 6 per cent, compared to 21 per cent in Spain.</p>

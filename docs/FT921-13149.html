			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: More invective but fewer choices - Political Notebook IT HAS not taken long for Britain's leaders to demonstrate once again one of the more unhappy truths of modern politics: the level of hyperbole and invective in political debate rises in inverse proportion to the real differences between those engaged in it. Journalists who have trudged along to the morning rounds of press conferences that since the new year have become a general election campaign in all but name could not have been presented with an apparently starker choice. Mr Chris Patten offers the image of a Labour government determined to rob the people of their incomes and hand the keys to 10 Downing Street to a few trade union leaders before leaving it defenceless, facing the likes of Saddam Hussein. For Mr Jack Cunningham, the Conservatives are set on a stategy that would cast Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the role of a moderate socialist. The health service and welfare state would be dismantled, Britain would be detached from Europe and the remainder of the country's manufacturing industry would be replaced by fast-food outlets paying slave wages. Standing for the moment on down reinforces both messages: only a vote for the Liberal Democrats can save Britain from two equally awful fates. Deep beneath the invective, it is possible to discern real choices for the electorate. Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock hail from similarly humble backgrounds. But there is little coincidence in their views on the respective role of state help and self-help for the individual. Mr Kinnock believes in greater equality, Mr Major that everyone should have a roughly equal chance of becoming unequal. The Conservatives would spend a fair proportion of the so-called growth dividend on tax cuts, Labour would devote it to the public sector. The redistribution of wealth towards the more affluent in the 1980s might well be reinforced by Mr John Major's plans to whittle down inheritance and capital taxes. Mr Neil Kinnock's tax plans, painful though they would be for those in the top income brackets, would involve a relatively modest reversal of the trend in favour of those lower down the scale. Their respective approaches to constitutional reform - the Conservatives want none of it while Labour is committed to many of its own MPs have realised - provide another area of less-noticed but important contrast. There is a sense, equally, that the practice of government under Mr Major or Mr Kinnock might well provide a much sharper divergence than their manifestos will hint at. Both sound more convincing in their attacks on what the other would actually do than on what they have said they will do. Even so, neither can dispute that the essential difference between politics at the start of the 1990s and that at the start of the 1980s is that both the Conservatives and Labour recognise that the job of government is to manage rather than to change the world. Mrs Thatcher's permanent revolution is as defunct as Mr Michael Foot's Alternative Economic Strategy. That the voters have sensed this is self-evident. A glance at the opinion polls shows that, with occasional blips, support for the main parties has settled at 40 per cent. The Liberal Democrats can claim about 15 per cent. The reality is that both Mr Major and Mr Kinnock are in tune with the mood of the country - and neither believes that the gap that will separate them after the votes are counted will be any more than 3 points or 4 points. So an election campaign already more frenetic and ferocious than any fought by Mrs Thatcher is being waged to win the allegiance for a single day of a couple of hundred thousand voters in a few dozen marginal constituencies. There must, as one minister commented this week, be a better way.</p>

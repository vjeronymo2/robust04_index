			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Alejandro Mendez] </F>   [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 16 Jun (EFE) --  Diplomacy has again rearranged words and has resorted to the  "fine print" of international agreements to overcome points of  discrepancy among the 21 countries that signed the "Declaration  of Cartagena de Indias."    The situation of Cuba and the "landlocked position" of  Bolivia and Paraguay were the cause of difficult negotiations  among the foreign ministers of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit,  which concluded Wednesday in the Colombian Caribbean city of  Cartagena de Indias, according to different diplomatic sources.    Another thorny issue was the Argentine proposal to include  an  antiabortion statement, which was debated under the umbrella of  the "defense of human life" to which the declaration finally  alluded. The negotiations led to a change in the text, which  toned down the implicit all-out defense of privatization that  appeared in the preliminary drafts of the document.    Also, the recommendation to prevent an "excessive emphasis"  on economic adjustment plans, which could affect state help to  the neediest population, was eliminated from the draft. The  corrected and eliminated points were a source of irritation to  countries, such as Argentina, which have seen their levels of  absolute poverty and unemployment rise, despite a parallel  growth of the gross national product achieved through fiscal  austerity.    The document, which maintained the neoliberal aspect of the  policies that are applied by the majority of the countries, was  signed by Cuban leader Fidel Castro, in exchange for a more  vigorous mention of the U.S. embargo against the island. The  mention of Cuba, although indirect, includes the words  "coercive" and "unilateral," which happens for the first time in  an Ibero-American statement since the "summits" began four years  ago in the Mexican city of Guadalajara.    Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, who organized and hosted  the event, asked that the "landlocked" topic that annoys Chile  be discussed by the foreign ministers of that country, together  with the foreign ministers of Paraguay and Bolivia. Bolivians  have claimed formally since 1979 the territories on the Pacific  Ocean that they lost to the Chileans in a war last century. The  controversy was unleashed by the recommendation to "seek more  favorable conditions for countries of relatively less  development," with a "special" mention of the "landlocked"  position of Paraguay and Bolivia.    The foreign ministers struck out the names of Paraguay and  Bolivia and replaced the controversial wording with "the factors  of the geographical situation referred to in the last paragraph  of Article 18 of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty (ALADI)," that is  the unnamed "landlocked" situation. Argentine President Carlos  Menem promised Pope John Paul II he would promote an  Ibero-American condemnation of abortion, with a view to the  upcoming World Conference on Population and Development that  will be held this coming September in Cairo.    Laws in Spain, Portugal, and Mexico, however, give women the  right to resort to abortion under given conditions. This  precluded reaching a unanimous decision. The matter was  overcome at the last minute with the inclusion of the  "commitment" to "respect the right of human life, the right to  health, and the quality of life of mothers and children" and "to  contribute in an relevant manner" to the meeting in Cairo.</p>

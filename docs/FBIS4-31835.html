			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by PS, CEG: "Reforms of the State Center Will Wait"] </F>   [Text]The government decided to refer some draft laws  reforming the governmental administration (among them, a law on  the Council of Ministers), for further consideration. The draft  laws envision a change in the government's structure, making the  posts of voivods political, as well as the establishment of an  apolitical corps of state officials.    "Prior to today's government session, there were three  options: The government could have adopted the draft laws  reforming the central administration as soon as today, it could  have repealed the draft laws, or it could have referred them for  further consideration" -- said Minister Michal Strak after  Tuesday's Council of Ministers session. "And so, the government  chose the third option, which -- bearing in mind the complex  nature of the issues that the draft laws deal with -- satisfies  me completely."    In two weeks, the government will again debate the draft  laws  discussed on Tuesday.    Regarding the proposed law on the Council of Ministers, it  is  being suggested -- among others -- that a change be made in the  ministries' structure, from a "branch-oriented" structure, to a  "task-oriented" one. The prime minister would be empowered to  appoint ministers, and to assign specific tasks to them. He  will not be restricted by the individual ministries' strictly  defined powers, the way he has been up to now.    "We are suggesting that new Council of Ministers committees  be established. Up to now, we have only had the Economic  Committee, the Socio-Political Committee, and the Defense Issues  Committee -- all of them being committees of the Council of  Ministers" -- Strak said. "The government will only decide the  most important issues, while all the details will be debated  during the committees' sessions."    The law on territorial administrative organs would increase  the powers of voivods by making voivodship special  administration offices, subordinate to voivods. The provision  aroused controversy among the ministers because they had doubts  as to whether the need to consult voivods regarding each and  every directive given to special administration organs -- which  are territorial offices subordinated to the ministries -- "will  improve the work of the ministries or of voivods."    But the law on civil state service, did not arouse major  controversy. It envisions the establishment of an apolitical  corps of state officials. The political corps on the other  hand, would be composed of the ministers and deputy ministers.  Voivods would also be political posts -- they would be under an  obligation to resign in the case of the government's dismissal.    The government did not, however, deal with the Foreign  Ministry's statute. The issue will be debated at a future  session, along with the statutes of two other ministries.</p>

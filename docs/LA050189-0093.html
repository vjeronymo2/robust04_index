			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> GUY'S FANS TOO EASY TO PLEASE  </P> <P> Guy got away with murder Saturday at the sold-out Universal Amphitheater in the  first of the night's two shows.  </P> <P> This R&amp;B/dance unit hoodwinked the audience, which was loaded with swooning  females in their late teens. Fronted by lead singer Aaron Hall, Damian Hall and  producer Teddy Riley, Guy put on a show that was all flash and no substance.  But it was such a slick con job that the audience didn't know what hit them.  </P> <P> These guys know that to please the female teen crowd in concert you have to be  slender, well-muscled and a good dancer, and be backed by a band that can  provide powerful dance rhythms.  </P> <P> How about competent singing? Obviously not necessary. Aaron Hall's sloppy  vocals certainly didn't turn Saturday's crowd off.  </P> <P> Riley, a bona fide studio wizard at 21, deserves credit for masterminding Guy's  album, which has sold nearly 1 1/2 million. He's tapped into a sound that turns  the young black audience on. But he and his colleagues in Guy haven't found a  way to translate that sound to the stage. Apparently there's no hurry.  Audiences seem to be quite satisfied with that diet of flash Guy is serving up.  </P> <P> Speaking of pulling the wool over an audience's eyes, rapper M. C. Hammer --  sandwiched in between Guy and short sets by Today and Kid 'n Play -- is a  capable con man, too. He gave the audience lots of noise and glitz -- including  go-go dancers and smoke machines -- laced with racy movements and sexy chatter.  </P> <P> On his records, Hammer is a passable rapper, but amid all that noisy  accompaniment, most of his lyrics were unintelligible. But when a good-looking,  well-built, high-stepping rapper is cavorting in front of an audience of  rapturous female teens, the last thing on their minds is lyrics. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

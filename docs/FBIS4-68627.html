			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Barbashev, executive secretary of the </F> Ukrainian Nuclear Society, laboratory manager at the Odessa  Polytechnical University, and candidate of physical-mathematical  sciences: "A Sore Subject--To Whom To Entrust Reactors:  Personnel Problems in the Nuclear Power Industry of Ukraine  Demand Immediate Resolution"]    [Text] The nuclear power industry is almost the only branch  of the national economy of Ukraine that ended 1993 and the first  quarter of 1994 with an appreciable increase in the volume of  production. Fourteen Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric power  station] units in 1993 produced 75.2 billion kilowatt-hours, or  32.9 percent of the total output of electric power in the state.  The plan task, set at the beginning of 1993, was fulfilled by  111 percent, and in addition, the price of a nuclear  kilowatt-hour was the lowest.    In the winter of this year the AES's of Ukraine were  producing up to 40 percent of the total production of electric  power in Ukraine. These results are even more meaningful in that  they were achieved under conditions of a growing economic  crisis. They indicate the great potential of the nuclear power  industry and its great vitality and stability.    As calculations and even life itself show, without nuclear  energy the formation and development of all industry, which also  means the economy of Ukraine, is impossible, and a rise in the  standard of living of the 52 million people of Ukraine is  impossible. President Leonid Kravchuk with complete  justification and accountability announced recently that nuclear  electric power stations are the salvation of Ukraine today.    Nevertheless, the situation in the nuclear industry of  Ukraine is very difficult. All AES's are in a very serious  economic position. Starting with the second half of 1993,  practically no fresh fuel was bought because of a shortage of  resources, spent fuel was not removed to prolonged storage, and  a breakdown occurred in contractual relations between many  plants, institutes, and AES's for equipment, spare parts, and  scientific service for the industry.    The problem of the highly qualified personnel drain is  severe, and a system to provide personnel for the industry in  Ukraine has not yet been established. Comprehensive scientific  and information tracking is absent, all of which has a negative  effect on AES safety. If the problems of the nuclear power  industry are not faced and urgent measures undertaken, in a  short time it could cease to exist as an economically effective  and ecologically safe industry. Traditional (thermal) power  engineering, especially the revived types of power engineering  (wind, solar, hydro, etc.), will not be able to cope with the  requirements of the national economy of Ukraine. But this could  lead to a crash of the whole economy of our state.    A serious discussion about all this transpired at a meeting  of the president of Ukraine with AES directors held at the  beginning of March. Its result was the presidential edict  concerning urgent measures for the development of Ukraine's  nuclear power industry.    In the context of the outlook for the development of the  industry, something should be said particularly about the  problem of providing it with qualified personnel. This question  is being addressed by the Commission for Nuclear Policy under  the president of Ukraine. Inasmuch as I am a member of the  working group for the creation of a national personnel training  system, which works under the commission, I would like to share  some ideas in this regard.    The number of AES personnel in Ukraine is now on the order  of  40,000, of which 25,000 are industrial-production personnel.  Personnel turnover has reached 10-12 percent per year, which is  explained mainly by the departure of highly qualified personnel  for Russia, where wages and the standard of living of atomic  scientists is much higher than in Ukraine.    The training of young engineers for the AES's according to a  small list of nuclear specialties is conducted in Ukraine only  three times a year--in the Kiev and Odessa polytechnical  universities and the Sevastopol naval institute. Considering  that the Sevastopol institute just began training students in  1993, and that the Kiev and Odessa VUZ's [higher educational  institutions] can graduate only about 130 persons (and, indeed,  will all of them go to work in an AES?), a catastrophic level of  specialist shortage can be observed.    Analysis of the personnel requirements of the AES'S of  Ukraine indicates a need for the immediate establishment of a  Ukrainian national system of personnel training for nuclear  power enterprises and organizations and for the industry of  Ukraine.    The draft of such a program has been created by specialists  of the Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power [Goskomatom]. It  contains a complex of studies that in a compressed timeframe  (three to five years) will permit ensuring the maximum possible  effectiveness of the personnel training system within the scope  of the traditional structures of the Ministry of Education of  Ukraine. Thus, the preliminary elaborations of the group of the  Commission on Questions of Nuclear Policy show that as early as  1995 the nuclear industry of Ukraine can receive on the order of  400 nuclear engineers according to a broad list of specialties.  But for this it is necessary to unite and coordinate the efforts  of all interested departments and organizations, from the AES's  to the Supreme Council and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.    First, it is necessary to have immediate special purpose  financing and technical support of the Ministry of Education and  its institutes, which will train personnel for the nuclear  industry. Second, it is necessary to train highly qualified  teaching personnel, who in their turn will be able to train  professional nuclear scientists.    Are there such people in Ukraine? In my view, there are.  However, because of a distortion in the assessment of spiritual  and moral values in the direction of the commercial side of  life, normal work and the existence of such people have become  impossible, and many of them were compelled to seek other, more  "profitable" jobs. The search for qualified teachers and their  training is a complicated process. It can be successfully  resolved only given appropriate material support of teachers on  the part of the state.    The problem of training science teachers for the nuclear  power industry of Ukraine, in my opinion, is the key to the  development of the nuclear power industry. Whether the  VUZ's--the principal executors of the program--are ready for  this will be shown by the results of their work in the 1994-1995  academic year.</p>

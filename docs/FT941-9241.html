			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / BCCI: The view from Abu Dhabi - Andrew Jack interviews the emirate's man at the bank If one man can best describe the feelings of Abu Dhabi and its involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, it is Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui. Since regulators closed BCCI in July 1991, Abu Dhabi has faced lawsuits, allegations surrounding its knowledge of fraud, and criticism from creditors, regulators and politicians alike, all compounding its own financial losses and personal embarrassment in connection with the collapse. 'Creditors should be grateful for what Abu Dhabi has done,' says Mr Mazrui. 'We think they should understand we are not the only ones to blame, and maybe not at all to blame.' Mr Mazrui is chairman of the department of private affairs of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, and is in charge of the government working group established when the financial problems of BCCI emerged in 1990. He sat on the board of BCCI companies from 1981, when Abu Dhabi acquired a 10 per cent stake through its investment authority. When in 1991 the Bank of England commissioned a secret investigation into BCCI scattered with code-words to preserve confidentiality, he was dubbed 'Robin'. Until now he has spurned publicity, but last week Mr Mazrui put his government's case in an interview, interrupted by a call to prayers from a nearby mosque and by officials bringing documents for him to sign. In the last few weeks he helped conclude an agreement with the US authorities allowing them complete access to the bank's records, and promising to hand over by April Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive who is on trial in Abu Dhabi. Mr Mazrui expresses confidence in his government's actions after the point at which he says it became aware of financial problems at BCCI in April 1990. 'We have nothing to fear,' says Mr Mazrui. 'We started on a long journey. All the time we discover that we are more confident about ourselves. We fear absolutely nothing that Naqvi does unless he dreams or writes fiction.' The story of Abu Dhabi's links with BCCI extends back to the initial friendship and financial support offered by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, to Agha Hassan Abedi, founder of the bank, from its creation in 1972. They culminate in the purchase of new and existing shares in the bank in April 1990 at the time Mr Naqvi told it of substantial losses staunched by money stolen from Abu Dhabi's Dollars 2.2bn investment portfolio, and pleaded for financial support. That led to the state's shareholding - split between members of the ruling family and those of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority - rising to 77 per cent. Mr Mazrui joined the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority when it was created in 1976 and it was in this role that he became the government's representative as a director on the board of BCCI in 1981. But he insists he had no inkling of financial troubles, and little expertise or time to devote to the bank. 'I'm not a banker as such,' he says. He admits that he was aware of rumours about the financial health of the bank. 'We thought it was a question of envy in the west, seeing a bank grew so fast in 10 years. We said BCCI must be taking a risk, but there are auditors, regulators, bankers and customers giving it critical analysis. This was really the atmosphere. On the face of the figures you cannot contest them. If you are not tipped off you don't suspect, you take it on trust.' Much of the criticism of Abu Dhabi has focused on the extent and timing of its knowledge of fraud at the bank, and its decision, once it knew, to restructure rather than close it. Mr Mazrui says Abu Dhabi was unaware of the losses until April 1990, when Mr Naqvi confessed - and then only in a 'piecemeal' fashion through a series of reports and interviews over several months. 'When the management said they took the portfolio, we said we could not trust them. But what could we do? There was little time. You could neither believe them nor disbelieve them. They put it in our minds that the money taken was only from (our) portfolio.' 'It was not an easy decision. They said if we left, one million depositors would suffer. They said BCCI was a very good bank, with good, young people working hard, and that within ten years we would recover our money.' He has little sympathy for Price Waterhouse, which drafted the report for the Bank of England leading to BCCI's closure while continuing to act as auditor and to advise Abu Dhabi on the restructuring. 'The auditors knew about the problems,' he says. 'They had the background. We felt their behaviour was somehow strange: they had said nothing in the past and everything now. They had arguments with management, the board had nothing to do with.' Price Waterhouse made several allegations in its report to the Bank of England against Mr Mazrui himself. It alleges that he signed a confirmation to the auditors of a falsified loan made on behalf of Abu Dhabi's crown prince. He says he signed no such document, has not seen the original and that if there is a signature it must be a forgery. He admits - as the Price Waterhouse report states - that he received money from BCCI from the sale of the bank's shares in 1986, which he says totalled Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m. But he says the bank credited him without his knowledge, and that he demanded that Mr Abedi take the money back. When this did not happen, he says he donated the money to charities, as Mr Abedi suggested. What is his message for the bank's creditors? 'We want them to be reasonable, to appreciate our sacrifice, to question their own countries' regulators. We were not the only ones on the scene.'</p>

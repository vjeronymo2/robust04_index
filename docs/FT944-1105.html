			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Labour looks at 'windfall' tax on lottery group The Labour party may seek to impose a 'windfall' tax on Camelot, the consortium which runs the National Lottery. Some shadow cabinet members believe the terms in the National Lottery licence under which Camelot will receive 5 per cent of the revenues for the initial seven years are unjustifiably generous given the lottery's immediate success. They are therefore considering a tax on Camelot's share of lottery proceeds if Labour wins the next general election. They see this as one way to redress the balance without renegotiating the licence. Although ticket sales have been strong since the lottery's launch last month, a reliable picture of Camelot's finances is unlikely to be available until early next summer, when it is expected to publish its first annual report. When Camelot won the licence to run the lottery in March it was believed that its profit levels would be well under 1 per cent of sales and probably about 0.6 per cent. The consortium - whose members include Cadbury Schweppes, the food and drinks group, ICL, the computer group, and De La Rue, the banknote printer which this week bought Portals for Pounds 682m - says it will be 'several years' before it breaks even. The 5 per cent of lottery revenues which Camelot receives must cover all its costs. In March the consortium forecast total sales of Pounds 32bn in the seven years of the licence and payments of Pounds 9bn to good causes such as charity and the arts. This implies revenue to Camelot of Pounds 1.6bn over the period. The consortium says Pounds 100m was invested before the lottery started, with more to follow as the number of terminals is increased from 10,000 at present to 40,000 by the end of 1996. There are plans to introduce a series of scratch card games as part of the lottery from next spring.</p>

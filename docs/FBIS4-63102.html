			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 6 RIA -- Russian Defence Minister Pavel  Grachev has said the Asia and Pacific region needs its own  security system. Speaking at a press conference Friday he said  the region where strategic interests of Russia, Japan, China,  and the United States are closely intertwined lacks a mechanism  to dovetail them.    He said Russia saw as its long-term strategic goal the  formation of a collective security system involving all states  situated in the region, and voiced confidence this initiative  would be backed up by all states interested in maintaining peace  and stability in the region.</p>

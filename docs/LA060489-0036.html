			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: THE WAILERS BAND "I.D." ATLANTIC * 1/2: POP STARS ***** GREAT  BALLS OF FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR *** GOOD VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY  * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> Between the death of Bob Marley, the murder of drummer Carlton Barrett and  legal entanglements restricting the group's activities for years, the Wailers  Band has faced plenty of trials by fire. But there's little evidence of the  reggae sextet's indomitable spirit on this undistinguished comeback album. The  songs (all written or co-written by singer-guitarist Junior Marvin) steer a  nondescript commercial course that echoes Steel Pulse and UB40. Only "Reggae  Love" and "Irie" pack any kind of groove punch, while the lyrics are nebulous  social protests or generic tributes to reggae music. No one should begrudge the  Wailers an identity as something more than the official Bob Marley jukebox, but  the anonymity of the material on "I.D." is pretty shocking -- as is the  realization that the Wailers, who once defined the direction of reggae, are now  followers rather than leaders.

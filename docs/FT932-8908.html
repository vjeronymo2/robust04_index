			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Lofoten tries to shake off Arctic barbarian image: Norwegian and Japanese whaling communities are united in their defiance of IWC moratorium ANTAGONISTS call the people of Norway's Lofoten Islands 'Arctic barbarians', yet the fishermen and whalers feel misunderstood and unjustly condemned by a world hostile to the way in which they make their living. Today - Norway's Constitution Day - will be celebrated by the islanders while they anxiously await tomorrow's commercial whaling quota announcement by the government, after a two-year battle with anti-whaling activists. At the weekend, Lofoten's whalers began rigging their boats and testing their harpoons before resuming traditional coastal whaling, hopefully, they say, sometime this week. As the IWC deliberated in Kyoto, foreign media descended upon Lofoten asking how whaling could be so important to so few people that the entire nation would risk isolation by most of the rest of the world. 'You begin to wonder what the IWC has become and what real use it is since it refuses to listen to the advice of its own scientists,' remarked Mrs Marietta Korsrud, wife of a Reine whaler and fisherman. 'It calms me to have a government which makes decisions based on scientific results because this is the only way in which the environment can be truly cared for. It's important for the world to know we are not barbarians.' Mr Korsrud's father was a whaler, as was his grandfather. The Lofoten Islands comprise six municipalities and a population of 25,000. Granite mountain pinnacles forming the jagged 'Lofotwall' rise from the treacherous Norwegian Sea. Four of the municipality's seven whaling boats returned on Saturday with a paltry spring catch of four minke whales out of 50 allotted under research quotas. The whalers spent the last month battling storms around the Bear Islands in the Barents Sea and in the West Fjord, which separates Lofoten from Norway's mainland. Captain Olav Olavsen of the Nybraena said the weather was so severe, just 17 hours of whaling was possible. Last December, the Nybraena was partially sunk by US anti-whaling activist Paul Watson, who is threatenening further action. Capt Olavsen was forced to take out war insurance coverage in order to remain in business. This spring's catch was brought to auction on Saturday in Skrova and Myre in Vesteraalen, where buyers paid NKr32.50 (Pounds 3.13) a kilo for the dark red meat, but they hope to get up to NKr80 a kilo in the second-hand market. They say the meat will fetch NKr120 a kilo in food stores around the country. According to Mr Tor Haug, the hunt's leader, it cost about NKr100,000 a day for each of the four whaling boats to operate. Whaling represents about 50 to 60 per cent of the annual income of Lofoten's fishermen, who began coastal whaling in the 1920s. Ms Zoelvi Pedersen, a spokeswoman for pro-whaling organisation High North Alliance, said Lofoten was disappointed Norway did not withdraw from the IWC but relieved the government was to allow coastal whaling. The whalers themselves do not have huge expectations for high quotas. As Mrs Korsrud said: 'They need quotas high enough to cover their operating costs - maybe 8 to 10 whales each, but will be thankful for what they get.' Editorial comment, page 13</p>

MINJU CHOSON in a by-lined article notes that the  achievement  of independence by the Tunisian people was a fruition of their  long-drawn-out struggle for freedom and liberation, and it  marked an important occasion in opening a new chapter in the  history of the Tunisian people.    The article says:    The Tunisian people are now making strides forward in their  efforts to consolidate the national independence and build the  national economy and culture so as to build an independent and  prosperous new society.    Although Korea and Tunisia are far away from each other  geographically, they have the bonds of friendship.    After the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two  peoples have developed relations of friendship and cooperation  on the principles of independence, equality and mutual benefit.    The Korean people will, in the future, too, make every  effort to expand and develop the friendly relations with the  Tunisian people in various domains.    They wish the Tunisian people greater success in their  struggle for the independent development and prosperity of the  country.</p>

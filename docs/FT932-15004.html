			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bermuda plans focus on Hong Kong and insurers - Much play is being made of its possibilities as an offshore equity market Financiers in the tiny island of Bermuda are moving ahead with plans to upgrade operations at the local stock exchange, in a bid to establish a new centre for international equity trading. Local banks, which still own the exchange, are hoping to develop the island as a shadow of the Hong Kong stock market, taking advantage of the fact that over 100 Hong Kong companies have already registered there. Much play, too, is being made of the island's possibilities as a centre for trading in the shares of new offshore international insurance companies, which have made their domicile in Bermuda in recent years. 'We would be the only international offshore stock exchange in the western hemisphere,' says Mr Charles Vaughan-Johnson, executive vice-president at the Bank of Bermuda. 'You can see the potential if it becomes fully modernised. For those who don't want to be in Luxembourg (a rival international centre) it will have enormous appeal.' Mr Vaughan-Johnson's vision is an ambitious one. Only 26 equity issues (including common and preference shares), and four note and bond issues are currently traded on the exchange. Over a dozen other mutual funds are listed but not traded. Capitalisation amounts to a respectable Dollars 802m according to Mr Bill Dolan, a manager at the Bank of Bermuda, who has been co-ordinating the modernisation effort. But a handful of stocks, notably the Banks of Bermuda and Butterfield, Bermuda Telephone and Bermuda Electric Light, account for the lion's share. The two banks alone have a capitalisation of more than Dollars 485m between them. Nevertheless the banks are optimistic and can point to real progress in the last few months. In February this year Bermuda finally scrapped its system of weekly trading. This had centred on the 'open cryer' method involving the three banks that own the exchange: the Banks of Butterfield and Bermuda, and the smaller Bermuda Commercial Bank. Each Tuesday three numbered ping pong balls were drawn by bank representatives to establish the order in which they would make their bids that week. The banks are still the only members but screen-based trading, conducted over the telephone, was introduced on February 24, with the index rebased to 1,000. Two months on the index has dipped to 982.69, with trading generally within a narrow range. Mr Dolan is currently reviewing the exchange's constitution, with a view to establishing a new incorporated entity, easing membership rules and bringing the exchange within the supervisory authority of the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Immediate objectives include efforts to persuade managers of over a hundred mutual funds currently registered in Bermuda to list on the exchange. In the medium term Mr Dolan is aiming to introduce an electronic settlement system, in order to increase efficiency. In the long-term, however, prospects are closely linked to the island's future as the favoured offshore centre for both Hong Kong companies and the insurance business. Jardine Mattheson, the trading company, was one of the first Hong Kong companies to register in Bermuda in 1984, and some 130 Hong Kong companies have followed suit. More recently the growth of a number of offshore insurance and reinsurance companies has opened up another opportunity. Since 1985 three companies which between them have net assets of over Dollars 2bn have been established in Bermuda. Of these, ACE and EXEL were originally owned by the large US corporations whose liability risks they insure, but both have launched successful share issues in New York within the last two years while a third, Centre Re, is planning to follow suit. Within the last six months two more companies - Mid Ocean and Underwriting Capital (Merrett) - have also been formed in Bermuda, and more new ventures are expected.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Condemns U.S. New Missile Development </F> Program"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Defense  Department is now going ahead with the program for developing a  latest-type missile to detect and destroy the missiles "hidden  underground" in the North of Korea.    NODONG SINMUN today says this is a typical expression of the  arrogance of the United States, which has customed to encroach  upon the sovereignty of other nations.    The detection and destruction of military equipment of other  countries are an unilateral exercise of armed forces against  sovereign states and a gross infringement on their sovereignty,  the analyst says, and continues:    The program is aimed at making a forestalling attack on the  DPRK and stifling it.    The U.S. authorities' talk about "nuclear nonproliferation"  is a sophism for strengthening its military predominance, the  nuclear supremacy and justifying the military terrorism and  invasion against the nations out of their favor.    The acceleration of a new-type missile development by the  U.S. conservative hardliners under the cloak of "nuclear  nonproliferation" can never be justified in every respect.    As for the nuclear proliferation, its chief culprit is none  other than the United States. The United States has produced a  large number of nuclear weapons and deployed them in different  parts of the world. And it has helped Israel, Japan and South  Korea in nuclear armament, conniving at it.    "Nuclear nonproliferation" cried for by the U.S. authorities  is nothing but a veil for covering up their crimes in nuclear  proliferation and justifying their nuclear monopolization and  the development of sophisticated weapons.    The acceleration of the program for developing a latest-type  missile may drive to a more dangerous phase the the Korean  situation which remains acute. The United States must be held  wholly responsible for the possible consequences.    We are keeping tabs on the moves of the United States.    The United States must promptly give up the inconsiderate  program for developing new-type missile against the DPRK.</p>

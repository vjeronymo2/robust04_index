			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bacardi pays Dollars 1.5bn for stake in Martini BACARDI, the Bermuda-based international rum company, has paid more than Dollars 1.5bn for a majority stake in Martini &amp; Rossi, the Italian vermouth and wines group. This emerged from industry sources yesterday as Bacardi confirmed a Financial Times report of a deal between the two companies to create the fourth largest drinks group in the world. A statement from JP Morgan, Bacardi's financial advisers, said Bacardi had agreed to make 'a significant investment' in General Beverage Corporation, Martini's Geneva-based holding company, but did not disclose the terms of the transaction. Bacardi would work in partnership with General Beverage, the statement said. 'This transaction will give the two groups reciprocal access to their distribution networks around the world. 'The Martini &amp; Rossi group's wide range of products will also complement Bacardi's product line.' Their joint portfolio of brands will include the two best selling alcoholic drinks in the world - Bacardi rum with annual sales of 22m cases, and Martini vermouth with sales of 17m cases. Martini also has a range of other drinks including Otard, the sixth-ranked cognac, Benedictine liqueur, Offley port and William Lawson Scotch whisky.</p>

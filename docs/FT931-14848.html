			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Spain leads high-yield sectors gaining from ERM relaxation THE EASING of tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism helped to lift some of the higher-yielding government bond markets yesterday. Some investors were encouraged to switch out of the hard-core currencies and into higher-yielding assets as the pressure on the French franc and Irish punt appeared to have lessened, allowing Ireland to lower interest rates yesterday. Spain was the chief beneficiary of the easing in ERM tensions, dealers said, with the yield on 10-year paper falling from 12.35 per cent to 12.18 per cent yesterday. Although short-term interest rates remain high, making it expensive for investors to fund their positions, dealers noted that there had been some overseas buying of long-dated Spanish bonds. Mr Steve Major, bond analyst with Credit Lyonnais, said that in addition to the easing of ERM tensions, buying interest has been stimulated by hopes that relatively favourable inflation data would emerge today. Danish government bonds ended lower after a day spent speculating over whether the Danish prime minister, Mr Poul Schlueter, would be forced to resign following criticism of his role in the so-called Tamil case. Mr Schlueter announced his resignation in the late afternoon, but dealers said the bond market was jittery most of the day before the announcement. Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds held steady, ending the day slightly firmer with the Liffe bund future contract rising from 92.84 at the opening to 93.02 by late afternoon. Dealers said the market was quiet in the absence of important economic news or statements from the Bundesbank. UK government bond prices ended mostly firmer yesterday on market hopes of a base rate cut, possibly in conjunction with the release of favourable retail price index data today. The Liffe gilt future contract opened at 99.30, touched a low of 99.23, and ended the day at around the high of 100.00 on relatively large volume of 32,000 contracts. However, some economists dismissed the possibility of an imminent base rate cut as unlikely. Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the gilt-edged market was taking its cue from relatively low overnight rates. 'Short-term money has been low, but for mainly technical reasons, not on fundamentals,' he said. THE JAPANESE government bond market saw a volatile trading session closing with prices higher on the day due to reports that the ministry of finance planned to buy back government debt. The market opened on a firm note on hopes of an easing in interest rates and as the stock market remained in a weak state, but then changed direction as investors took profits. However, close to the end of the trading session, news emerged that the finance ministry's trust fund bureau will start buying bonds outright soon. The benchmark No 145 issue opened at a yield of 4.435 per cent and moved to 4.39 per cent, corresponding to a new high price for the cash bond. The yield closed at 4.395 per cent in Tokyo but moved to 4.38 per cent in London trading. US Treasury prices firmed across the maturity range yesterday, aided by sporadic retail buying and suggestions that President-elect Clinton may not follow through his campaign of cutting middle class taxes. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 102 21/32 , yielding 7.397 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 15/32 , to yield 4.355 per cent. The main economic news of the day was the Labor department's announcement that state unemployment insurance claims rose by 52,000 in the week that ended January 2. At first glance, the big increase in jobless claims was positive for the market, but analysts, dealers and investors were suspicious of the data, which bucks the recently established trend of declining unemployment claims. Any bullish news on the jobs market was offset by data showing retail sales rose 1.2 per cent in December, a sign that consumer spending is picking up. The day's other important figure - a 0.2 per cent increase in producer prices last month - had no impact on sentiment.</p>

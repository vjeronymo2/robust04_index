			<p>BFN     [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice faction  in the State Duma, declared that "under the obvious offensive of  conservative and reactionary forces" the Russia's Choice party  faces the goal "to defend the democratic alternative in Russia."    Addressing the constituent conference of the party's Moscow  organization on Saturday, Gaydar expressed his opinion saying  that "the organizational weakness and crumbliness of the  democratic movement represent a serious threat for Russia's  future." The new party of a parliamentarian type which is being  created on the initiative of the Russia's Choice faction is  intended "to unite those who share the valuables of the market,  democracy, and private ownership."    As Gaydar said, the implementation of the party's program  "will assist in stabilization of the situation in the country  and its growth."    In Gaydar's opinion, Russia is experiencing "an inevitable  wave of reaction with respect to the deep transformations  underway in the country now" but "not the beginning of an  irreversible turn backwards." He believes that "this wave will  go away" because "the communists and their allies, the radical  nationalists, have no notion what to offer to the society" but  the "unpopular program" which "was already implemented in Russia  some time ago."</p>

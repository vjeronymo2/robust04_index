Feasibility studies are now on to make  planes with the capacity [of] up to 100 seats. The Chinese  ambassador, Mr. Cheng Ruisheng, told PTI in New Delhi that the  two countries proposed to pool their technological and other  resources for the project. The studies are to be undertaken by  experts of the National Aeronautical Laboratory and the  Aerotechnology Research Institute of China. Mr. Cheng said both  India and China have good military planes and they can diversify  the capability to the civilian side. As the two countries are  carrying out economic reforms, they will also be able to acquire  better technology for the project, he said. The ambassador also  felt that there is great scope for stepping up bilateral trade  as it accounts for just 1 percent of India's foreign trade. He  said China is trying to introduce Indian technical know-how in  the computer field and is interested in launching Indian  satellites which will be cheaper than other European launchers.</p>

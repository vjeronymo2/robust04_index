Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive, said in an internal memorandum, released by the company, that he was creating a corporate executive committee which would focus on corporate results, making IBM business units work in a responsive way to serve customers and minimise bureaucracy. 'I have reached the firm conclusion that decentralisation versus centralisation is not our most important organisational dilemma,' Mr Gerstner wrote. The new committee will consist of Mr Jim Cannavino, Mr Gerry Czarnecki, Ms Ellen Hancock, Mr Bob LaBant, Mr Ned Lautenbach, Mr Bernard Puckett, Mr Paul Rizzo, Mr John Thompson, Mr Pat Toole, and Mr Jerry York. Each will be part of the IBM corporate office and their principal focus will be on overall corporate results, not on individual unit performance.

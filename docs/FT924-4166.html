			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disillusioned traders push oil prices still lower CONFIDENCE IN the oil market weakened further yesterday when prices for North Sea Brent crude oil for delivery in January slipped by another 20 cents to Dollars 18.30 a barrel. World oil prices have lost a dollar a barrel in just over a week as traders have become disillusioned with the ability of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to support the oil price. 'The market is not convinced by last week's Opec agreement. There have been no signs that Saudi Arabia and Iran will actually cut back their production,' said Mr Peter Bogin, at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's energy minister and Opec's current president, said in comments to the Reuter news agency yesterday that he could not understand why the market had weakened following the agreement to cutback output to 24.58m barrels a day from 25m b/d. He said it was a realistic agreement and had the full support of all members. But weak prices for oil products have also been dragging the crude market downwards. Europe remains well-stocked with products such as gasoil for which prices have dropped by Dollars 5 to Dollars 10 a tonne over the past month to Dollars 174 a tonne. The weather in Europe and North America remains warmer than forecast leading traders to fear that stocks of oil will not be run down very quickly and could further depress prices early next year.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (13): Languages and contacts - The Jewish community has made a big contribution to business life the Hebrew Chorus performed by the Turkish state opera company, before an audience of the best and brightest of Istanbul Jewry. Verdi's Nabucco was just one event in 1992, in a spate of celebrations to mark the 500 years since the Sephardic Jews were expelled from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella, to find a new life in the Islamic world of Sultan Beyazit II. 'In impoverishing Spain,' the Sultan is said to have remarked, 'the expulsion will enrich Turkey.' Nowhere is this more true than in the business community, where Jews play a leading role in Turkish corporate life. From sectors like textiles, where they have traditionally been strong, to heavy industry, the 20,000-strong Jewish community has made a big contribution to Turkish business life. Equally successful, if less conspicuous, are those Jews who control much of the activity on Istanbul's Tahtakale money market. 'Even today the rate for the dollar is still set by the Tahtakale. The Jewish wholesalers are the bankers of this country,' says a producer of women's lingerie. Just as the first arrivals in 1492 brought the art of printing, and even cannon construction, to the Sublime Porte, the Jews today, with their language skills and their contacts in the markets of Europe and the US, have played an often pivotal role in the development of some of the Turks' own groups. In his memoirs, Mr Vehbi Koc paterfamilias of Turkey's biggest trading house, openly acknowledges the contribution to the company's success of two prominent members of the Jewish community - Bernar Nahum and Isak de Eskinazis. Mr Nahum, who started his career with Ford Motor, was an invaluable partner when the young Mr Koc started his auto business, initially making the Anadol, before forming a joint venture with Fiat of Italy, an operation which dominates the Turkish car market today. Others have emerged on their own. Mr Isak Alaton's Alarko Holdings is one of Turkey's most successful construction companies, building everything from sewage plants for the Istanbul municipality to hotels in Moscow and other cities in the former Soviet Union. Another well-known name, Vitali Hakko, started his career making felt hats. Today he owns and runs Vakko, Turkey's leading fashion house. It would be difficult to put a figure on their contribution to Turkey's economy. Certainly, personal fortunes have been made. The display of cosmopolitan elegance at the Ataturk Cultural Centre, in Istanbul, might have graced any opera house in London or Paris. 'It's very strange, but when the Ottomans were in Palestine, none of the Turkish Jews chose to leave,' says Mr Silvyo Ovadya, editor of Salom, the official newspaper of the Jewish community. Salom today publishes seven of its eight pages in Turkish. Before 1983, the paper was produced in Ladino, a medieval Spanish comprehensible to Cervantes but increasingly unknown to Turkey's younger generation of Jews. 'I think some of the businessmen are reluctant to drop the cult of the wandering Jew,' says Jak Deleon, restaurant critic and professor of English at Istanbul's Bosporus University. Some habits are certainly difficult to break, like the weekly visit to Istanbul's only remaining Kosher restaurant, now run by a Moslem Turk. In her documentary film, Si je t'oublie Istanbul, Nora Seni describes how Istanbul's Jewish families still retreat to their large wooden houses on Buyukada island, during the hot summer months. Many of the rich Jews prefer to fly to a south coast resort and sit in more stately splendour on their yachts. 'We're not a typical Jewish community,' says Mr Jefi Camhi, of Profilo, a leading consumer electronics group. 'We're from both worlds, Sephardic and Ashkenazic. In Britain there was a time when Jews were restricted from certain trades. In Turkey there has never been any restrictions.' There was, of course, the Varlik Vergisi - the infamous wealth tax imposed on the Jews and the other official minorities, the Greeks and the Armenians, during the second world war, when an estimated 5,000 people were sent to labour camps for failing to pay the tax. Eli Aciman was one Jewish businessman who suffered as a result of the Varlik Vergisi, eventually leaving for the US. He later returned, and today runs Turkey's largest advertising agency, in partnership with J. Walter Thompson. But the community remains particularly vulnerable to another shift in Turkish attitudes - this time perhaps a shift in Turkey's western orientation to play a more Islamic role. Significantly, it is Mr Jak Camhi, Jefi's father, who is now a leading voice in the campaign to have Turkey accepted as a full member of the European Community, heading a business association which directly lobbies Brussels - so far without success.</p>

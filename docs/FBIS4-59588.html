			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Today's press commentaries focus on U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher's new regional tour, which is aimed  at boosting and activating the stalemated peace process.    In its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: With the beginning of  Christopher's new tour of the region, it must be reasserted that  Syria adheres to peace in accordance with the bases that were  agreed upon in Madrid. Syria will accept no alternative to the  bases and principles provided for by the UN resolutions and the  laws of international legitimacy. If Syria insists on  dismissing partial solutions, this is because its peaceful  orientation proceeds from one basic axiom--that unless peace is  just, comprehensive, and based on sound bases of equality and  equilibrium, it will not be a genuine and firm peace.    AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria wants a peace that ensures  the  principles and values of truth and justice and ends any form of  injustice, occupation, and aggression. Syria wants a peace that  restores rights to their rightful owners and enables the region  to enjoy true security and stability. Expressing its constant  readiness to cooperate to achieve a peace of this kind, Syria  places all those concerned, especially the United States, before  their historic responsibilities. It asks them to honor their  promises and assurances and to support the resolutions and laws  of international legitimacy, which are disregarded by Israel.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Christopher is coming to the region in a  new effort to activate the peace process, especially on the  Syrian- Israeli track. However, Israel, through Foreign  Minister Peres, went ahead of events and cast doubts about any  possibility of achieving any success in this tour.    AL-BA'TH says: In his latest statement, a few hours before  his new tour of the region, the U.S. secretary of state did not  show a great deal of optimism about his continuous mission to  boost and activate the stalemated peace process.    AL-BA'TH adds: When the U.S. secretary says that he does not  hope for much from this tour, this means that he has prejudged  the results without giving any reasons. Reviewing the reasons  that may have made Christopher prejudge the results, the paper  says that the reasons are innumerable. The paper reviews  Israel's recent stands and attempts to portray itself as  moderate and flexible. It says that during Christopher's recent  tour of the region, the U.S. secretary conveyed [to Syria]  so-called Israeli ideas on withdrawal from the Golan. The ideas  were listed as concessions, directly linked with conditions that  have nothing to do with the essence of the peace process.    AL-BA'TH adds: Regarding Israel's alleged concessions, it  can be stressed that the term concessions is a completely  rejected political fallacy that the Rabin government is trying  to peddle in order to mislead domestic and foreign public  opinion. This is a argument must be rejected because a  concession is made when someone concedes something that he  possesses. But, since Israel, the paper says, does not possess  an iota of the Golan nor any inch of the soil of the occupied  Arab territories, it has no right to use the term concessions  anywhere on any issue.    Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Against this  backdrop, it is possible to understand the judgment that  Christopher issued on the eve of his visit to the region. It is  the judgment of someone who knows the Israeli mentality, which  insists on obstructing the peace process. For hopes for  progress to become greater, this situation should be corrected  and restored to its logical context. In this case, logical  context is commitment to the essence and principles of the peace  process.    On the same subject, TISHRIN notes that Syria is not ready  to  deal with any Israeli proposals that do not show an explicit  commitment to full withdrawal from the Golan within a reasonable  and acceptable period of time. The paper adds: Syria has long  experience with Israel's evasive and intransigent policy.  Therefore, in view of Syria's constant stands, Israel must have  realized that partial, phased settlements are not possible and  that Syria will not relinquish its territory and rights or Arab  territories and rights. Simply speaking, Syria believes in a  just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    TISHRIN says: A just, comprehensive peace is one of Syria's  strategic objectives. Yet, this does not at all mean that Syria  will relinquish the essence of this peace or accept fragile  agreements that do not usher in a complete removal of the  occupation. The paper says that if all parties have the right  to raise their security concerns, then Syria's security is  represented primarily in the removal of the occupation and  providing peace and security for others, especially since it is  a peace that will be guaranteed by the international community.  The paper believes that achieving substantive progress on the  Syrian-Israeli track does not require all the complications and  thorny issues raised by Israel. Syria is proposing a full peace  in return for full Israeli withdrawal. Peace with Syria means a  comprehensive Middle East peace. This is because there is no  peace at all without Syria's participation.    Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN says: It is high time the  United States translated the role of a full, fair, impartial  partner into reality. This is would be forcing the Israeli  rulers to make the sound decision without which peace is  impassible; namely, full withdrawal from the Golan and the other  occupied Arab territories.</p>

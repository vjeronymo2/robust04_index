			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / 'Many football clubs' lose money ABOUT 70 per cent of English football clubs are lossmaking, according to a report published yesterday. 'British football is beset with major problems such as high wage costs, spiralling transfer fees and huge ground improvement costs which have severely affected profit margins,' says ICC Business Ratios. A total of 10 clubs have wage bills which exceed their turnover. The report shows that turnover in the former First Division clubs increased 28 per cent in the latest year, compared with an average 18.6 per cent for all clubs. Nevertheless, the big clubs have increased ticket prices by 20 per cent to try to meet the cost of ground improvements. The most profitable club, the report says, was Manchester United, which made a profit of Pounds 5.3m in the year to end-July 1991. The biggest loss was scored by Queen's Park Rangers with a deficit of Pounds 2.73m in the year to end-May 1991.</p>

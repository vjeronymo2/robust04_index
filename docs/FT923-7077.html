			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Japanese publisher to take over Berlitz International BERLITZ INTERNATIONAL, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation, which discovered a majority of its shares were pledged improperly to banks as collateral by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, has signed a merger agreement with Fukutake Publishing, the Japanese correspondence course and book publishing concern. If the deal is completed, existing Berlitz shareholders would own about one-third of the company's ongoing equity. Fukutake, which is making the offer through its US subsidiary, would hold the rest. The deal requires approval from two-thirds of the shareholders. That will be complicated as ownership of 6.8m of the 20m shares is in dispute and subject to legal action. When the formal offer document is issued, it is expected to require approval from both sides claiming ownership of these shares: Macmillan on one hand; and Shearson Lehman, Credit Suisse, Swiss Volksbank and Advest on the other. The announcement follows market speculation, and comes after Berlitz, based in Princeton, New Jersey, said earlier this month that it was in talks with parties interested in the possible takeover. Fukutake acquired 20 per cent of Berlitz's Japanese unit in 1990. A letter of intent, allowing Fukutake to buy the 56.5 per cent stake in Berlitz held by Macmillan, MCC's main US subsidiary, for Dollars 265m, was signed in November 1991. That was rendered void when MCC went into bankruptcy, following Mr Maxwell's death late last year. Since then, MCC has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. At present, most of the Macmillan stake in Berlitz is in the hands of five banks and companies that received stock as collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. Apart from shareholder approval, the deal between Berlitz and Fukutake is conditional on certain transactions, involving share transfers and the waiving of claims by MCC. Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC, refused to comment yesterday, saying the issue was sensitive because ownership of Berlitz shares is still in dispute.</p>

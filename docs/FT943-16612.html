			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Six-year peak for fund management The profitability of the UK fund-management industry reached a six-year peak last year because of buoyant markets, but the industry's costs are also rising far faster than they should, a survey by Price Waterhouse concludes. In its sixth annual review of the fund-management industry the accountancy and management consultancy group says that pre-tax profits as a proportion of total revenues rose to 28.8 per cent last year, up from 18.1 per cent in 1992. None of the 41 organisations in the survey reported a pre-tax operating loss last year, compared to a third in 1992.

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFESSORS' PRIORITIES  </P> <P> The tone of Kennedy's statements and your editorial echo most recent  discussions in implying that universities have overemphasized research in a  self-interested pursuit of scholarly prestige and research funds.  </P> <P> This may be partly true. However, it must be remembered that at present  universities are the only institutions at which research in many fields  (including some areas of science) can be pursued. There are few or no  opportunities for employment in industry or in the government in these areas of  scholarship.  </P> <P> Excellent teachers can find employment in liberal art colleges, state campuses  with a teaching emphasis, and in secondary education -- where their talents are  sorely needed.  </P> <P> JOHN DAMUTH  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

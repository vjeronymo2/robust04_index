			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nigel Hawkes, science editor: "Diphtheria Alert </F> Clears Jab Stocks"]    [Text] Supplies of adult diphtheria vaccine in Britain have  run out just as the foreign Office has warned travellers to  Russia to have booster jabs.    An epidemic of the disease has caused a run on supplies, and  yesterday Regent Laboratories, the sole importers, said it would  have no more before October. A combined tetanus and diphtheria  vaccine has been available from Merieux UK, but has also run out.    Cases of diphtheria in Russia rose from 1,876 in 1991 to  3,897 in 1992. From January to May this year, 2,828 cases were  reported. The epidemic is centred in Moscow, St Petersburg and  Kaliningrad. The risks are greater for people likely to come  into contact with Russian families than tourists staying in  hotels.    Diphtheria caused 2,400 deaths among 45,000 cases in Britain  in 1940 but the disease has been beaten by vaccination.    Dr. Peter Barrett, of the Medical Advisory Service for  Travellers Abroad, said yesterday that although revaccination  was recommended, the risk was not enough to justify cancelling  visits to Russia.</p>

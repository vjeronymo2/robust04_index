			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: BCCI branch may reopen MR Noel Gleeson, provisional liquidator of Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong (BCCHK), said the local unit of the now defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International hopes to reopen under another name by the end of March, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Mr Gleeson also said a bid by Hongkong Chinese Bank, part of the Lippo group, to take over the bank had been delayed by claims by BCCI, but none of them had been found valid so far. Depositors must approve any bid and they would have 25 days to consider it before holding a vote. Hongkong Chinese Bank, as head of a consortium, agreed in November to take over BCCHK, which was closed in July when BCCI collapsed. Mr Gleeson is still trying to obtain a guarantee for the bank's unrecorded liabilities from the government of Abu Dhabi, which controlled BCCI. Otherwise the deal could be rejected by the local High Court.</p>

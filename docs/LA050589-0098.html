			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE MAKES FINAL STOP OF 9-DAY AFRICAN TOUR;  </P> <P> POPE SALUTES MALAWI FOR GENEROSITY TO REFUGEES  </P> <P> Arriving in Malawi, whose economic self-sufficiency has been all but destroyed  by a heavy influx of refugees from Mozambique, Pope John Paul II paid tribute  Thursday to the remarkable selflessness of the people of this African country.  </P> <P> "The international community applauds your generosity," the Pope said on the  final stop of a nine-day visit to southern Africa. He will leave Saturday for  Rome, having visited -- in addition to Malawi -- Madagascar, the French island  of Reunion and Zambia since beginning the tour April 28.  </P> <P> The pontiff was greeted at Blantyre airport by perhaps the most distinctive  head of state he has encountered on this trip, H. Kamuzu Banda, the  nonagenarian "president for life" of Malawi.  </P> <P> Banda wasted no time in lecturing the Pope about his own accomplishments in  leading this landlocked, resource-poor nation of 7.6 million.  </P> <P> "I know you've heard and read in the newspapers that Malawi has a very good  name, especially in Europe, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, the United  States. . . ." He reeled off the name of virtually every major nation in his  surprisingly firm baritone.  </P> <P> "You've heard and read that Malawi is one of the best-governed countries in  Africa," he added, in what might apply more to the impeccable tidiness of  Malawi's streets, the orderliness of its crowds and the precise orchestration  of its presidential rallies than to its rock-bottom per capita spending on  education and health, its declining literacy rate and its level of political  repression.  </P> <P> Banda has also lent his people something of his own religious background -- a  Calvinist Presbyterianism that places them among Africa's most abstemious  people. Although the country is a major exporter of tobacco, cigarette smokers  are rare here. "Why consume what we can export for money?" a businessman  remarked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Catholics and Protestants  </P> <P> About 25% of the population is Catholic and a third is Protestant, including  members of some Presbyterian splinter sects found nowhere but in Scotland and  Malawi.  </P> <P> The welcoming ceremony was more notable for what went unsaid than for what was  said. Absent from the pontiff's and president's remarks was any reference to  apartheid, the racist policy of South Africa that was the subtext at almost  every gathering on the Pope's previous stop, in Zambia.  </P> <P> This was not surprising, for two African leaders could scarcely differ more in  their approach to South Africa than do Banda and Zambia's President Kenneth D.  Kaunda.  </P> <P> Kaunda, perhaps Africa's most obdurate foe of South Africa, maintains full  diplomatic relations with the anti-apartheid African National Congress, and  Banda's Malawi is the only sub-Saharan country that maintains full diplomatic  relations with Pretoria.  </P> <P> Banda has long held that normal relations are necessary because of the economic  dependence of most southern African countries on South Africa.  </P> <P> For all that, the Pope's focus on Malawi's service to the Mozambicans was  entirely appropriate. Malawi had been producing enough corn and other staples  to feed itself before the vicious Mozambican guerrilla war began forcing  refugees across the border three years ago. Today there are more than 600,000  Mozambicans in Malawi, many of them occupying otherwise cultivable land.  </P> <P> Now Malawi is an importer of food. The huge refugee population has denuded its  forests in quest of firewood, leading to severe flooding in districts that had  not been so inundated in more than 30 years. In the south, where the greatest  concentrations of Mozambicans are found, roads crucial to the transport of farm  goods have been shattered by the passage of heavy trucks carrying relief  supplies.  </P></p>

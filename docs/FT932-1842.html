			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Matters of opinion: Christopher Bobinski on poll-taking in east Europe East Europeans no longer have to fear the early morning knock on the door. When they hear someone outside these days, it is likely to be an opinion pollster rather than the secret police. The calls are becoming frequent as local and western academics, and financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, send out researchers to check the pulse of societies applying free-market prescriptions to their formerly state-run economies. One of the latest polls, carried out by the European Community along with the Gallup organisation, showed that the Albanians are eastern Europe's most 'optimistic' people, while the Russians are among the least satisfied with the direction their country is going in. Demand for such information has spawned a small but growing industry of private local polling organisations, some operating alone, and others, such as Emor in Estonia, working alongside groups such as Gallup. Industry estimates for 1991 suggest that 5 per cent of worldwide polling funds were spent in the former Soviet bloc countries. Local academic sociologists and psychologists are pitching in too, eager to catch up on years when the communist authorities frowned on a pastime which revealed opinions they preferred not to hear. There are few government-funded research organisations in eastern Europe, along the lines of the many national institutes in the west - the former communist states did not feel the need for such organisations. Today, the climate has changed. Researchers in eastern Europe say that most people they poll are eager to express a view. 'They see it as a way of taking part in politics,' says Ms Cynthia Kaplan, a student from the University of California, who is studying political participation rates in Russia and Estonia. Up to 85 per cent of east Europeans agree to answer questionnaires, according to the pollsters, in contrast with the UK or the US, where people with clipboards are lucky to get a response rate of more than 60 per cent. But in Russia, at least, there is still mistrust. 'There are some problems with senior military men,' says Ms Elena Bashkirova, head of Romir, a Moscow-based private polling company. 'Army people in general are wary and do not like to answer questions.' Ms Elena Koneva of Comcon 2, another private company, adds that some people 'refuse to talk about the consumer-durable goods they have at home in case burglars should hear about it'. Nevertheless, a post-communist enthusiasm for expressing a view means that opinion polling in eastern Europe is producing findings that are more thorough and accurate than most polling in the west, according to Ms Meril James, Gallup's international co-ordinator. 'The quality of the research is incredibly high, it's still a prestige business,' says Ms James, who recently addressed a seminar organised by the World Association for Public Opinion Research, held in Tallin, capital of Estonia. Demanding information about the nation's political views was part of the struggle for his country's independence in the 1980s, says Mr Andrus Saar, an Estonian who owns Saar Poll, a private company. An opinion poll carried out in Estonia in 1984 was kept 'under lock and key' for four years, until the Gorbachev era of reform began to ease the atmosphere in the region. Other experiences of the communist era have helped to create a particular abhorrence among many east Europeans for the manipulation of opinion poll findings by politicians. In Lithuania, for example, Ms Rasa Alisauskiene, from the Baltic Surveys private polling company, recounts with disdain how the governing party banned the publication of poll results 30 days before recent parliamentary elections 'because the figures looked bad for them'. Such action is increasingly likely to draw a hostile response, since the opinion polls themselves in several former socialist countries such as Estonia and Poland reveal a feeling among ordinary people that the politicians are failing to act in their inter-ests. This is not to say that there is any more of a guarantee in eastern Europe than elsewhere that interviewees will always respond truthfully. Just as the polls inaccurately forecast election results in Britain, local exit polls in Lithuania underestimated by 12 percentage points support for the country's former communist leader, who was returned to power as a Democratic Labour candidate. People were apparently unwilling to admit they were voting for a former communist. One great advantage for east European polling companies is that they have access to vast amounts of data compiled in the communist era. Throughout eastern Europe, police have detailed residence records. Russia and other former Soviet republics also have lists, originally compiled for the issuing of ration cards, as good as any electoral registers in the west. The data enable east Europeans to get a more accurate cross-section for polling and to interview named people for their research: this method is seen in the industry as potentially more accurate because it virtually rules out falsification of results. And according to Ms James, the cost of carrying out polling is still relatively low in eastern Europe mainly because of much lower wages in the east. Whereas in Britain, estimates suggest it would cost the equivalent of some Dollars 8,000 to have a sample of 1,000 people asked five questions, the Moscow-based companies would charge between Dollars 3,000 and Dollars 4,000 for a 1,500-strong sample throughout Russia. It was against this low-cost background that the EC last autumn carried out perhaps the most ambitious opinion poll ever undertaken in the region. The Eurobarometer poll of 18 former communist countries revealed that, while the Czechs and Slovenes are among the happiest people in eastern Europe, one-third of the region's total population wants to live and work in the west.</p>

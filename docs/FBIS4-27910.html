			<p>CSO     [Text] As a whole, businesses listed on the stock exchanges  reported declining revenues and profits for the year ending in  March 1994. It represented the fourth year of consecutive  declining profits in the postwar period and it seems that we  could hear cries that "we cannot tolerate a further decline." It  is predicted that fiscal year 1994, which ends next March, will  reflect a throttling of the declining profits, but we cannot  necessarily be optimistic.    Conditions affecting businesses were difficult during the  past year. The yen advanced in value amidst historically low  interest rates. Movements intensified to correct foreign and  domestic price differentials, and "destruction of price  structures" spread. Both major and midsized businesses were  forced to adapt to globalization based on imports of materials  and products from overseas, especially Asia, giving birth to the  situation where Japanese businesses can no longer adhere to  keiretsu transactions. It was also necessary to dispose of  issues left as a result of the bursting bubble. The various  firms worked assiduously to improve corporate performance, but  earnings reports testify that they were not able to take  adequate remedial actions.    A sector analysis shows that raw materials makers such as  steel and chemicals faced recessionary conditions and that  fabrication and assembly firms recorded varying results.  However, of even greater significance than differences between  industries was the sharp contrast in performance among firms of  the same industry in response to the existence or lack of  management actions taken to improve corporate performance.    The severity of the problems surfacing as a result of the  bubble economy and the differences in skills associated with the  handling of restructuring projects have determined the ultimate  performance of individual corporations. Firms that took early  remedial and bold actions to restructure have succeeded in  producing minimally acceptable results. Additionally, skills  exercised in responding to "price destruction measures" such as  the procurement of materials and products from overseas made a  difference in corporate performance. It was a phenomenon visible  even in the United States, but we cannot overlook the fact that  major corporations had a tendency to be hobbled by past  performance and to suffer from delays in restructuring.    There are signs of a recovery in the economy. Conservative  restructuring actions such as reducing fixed expenses have  progressed to a considerable degree. Industries operating in the  information equipment, housing, and environmental equipment  sectors will probably undergo aggressive restructuring while  focusing on primary goals. As long as the future sees growth in  demand leading to increased sales, underpinnings for increased  profits now being laid will come into play. However, we have not  passed the stage of operational reductions, balancing of supply  and demand, and prospects for reduced profits in the  nonmanufacturing sector, and most corporations are still  cautious about capital outlays and the issue of employment  instability still lingers on.    The foregoing condition probably persists because individual  firms do not have the resources to resolve all of the pending  issues. Taking the single issue of foreign exchange, most firms  visualize a rate of 105 yen to the dollar for the year ending in  March 1995, but if the rate should fall below 100 yen during the  year, there is the risk that corporate programs will become  unattainable. A strong yen means lower materials costs and  provides businesses with some advantages, but it is a matter of  degree and it could have an unbearable impact on Japanese  society if it leads to a hollowing of industrial sectors. We  cannot overlook factors such as the direction of Japan-U.S.  trade talks, deregulation, and the effects of political trends  on business psychology and performance.    Notwithstanding, it is not a time for inaction because of  the  vagueness of external factors. We see a movement emerging that  favors a departure from the trend to reduce the scope of  business operations. Although the structural strength of  corporations has been weakened by several years of difficult  economic conditions and there is some concern about how long  they can persist, we cannot help but hope that they will  persevere and expand their current efforts.</p>

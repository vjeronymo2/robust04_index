			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Craxi immunity decision put off amid fresh allegations THE Italian parliament yesterday decided to postpone until Tuesday a final hearing on whether to waive immunity from prosecution for Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, who faces corruption charges. The hearing began on Tuesday and was due to last two days. But proceedings have been delayed following new allegations by Mr Claudio Martelli, the ex-justice minister and former close colleague of Mr Craxi. Milan magistrates have asked parliament to waive immunity for Mr Craxi citing his alleged illicit receipt of L36bn (Pounds 16m) in funds for the party. Mr Craxi is the most prominent political figure to have been caught up in Italy's ever-spreading corruption scandals. The new allegations by Mr Martelli contain statements that Mr Craxi was personally involved in the receipt of funds paid into a secret Swiss bank account. The funds were allegedly paid by the late Mr Roberto Calvi, the head of the Banco Ambrosiano, which collapsed in 1982, and related to the Socialist party's assistance in organising loans from ENI, the state oil company, to help the ailing bank. It was not clear yesterday whether the delay in parliament's decision was solely related to these fresh allegations. The government is also drawing up legislation for a political solution to the judicial problems raised by prosecuting scores of politicians, businessmen and officials on corruption charges, largely related to illicit financing of the political parties. The cabinet could agree on such proposals at a meeting today. Meanwhile, the work of the parliamentary commission drawing up proposals for constitutional change is likely to be delayed pending the choice of a successor to Mr Ciriaco de Mita, who resigned this week as commission president. Mr de Mita, a former Christian Democrat premier, resigned after his brother was arrested on fraud charges.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTING TARGET HOLLYWWOD;  </P> <P> THE ETHICS OF EXPOSING CELEBRITIES' SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS  </P> <P> Re the July 22 article on "outing" by Pat H. Broeske and John M. Wilson:  Tattle-taling on closeted homosexuals.  </P> <P> Yes! Just of kind of juicy smut I savor.  </P> <P> You tantalize with tidbits: ". . . the alleged lesbianism of the daughter of a  popular performer," a former model who ". . . claimed she had a relationship  with a prominent TV and film actress." Yes! Yes! Don't stop!  </P> <P> The excitement is building. The breath is faster. I turn the pages quickly.  Pressure is mounting. Who? I want names, dammit! and then . . . there it is  that little box that marks the article's end, like an inept lover who  prematurely rolls over. It'll be another long night.  </P> <P> MILDRED CRANE  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CORNER  </P> <P> Epochal. Earth-shaking. Monumental. What's been happening in Eastern Europe  ranks as one of the great news stories of the decade. Perhaps of the century.  </P> <P> But viewers in this country have not been tuning in to see it, at least not in  the kind of numbers one might expect. Not even when the Berlin Wall all but  fell crashing to the ground.  </P> <P> "It just didn't play," says a spokeswoman for ABC News. "The ratings are down a  little bit across the board," says a spokesman for CBS News. "They certainly  haven't gone up."  </P> <P> America is soft on communism. And the decline and fall thereof.  </P> <P> But why? Here is a story of drama, significance and impact, told through often  sensational pictures: Families streaming through newly opened borders. Loved  ones reunited. Masses marching. Decades-old barriers crumbling as whole  societies make giant leaps toward freedom.  </P> <P> "Anyone who touched this story saw their ratings go down," says Richard Kaplan,  executive producer of the ABC News series "PrimeTime Live," whose program on  the Berlin Wall was the lowest-rated installment that aired up to that time.  </P> <P> Viewership for the three network evenings newscasts is off from the same period  a year ago. Special reports on Berlin that aired on ABC, CBS and NBC scored  ratings that were mediocre or meager or worse. The Nielsens gave no sign of  voracious or even above-average interest.  </P> <P> "Everyone in network news is scratching their heads about this," says Kaplan.  "I can see where the average Joe might not care that much about Poland or  Czechoslovakia, but the Berlin Wall is universal; you couldn't grow up not  knowing about it. It's a tangible Iron Curtain, albeit one made of brick, and  it falls, and nobody cares. I can't figure it out."  </P> <P> Ed Turner, news director of CNN, says his network's audience hasn't seemed  fascinated with the story, either. "Much to my astonishment, I think that's  true, at least in this sense: The ratings have not shown a leap as they did  with China earlier this year or with the earthquake in San Francisco."  </P> <P> "I tell you what it may prove," says Reuven Frank, former president of NBC  News. "It may prove that Geraldo Rivera is right and the rest of us are wrong,  God help us. Maybe he's the one who knows what news is. Maybe if four people  sat around and talked about it with Oprah Winfrey, people would listen."  </P> <P> Frank doesn't feel TV news has failed the audience with its coverage of the  story. "As far as whether the networks are doing it right -- the depth of  analysis tends to be rather shallow, but other than that, they're doing it as  right as they can."  </P> <P> "I don't think we in the news business should be insulted by the ratings," says  Andrew Lack, executive producer of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung" on CBS.  "And I wouldn't infer from the ratings that people don't care about it. I think  there's a repetitive quality to the coverage and people realize that. They know  something's going on; I just don't think they need to miss 'L.A. Law' to see  it."  </P> <P> "Normally, you do not see network-rating lifts with internationally based  stories," says David M. Poltrack, the executive vice president in charge of  research for CBS. Poltrack doesn't feel this is a failure by network news; it's  just a matter of viewer preference. "You see ratings lifts on domestic-based  stories like earthquakes and hurricanes."  </P> <P> And yet ratings did shoot up for coverage of the uprising and massacre in  China. ABC News President Roone Arledge has told colleagues that he thinks slim  viewer interest in Eastern Europe may be traced to the fact that the story  hasn't had the threat of violence hanging over it, as China did. CNN's Turner  agrees.  </P> <P> "This story is good news," Turner says. "Had there been a Tiananmen Square in  Berlin, we would have had tremendous ratings. This did not have the macabre  appeal that death and destruction do."  </P> <P> Perhaps viewers are uncomfortable with the feeling that the United States  suddenly seems to sit on the sidelines of history instead of in the thick of  it. Now the Soviet Union and its crumbling bloc are the focal point of the  world's attention. Earlier, it was China. It used to be us.  </P> <P> America isn't the news epicenter it was, and Americans may even subconsciously  resent that the big stories are happening elsewhere. Despite the everyday  wonders of the satellite link, the Global Village may still be a long way off.  A National Village prevails. It's one wall that has not fallen.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to argue that our (national) priorities are in the right  places," says Poltrack, "but we in the news business can only just keep  trying."  </P></p>

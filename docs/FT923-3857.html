			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Anger at EC product safety rules BRITISH industry has been told by the government to implement EC product-safety directives immediately, even though that may double the cost of the changes and most community countries are behind the UK in introducing them. The directives on child-resistant caps for containers of toxic material such as creosote, paint stripper and adhesives sold through retail outlets were supposed to come into force on August 1. The retail, paintmaking, adhesives and aerosols industries were advised by government officials not to retool their production lines until the Health and Safety Executive had drawn up parallel domestic regulations. The complexity of drafting the regulations meant that the August 1 deadline was missed, and the Department of Trade and Industry has put the date for implementation of the regulations back to November 1. Manufacturers say that means millions of pounds worth of stock already produced will have to be taken back and their containers scrapped. The industries were expecting a six-month transition period. Mrs Moira McMillan, director of the Paintmakers Association, said yesterday: 'We are all in favour of making the changes, providing it is the same for all of us, but this will double the cost for the paint industry alone from Pounds 6m to Pounds 12m. The other industries are going to be similarly hit. 'It's a terrific example of the government shooting its own industry in the foot. As if things were not bad enough already with the recession.' There is also confusion about which types of bottle tops will comply with the regulations. Mrs McMillan said some companies that had started tooling up for designs approved by the British Standards Institution had discovered that the directive dealt only with internationally approved systems, and the two were not the same. A delegation from all the industries this week failed to persuade DTI officials to change their minds. The delegation was particularly annoyed that only the Netherlands and Denmark have the directives fully in place so far. France implements them on October 1, but with a three-month transition period. Germany's date is January 1, with a six-month transition.</p>

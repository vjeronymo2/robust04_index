			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CRP Leisure shares suspended SHARES in CRP Leisure, the USM-quoted public house refurbishment company formerly called PE Kemp, were suspended at 7 1/2 p yesterday at the company's request, pending an announcement. Yesterday's request for the suspension is understood to have followed the acquisition by a small group of shareholders of the 78 per cent stake in the company formerly held by Gatedene Developments. The new shareholders are believed to be planning a refinancing, including a rights issue, which is likely to be announced on Monday. Last month, the group warned of financial difficulties at its CR Pursehouse subsidiary acquired a year ago, compounded by a sizeable bad debt on a building contract.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: Sergey Leiferku - Recital Although the freedom to travel has encouraged ever more striking young Russian singers to forge careers in the West, those who managed to establish themselves in the dying days of the communist era still hold their place proudly. Among the many baritones, Sergey Leiferkus remains supreme on the international stage. It is almost ten years since I first heard Leiferkus in Aida at the Maryinsky (then Kirov) Theatre in St Petersburg. The voice did not seem especially large at that time, but it had a flawless focus of sound that left no doubt as to its quality. His encore from Yevgeny Onegin at his Wigmore Hall recital on Wednesday told of the same strengths - concentrated force of tone, ringing top notes, beyond the limits of his younger rivals. It would be easy to talk about nothing but the basic quality of his voice. Its brilliance, as though singing with the spotlight turned full on, is unlike any other baritone in the profession today. But this recital of songs by Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov displayed colourings, variations, shadings of the voice that are now just as important. One reason may be that it has become a deeper baritone than it used to be. The words 'Say, I love' in his second Rakhmaninov song were spoken in a strangely hollow, husky tone, so as to convey something of the poem's hints of masochism. The central stanza of 'Fate', when the poet talks of sunset growing dark behind the wood, became warm, tender, dusky. The scalding mockery of 'Christ is risen]' was aflame with white-hot vocal intens-ity. Almost every colour was there - the one exception being a truly hushed, inward feeling, which Leiferkus uses sparely. Even when he did find it for Tchaikovsky's desolate 'Again, as before, I am alone', it is worth remembering what his compatriot Olga Borodina has achieved in the same song. Where Leiferkus was soft-edged, withdrawn, keeping Tchaikovsky cocooned in his own private world with eyes closed, Borodina peered openly into the black depths of despair. Comparisons, though, rarely go against Leiferkus. Perhaps the programme included an undue number of songs that ended with a chance to show off those impressive top F's and G's. Otherwise, this recital, gloriously sung, tellingly interpreted, and with an able accompanist in Semion Skigin, showed Russia's leading baritone at the peak of his art. It is excellent news that he is to record the songs of Musorgsky. The other Russian song composers should follow soon.</p>

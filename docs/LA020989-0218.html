			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BONN REPORTS RECORD TRADE SURPLUS  </P> <P> t Germany today announced a record trade surplus for 1988, but economists said  the European Community is not likely to be pleased with the excess and  predictions of future export growth.  </P> <P> West Germany recorded a trade surplus of 128 billion marks ($69 billion) last  year, versus the then-record of 117.7 billion marks ($63 billion) in 1987, the  Federal Statistics Office reported.  </P> <P> Economists estimate a surplus as high as 142 billion marks ($76 billion) this  year. Exports should continue to boom, they said, although higher consumer  taxes are expected to dampen economic growth to 2.5% from 3.4% in 1988.  </P> <P> "They're bound to complain," Richard Reid, international economist at London  brokers Phillips &amp; Drew, said of the EC members. "West Germany's surplus  with countries like France, Britain and Italy is increasing most rapidly."  </P> <P> Bonn's bulging surpluses have provoked frequent criticism from Washington the  last two years, but the emphasis is now shifting to EC countries -- who are  buying more than half of the country's exports, economists said.  </P></p>

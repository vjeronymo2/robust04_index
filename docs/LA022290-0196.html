			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: HOW TO PREDICT THE UNPREDICTABLE  </P> <P> Presidents of the United States are not the only ones who hire soothsayers to  tell them what the future will bring. Large corporations also sign up former  Cabinet officers and foreign policy experts to warn them what to expect around  the globe. These experts don't come cheap, but they're worth it. From Moscow to  Mandela it's been one triumph after another for global consultants.  </P> <P> Occasionally, there are misunderstandings. I was sitting in the anteroom of  Heinrich Applebaum's "Made-to-Order Quality Predictions" when Willard Dergen,  CEO of Stardust Avionics, charged in. He wanted to know why he hadn't been  informed about the overthrow of the old regime in Czechoslovakia, and its  replacement with a playwright, when he had paid Heinrich a fee of $750,000.  </P> <P> Heinrich smiled, as he usually does when stuck in a corner, and replied, "We  didn't want to bother you with something so insignificant. Czechoslovakia is  such a little country, it can't affect anything."  </P> <P> Willard spluttered and said, "Why did I have to find out on CNN that Romania  was about to fall and its leader had been killed? Your job is to let me know  who is going to get killed in Romania."  </P> <P> "Willard, we didn't want to go off the deep end until our CIA sources confirmed  it for us. One thing we don't do at Applebaum Predictions is fax a client for  the sake of faxing him."  </P> <P> "This may sound strange to you, but I don't like to spend $2 million a year and  not even know about the fall of the Berlin Wall. Why didn't you people inform  us that the wall was going to be torn down?"  </P> <P> "The East Germans gave us their word that the wall would stay forever. But they  double-crossed us to suck up to West Germany."  </P> <P> "Why didn't your firm predict the collapse of communism in East Germany?"  </P> <P> "We don't Red-bait. Nobody could have seen that coming. If we had told you last  year that there would soon be only one Germany, you would have asked for your  money back. Weren't you surprised?"  </P> <P> "I pay you so that I won't be surprised. How come I didn't hear from you when  Bulgaria went under?"  </P> <P> "We told you that there is a surcharge for information about events in  Bulgaria. Willard, were we or weren't we right on Poland?"  </P> <P> "You were as right as Time magazine which was where I first read the story.  What have you been doing about the Soviet Union?  </P> <P> "I have to know now. If I can't figure out what the Soviet Union is doing, I  won't be able to decide how much business the Defense Department is going to  throw my way. You owe it to me to give me the scoop on daily events in the  Kremlin."  </P> <P> "Willard, we have a report on Raisa Gorbachev's dressmaker that will make your  hair stand on end."  </P> <P> "When do I see this intelligence?"  </P> <P> "As soon as we get the leather-bound report with your name engraved on it back  from the printer. It's a gorgeous presentation if I must say so myself."  </P> <P> "Give me something today that I can go back to my board with to justify your  outrageous fee."  </P> <P> "The South Africans are going to release Nelson Mandela from prison."  </P> <P> "They did that last week."  </P> <P> "They did?" Heinrich was truly surprised. "Nobody tells me anything."  </P></p>

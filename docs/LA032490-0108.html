			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAO OPENS INVESTIGATION INTO FUNDING OF 'OBSCENE' ART  </P> <P> The U.S. General Accounting Office said Friday it had opened an investigation  of alleged improper funding of obscene artworks by the National Endowment for  the Arts, responding to a demand for a probe earlier this week by Sen. Jesse  Helms (R-N.C.).  </P> <P> A GAO official, however, said a preliminary reading of the NEA's 1990  appropriation bill, which precludes funding of obscene works unless they meet  high standards for artistic excellence, appears to give the arts endowment  extremely wide leeway.  </P> <P> The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was brought into the NEA  controversy by Helms when the North Carolina senator asked, in a letter dated  March 6 but not made public until this week, for an inquiry into "possible  violations of law by the NEA."  </P> <P> John E. Frohnmayer, the arts endowment's chairman, said GAO investigators were  meeting Friday afternoon in Washington with endowment officials. "I believe we  have been very diligent," he said. "I do welcome the review. If there are  things that need to be remedied, I'm the first one that wants to remedy them.  But, if not, I hope this impartial review lays the issue to rest."  </P> <P> Henry Wray, the GAO's associate general counsel, confirmed the agency is  responding to a demand by Helms that it investigate possible violations of  restrictive language in the arts endowment's 1990 funding bill. The rider was  inserted as a compromise to resolve an intense controversy last year in which  Helms attempted -- unsuccessfully -- to ban federal funding for any art that  was obscene, indecent or even just offensive.  </P> <P> Wray said clear questions exist over whether the restrictive language, which  permits funding of any arts project that meets high standards of artistic  excellence, has any practical effect on banning federal funding of anything.  </P> <P> "The way the restriction is written leaves the endowment some discretion in  what to fund and what not to fund," Wray said. "It certainly gives them the  right to make a judgment. If they make the determination (that a possibly  obscene work had exceptional artistic merit), there would be no illegal use of  funds."  </P> <P> A Helms spokesman said the senator would have no statement on the NEA  controversy until at least Monday.  </P> <P> The Helms letter included a list of nine specific arts projects that Helms  contended were illegal under the terms of the 1990 appropriation law. But while  many of the examples were works or shows that had previously been brought into  the arts endowment controversy, all nine examples appeared to have been  projects funded by the NEA before the current appropriation bill went into  effect.  </P> <P> The major elements in Helms's complaint included "Witnesses: Against Our  Vanishing," an AIDS-related show at a New York City gallery that precipitated a  major NEA crisis last November when Frohnmayer first rescinded -- then restored  -- NEA support, and "Modern Primitives," another 1989 show.  </P> <P> "Modern Primitives" featured body piecing and piercing of the genital organs.  It was organized by an arts group in Seattle and exhibited at Southern  Exposure, a gallery affiliated with San Francisco's Project Artaud.  </P> <P> The Helms list also included a 1989 performance by Annie Sprinkle, a  controversial New York performance artist, to which conservatives objected.  </P> <P> "I do not question that the endowment's chairman (Frohnmayer) may be sincere in  his assertion that none of the NEA funds are being used to support such 'art,'  " Helms said, "but the evidence to the contrary is so compelling that it is  imperative that there be an objective investigation."  </P></p>

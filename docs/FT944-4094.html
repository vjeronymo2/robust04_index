			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Eddie George's view on inflation heartens gilts UK government bonds were heartened by reassuring comments yesterday on inflation from the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, who said it would reach a plateau soon. Gilts had opened weaker but then rose on his comments, with one dealer saying prices were marked up by about  3/8 of a point. The 'mini-budget' by chancellor Kenneth Clarke seemed to leave gilt prices largely unmoved, although some dealers were quick to point out that the increase in the tax on drinks would take effect from January, whereas the now-abandoned fuel tax increase which it replaced would not have taken effect until April. However, some estimates suggest that while the tax on fuel would have added 0.5 of a point to inflation, the taxes which replace it would add 0.2 or 0.3 of a point to inflation. Mr Adam Chester at Yamaichi said the 'mini-budget' left the inflation outlook 'broadly unchanged'. By the end of the day the December long gilt future had moved up  1/8 of a point to trade around 101 13/32 . The spread over bunds had moved to about 131 basis points. Trading was slow, with dealers reporting some switching out of gilts as the spread over bunds approached 128. Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS said: 'Buying has trickled away. People are waiting for next week's data.' There is a raft of data due out in the UK next week, with producer prices on Monday, earnings and inflation figures on Wednesday, retail sales figures on Thursday and the public sector borrowing requirement on Friday. Mr Chester said: 'I think it will be another welcome set of data for the market.' He thinks the gilt market will enter the new year on a reasonably firm note. Analysts said most big investment decisions would probably be driven by the data due out in the UK next week and the data due from the US, rather than recent political developments. German government bonds opened weaker on third-quarter gross domestic product figures but then rose slightly. The third-quarter GDP figure was 1.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter, against market expectations of around 1 per cent. Mr Paul Campayne at Paribas Capital Markets said: 'There is very little momentum or activity. A lot of domestic investors have closed their books for the year, and the market will probably stay in range-bound trading.' He said that while bunds had been hit by the stronger-than-expected GDP figure, there was evidence of technical support for bunds at the 90 level. The March bund futures contract on Liffe rose by 0.08 on the day to 90.29. US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday in thin trading as investors continued to sort through signs that the Federal Reserve intends to raise interest rates again in the near term and ramifications of the bankruptcy of Orange County, California. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  9/32 at 95 13/16 , yielding 7.859 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 9/16 , yielding 7.473 percent. With little economic news out yesterday, the market focused on Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's Wednesday testimony to Congress' joint economic committee. Mr Greenspan said he was concerned that inflationary pressures would ultimately be reflected in rising consumer prices. Investors interpreted the testimony as a signal that the Fed would boost interest rates again by early next year. The Fed has already raised rates six times this year. The interest rate fearsled to a sell-off of short-term bonds. The long end of the market, however, firmed as the market judged that the Fed's actions would slow the economy. At one point, the decoupling of the long and short term segments of the market pushed the spread between the two-year and 30-year bonds down nearly 35 basis points, before it bounced back close to where it was late on Wednesday. The long end also gained support from the dollar, which rose against the Japanese yen and the D-Mark. A rising dollar helps the market by encouraging foreign investors to put their money in US government securities such as Treasury bonds. Also troubling the market were concerns about the fall-out from the financial troubles of Orange County - the largest municipality ever to declare itself bankrupt. Investors fear other counties may face similar difficulties.</p>

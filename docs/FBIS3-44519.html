			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A Solemn Mission -- on the </F> Meetings of Various Subcommittees Under the Preliminary Working  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's  Preparatory Committee in Beijing"]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- Coming on the heels of  the new year, the various subcommittees under the Preliminary  Working Committee [PWC] of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region's [SAR] Preparatory Committee will hold successive  meetings in Beijing to study and make suggestions on the Hong  Kong SAR's political, economic, and legal affairs. Intensifying  the PWC's work following the complete destruction [che di po  huai 1796 1646 4275 0975] of the Sino-British talks by the  British Government and Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten carries  vital significance for ensuring China's resumption of  sovereignty over Hong Kong, for effecting a smooth transition in  1997, and for achieving long-term stability and prosperity in  Hong Kong.    Resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong is a common aspiration  of  all Chinese people. For a long time since the end of the Opium  War in 1840, China suffered all kinds of aggression by Britain  and other imperialist powers; its sovereignty was violated, its  people were humiliated, and it suffered territorial losses and  breakups. Generation after generation of our forefathers did not  hesitate to shed their blood and make sacrifices as they  advanced in an endless stream to end this history of  humiliation. The Chinese nation was able to stand on its own  feet only after the PRC was founded in 1949. Three and a half  years from now on, Hong Kong -- a piece of territory occupied by  Britain for more than a century -- will return to the fold of  the motherland. Once we resume our sovereignty over Hong Kong,  the entire world will see that the sovereignty will be complete  and real; in other words, we will not exercise the kind of  fragmented, nominal, and empty "sovereignty" -- that proposed by  the British Government in the past -- which aims at continuing  British rule over Hong Kong by separating "sovereignty" and "the  right to rule." All Chinese people who champion national  interests -- including the vast numbers of Hong Kong compatriots  -- and all patriots will heartily support this solemn stand of  the motherland.    After the PWC's formation, the British Hong Kong authorities  and a handful of people who are eager to stir up trouble have  gone through restless nights and days; like people who whistle  to drive away their fears when they walk on the street at night,  they have made defamatory remarks about the PWC from time to  time. Patten has prated about so-called "public trust" in the  PWC, although people can see that he himself feels that his  remarks are lame. Is a British politician who would not forego  his colonialist interests qualified to criticize as lacking in  public trust a working body authorized by China's supreme organ  of power? Consider Britain's actions when it was forced to  retreat from its colonies one after another. What public trust  did it ever have? Conversely, we will certainly win the  public's trust if we respect our own nation, sincerely support  the motherland's resumption of its sovereignty over Hong Kong,  contribute our talents and efforts to maintaining Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability, and work realistically to implement  the Basic Law and the "one country and two systems" in Hong  Kong. Mr. Patten and a few individuals who talk and act wildly  cannot vilify the broadly representative PWC and its fruitful  work.    PWC members are working hard to defend China's sovereignty,  to let Hong Kong exercise a high degree of autonomy within the  context of the Basic Law and effect a smooth transition in 1997,  and to create a better future for Hong Kong. They carry the  great trust of more than 1.1 billion Chinese people, as well as  a solemn mission. We would like to pay our high tribute to them.  Their work will write an illustrious page in China's history.  We wish the meetings success.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> HOLLOW PREDICTIONS ABOUT AMERICA  </P> <P> American Renaissance: Our Life at the Turn of the 21st Century by Marvin Cetron  and Owen Davis (St. Martin's Press: $19.95; 320 pages).  </P> <P> There are 55 stars on the flag on the cover of "American Renaissance: Our Life  at the Turn of the 21st Century" by "futurologists" Marvin Cetron and Owen  Davis. One of the extra stars stands for Puerto Rico, and the other four stand  for Canada which -- so Cetron and Davis fatuously but confidently assert --  will join the United States sometime near the dawn of the 21st Century.  </P> <P> Why Canada "minus Quebec, which will become, we are told, independent" will  join as four states rather than two, six, eight or 12, or why it will join at  all, our authors never tell us. They live in a happy land above the clouds  where such mundane questions are not raised; where the laws of history, logic  and arithmetic do not hold; where America's most pressing problems will  disappear in a decade -- and where bad prose, sloppy editing and wishful  thinking add up to a book.  </P> <P> "Futurology" is a discipline -- we do not say a science -- concerned with  making predictions -- in this case about the year 2000. The discipline lends  itself to two kinds of predictions: the obvious and the venturesome. The  obvious predictions are the most common, although not always the safest. One  simply extrapolates a given trend into the future and -- presto! -- the  predictions appear. Thus Cetron and Davis can tell us that there will be more  old people in the year 2000 than there are now. There will be more need for  nursing homes, a shortage of qualified workers to staff them, and greater  trouble paying the health-care bills of the elderly. In perhaps the most  competent of the 22 chapters of this book, the authors look at additional  implications of demographic changes now under way in the United States.  </P> <P> This kind of trend-spotting is the lower futurology, and our authors have  higher aspirations. At their most interesting, futurologists apply the  principles of history, economics, sociology and technology to imagine possible  futures that can help guide our actions in the present. "Predictions" of this  kind rarely are fully justified by events, but often contain insights of great  importance and interest.  </P> <P> This is the level of futurology to which Cetron and Davis aspire, and this is  the level at which they fail -- painfully, publicly, utterly. They want to make  the case for America's coming recovery from its troubles of the last two  decades, but their understanding of the problems is so clearly superficial that  their optimism rings hollow. Unintentionally, they have written a book from  which only pessimists and cynics can take solace.  </P> <P> Take economic competitiveness, for example. Many observers have been troubled  by the difficulties American industry has had in coping with international  competition. Clearly, if such difficulties continue, it will be difficult to  finance a rising standard of living for American workers. This development  would be bad news not only for them but for all those who make their living  selling workers cars and consumer goods, tending their illnesses and building  them houses. Cetron and Davis acknowledge the problem, but make a diagnosis  that economists of every school would consider foolish, and predict a cure  based solely on wishful thinking.  </P> <P> Their "diagnosis" begins with the colossally silly statement that "each nation  that makes a place for itself in international commerce reduces the market for  American goods and so cuts into our standard of living." The Smith family might  as well say that every dollar the Joneses make is one less dollar for the  Smiths. Actually, of course, the prosperity of the Joneses is good news for the  Smiths, and the growth of other countries is good for the United States. In  both cases, the greater incomes of our trading partners mean more opportunities  for us to sell goods to them. Prosperity is contagious -- that is why American  administrations, liberal and conservative, Republican and Democratic, have  tried to increase international trade for the last 50 years.  </P> <P> So far, so bad. But when "American Renaissance" ventures into the field of  international relations, it gets even further out of its depth. Japan "may soon  collapse," say the authors in a one-page mini-essay stuffed with embarrassing  mistakes. Why is Japan in decline? Declining competitiveness with East Asia  (actually, Japan maintains healthy trade surpluses with most of the newly  emergent countries), rising unemployment at 4% (actually, Japanese unemployment  is at 2.2%, down from 2.4% in the last year) and slowing gross national product  (actually, Japan's growth at 4.8% in the last 12 months remains the highest, by  far, of any major industrial nation). "American Renaissance" also points to the  graying of Japan as a source of weakness, but fails to mention that unlike the  United States, Japan is a net international creditor with approximately $10  trillion in total savings to support its retirees.  </P> <P> According to "American Renaissance," at or near the turn of the century, Japan  will decline, Canada will join the union, and the Soviet Union will cooperate  with the United States to police the developing world. Maybe -- but Cetron and  Davis' error-filled and superficial analysis fails to persuade.  </P> <P> A strong case can be made that America's decline is not anywhere near  irreversible, and that a new and better world is just around the corner.  Unfortunately, this book doesn't make that case. Badly conceived and poorly  organized, it is -- or ought to be -- an embarrassment to its publisher, its  editor, its authors and their fellow futurologists and optimists everywhere.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas Vows To Continue Its </F> Operations, Warns Against `One-Party System'"]    [Excerpt] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Islamic Resistance  Movement (Hamas) yesterday vowed to continue its operations  against the Israeli occupation despite the agreement signed by  the PLO and Israel in Cairo to implement self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho. It described the agreement as "capitulationist, null  and void, and not binding on the Palestinian people."    In a statement, of which AL-HAYAH has received a copy, Hamas  urged the Palestinian authority and its police to serve the  people. It warned of "the consequences of factionalism, a  one-party system, submitting to the Zionist enemy, and  preventing our people's mujahidin from carrying out resistance  operations against the occupation army and settlers."    Hamas welcomed "dialogue and meeting with all Palestinian  national forces and influential figures on the basis of  continuing the resistance, defeating the occupation, and sparing  our people the calamities of sedition and infighting." It  condemned "the use of arms to resolve political and family  disputes."    Hamas vowed to continue mass struggle "against the  occupation  and its symbols." [passage omitted]</p>

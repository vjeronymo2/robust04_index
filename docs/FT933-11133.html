			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (3): Waiting for the bonanza - Oil and gas strike brings fresh hope for Clwyd economy or rather a consortium of Hamilton, Lasmo and Monument Oil has struck gas and oil in Liverpool Bay, a few miles off the Clwyd coast. What Clwyd hopes for, long term, is a bonanza. Most believe it cannot come quickly enough, for some aspects of the local economy are on what Paul Roberts, head of economic development at Clwyd county council, says is a 'knife-edge.' Clwyd lost about 10,000 jobs with the closure of much of the Shotton steelworks more than 10 years ago. It was close to clawing most back through inward investment and growth, but in 1991 lost 1,200 more at United Engineering Steels at Brymbo, near Wrexham. Meanwhile, continuing recession in world aviation markets means dangling uncertainty for British Aerospace, which employs 800 people on executive jets and 3,000 on airbus wings in the county. Inward investment brings jobs, but usually not many at a time. For example, when Amcor, a packaging company, recently decided to set up a corrugated cardboard factory in Clwyd, it brought in only a tenth of the jobs lost with the Brymbo steelworks closure. What Clwyd needed therefore was something to give it a big leap forward and attract clusters of new investment. The newly-discovered oil and gas fields of Liverpool Bay look like providing it. Indeed, for all the trumpeting of Toyota's decision to locate its engine plant in Clwyd near the now highly efficient strip-processing remnants of Shotton steelworks, Hamilton's discovery is widely expected to prove much more significant. Toyota will eventually create about 300 jobs - about 100 people have been taken on already - and although this should lead to more among component suppliers, many will not be local. Exploitation of Liverpool Bay looks like offering bigger local prospects. Gas is to be piped ashore to a terminal at Point of Ayr, on the tip of the Dee estuary. Oil will be removed directly from the field by ship and in the early stages at least will bring no direct benefit to Wales. The gas will involve initial developments costing Pounds 1.2bn. From the terminal, gas will be piped about 15 miles to Connah's Quay, near the Queensferry border with England, there to fire a 1,350 MW, Pounds 580m power station which GEC Alsthom is building for Powergen. Go-ahead for the entire development came in the spring after more than a year of delays. First, conservationists on both sides of the Dee estuary objected to the terminal, which will be near a nature reserve. A public inquiry cleared the way for David Hunt, then Welsh Secretary, to approve the terminal in February, but by then the pit closures debate had seen the electricity generators' 'dash-for-gas' put on hold, so the power station was stalled. The first contracts were finally let at the end of May after the project was eventually cleared by government. Work on the Pounds 60m terminal has started, with immediate knock-on economic effects. AOC International has the contract but associated civil engineering works are being done by David McLean Contractors, which is based in the Clwyd town of Flint, creating 700 local jobs immediately. A total of 3,000 construction jobs are expected overall, with the first gas reaching Wales in 1996. Although the project will leave only 200 permanent jobs, Mr Roberts expects Clwyd to be in position to exploit what should be some attractive industrial infrastructure. 'We hope to attract to the region energy-intensive projects which can take advantage of such abundant supplies of gas and electricity. We think this might give us the basis for building good, long-term jobs. 'In the past we have played the numbers game. We have tried to retain employment as jobs drained away through closures by attempting to attract labour-intensive industries. We are now developing a base that should prove attractive to companies looking for higher skills, where people will be able to earn higher wages,' he adds. This is critical for male jobs in particular. Clwyd's male unemployment rate is 14.7 per cent - nearly three times worse than that for women, currently 5.3 per cent. Redressing this imbalance would go some way to counteracting one of Wales's perpetual problems - a low gross domestic product per head relative to other parts of Britain. What Clwyd is hoping to get from new high technology industry is better value added in manufacturing, higher wages, and a more widely multi-skilled workforce with better local spending power. The local professional infrastructure to back this up is developing. Mr Peter Richards, senior partner of Clement Jones &amp; Co, a firm of solicitors based in Holywell is sure the Liverpool Bay developments will stimulate growth across the board. A native of Crickhowell in South Wales, he joined the firm in 1973 after university and articles in Liverpool. He has since expanded it to 14 offices  -eight in Clwyd, four in Gwynedd, and two in Cheshire - with more than 100 employed, including 30 fee-earners, including six partners. He claims his is now the biggest commercial law firm in North Wales. Clwyd as a county is aiming for 25,000 new jobs by the year 2000, split equally between services and manufacturing. It also wants at least 500 export-focused companies by then. Not all of the old world has been swept away, however. There is one working coalmine left - ironically, at Point of Ayr. It has survived the coal closure review, although with only half its former complement of 470 men. Clwyd's leaders fought as hard to save it as they did for the gas terminal and power station which, many believed, threatened the pit's doom. However, the two fights were parallel, not inter-dependent, for the colliery's market is Fiddler's Ferry power station at Widnes on the banks of the Mersey, about 30 miles away. The old and the new look like co-existing for some time.</p>

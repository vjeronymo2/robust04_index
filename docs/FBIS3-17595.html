			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" Article by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy: "When I Am </F> President..."]    [Text] Since the political earthquake caused by the  parliamentary elections in Russia last September, no politician  on this planet has been the target of such fanatical media  interest as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the victorious  Liberal Democrats. All the songs of hatred that are being sung  about him seem incapable of stopping his victory procession.  Last week in Moscow, Zhirinovskiy conducted an exhaustive  tete-a-tete with former U.S. President Richard Nixon, whom  President Bill Clinton had sent to the Russian capital to  discover Zhirinovskiy's real thoughts. Nixon expressed his  approval of Russia's wish to regain its great power position and  of its claim for equal treatment. We present, exclusively for  DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG and DEUTSCHE WOCHEN- ZEITUNG readers,  an article by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy about his plans as future  Russian president:    The most ridiculous accusations have been leveled against me  recently, mainly by the German media. I have been accused of  everything except cannibalism and beastiality, in other words  sex with animals. If I were to reply to every single abnormal  insinuation, I would be doing nothing but countering the  perverse fantasies of press people who have obviously been  watching too many Hollywood movies.    The nationally aware and historically enlightened Germans  are  clever enough to know what certain "media" understand by the  term "truth." But critical-minded persons will notice that,  despite the fact that the media "report" on me so often, I  seldom have the opportunity, even in Germany, of uttering a few  sentences by way of explanation. At the very most, strings of  words are brought into play meant to "prove" exactly the  opposite of what I really said. Sometimes my statements are  mistranslated. Mostly downright lies are said about me.    My good German friend Dr. Frey is now giving me the chance  to  speak out in plain terms, and without censorship. I am happy to  take advantage of this opportunity in order to answer a question  that must beset very many Germans: What is this man Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy going to do when he becomes president of Russia,  the biggest country in the world?    Will I destroy Germany with nuclear bombs or assume  leadership of the world together with the Germans? People  accuse me of both, often in the same breath. This is utter  nonsense. The truth is that I want a strong Russia allied to a  strong Germany. For this purpose, military strength is also  required, or else we shall become a banana republic dictated to  by foreign powers and ridiculed at our expense.    Indeed we wish to be fearsome, but only to those who want to  attack us. I want a Russia that is respected in the world, a  country that people cannot ignore whenever they want to. I  envisage good cooperation with Germany in defense technology. A  new armed struggle between the Germans and the Russians must be  firmly ruled out.    What do I want in industry? As much private initiative as  possible, as much state interventionism as necessary. We want  none of the rapacious capitalism where international bosses  pocket all the money and the masses simply vegetate in poverty.  I think the social market economy concepts of Professor Ludwig  Erhard, developed during World War II and implemented in many  spheres since then, contain sound ideas.    As president, I will also maintain the best possible  economic  relations with the Germans. We Russians, with our enormous  natural resources, and the Germans with their know-how are ideal  partners. A German-Russian economic partnership would certainly  bring an economic miracle to both countries.    Regarding social policy: I do not want a social system in  Russia in which a wafer-thin minority acquires untold riches  whilst the man in the street gets nothing. As far as the social  security system is concerned, the policy of Bismarck is a  pattern for me.    Regarding cultural policy: Here, I want a Russian  self-awareness. I will certainly oppose the flooding of our  country with the decadent trash that is showered upon us, mainly  from the United States. The readers know what I mean, because  the Germans are also recipients thereof. I am not at all  concerned with sealing Russia off from foreign cultural  influences completely, but there must not be an excessive flow  of this cultural influence. Our great Tchaikovsky combined  German romanticism with Russian national music, and thereby  created masterpieces of Western music. That is just one of many  examples.    Regarding foreign policy: He who is peaceful toward us has  nothing to worry about, but he who wages war on us should know  that Russia under my leadership will trample every invader  underfoot. The Russians and Germans could establish an  invincible defense union. The heroism of German and Russian  soldiers, so often proved in history, will, together with a  joint defense policy, frighten off any potential aggressor.  Bismarck is also an example for me in foreign policy.    When the German-Russian partnership I am aiming toward has  come about, we will be able to discuss Kaliningrad and find a  solution that conforms to German interests. The territorial  change to Germany in 1945 was not a final act of history, and  certainly not a final act of wisdom.    Just as his predecessors did before him, President Clinton  said in his inaugural speech that the United States shall lead  the world. We have no intention of adopting a similar role for  Russia. We want a completely sovereign Russia that possesses  its rightful place in our hemisphere. To quote the great  Prussian King Frederick II, everyone should be happy in his own  way.    One last word. I am not concerned with delivering empty  sentences in a manner to which certain Russian and also German  politicians have grown accustomed. I do not use underworld  vocabulary that is understood by only a few initiated persons.  I try to express myself in such a way that my people know what  I want. The Germans, too, should know that I love my people and  country above everything else, just as nationally-conscious  Germans love their nation and their fatherland. If is out of  this love that I desire eternal friendship between the two great  western peoples, the Germans and the Russians.</p>

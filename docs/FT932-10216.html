			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Revamped Maddox over Pounds 1m AFTER returning to the black at midway, Maddox Group finished the 1992 year with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.13m from turnover of Pounds 24m. Included in the profit was a Pounds 491,000 exceptional credit. In the second half Cables and Flexibles and Seacoast Electric suffered a significant reduction in activity and substantially poorer results than expected. Hence the decision to sell them. Wakebourne Group, the computer and maintenance support business acquired last August, matched expectations and made significant contributions to profits. Operating profit before central costs came to Pounds 1.36m. Wakebourne accounted for Pounds 906,000, C&amp;F Pounds 387,000 and Seacoast Pounds 223,000 for the period March to September, and other businesses incurred losses of Pounds 155,000. Earnings per share came to 0.39p, against losses of 1.43p in the previous nine months on a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 311,000. Assuming shareholders approve the sale of C&amp;F and Seacoast the main business of the group in 1993 will be focused on the information technology support sector. In the first four months of 1993 Wakebourne's profits were ahead of budget, and Computer Profiles, a UNIX based systems development business acquired in February, was already contributing to group performance.</p>

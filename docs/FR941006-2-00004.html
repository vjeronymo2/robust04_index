			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, certain State regulatory agencies have requested modifications to the follow-up procedures when producer herd milk exceeds the maximum allowable bacterial estimate. Changes are being proposed that will provide uniformity with producer herd milk bacteria and somatic cell follow-up procedures. The modified follow-up program is also more adaptable to computer-based recordkeeping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to align the bacterial estimate and somatic cell count requirements contained in the Recommended Requirements with the resolution passed by NASDA, this document proposes the following changes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Reduce the maximum somatic cell count in producer herd milk (no change for goat milk).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of leukocytes (somatic cells) present in milk increases as a result of mammary gland infection (mastitis). The number of somatic cells present in milk provides information regarding the health of the dairy herd. The National Mastitis Council (NMC) is an organization that promotes research and provides education to help dairy producers reduce the incidence of mastitis and thus enhance milk quality. In their publication entitled  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Current Concepts of Bovine Mastitis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the NMC states that ``Presence of more than 500,000 leukocytes per milliliter of mixed herd milk suggests a significant incidence of mastitis in a given herd''. Changes in the Recommended Requirements are being proposed that would reduce the maximum somatic cell count permitted in producer herd milk (cows milk only) from 1,000,000 to 750,000 per ml. Through effective herd management, many dairy farmers have reduced the number of somatic cells well below the maximum limit being considered. Since the number of somatic cells found in milk produced from healthy goats is normally higher than the number found in cows milk, similar reductions are not being proposed for goat milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Delete the laboratory screening tests for somatic cells in producer herd milk samples (no change for goat milk).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Mastitis Test (CMT) and the Wisconsin Mastitis Test (WMT) are used as screening tests for somatic cells. These screening tests are accurate for samples containing 1,000,000 or more somatic cells per ml. When the maximum somatic cell count is reduced to 750,000 per ml., the CMT and WMT screening tests are not accurate. Since the maximum somatic cell count for goat milk remains at 1,000,000 per ml., the CMT and WMT tests can still be used to screen goat milk. The proposal identifies those tests which may be used for cow milk somatic cell counting. The appropriate tests are those listed in this document or other methods identified in the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Reduce the maximum bacterial estimate permitted in producer herd milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of bacteria present in milk increases when the equipment and utensils used to collect and store the milk is improperly cleaned and sanitized. This number increases rapidly in milk that is not cooled promptly or is not maintained at refrigerated temperatures throughout storage. Enhanced milk quality can be attained when dairy equipment is properly cleaned and sanitized, and when milk is promptly cooled and stored at refrigerated temperatures. Improvements in sanitation practices and milk cooling equipment has resulted in enhanced milk quality. Changes in the Recommended Requirements are being proposed that would reduce the maximum permissible bacteria count in producer herd milk from 1,000,000 to 500,000 per ml.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Modify the follow-up procedures when producer herd milk exceeds the maximum allowable bacterial estimate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes are being proposed that will modify the follow-up procedures when producer herd milk exceeds the maximum permitted bacteria estimate. These changes would require the dairy plant to notify the producer with a warning whenever an excessive bacterial estimate is found. When two of the last four consecutive bacterial estimates exceed the maximum permitted, the dairy plant would be required to notify the appropriate State regulatory authority. The State Regulatory authority would then send a written warning letter to the producer. After 3 days, but within 21 days, an additional sample of herd milk is tested. If this sample also exceeds the maximum permitted, that producer's herd milk is excluded from the market until satisfactory compliance is obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes would provide uniformity with producer herd milk bacteria and somatic cell follow-up procedures. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified follow-up program is also more adaptable to computer-based recordkeeping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Reduce the maximum permitted bacterial estimate in commingled milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commingled milk is the combined milk from more than one producer. Proposed reductions in the maximum bacterial estimate for producer herd milk should result in improved commingled milk quality. Changes in the Recommended Requirements are being proposed that reduce the maximum permissible bacterial estimate in commingled milk from 3,000,000 to 1,000,000 per ml.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In order to provide consistency throughout the Recommended Requirements, changes in terminology and formatting are being proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal would: (a) Amend the definitions for ``acceptable milk'' and ``probational milk'' by deleting the reference to bacterial estimate; (b) amend the requirements for ``excluded milk'' by incorporating provisions for milk with a history of excessive bacteria counts; (c) amend the bacterial requirements under the terms of quality testing of milk from producers; and (d) instruct plants to provide field assistance to farmers concerning excessive bacteria counts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Recommended Requirements which were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  issued April 7, 1972 (37 FR 7046) and amended August 27, 1985  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (50 FR 34726) and May 6, 1993 (58 FR 86) are proposed to be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

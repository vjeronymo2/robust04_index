			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 15 Jun -- Celebrations were held today at a  training ground near Leczyca, in the Pomeranian Military  District, marking the start of training and the formation of an  air cavalry division, the first such division in the history of  the Polish Armed Forces. Apart from the United States, Poland  will be the second country in the world to have such a force,  National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said.    The inauguration was accompanied by an air display by Huzar  and Mi-8 helicopters, and an airdrop assault performed by  commandos from the Sixth Air Assault Brigade from the Krakow  Military District.    The 25th Air Cavalry Division, with its Headquarters in  Lodz,  will me made up of three regiments stationed at Leczyca,  Tomaszow Mazowiecki, and Nowe Miasto nad Pilica. Ultimately it  will have 150 helicopters, mostly multi-purpose Huzars,  manufactured by WSK Mielec, as well as Mi-8 transport and Mi-24  combat helicopters. The first to be formed will be the regiment  at Leczyca. It is to be ready by next April, and the regiment  in Tomaszow by the fall of 1995. The division is being formed on  the basis of the Sixth Air Assault Brigade, whose current  commander, Colonel Wlodzimierz Michalski, has taken command of  the new unit. Although stationed in the Pomeranian Military  District, the division will be under the command of the Krakow  Military District.    At a news conference after the air display, Col. Michalski  said, among other things: "This will be a reserve division, an  elite division for special tasks, whose main strength will be  its speed. It will be possible to deploy it within five or six  hours to any point on any border and engage the enemy."    Asked about how the ultimate size of the division (150  helicopters) related to international disarmament agreements,  which allow Poland only 130 helicopters, Gen. Tadeusz Wilecki,  chief of the general staff, explained that the agreements  concern assault helicopters, of which Poland has about 30. On  the other hand, the Huzars, as multi-purpose machines, "do not  fall in the restricted category".    The Huzars, made by WSK Swidnik, are an armed version of the  Sokol helicopter. The helicopter, flown by two pilots, has a  1800 horsepower engine, flies at 270 kms an hour, can carry two  metric tons of cargo, including one metric ton of weapons,  consisting of guided or unguided missiles, or mines.    WSK director Mieczyslaw Majewski said that the basic version  of the Huzar costs about $2 million. On the other hand, the  version equipped with the latest "gadgets" costs $4 million,  which, however, is only half the price of a similar helicopter  in the West.    Minister Kolodziejczyk said that, should the Constitutional  Tribunal "unfreeze" 300 billion zlotys, which the budget law  allocated for the purchase of Iryda aircraft from WSK Mielec  (against the view of the Ministry), the Ministry of National  Defense [MON] would purchase the Huzars from Swidnik for the  same amount. "The Swidnik enterprise can annually make 40  helicopters which, unlike the Iryda, meet all our requirements."</p>

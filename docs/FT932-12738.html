			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Observer: Batting record Red faces - if not red lights - at Manchester Airport's new Terminal Two. Electronic traffic lights failed to change from amber to red on Saturday and a Qantas jumbo overshot its space, inflicting minimal damage but inconveniencing about 800 passengers. Flights to Australia about to take off from Heathrow were delayed while the Mancunians caught up. Manchester's pride in its Pounds 265m showplace seems to be the greatest casualty, especially as the 600 metres-long terminal is supposed to be the most up-to-date. For the time being, aircraft are being waved in by the decidedly less than state-of-the-art, but all too familiar, table-tennis bats.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uganda sees cobalt deal prospect UGANDA may become a major cobalt producer by means of a Dollars 45m (Pounds 25.5m) deal now being discussed by the French mining group BRGM and Barclays Metals to extract the stockpiled by-product of an abandoned copper mine in the south west of the country, Reuters reports from Kampala. Jeff Thomas, managing director of Barclays Bank Uganda, said in an interview that the proposal was a further sign of confidence in the country's economic recovery process. Mr Thomas said that the joint venture would release the world's largest stockpile of the strategic material. He also confirmed that talks were now at an advanced stage. 'We are now only awaiting government go-ahead', he added. If the deal goes ahead, Uganda will become one of the world's major cobalt producers, along with Zaire and Zambia, which together account for about 70 per cent of global output outside former eastern bloc countries.</p>

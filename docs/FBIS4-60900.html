			<p>BFN     [Unattributed report under the "In Brief" rubric:  "Orenburg"]    [Text] "The state does need the press and television, but  not in the amounts in which they currently exist," Russian  Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists  in Orenburg, where he arrived to attend festivities on the  occasion of the 250th anniversary of Orenburg Guberniya's  formation. The premier pointed out that the state would  maintain a number of newspapers and television channels, but  this would not apply to all existing mass media. According to  the head of government, the system of state support for  newspapers and television will be preserved only during a  transition period.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAIR TAXATION  </P> <P> Raymond Ponath in his letter (April 4) expresses a view that is unfortunately  all too common: the belief that a progressive income tax is the only "fair" way  to get citizens to pay for government services. This view stems from the idea  that individuals with high incomes not only can, but should pay higher  proportions of their incomes in the form of personal income taxes.  </P> <P> In reality, a progressive income tax is nothing more than a penalty for  success. If we wished to institute a truly fair system of taxation, everyone  should pay a flat rate on income earned, say 10%. No deductions, no writeoffs,  nothing, just 10% right off the top.  </P> <P> People with high incomes are not simply lay-abouts who sit back and wait for  the money to come rolling in. They tend to be hard-working and highly skilled  people. Fairness demands that everyone pay an equal share and not differential  rates simply because they can.  </P> <P> DREW J.

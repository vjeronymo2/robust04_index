			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by D. Blazevic: "We Do Not Want To Give Up a Single </F> Inch of Croatian Territory!"]    [Text] Sibenik -- "If the enemy should even think of  firing a single shell at Sibenik again, I can tell him with full  responsibility that he will not fire again!" This was the  message addressed by Janko Bobetko, the head of the Croatian  Army General Staff, to the members of the 113th Sibenik brigade  at a ceremony on the occasion of its third anniversary.    Before soldiers, officers, noncommissioned officers, and  numerous guests -- including Vinko Nikolic, personal envoy of  the Croatian president; Josip Juras, deputy defense minister;  General Ante Gotovina, commander of the Split Military Region;  Admiral Sveto Letica, General Milivoj Petkovic, General Ivan  Basarac, as well as the president of the County of Sibenik, and  the mayor of Sibenik -- Colonel Milan Perkovic, the commander of  the 113th brigade, recalled the days when the Sibenik brigade  was established. He mentioned that the brigade had participated  in the defense of Lisane, Velika Glava and Dubravica as early as  July and August 1991. He stated that the first shells against  Chetniks were fired on 1 August 1991. "A real undertaking was,  however, the battle for Sibenik in September 1991," he said.  This already historic battle is considered the key turning  point in the war for the independent Croatia. Nos Kalik was  liberated in March 1992, but the liberation of Miljevacki  Plateau in June 1992 is, according to Perkovic, the most  important victory achieved by the 113th brigade. The brigade  was not only active in the territory of its county, it also  participated in battles on the southern front, Stolovi, or the  Zadar hinterland. According to Colonel Perkovic this brigade is  still ready to accomplish every task assigned to it.    In his address to the soldiers, guests, and the inhabitants  of Sibenik, Janko Bobetko said: "Why did the enemy choose  Sibenik of all places as his aim? This is not a coincidence,  this was the place where they wanted to begin the  materialization of the dream of a Greater Serbia. They knew  that this would be the strongest infliction on the dignity of  Croatian people. They wanted to split Croatia into two parts at  this point; they wanted to become masters of Sibenik. The  second blow was directed at Zadar, and the third one should have  been aimed at the Neretva River. Croatia would have been  subjugated in this way, it would have lost its sea and its  coast, it would have lost its islands and its connection to the  world. They had been working on these plans for years. They  waited for a favorable moment to achieve their aim. If the  brave men from Sibenik and all over Croatia had not realized  that that was a historic moment, if they had not been decisive,  we would read in papers today: 'The Croats used to live here!'  Sibenik must know that its famous history has been continued,  that it has defended itself, that it has defended Croatia. If  Sibenik had fallen, events would have probably unfolded in a  completely different way," Bobetko said and repeated his message  addressed to Martic and "his hen hawks," as he called them: "If  they dared attack Sibenik -- the heart of Croatia -- once again,  we would strike back with full force."    "We have provided irrefutable evidence that Croatia supports  peaceful solutions; we have made concessions, but we have  retained our national right to liberate our territory. Let us  do everything in order to retain our territory, since history  does not allow us to give up a single inch of our territory. We  only have to decide when to do that. We shall go into this  battle in order to expel the enemy from sacred Croatian  territory," Bobetko concluded. In the end he said that this is a  year of big historical events, during which the Croatian army  and Croatian people need support and unity. Josip Juras, the  deputy defense minister, added that 113th brigade was a famous  elite brigade that defeated the notorious 9th Knin Corps and  brought Mladic's troops to a halt.    This occasion was used to promote and award soldiers,  officers and noncommissioned officers. The guests visited an  exhibition of photographs by Sime Strikoman from the war  itinerary of the 113th brigade. A wreath was laid on the grave  of dead soldiers from the 113th brigade.</p>

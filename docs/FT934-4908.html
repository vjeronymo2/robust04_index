			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / General strike call hits peseta The Spanish peseta came under selling pressure yesterday after the country's two main trade unions confirmed they would call a one-day general strike in January in protest at the government's resolve to press ahead with labour market reform without their agreement. The currency closed in Madrid at Pta82.18 to the D-Mark after having fallen to Pta82.3 earlier yesterday. The leaders of the two main unions, the the socialist General Workers Union (UGT) and the communist Workers Commissions (CCOO) said they would decide on an exact date for the stoppage at meetings on December 9 and 10. The strike call is a direct challenge to the political authority of prime minister Felipe Gonzalez's minority Socialist government. It reflects not only union anger at reforms that promise to make it easier and cheaper to hire and fire workers, but also broader union frustration at their inability to influence policy. Market analysts were unsure yesterday how badly the peseta might be affected between now and the strike but a common belief was that the country would probably not be pushed into another devaluation. A half-day general strike in protest at jobless benefit cuts failed badly in the spring of 1992. While a strike call this time might attract a greater following, the government says it has no intention of softening its proposed reforms. These are due to be approved at the weekly cabinet meeting in Madrid this Friday. The government has been sponsoring efforts to reach agreement on a wide range of social policy since the general election which Mr Gonzalez narrowly won last June. The prime minister calculated correctly that while unions, employers and the government were talking, the markets would ease pressure on the peseta. These talks formally ended yesterday with no agreement and Mr Gonzalez, anticipating failure, had been warning for some weeks that he would impose his reforms - and begin taxing unemployment benefit for the first time - with or without a deal. The unions have taken this as an excuse to accuse the government of negotiating in bad faith and in the last few weeks strike action had become inevitable in order for politically ambitious union leaders to save some face. This will probably be achieved by bringing the country to a halt for a day in January but is unlikely to make much difference as the government has been promising to try to bring new labour regulations into force by the end of this year.</p>

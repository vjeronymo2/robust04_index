			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will  abolish its system of automatically imposing a limit on loans to  the real estate industry when certain conditions are met,  ministry officials said Friday [4 February]. The "trigger  system," introduced in 1991 to control growth in loans to the  industry, has never been put into force.    The system will be abandoned under the new financial policy  guidelines that the ministry will announce after the government  comes out with its new pump-priming package on or after  Saturday, the officials said.    Abolition of the system is unlikely to rekindle the kind of  serious land price inflation that Japan experienced during the  years of the inflationary bubble from the late 1980s to the  early 1990s, the officials said.    Loans to the real estate industry by banks and other  financial institutions have remained at a low level in recent  years due to the economic recession.    The Finance Ministry introduced the trigger system in 1991,  when it abolished its arrangement for limiting the growth of  loans to the real estate industry to less than that of total  loans to all industries.    The officials said the trigger system will be abolished to  help activate land transactions and promote business recovery.</p>

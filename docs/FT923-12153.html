			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo buoyed by Indonesian reserves Shares in Lasmo, the oil exploration and production group, yesterday rose from last week's low after the company said its share of reserves in Indonesia had increased, writes Neil Buckley. The shares gained 6p to 131p on news that Lasmo's share of reserves in the Sanga Sanga production-sharing contract in Kalimantan had been increased by 34.1m barrels of oil equivalent from 420.6m at the end of last year. Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief operating officer, said the increase confirmed the considerable potential of the interest, acquired in the Pounds 1.1bn takeover of Ultramar last year. Indonesia accounted for more than 40 per cent of Lasmo's total reserves at the end of last year.</p>

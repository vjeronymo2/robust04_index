En route to the United  States, he made a brief stopover in Prague, where he had a  meeting with Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech Republic. The  Georgian leader pointed at "mutual understanding" in his  relations with Russia and with Russian Federation President  Boris Yeltsin.    A Georgian embassy is expected to be opened in Prague in the  near future to represent the republic's interests in the Czech  Republic and in other Central European countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The foreign minister, Dr. Obed Asamoah, has made  strong representation to the Togolese charge d'affaires in Accra  on the shelling of the office and residential accommodation of  Customs, Excise, and Preventive Service, CEPS, at Aflao by  Togolese forces following the fighting in Lome in the last  couple of days. A statement issued by the ministry in Accra  today said the shelling caused extensive damage to buildings and  injured three persons who are now on admission at the Saint  Anthony's Hospital at Dzodze. The statement said the Ghana  Government deplores the ritual accusation by the Togolese  authorities of Ghana for anything that goes wrong in Togo and  advises the Togolese Government to put an end to this. It also  demanded that the Togolese forces be restrained from indulging  in acts of provocation which would only lead to the worsening of  the already tense situation at the border. The statement said  Ghana has no intention of intervening in the internal affairs of  Togo. It said the problems of Togo are not the making of Ghana  but are the result of the refusal of the Togolese authorities to  implement a credible program of democratization in the country.    Commercial activities in the Aflao border post have come to  a  standstill following the closure of the Togo side of the border.  Correspondent Rauf Avavonyor visited the border post yesterday.  His report is read from the studio.    [Announcer] At the time the news team visited the border, it  was almost empty. There was apparently a kind of war being  waged from the Togo side against installations and buildings on  the Ghana side of the border. Officers quarters of the CEPS and  the Ministry of Health block had been badly damaged by a barrage  of bullets and mortar fire from the Togo side. There are also  reports of horrifying and indiscriminate shelling and killings.  According to customs officials, the Togolese soldiers lined up  12 shoe-shine boys at their side of the border and shot them.  Yesterday, three women and a child were similarly killed and  their bodies dumped in a vehicle and driven away. Some  residents along the Ghana side of the border spoke of stray  bullets landing in their homes and destroying their fittings and  property. The CEPS officers quarters appeared to have been  their main target. Sporadic shootings from the Togo side of the  border could still be heard at the time of the visit.    At about 4 PM [1600 GMT] yesterday, the Togolese soldiers at  the border post started another round of warning shots to drive  away observers who had gathered at the border post. It was also  around this time when the Volta regional minister, Mr. Modestus  Ahiable, was being briefed on the situation by the CEPS sector  commander, Mr. Cyril Mensah. Meanwhile, stranded passengers  are putting up at lorry and filling stations. [passage omitted]</p>

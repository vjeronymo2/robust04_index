			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would also add a new &sect;124.611 that would make SBA Small Disadvantaged Business status decisions issued pursuant to &sect;7(j)(11)(F)(vii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(11)(F)(vii), available in full text. The decisions would be available for review in the law library located in SBA's central office. This new section would implement the requirements imposed by section 221 of the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;366, 106 Stat. 986, 999. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was not reviewed under Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA certifies that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This rule is necessary to resolve several points relating to eligibility for SBA's Section 8(a) program and the procedures relating to appeals of denials of eligibility. It would also clarify/amend the requirements by which an 8(a) concern could obtain an exemption to the Miller Act bond requirements. The contracting opportunities offered to the 8(a) program should not be affected by this proposed rule. Whether a particular 8(a) concern would be eligible for participation in or, once in, could receive a bond exemption (and, therefore, whether it, as opposed to another 8(a) concern, would be awarded a particular 8(a) contract) could be affected by the rule. The rule would have no effect, however, on the amount or dollar value of any contract requirement or the number of such requirements reserved for the 8(a) program. Therefore, it is not likely to have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on competition or the United States economy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would contain no new reporting or record keeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule would not have any federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 13 CFR Part 121 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government procurement; Government property; Grant programs_business; Loan programs_business; Small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 13 CFR Part 124 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government procurement; Hawaiian natives; Minority businesses; Reporting and record keeping requirements; Technical assistance; Tribally-owned concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth above, SBA hereby proposes to amend part 121 of Title 3, Code of Federal Regulations, and subpart A, part 124 of Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 121_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

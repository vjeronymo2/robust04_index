Citing its own poll conducted March 11-16, immediately after  Meciar's fall from power, the station said that if parliamentary  elections were held today, 26 per cent of voters would vote  HZDS. The Democratic Left Party (SDL) would trail with only 11  percent, the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) with 6 percent,  and the Association of Workers (SD), which recently split from  the SDL, with five percent. Fifteen percent of voters were  undecided for any party and 11 per cent said they would not vote.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Letter: Clear need for institutional source of equity capital Sir, Your leader on the prospective demise of the unlisted securities market ('Going to market', December 1) makes the remarkably perceptive point that an external source of equity capital is more important for British companies than for their German counterparts. Remarkable because this basic fact of British economic life seems to be so little understood. The difficulties faced by companies needing the oxygen of base capital at a time when they are stifled by excessively large and expensive amounts of debt point to the need for a permanently available institutional source of equity capital. It is inevitable that such capital will become more scarce and expensive as the liquidity of the secondary market declines, however easy it may be in times of booming corporate profits and investor demand. There is thus a clear need for an institution capable of providing equity capital to private companies in all economic weathers. It must be able to acquire inexpensively, and hold indefinitely, equity stakes which provide its own shareholders with little short-term income, but with the compensation of long-term capital growth. I could, if you like, suggest a name for the proposed institution, reflecting its long-term commitment to British business - 'Investors in Industry', or, if you prefer a more whacky abbreviation, '3i'. Donald Clarke, Barton St David, Somerton, Somerset TA11 6BJ</p>

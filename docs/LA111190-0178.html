			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARTIN SCORSESE'S OBSESSION  </P> <P> When Scorsese says that at some point he "becomes" the film that he is making,  he is not describing alienation, as the author asserts, but rather its opposite  -- a communion in which the self merges with a higher realm, a kind of  out-of-body experience traditionally associated with Catholic mystics who  achieve union with God.  </P> <P> This makes Akira Kurosawa's choice of Scorsese as Vincent van Gogh a  particularly inspired one, since for both making art was an act of devotion as  well as a spiritual experience.  </P> <P> And how sad a sign of our times that passionate commitment seems so  incomprehensible that it should be confused with alienation.  </P> <P> JILL FINSTEN  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are many ways that States can provide for such input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to allow for public input into the proposals, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department expects States to ordinarily follow one (or more if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State desires) of the processes described in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. At any time prior to submitting a section 1115  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration proposal to the Department of Health and Human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Services, a State may provide to the Department a written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of the process the State will use for receipt of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public input into the proposal prior to its submission to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within 15 days of receipt of such description, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department will notify the State whether the described process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides adequate opportunity for public input. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will accept any process that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Includes the holding of one or more public hearings, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the most recent working proposal is described and made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the public, and time is provided during which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments can be received; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Uses a commission or other similar process, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meetings are open to members of the public, in the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposal; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Results from enactment of a proposal by the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislature prior to submission of the demonstration proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the outline of such proposal is contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislative enactment; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provides for formal notice and comment in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State's administrative procedure act; provided that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice must be given at least 30 days prior to submission; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Includes notice of the intent to submit a demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal in newspapers of general circulation, and provides a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism for receiving a copy of the working proposal and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity, which shall not be less than 30 days, to comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposal; or,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Includes any other similar process for public input that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would afford an interested party the opportunity to learn about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the contents of the proposal, and to comment on its contents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State shall include in the demonstration proposal it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submits to the Department a statement (a narrative of several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sentences) briefly describing the process that it followed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing the process previously presented to the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department may find a proposal incomplete if the process has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not been followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A State that has not followed the procedures described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in paragraph 1. must submit a description of the process that was used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State to obtain public input, at the time it submits its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration proposal. The Department will notify the State if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the process was adequate within 15 days after the application is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted, applying the same criteria as in paragraph 1. If the process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not adequate, the State can cure the inadequacy by_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Posting a notice in the newspaper of widest circulation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each city with a population of 100,000 or more, or in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newspaper of widest circulation in the State if there is no city  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a population of 100,000, indicating that a demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal has been submitted. Such notice shall describe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major elements of the proposed demonstration and any changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits, payments, eligibility, responsibilities, or provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection requested in the proposal. The notice shall indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how interested persons can obtain copies of the proposal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall specify that written comments will be accepted by the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a period of thirty days. If a State follows such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure, the State should respond to requests for copies of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal within seven days. The State should maintain a record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of all comments received through this process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All HHS commitments with respect to times for responding to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration proposals shall be tolled until this process is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Federal Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Health and Human Services intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publish a monthly notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of all new and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pending proposals submitted pursuant to section 1115. The notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will indicate that the Department accepts written comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding all demonstration project proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will maintain a list of organizations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have requested notice that a demonstration proposal has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received and will notify such organizations when a proposal is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

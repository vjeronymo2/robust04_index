He was commenting on a Sunday Times publication which  alleged, referring to intelligence sources and three Russian  "defectors," that the Russian Defence Ministry was engaged in  the development of biological weapons behind Yeltsin's back.    Yevstigneyev does not consider the paper's report unusual  given the background of continued Western accusations against  Russia concerning the developing of such weapons. He said that  in the past, such campaigns were timed to coincide with major  international talks on banning biological or chemical weapons in  an effort to divert attention from the West's own programs which  were in violation of the 1972 convention.    The general said the Sunday Times publication had emerged in  the run up to a session by a preparatory committee intended to  clear the ground for a special conference for measures to verify  the compliance with the 1972 convention. Moscow is expected to  continue work on possible verification measures at that session,  Yevstigneyev said.</p>

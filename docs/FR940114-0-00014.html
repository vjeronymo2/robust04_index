			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Notice and Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), requires in most instances that a notice of proposed rulemaking be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and that opportunity for comment be provided when an agency promulgates new regulations. Section 553(b) sets forth an exception, however, for rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. The instant amendments provide expedited procedures for the approval of certain contract market rules. The Commission has determined that these amendments, which will reduce the burden on the exchanges, relate to Commission procedure and practice and therefore that notice and comment is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 553(b) also sets forth an exception to the requirement of notice and opportunity for public comment when the Commission for good cause finds such notice and public comment are unnecessary or contrary to the public interest. The Commission finds that notice and public comment on the rule changes announced herein are unnecessary because the changes are procedural in nature and do not establish any new obligations under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 17 CFR Parts 1 and 5 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commodity futures, Contract market rules, Consumer protection, Rule review procedures, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority contained in the Commodity Exchange Act and, in particular, sections 4c, 5a, and 8a thereof, 7 U.S.C. 6c, 7a and 12a, the Commission hereby amends parts 1 and 5 of chapter I of title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1_GENERAL REGULATIONS UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

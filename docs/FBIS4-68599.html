			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Semenov: "God Gave--God Took Away?"] </F>   [Text] It is universally recognized that the mafia is  a coalescence of state and commercial structures. When a  businessman is dissatisfied with a competitor, the state-legal  machine is turned on: Click--there is no competitor.    The subject of a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS article, "Taras  Bulba  Goes on the Warpath," concerned the examination by a group of  State Duma deputies of the legality of closing the check  investment fund Neft-Almaz-Invest by Goskomimushchestvo [State  Committee for Management of State Property] (GKI).    New facts in the scandal have become known to the editorial  staff.    The license issued earlier by Goskomimushchestvo to the  check  fund was suspended on 5 March. The formal pretext--the  leadership of the fund did not submit the annual report on time.  However, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation  postponed the date for submission of the annual report to 1  April.    The second discrepancy--the fund is accused of stealing  vouchers. This served as yet another pretext for invalidating  the license. I personally saw a half million vouchers in three  armored safes.    According to Mosaudit data, the fund's assets are shares of  stock of 71 very large Russian enterprises, including oil  extracting and gold mining, and the expected profit is $22  billion. Large blocks of stock of the pillars of national  industry cannot help but whet the appetite of potential  competitors. In addition to everything else, in the event the  fund is closed, 572,700 vouchers will shift to the control of  the GKI, but from there...    In the opinion of parliamentary experts and the fund's  management, a model of forced bankruptcy, approved at Tekh  Progress, is being employed with respect to Neft-Almaz-Invest.  The fund is being accused of "insolvency" in correspondence  through "its own" journalists in the mass media. A wave of  popular anger is growing among ordinary shareholders. The GKI  has been swamped with "letters from workers." The license is  being suspended on this basis, and an audit is beginning. During  the audit the competitors get a "handicap," and they correct  their affairs. The auditors are putting all their energy into  digging for compromising material. The fund is being closed. The  assets are being transferred to the GKI. Further, they are  divided among the large check investment funds. To whom and how  much is decided by Goskomimushchestvo officials. Afterwards, the  obligations (stocks, certificates) are exchanged for obligations  of its former competitors. The deed is done.    As a rule, people do not suspect anything. What difference  does it make whose paper one holds. The main thing is that the  dividends come in. What they would have been in a ruined fund,  and what they will become after the division of the pelt of the  killed bear, only those initiated into the mysteries of the  property court can guess.    Aleksandr Ignatenko, an employee of the UEP GUVD [Economic  Audit Department of the Main Administration of Internal Affairs]  and a member of the GKI commission to audit the fund, said: "We  have already been working for several weeks. We cannot bring any  charges at present. But I think we will find swindlers..."    G. Khodakov, manager of the commission and a senior employee  of the GKI, said: "The parliamentary commission for examination  of our activity has not been established officially. The  deputies, of course, can audit us, but does this make any  sense..."    An opponent of Khodakov--Nadezhda Razuvayeva from Mosaudit,  said: "Based on the `presumption of innocence,' the management  of the fund had every right to involve the deputies in  monitoring the audit. All the deputies are professional experts.  But whether they are Chubays' expert employees... The audit  method raises doubts about this. All documentation representing  a commercial secret was confiscated. The commission has its own  Xerox machine. Papers are copied and sent who knows where.  Strangers who have no relationship to the fund or the commission  are continuously encountered in the building where the auditors  are working. Indeed, the commission staff is always changing..."    The commission continued its work yesterday.</p>

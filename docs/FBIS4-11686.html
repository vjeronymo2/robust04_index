			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] In his meeting yesterday with Kuwaiti Amir  Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, our country's Roads and  Transport Minister Akbar Torkan submitted to him a message from  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the Islamic Republic of  Iran. Although the content of the president's message has not  been publicized, according to informed sources, the message was  chiefly in connection with friendly ties and cooperation between  Iran and Kuwait.    Our country's roads and transport minister, who started his  three-day visit by meeting the amir of Kuwait, has also met the  Kuwaiti prime minister and has conferred with him about the  expansion of bilateral cooperation in economic and political  spheres.    In this visit, Mr. Torkan will sign a maritime agreement  between the two countries. The first shipping line between the  two countries has been operating actively since February last  year. The opening of an active shipping line between the two  countries is in reality a new chapter in the process of  consolidating economic and political bonds between the two  Muslim and fraternal nations of Iran and Kuwait. In addition,  the distinguished and unique geopolitical situation of Iran has  made our country a major communications link between Muslim  countries, in particular as Iran links Arab countries --  especially Persian Gulf littoral states -- to the newly  independent Muslim countries of Central Asia.    The expansion of cordial and fraternal ties between Iran and  Kuwait is taking place at a time when there are vigorous  attempts by a number of Western countries and their allies in  the region to mar Iran's relations with its southern neighbors.  However, the present state of relations shows that despite the  wish of the enemies and their extensive political and propaganda  endeavours aimed at creating distance between Iran and its  neighbors, the present realities in the region prove that there  exist many profound bonds, as well as common interests and  objectives, the attainment of which is dependent upon the  expansion of cordial relations between historical neighbors in  the region.</p>

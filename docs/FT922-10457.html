			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (6): Markets turmoil raises doubts: Japan: Regional role WHEN Kumagai Gumi became the first Japanese general contractor to win an international tender, for a water channel in Hong Kong 31 years ago, it was a symbol of Japanese industry's determination to play an increasingly important role in the development of east Asia. But the aggressive Kumagai Gumi has now become a symbol of the limits to Japanese ambitions. Having been wounded in the international property market, the contractor and developer has announced that it will concentrate on the home market for the next few years and gradually sell off its international holdings. The turmoil on domestic financial markets, and the resulting higher capital costs and extra pressure on profits, have raised unexpected doubts about the ability of Japanese companies to participate in regional projects. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance, troubled by a slowing of tax revenue, is attempting to cut spending and has taken aim at foreign aid programmes. In the late 1980s, when the Tokyo stock market rose ever higher, Japanese companies were easily able to raise funds for investment abroad. But the higher capital costs have forced Japanese contractors, among other companies, to be more selective about exposure to low-margin projects. In Kumagai's case, international contracts for the current year will be about Y50bn, down from Y150bn last year. The stock market collapse has also bruised Japanese banks who are struggling to meet international standards for capital adequacy and are reviewing their regional investments. Banks say that plans to expand offices in Asia are being reviewed, postponed or even shelved and they warn that asset growth generally must be limited. After the stock market peaked in late 1989, direct investment in members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) also peaked. Having risen from Dollars 856m in fiscal 1986 to Dollars 4.68bn in 1989, the figure declined to Dollars 4.08bn in 1990, and in the fiscal first half to end September last year, the total further declined to Dollars 1.73bn. However, Japanese government and industry will continue to play an important regional role, both through the funding of infrastructure projects in countries such as Indonesia, Burma and China, and through the continuing transfer of technology to industries in more developed economies such as those of Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Japanese industry, still suffering from a labour shortage despite the domestic slowdown, has sound reasons to continue investment in the region. Trade with Asean rose from Dollars 35.1bn in calendar 1987 to Dollars 63.2bn in 1990 and Dollars 69.4bn last year. Growth has slowed, but Tokyo sees the region as an important source of low-cost manufacturing capability and as the home of an increasing number of consumers of Japanese products. The region is also the testing ground for Tokyo's emerging political profile. The Japanese government has made clear its intention to assist in the reconstruction of Cambodia and to encourage the development of Laos and Vietnam. Vietnam, in particular, will be a test of Japan's political will. The Keidanren, the Federation of Economic Organisations, sent a delegation to Vietnam late last year, while officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have decided, in principle, to resume the provision of trade insurance to Hanoi. The dilemma for Tokyo is that it would like to encourage investment in Hanoi but risks criticism from Washington, which has yet to lift its economic sanctions on Vietnam. Presuming that official assistance will resume in the near future, Japanese trading houses have expanded their Vietnamese operations and are putting together lists of likely investment opportunities. Meanwhile, the Japan International Co-operation Agency (Jica), the government agency responsible for technical co-operation, is continuing to expand assistance programmes in the region. In fiscal 1990, the organisation was involved in 89 technical co-operation projects and began 40 new studies, with involvement ranging from a waste-water disposal project in Indonesia to a hydro-electric plant in Malaysia, as well as a geological survey in the Philippines. 'Obviously we have a geo-political interest in Asian development. It is very important to us,' a Jica official said. Over the past five years, about 30 per cent of Jica's expenses have gone to projects involving Asean members and Japan now provides more than half the bilateral assistance received by east Asian nations. The Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund (OECF), the government agency providing long-term concessional loans, disbursed Y922.1bn in official development assistance funds last year, an increase of 20.4 per cent. Net disbursement, the gross figure less principal repaid, was Y775.4bn, a 24.6 per cent increase on 1990 when about 73 per cent of loans were devoted to projects in east Asia. Of the total loans to foreign governments made by the OECF in fiscal 1990, 26.8 per cent cent were for transport projects, 13.8 per cent were for electric power and gas, 7.7 per cent for mining and manufacturing, and 6.4 per cent for telecommunications. Commodity loans accounted for about 26 per cent of the total. Apart from the well-intentioned aim of assisting the development of the region, the aid programme overlaps with the interests of Japanese industry which is reluctant to invest without the confidence that there will be sufficient energy to run factories and enough transport to carry goods to foreign markets. Japanese companies are already profiting from the gradual rise of a consumer class in south-east Asia and they are still excited by estimations of latent demand in China. Evidence of that demand was shown in the mid-1980s when Japan's television exports to China rose from Y87bn in 1984 to Y285bn in 1985, then plunged to Y5bn in 1986 after a tightening of import controls. In February this year, Japan's exports to China were 59.8 per cent higher than a year earlier. Until now, Japanese project assistance has come with few strings attached, a policy that has helped Tokyo cultivate friendships in some Asian governments with less than perfect human rights records. While Japan claimed to have 'frozen' Y810bn in loans to China after the crushing of the pro-democracy movement, preparatory work continued in Tokyo and the loans have since been disbursed on schedule. There are signs that a higher political profile may bring a tougher stance on concessional loans but the foreign ministry is still reluctant to criticise acts interpreted by most western governments as an abuse of human rights. Tokyo argues that freezing of such loans further injures a people already suffering under their own government.  ----------------------------------------------      JAPANESE TRADE WITH ASEAN (Dollars m)  ---------------------------------------------- Calendar year   Exports     Imports  ---------------------------------------------- 1987            15,574      19,580 1988            21,394      22,458 1989            25,966      25,809 1990            32,975      29,260 1991            37,679      31,759  ---------------------------------------------- Source:   Japanese Ministry of Finance  ----------------------------------------------</p>

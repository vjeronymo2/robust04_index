			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> FISHBONE HOOKS FANS AT THE ROXY  </P> <P> Too few acts can drop an hour-plus of spankin' new material on an audience --  not once stooping to trite 'n' true call 'n' response routines -- and watch the  sell-out crowd explode.  </P> <P> At the Roxy on Monday, in the first show of a three-night stand, local sextet  Fishbone proved itself a full-tilt, booty-bustin' member of this killer elite.  </P> <P> After five years and a couple of albums and EPs, the original lineup -- and  hey, let's hear it for loyalty and brotherhood in every sense of the word --  remains as eclectic and hyper-energetic as ever.  </P> <P> Highlight of the new material -- most of which was pretty much your  hardest-workin', interplanetary dance band's typical  ska-funk-reggae-soul-rock-rap-beat-poetry with all the psychedelic trimmings --  had to be the too-Sly screaming yellow zonker "Everyday Sunshine." All this and  they saved the "greatest hits" for the encores. DON WALLER  </P></p>

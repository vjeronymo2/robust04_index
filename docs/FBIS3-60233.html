This forum was primarily devoted to studying how to  orient the protection of environment and natural resources to  the demands of the new situation and to explore how to take up  the new challenges facing environmental protection.    Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the NPC, made a speech at  the  forum. He said: As a fundamental national policy of our  country, environmental protection has always attracted high  attention from the party and the state. The vast numbers of the  people have also strongly demanded the prevention and control of  pollution and improvement of the ecological environment.  Therefore, party and government leaders at all levels should  actually list environmental protection work as a major item on  their daily agenda and strive to do the work well. The NPC and  the people's congress of various provinces, autonomous regions,  and municipalities should accelerate the pace of protecting  environment and further strengthen inspection and supervision  over the implementation of the laws on environmental protection  in order to give rise to a new situation in which the NPC,  people's congresses at various levels, governments at various  levels, various circles in society, and the broad masses of the  people make concerted efforts to manage the work altogether.    At the forum, Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the  provincial  party committee and governor of the province, extended a welcome  to the comrades of the environmental protection committee under  the NPC and the comrades from various fraternal provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions, on behalf of the  provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress  standing committee, and the provincial government.    Qu Geping, vice chairman of the environmental protection  committee under the NPC, presided over the forum and made a  report entitled "People's Congresses at All Levels Should  Strengthen the Protection of Environment and Natural Resources."  Attending the forum were Lin Zongtang, Yang Jike, Qin Zhongda,  and Yang Zhenhuai, vice chairmen of the environmental protection  committee under the NPC; and Li Zhen, chairman of the Shandong  Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee.</p>

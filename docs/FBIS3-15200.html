Addressing the delegation, President Aliyev said that  Azerbaijan supports a settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict within the framework of the UNO and the CSCE. "Though  all previous attempts by the CSCE to settle the conflict  resulted in failure, we still hope that the Minsk Group will  continue its efforts regarding the settlement of the conflict".    President Aliyev mentioned that Azerbaijan's conditions  remain the same. Armenia must withdraw its troops from all  occupied territories and only after that can we begin  negotiations concerning the status of Nagorno Karabakh.    Jan Eliasson mentioned that the "settlement of the conflict  must be just and based on the principles of international  norms". Eliasson said that when preparing for his mission, he  visited Ankara and Moscow and discussed the steps on the  settlement of the conflict there as well. In addition, he said  that "we have to move step by step. The first step is a  cease-fire, a withdrawal of troops from occupied territories and  the resumption of communication and beginning of talks  concerning political settlement".</p>

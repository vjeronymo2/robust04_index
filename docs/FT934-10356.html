			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Glynwed disposes of lossmaking US arm GLYNWED, the international engineering group, has sold its lossmaking US metals distribution business for Dollars 15.4m (Pounds 10.9m) and expects its 1993 pre-tax profits to be Pounds 2m higher as a result. The buyer is Samuel, Son and Co of Mississauga, Ontario, one of the biggest metals distributors in North America and the company which bought Glynwed's Canadian distribution business in 1991. For Glynwed, the US metals distribution business has always been peripheral to its main interests. The companies it is selling came with Amari when it was acquired in 1988. But it is selling the assets at less than their book value of Dollars 18.6m. Ultimately Glynwed should receive about Dollars 20m, given that it is retaining business debtors and there is a formula which, should Samuel's return on the assets exceed a certain percentage over the next three years, it will pay Glynwed additional sums. For each of the last two years the businesses Glynwed has sold have lost about Pounds 2m.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Art dealer goes into receivership BLUETTS, one of the leading British dealers in oriental art, has gone into receivership. The private company was refinanced a year ago, with Chelsfield Group underwriting a management buyout by directors Mr Anthony Carter and Mr Dominic Jellinek. A move to premises in Brook Street in London's Mayfair followed, but business has not improved and Chelsfield is withdrawing its support. The stock will be auctioned by Sotheby's and the directors will probably continue as private dealers. Although oriental art has not suffered as badly as post-1870 pictures in the recession, the main buyers are now in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, and the centre of the market has moved to the Far East.</p>

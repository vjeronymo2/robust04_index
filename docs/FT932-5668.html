			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Tunisia refines battle against fundamentalists: The government continues its assault on Islam despite rising economic pressures TUNISIA's latest weapon in its uncompromising battle to expunge Islamic fundamentalism is a modern white-walled building on the fringe of a poor Tunis suburb, full of youthful teachers, social workers and psychologists, audio-visual equipment and colourful children's books. It is called a Centre for Social Defence and Integration and will soon be one of eight spotted around Tunisia's more economically deprived areas. And for all its faintly Stalinist name, the Tunisian government hopes it will offer a flexible response to the sort of socio-economic problems which it believes give fundamentalists a political foothold. 'It will reinforce the government's fight against the fundamentalists,' says Mrs Chedlya Ben Aleya, the centre's energetic director. 'Fundamentalism is a form of fanaticism - it can manifest itself as crime, violence or belief in an extreme ideology. Children without direction risk becoming prey to this.' Tunisia's government believes the fundamentalists have been curtailed as a political force. In 1991, detecting what it considered a direct political threat from al-Nahda, the now outlawed Islamic group, the government rounded up 300 of its leaders and activists. The security clampdown raised severe criticism from Amnesty International and other human rights groups for what they considered its unnecessary harshness. They leveled claims of torture and unfair judicial procedure. But the government, which keeps a fierce grip on political expression and press freedom, is unrepentant. Ministers point west to the incipient guerrilla war in Algeria between Islamic militants and the government as vindication. Under President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who relieved Mr Habib Bourguiba, the ailing post-independence leader, of power in 1987, Tunisia has accelerated a programme of IMF and World Bank steered economic liberalisation. It hopes this will lift it to a near-European standard of living, and clear of the economic problems which its technocratic ministers believe to be the root cause of fundamentalism. But, while more import controls are dismantled, more prices freed and the previously dirigiste economy of the Bourguiba era opened increasingly to global competition, the government is also trying to pre-empt potential social problems. At the same time, it is honing and building upon its social policies of 35 years to contain the spread of renascent Islam. 'In Algeria and Egypt social policies have been left to the fundamentalists,' says one official. 'That will not happen here.' In the first couple of months since opening, therefore, Mrs Ben Aleya and her small staff have begun seeking out children and their families in Douar Hichen, a poor satellite town 15km from Tunis, who have had run-ins with the law, dropped out of school or shown other signs of 'delinquency'. The centre's young teachers are encouraged to compile lists of children considered at risk, go out and meet their families, then set up whatever classes or courses they think will help: drama, photography, elementary electrical know-how, whatever programmes their budget of TD160,000 (Pounds 106,200) for the year will permit. Attendance is purely voluntary, but children who have appeared before local magistrates are now being steered towards the centre. Already several hundred childern of all ages from the suburb pass through its doors every week. 'The government gave us the principle to attack these problems, but how we do it is up to us,' says Mrs Ben Aleya. She says the idea for the centre came out of a governmental review of the country's last five-year development plan. The Social Affairs Ministry is doing all it can elsewhere to identify social problems before they fester - and increase its grassroots intelligence on where, why and among whom these arise. The test for Tunisia's government will be continuing this social assault in the face of rising economic pressures. Government spending on its increasing panoply of social programmes and benefits, which include social security payments and a guaranteed minimum wage, are due to rise by nearly a third between 1992 and 1996 to TD13bn from TD9.9bn over the preceding five years. But the government must also, under its structural reforms, further cut the budget deficit from the present 2.4 per cent of GDP to 1.2 per cent by 1996. Perhaps more critically, the government must also retain Tunisia's competitive edge for inward investment in the face of competition from Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, the countries of eastern Europe and Asia. To attain its target of average real GDP growth of 6 per cent to 1996, the government reckons it needs to treble present levels of annual inward investment to Dollars 200m or more. Although much of Tunisia's present appeal for investors lies in its proximity to the European market and its political stability, it still relies heavily on offering a low-wage economy. For the present, Tunisia cannot afford to allow its social safety net to erode that advantage. But neither does the government feel it can stall its politically imperative social advances.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hopefully, Agreement on New Airport Financial </F> Arrangements Will Be Reached"]    [Text] After a three-and-half-hour meeting of the  Sino-British Airport Committee yesterday, the two sides  simultaneously announced that experts will be entrusted with  preparing a summary of the meeting, which the chief negotiators  of the two sides will sign, and which will serve as an agreement  on the new airport financing deal reached between the two sides.  This shows that comparatively great progress was made at  yesterday's meeting; hopefully, a comprehensive agreement on the  new airport financial arrangements will be reached.    In answering reporters' questions, the Chinese team leader  Guo Fengmin stated: "The accomplishments scored by the two  sides are the result of their common efforts." What gives much  food for thought is that here, Guo Fengmin laid special stress  on the two characters "both sides." Doing a good job of  handling important matters during Hong Kong's transition is a  responsibility shared by both the Chinese and British sides, and  calls for common efforts; only then will it be possible to score  results satisfactory to both sides. If only one side shows  sincerity, but the other side not; if only one side hopes for  cooperation, but the other side goes its own way; some simple  issues will become complicated, whereas complicated issues will  become increasingly so.    The new airport issue is one that has already been settled,  and not a complicated one at that. After eight months of  negotiation, they signed a memorandum of understanding on  building a new airport and related issues back in 1991, with  explicit rules on some basic principles and important specific  issues. So long as the British Hong Kong Government takes up  its responsibility, and does business earnestly in accordance  with the memorandum of understanding, the new airport project  will fold smoothly, and Mr. Chris Patten will be sure to return  to London from the Lantau Island airport on 30 June 1997.  However, the British side has created side issues by setting  out financial arrangements in violation of the memorandum; in  addition, it has unilaterally and repeatedly made financial  allotments based on such arrangements; thus an issue that has  already been settled was once again placed on the table, and the  talks have continued on and off for more than two years.    The building of a new airport aims to help Hong Kong's  development; the Chinese side has all along adopted a positive  attitude, which is given full play in the memorandum. However,  the building of a new airport involves huge funds; the Chinese  side must show concern over costs and economic returns as well  as the finances of the future Hong Kong SAR [Special  Administrative Region] Government. While negotiations were  under way before the signing of the memorandum, the British side  proposed leaving only a HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars]  financial reserve to the HK SAR Government; whereas the Chinese  side argued strongly on just grounds, and fought for every  additional penny; with great efforts, the two sides reached an  agreement on HK $25 billion. To avoid leaving a heavy financial  burden on the SAR Government from loans to build the airport,  the two sides agreed that the debts left over to the SAR  Government should not exceed HK$5 billion; if the amount of  debts exceeds that sum, the matter must first be negotiated  between the two sides. The future Hong Kong SAR Government will  be totally independent financially, and the Chinese Government  will not take one cent away from it. Now, on the new airport  issue, the Chinese side shows special concern about and insists  on the two figures, HK$25 billion and HK$5 billion, out of  consideration for a sound financial basis for the Hong Kong SAR  Government so that SAR taxpayers will be spared additional  burden.    The question lies in the fact that the British side has  failed to perform its commitment in the memorandum of  understanding and show consideration for Hong Kong's future, but  always attempted to acquire as much money as possible for its  motherland through building the new airport. Consequently, a  financial plan by which "the British Hong Kong Government takes  out loans, the SAR Government will repay the debts" surfaced.  According to the first plan, some HK$70 billion loan would be  taken out, which was around 15 times greater than the sum  stipulated in the memorandum, equivalent to approximately three  times the total of the financial reserve to be left to the SAR  Government. The third plan would still involve a loan of some  HK$40 billion. And the fourth plan would take out some HK $23  million, 4.7 times the sum stipulated in the Memorandum. On the  one hand, the British Hong Kong Government would leave the Hong  Kong SAR Government HK $25 billion financial reserve; on the  other, it would leave the SAR Government a debt of some HK $23  billion. Is it not true that the British Hong Kong side  attempts to make things very difficult for the SAR Government?  How can Hong Kong residents agree to that?    The arguments between the two sides over the new airport has  all along centered around the issue of whether or not  consideration should be shown for Hong Kong residents.  Representing Hong Kong residents' interests, the Chinese side  has engaged in talks with the British side for two years or so;  it has persisted in principle, while expressing extremely great  patience and due flexibility. On the issue of taking out loans,  the Chinese side has actually handled the matter with some  flexibility. Based on the stipulation in the memorandum that  "taking out any loans exceeding the sum of HK$5 billion must  first acquire unanimous agreement of the two sides to the  proposal on making the loan," the Chinese side is willing to  conduct truth-seeking discussions with the British side to seek  a rational settlement.    We may put it that in discussing the issue of the new  airport financial arrangements, the Chinese side has already  shown great sincerity and exerted very great efforts. So long  as the British side is willing to cooperate and show  consideration for Hong Kong residents' interests, it will not be  difficult to settle the differences. The Sino-British Airport  Committee's discussion on the new airport financial arrangements  held yesterday has made pleasing progress. We believe that the  British side has also exerted some efforts.    However, experts of the two sides will continue to contact  each other in drafting a summary of the meeting, and a  comprehensive agreement on the new airport financial  arrangements is yet to come. From the statements by team leaders  of both sides yesterday, we can see that the two sides have  reached common understanding on some basic issues; however,  "there are sill some specific issues and wording to be studied,"  which calls for the common efforts of experts from both sides.  We hope that the two sides will show mutual understanding and  make concessions to each other in studying specific issues and  wording, while bearing Hong Kong residents' interests in mind to  complete the drafting of the summary as quickly as possible.    Even if the two sides reach an agreement on the new airport  financial arrangements, it only means that a solution to  implementing one aspect of the memorandum is found. In handling  all sorts of issues related to the new airport, the spirit of  the memorandum and the principle of cost and economic returns,  as well as avoiding burden to the SAR Government should persist.  From now on, in handling all important issues straddling 30  June 1997 in relation with the airport project, such as the  establishment of the airport administration and advisory  committee, both sides should conduct negotiations in accordance  with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the memorandum in  the spirit of cooperation. Any behavior in violation of  commitment and trampling the agreement will jeopardize the  building of the new airport and Hong Kong residents' long-range  interests.</p>

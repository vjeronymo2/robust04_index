			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Hurd aims to dispel Maastricht 'myths' THE GOVERNMENT is spending about a ha'penny per head of the electorate in its campaign to persuade the British people that Maastricht is good for them. It has spent Pounds 125,000 publishing 250,000 copies of a pamphlet called Britain in Europe. The publication is designed to dispel the 'Euromyths and Euro-monsters', Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said yesterday. A further 250,000 copies will be printed if demand is enough, taking the total cost to Pounds 163,000. The pamphlet is being distributed to MPs, MEPs, libraries, universities and various agencies. It explains how the European Community works, what the Single Market is and what changes the treaty will bring. The cost of the pamphlet's launch compares with the Pounds 3m cost of the government's campaign in September to explain its council tax. Then, a leaflet was delivered to 20m households. Mr Hurd said the government had considered distributing the pamphlet to all households but this had been ruled out. A Foreign Office official said cabinet convention meant the government could not be seen to be advertising what was not yet official policy, but cost had also been a factor. 'Some might argue that a universal mailshot would not be good value for money,' the official added. The Danish government, in the run-up to its referendum on Maastricht, sent pamphlets to all 2.33m Danish households. It also distributed free 500,000 copies of the Maastricht treaty. Copies can be obtained by writing to Freepost, PO Box 1992, Burgess Hill, West Sussex, RH15 8QY, or by ringing 0800 778866</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the </F> Sandinist National Liberation Front, to militants, members, and  supporters of the FSLN, and the people of Nicaragua, issued in  Managua on 15 April]    [Text] Brothers:    I am addressing you five weeks before the start of the  "Augusto C. Sandino, for the Sake of Sandinist Unity" special  Congress of the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN].    On 19 July 1993, at a ceremony to mark the 14th anniversary  of the triumph of the revolution, I made public an initiative to  hold this special congress to consolidate and strengthen  Sandinist unity, to ensure we are better prepared to support  popular struggles, and to prepare ourselves to win the 1996  nationwide elections. Those who were at Revolution Square  supported it and the Sandinist Assembly approved it later.    These days there are discussions on the basic documents  dealing with crucial issues of our program and our statutes that  have in turn enriched them, with proposals and resolutions  presented at territorial and sectorial assemblies.    The debate is deepening and opening itself up to others to  the extent that we fully welcome the FSLN and FSLN members,  those who committed themselves to fight -- once and a thousand  times -- against the Somozist dictatorship and to defend the  revolution, and those who -- at one time or another -- have felt  isolated, relegated, neglected, and even attacked. We want them  to join the process of discussions at the Congress to turn the  FSLN into a more participative political organization with a  renewed commitment to the ideals of Augusto Sandino, Rigoberto  Lopez, and Carlos Fonseca, by participating in the struggle to  defend a national, democratic, and popular program for all  Nicaraguans.    Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers:    These lines were written amid a debate that has at times  turned vehement and passionate. The debate is there, it is in  full force and is charged by politics and ideology. It should  produce ideas that will enrich and strengthen Sandinist thought,  actions, and unity.    Some of us Sandinists have had the privilege of experiencing  three great periods of Nicaraguan history. In the 1960's and  1970's we were part of a guerrilla movement whose strength was  based on our zeal and devotion, and our willingness to sacrifice  even our lives. We were in the government beginning on 19 July  1979, that is, in power and facing another assault by Yankee  expansionism and imperialism, which financed and organized the  war against Nicaragua.  <H5>  Renew and Modernize the FSLN </H5>   On 25 February 1990, before Nicaragua and the world, we gave  the best example of personal selflessness and democratic  exercise when we admitted defeat in the elections and handed  over the government. We reaffirmed our respect for the popular  vote. Today we are a political revolutionary front that must  adapt to new conditions. We must promote change in favor of the  people in order to successfully wage popular struggles -- and in  due time -- win the nationwide elections of November 1996.    Amid these circumstances, we must renew and modernize the  FSLN and deepen democracy within Sandinism by promoting changes  that will allow us to make contributions -- amid the new  situation -- to the freedom struggles of the people who are  rebelling against sustained growth policies, sustained  consumption, and sustained exploitation that industrialized  capitalism or "wild capitalism" is imposing on the world today  through its neo-liberal philosophy.    As we cling to our roots, culture, history, and principles,  we have the obligation to promote an alternative program that  will meet the hopes of the Nicaraguan people who are poorer and  more debased than ever today. We must find a project for all  Nicaraguans who realize that in order to guarantee stability we  must ensure the well-being of a great majority of citizens who  are roaming the countryside and cities, because they are  unemployed, hungry, and desperate.    All this will demand clear definitions of our stand toward  the policies of the current Nicaraguan Government. We want to  consolidate positions and overcome contradictions and confusions  that a lack of definition has provoked among the ranks of the  FSLN and the Nicaraguan people.    Article 4 of the Constitution's chapter on fundamental  principles states: "The Nicaraguan people have created a new  state to advance their interests and guarantee their social and  political accomplishments. The state is the people's most  effective instrument for eliminating all forms of human  domination and exploitation, giving impetus to the nation's  material and spiritual progress, and making sure that the  interests and rights of the majority will prevail."    Four years into the present government, this principle has  systematically and grievously been negated. The social and  financial adjustments have become the government's main  instrument for denying the people this constitutional principle.  The defective judicial system accompanies the policy of  dispossessing thousands of Nicaraguan families. Unemployment,  poverty, and crime rates get higher and higher in an upward  spiral that gradually negates the people's most fundamental  rights.    For this reason, the Sandinist Front must wage a firm and  active opposition struggle against those governmental policies  that undermine the people and negate the Nicaraguan  Constitution's fundamental principles.    In this struggle of the Sandinist Front with the people, we  must respect the methods of struggle adopted by the unemployed,  those who suffer hunger, those who feel grieved by government  policies. This civic and popular struggle, which is determined  by the affected sectors, must be backed by the Sandinists, in  the street, the National Assembly, and in a dialogue with the  government.    It is clear that it is necessary to access the government to  gain a better position in the defense of the people's interests.  It is also true, however, that the vote of the Nicaraguan  people is the only way that we Sandinists can gain access to the  government. For this reason, we also have to strengthen the  people's awareness and win the 1996 elections with the citizens'  conscientious vote for a broad democratic, popular, and national  program, which guarantees the right for property in all its  forms for all Nicaraguans, a program that proposes alternative  economic policies vis a vis neo-liberalism.    Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: To fight with the  people and win the elections, we need a revolutionary party  renovated in its members' commitment, with the power of Carlos  Fonseca and the heroes and martyrs who gave their lives in and  for the Sandinist Front, whose duty it is to stand firm and  raise aloft the banners of the people and the national dignity  against the onslaughts of neo-liberalism and neo-imperialism.    Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: In this process of  Special Congress debates, we must protect Sandinism's unity,  which reaches beyond legitimate personal interests, views, and  opinions. Just as we maturely experienced the baptism of fire of  a institutional democratic system four years ago, at present we  have the moral duty of participating in the democratic exercise  as members of the great Sandinist family.    The debate is open. Ideas flow powerfully. To the extent  that we can listen to one another, refrain from taking positions  of force, and take a consensus essential to reinforcing unity,  the Sandinists will become stronger and the people will attain  more victories.    Sandinist brothers: It is your decision. You are the  Congress.    For the Sandinist unity, everyone to the Augusto C. Sandino  congress.    [Issued] Managua, 15 April 1994.    [Signed] The FSLN secretary general.</p>

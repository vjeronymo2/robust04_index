			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH  </P> <P> In "Ron Kovic Calls for Pullout From Gulf" (Aug. 23), The Times reported on a  counter demonstration led by Los Angeles businessman Robert Zirgulis.  </P> <P> Zirgulis apparently identified himself as being from the International Human  Rights Watch group. Human Rights Watch dissociates itself from all statements  of Zirgulis and International Human Rights Watch.  </P> <P> Human Rights Watch is a nonpartisan, nonprofit U.S.-based human rights  monitoring organization that investigates, documents and publicizes violations  of human rights throughout the world. Human Rights Watch takes no position on  the U.S military buildup in Saudi Arabia. Rather it limits its investigations  and advocacy to human-rights concerns.  </P> <P> ELLEN L. LUTZ, California Director  </P> <P> Human Rights Watch, Los Angeles  </P></p>

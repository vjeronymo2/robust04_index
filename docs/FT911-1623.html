			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firm as data puts supply in the shade US government bonds firmed across the yield curve yesterday as retail demand and a rise in the jobless total counteracted the weakening influence of next week's injection of fresh supply by the Treasury. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 97 3/16 , yielding 8.120 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  1/16 at 100 13/32 , carrying a yield of 6.761 per cent. Trading activity was said to be very light. The important statistics of the day came from the Labor Department, which revealed a 61,000 increase in the number receiving state unemployment benefits in the week that ended April 13. Although the rise was expected, it confirmed the view that the employment picture throughout the US is bleak, and suggests that next Friday's unemployment rate for April will rise from 6.8 per cent to 7 per cent. If it were not for the jobless data, bond prices would probably have been lower yesterday because of apprehension ahead the Treasury refunding offering due next week which, at Dollars 37bn, is the largest ever seen. Federal funds were trading at 5 3/4 per cent late yesterday morning, in line with the new target set by Federal Reserve on Tuesday when the discount rate was also cut. YESTERDAY'S announcement that the Bundesbank will issue a new Federal bond next week met with little cheer. German government bond prices fell during the day as investors moved out of the D-Mark into other currencies. The yield on the benchmark 9 per cent bund due in 2001 rose from 8.31 per cent to 8.35 per cent. The federal bond consortium will meet next Tuesday to set the terms of the new bund issue. Traders expect the Bundesbank to issue between DM6 and DM10bn of 10-year paper with a coupon of about 8 1/4 per cent. One portion of the new issue will be sold through the consortium, and a second will be auctioned on Wednesday, traders said. There were no new federal bund issues in March or April, and traders believe that the Bundesbank may find it difficult to place the new May issue. The market is worried by the Bundesbank's need to borrow heavily in the bond market following reunification. Traders said that the recent widening of spreads between German bunds and Dutch government bonds has encouraged investors to switch from GerThe spread between the markets at the 10-year maturity has widened from 21 basis points last week to 28 basis points on Wednesday and 25 basis points yesterday. JAPANESE government bond prices firmed on hopes that the Bank of Japan would cut the Official Discount Rate shortly. The yield on the benchmark government bond issue No 129 opened at 6.645 per cent in Tokyo and traded between 6.635 per cent and 6.66 per cent. UK gilts rose in the morning but slipped back in the afternoon to finish unchanged. A combination of local election jitters and disappointment with the German government bond market caused gilts to fall back after lunch. The benchmark 11 3/4 gilt maturing in 2003/07 fell to its opening price of 110 1/2 to yield 10.184 per cent.</p>

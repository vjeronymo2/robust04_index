			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Alvaro Moscoso Blanco, president of the </F> Cochabamba Development Corporation by Carlos Heredia Guzman;  place and date not given: "It Would Not Be Expedient To Open Up  the Oil Royalties Fund"]    [Text] At a crucial moment in the appointment of capable  officials to run the institutions for development of the region,  and after several months of changes without warning of its  presidents, the Cochabamba Regional Development Corporation  (CORDECO), as of last week, has a new executive president.  Alvaro Moscoso Blanco, highly respected nationally and  internationally for his brilliant works and his conference  papers presented before distinguished audiences, is now at the  helm of CORDECO, a company that is in critical economic shape  but that has great potentialities, especially in the rural area,  as well as many problems to resolve. Following are the thoughts  Alvaro Moscoso has expressed to FACETAS:    [Heredia] We are five months into the term of a new  administration, and the institution that you now preside over  has already had four presidents. In what condition have you  found CORDECO?    [Moscoso] CORDECO's situation is critical. We have found a  situation without liquidity, with accounts receivable totaling  over 7 million bolivianos for completed projects, unpaid by the  preceding administration. CORDECO's performance is still being  affected by structural organizational problems. We think the  time has come to restructure and institutionalize it. We also  believe that the focus of CORDECO's purposes and objectives must  be reoriented. We have also found an extremely delicate  situation in the PIL [Indian Liberation Party], with assets  totaling not more than 25 million bolivianos and taxes owed to  the state totaling over 60 million bolivianos. I believe this is  CORDECO's most delicate aspect.    [Heredia] The PIL is your first stumbling block. Where is it  to get the money to pay the taxes it owes to the state, knowing  that the PIL is an institution that must subsidize your products  for Bolivia's infant population?    [Moscoso] At this time there is no visible solution, because  of the extent of the possible applicability of the SAFCO  [Administrative and Financial System for Government Control]  Law. The debts owed by the state to the state must be covered,  especially when all the steps in this process have been  followed. What we are awaiting now is a possible reply by the  president of the Republic to overcome this worrisome problem for  all the citizens of Cochabamba. Even a payment plan that the  Directorate of Internal Revenue might offer the PIL and the  corporation would place a strain on this company's capabilities.    [Heredia] What are the first tasks you have set out to  accomplish within CORDECO?    [Moscoso] There are two spheres of action. CORDECO's  internal  sphere needs to be restructured immediately, and its hierarchy  institutionalized. The restructuring will be addressed by the  Social Participation Law, whereas the institutionalization will  be defined by our administration. We think the  institutionalization will enable us to establish a hierarchy of  public-sector employees and set standards and required  qualifications for service to the collectivity. We believe  CORDECO must be depoliticized so as to turn it into a technical  instrument for development oriented toward improving the  well-being of the citizenry. The second sphere of action  concerns the corporation's responses to the major problems  facing the department. These problems can be boiled down to the  structure of the tenancy of the land in the inter-Andean  valleys, which is marked by a small-holder economy that first  makes its appearance in the tropic of Cochabamba; the migration  toward urban centers, which is acquiring alarming dimensions;  the scant dynamism of industry from the standpoint of generating  employment for these people; and the overall inability to  generate employment and services for the citizenry in general.    [Heredia] You speak of institutionalizing the hierarchy of  functions in CORDECO. When is this going to begin?    [Moscoso] It will begin once the Social Participation Law,  which I understand is tied to the tasks of corporations, is  passed. It will certainly modify the way in which those tasks  are carried out. When this phase of structural reforms to be  enforced by the central government is enacted, we shall enter  the institutionalization phase.    [Heredia] Toward which sector will your work mainly be  directed under the new approach that your presidency is  proposing?    [Moscoso] CORDECO must be de-urbanized. Cochabamba poses  major problems, but at the same time, it offers vast  potentialities from the standpoint of natural resources. We  believe we must start working in the provinces, and more  specifically in the rural area, gearing the work of the  corporation to the activities of the social organizations in the  rural area. In some provinces, as in the case of Mizque,  Provincial Development Councils have been created that  successfully integrate governmental authorities with  representative organizations of civil society. This linkage has  introduced a new development dynamic that is notable in the  Mizque zone.    [Heredia] Two important and perhaps controversial points:  oil  royalties and relations with the mayoralty.    [Moscoso] The oil royalties budgeted this year total 21.53  million bolivianos. My first step upon arriving at the  corporation was to request a report on the revenue the  corporation has received as royalties, and I ordered the opening  of a specific account for the administration of these funds. I  believe the corporation and its management must administer the  royalties rigorously and responsibly, drawing on the experiences  of record in other departments. We think royalties must be  managed in accordance with the law of 14 September 1992 devoting  them principally to the implementation of the Misicuni Project.  Meanwhile, it seems to me that it would not be expedient to open  up the royalties fund for grabs by all the institutions. There  is a request from the Cochabamba mayoralty, a prior one from the  university, the Quillacollo mayoralty has spoken of its  intention in this respect, as have also the inhabitants of  Carrasco Province. It seems to me very dangerous to accede to  these requests without the prior benefit of a specific policy  regulating the administration of oil royalties. This does not  mean in any way that we do not wish to work or cooperate with  the mayoralty. On the contrary, I wish to make it clear publicly  that I fully intend to cooperate with Cochabamba's municipality  and with all the municipalities of the Department of Cochabamba.  It is my obligation and we are prepared to finance funding for  the municipal mayoralty, to endorse projects for their  respective financing.    [Heredia] There would seem to be a degree of zeal in  relation  to the administering of the oil royalties.    [Moscoso] The royalties are, beyond question, the  corporation's operating revenues. This is laid down in law, and  it is the corporation management's responsibility, in  coordination with the department's parliamentary work group, to  decide the use and destination of these funds. The corporation  is prepared to cooperate in this regard, but it seems to me very  premature to institute a future earmarking of some 20 percent of  the royalties. This could give rise to a subjugation of the  administration of these funds on the basis of very justified  demands, not only on the part of the mayoralty.</p>

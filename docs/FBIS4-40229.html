			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine does not support Russia's intention to seek  a special status within the framework of NATO' Partnership for  Peace program, the chief of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's  political analysis department, Igor Kharchenko, told IF.    In reply to a question from the INTERFAX-Ukraine news agency  Kharchenko said that "practically all member-countries were  against any advantages being granted to any country involved in  that program, contrary to statements by Russian politicians that  Russia's opportunities were far wider than those of other  countries."    Kharchenko said that Russia's relations with NATO were  crucial to European security.    The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry official said that Ukraine  was  conducting "a consistent policy in order to take a decent place  in the system of collective European security and not to drift  either eastwards or westwards."</p>

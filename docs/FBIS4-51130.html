			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chu Baoping (2806 0202 1627)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 14 May (XINHUA) -- At a recent national  meeting of directors of posts and telecommunications bureaus,  Posts and Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan said: China's  fast-growing telecommunications capacity distinctly reflects the  country's backward telecommunication services. Therefore, the  posts and telecommunications industry will soon build a market-  and client-oriented business and service system to completely  improve posts and telecommunications service focusing on  improving the service style and solving crucial problems.    According to the ministry's plan, problems in installing and  relocating telephones will basically be solved within two or  three years. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, provincial capital  cities, and coastal open cities should strive to create the  necessary conditions for installing telephones in a timely  manner; time for repairing problematic telephones should meet  the standards set by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry;  the problem of inaccurate telephone billing should be solved  within a specified period; the system of allowing telephone  users to inquire about telephone billing should be strictly  implemented; time for mail delivery should be shortened; mail  should be delivered to all accessible buildings in urban areas;  and letters and newspapers should be properly delivered to all  villages.    Wu Jichuan said: In addition to setting our eyes on the  market and providing a series of regularized services, we should  develop a service supervision mechanism that combines the  efforts of posts and telecommunications departments and of our  clients, and develop a system for feedback regarding our  clients' complaints. Those who arbitrarily interrupt  communications or retaliate against our clients must be severely  punished on charges of sabotaging communications. Wu Jichuan  stressed: From the perspective of safeguarding our clients'  rights and interests, we should support our clients in filing  complaints to higher authorities and in resorting to legal  action.    At the meeting, Wu Jichuan particularly demanded that the  public's recent responses to the postal and telecommunication  service be relayed to the meeting's attendees. These responses  included motions on the postal and telecommunication service  tabled by National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference members; and the masses' response to the  postal and telecommunication service reported by national  newspapers, such as RENMIN RIBAO, XINHUA DAILY DISPATCH, and  GONGREN RIBAO. This was the first time that such responses were  relayed to attendees of a national posts and telecommunications  meeting.</p>

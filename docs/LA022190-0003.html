			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIVERS PULL 1 OF 7 BODIES FROM ICY SIERRA LAKE;  </P> <P> TRAGEDY: SHERIFF SAYS ALL THE VICTIMS MAY NOT BE FOUND. MEANWHILE, CLOSE-KNIT  COMMUNITY IS IN SHOCK.  </P> <P> Rescue teams pulled the first of seven bodies from the frigid waters of this  eastern Sierra Nevada fishing lake Tuesday, as friends of the drowning victims  kept vigil at lakeside and counselors moved in to assist survivors at a youth  camp that lost three students and two adult employees in a holiday tragedy.  </P> <P> Throughout the day, divers clad in bright blue insulated suits probed under a  shroud of ice for the bodies of the victims, who had not been seen since they  slipped beneath the lake's surface shortly after noon Monday. Other rescue  workers manned helicopters and a special air-propelled boat that skimmed over  the treacherously thin surface.  </P> <P> The search was called off at dusk and will resume at 8 a.m. today.  </P> <P> The body discovered was that of U.S. Forest Service employee Clay Cutter, whose  wife, Terry, had watched as her husband ran across the frozen lake to try to  aid three floundering teen-agers -- only to be trapped himself when the ice  collapsed. Another three would-be rescuers also drowned.  </P> <P> Outside the Cutters' lake-front home Tuesday, friends sobbed as rescue workers  lifted the body into the airboat and enclosed it in a yellow bag. Cutter's body  was recovered after rescue divers found a rope floating on the lake. They  pulled at the line, and found Cutter at the end, according to one rescuer, Lt.  Glenn Barnes of the Washoe County, Nev., Sheriff's Department. Cutter's hand,  he said, was still tightly clasping the nylon rope.  </P> <P> As delicate recovery work proceeded on the ice, California Air National Guard  crews combed the perimeter of the lake. Officials said they were responding to  statements by witnesses who said they saw one of the seven victims make it to  shore. But no evidence was found of a survivor.  </P> <P> "We searched the perimeter real thoroughly and we didn't see anything," said  Maj. Steve Hussey, who is attached to the reserves at Moffet Naval Air Station  near San Jose.  </P> <P> As the investigation into the deaths deepened, speculation centered on whether  the youngsters were properly supervised on the holiday hiking trip. It was not  yet known, authorities said, whether the counselors who died trying to save the  teen-agers had been out on the ice with them, or had run onto the ice only when  they saw trouble.  </P> <P> Local residents said Convict Lake is known to be dangerous in winter. Its ice  frequently melts and refreezes, making its thickness and safety suspect,  residents said.  </P> <P> "These are the things we're trying to find out: How much supervision did they  have? Were they out on the ice alone? How many were out on the ice at one  time?" said Mono County Sheriff's Investigator John Rutkowski.  </P> <P> The executive director of Camp O'Neal, the private residential treatment center  where the teen-agers lived, said the outing included half of the 34 students  who lived there, as well as some supervisors. One of the supervisors was an  "experienced back-country guide," said Bobbi Trott, the executive director.  </P> <P> At a press conference, Trott repeatedly sidestepped questions about the conduct  of her staff. "We're relying on the sheriffs to do their investigation," she  said.  </P> <P> The trip was meant as "a holiday outing, a fun time for kids," she added.  </P> <P> The sheriff's office and other agencies, meanwhile, began releasing the names  of the dead.  </P> <P> The tragedy, among the worst drowning incidents in the nation in at least a  decade, began at noon Monday when the hiking teen-agers ventured out onto the  newly frozen surface. The camp, which is located across U.S. 395 from Convict  Lake, handles troubled youths ages 12 to 18 from several counties.  </P> <P> As they played on the ice, four of them suddenly fell through. One managed to  clamber out but three were trapped in the frigid water. Authorities identified  the dead youngsters as David C. Sellers, 15, of Tulare County and Shawn Diaz,  15 of Dinuba, and an unnamed 13-year-old from Redlands. The 16-year-old who  escaped the frigid lake was not identified.  </P> <P> In addition, Mono County Sheriff-Coroner Martin Strelneck identified two of the  adult victims, Dave Meyers and Randy Porter, as camp counselors who had tried  to rescue the teen-agers. The other victims were two would-be rescuers --  volunteer fireman Vidar Anderson, 58, of Sunnyslope and Cutter, a 31-year-old  U.S. Forest Service employee.  </P> <P> Another volunteer firefighter who survived several minutes in the frigid water  was released Tuesday from Centinela Mammoth Hospital in Mammoth Lakes, about  five miles north of here.  </P> <P> Shortly after his release, Cris Baitx told The Times that he had to punch  through the ice three times to grab breaths of air as rescuers crept toward  him.  </P> <P> "It was a bad scene and it just kept getting worse," he said. Baitx, part of a  volunteer force that arrived well before better-equipped rescuers, said he felt  he had to reach out to the struggling youths and counselors despite the risk.  </P> <P> "Just watching these heads bobbing up and down was too much," Baitx said.  </P> <P> "We figured we should have waited for the rescue team. But when people are  bobbing up and down, you know what's next."  </P> <P> The search for victims had been called off at dusk Monday because of fears that  more would be lost to the lake. But at 7 a.m. Tuesday, new rescue teams began  converging on the Mammoth Lakes sheriff's substation. Within two hours, a  helicopter from the China Lake Naval Weapons Station was circling the lake,  pinpointing with buoys the holes where the victims had disappeared.  </P> <P> The airboat from the Truckee Fire District and a special diving team from  Washoe County then moved onto the ice, recovering the first body by 11 a.m. and  searching throughout the day for others.  </P> <P> Sheriff-Coroner Strelneck said the chances of finding all of the bodies are  slim, given the lake's depth and the dangerous conditions. As if to emphasize  that, the skies, clear and wind-free at dawn, had clouded over by noon.  </P> <P> "We think it will be a very difficult operation," Strelneck said.  </P> <P> The conditions remained treacherous and the progress frustratingly slow all day  Tuesday. Divers were limited to 15 minutes in the icy water because of the cold  and the effects of the high altitude.  </P> <P> The first of five crews to dive under the ice Tuesday was forced to return to  the surface after only six minutes, when the air regulators on their diving  equipment froze. The malfunction sent compressed air streaming from the tanks,  endangering the divers.  </P> <P> "I was down for about six minutes and it will be three hours before I'm able to  dive again," said Carl Barrett of the Washoe County sheriff's diving team.  Divers were forced to stay out of the water after each dive until their blood  gases returned to normal, he said.  </P> <P> Barrett and his partner were diving in about 77 feet of water near where the  adult rescue workers were believed to have fallen through the ice, he said.  Visibility was 12 to 15 feet, but Barrett said no bodies were visible.  </P> <P> "Nothing but sand, nothing," he said when asked what he saw.  </P> <P> Divers were sent down in teams of two from a rubber boat, which carried other  diving team members who monitored the safety of their colleagues. During the  attempts Tuesday, divers began at the points where the adult victims were  believed to have fallen, and slowly worked their way outward in a circular  pattern. They have not yet searched the deeper area where the teen-agers were  last seen.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies said they believe the bodies may have sunk to the bottom of  the lake, which is up to 140 feet deep. Because of its equipment, the Washoe  County team is able to dive only to depths of about 80 feet. Late Tuesday,  officials here sent for the Los Angeles County sheriff's rescue team, whose  equipment allows dives of up to 300 feet. The team was scheduled to depart Los  Angeles on Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "We're kind of convinced that they're not in this shallower part, that they're  going to be found in deeper water," said Glen Vogler, chief deputy of the  Washoe County sheriff's team.  </P> <P> Skaters and hikers often test the frozen lake, as the camp youths apparently  did on Monday, local officials said.  </P> <P> "People do that and get away with it quite often," said Mono County Sheriff's  Lt. Terry Padilla.  </P> <P> In the close-knit Sierra community, the impact of the deaths hit home Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The town is in shock right now," said Mammoth Lakes town manager Paul  Marangella. "This accident has touched everyone. . . . Most of us know each  other. Any kind of tragedy like this has a tremendous effect."  </P> <P> At Camp O'Neal, a spokesman said residents and counselors were undergoing  therapy Tuesday with specialists.  </P> <P> "They're very devastated," said Almeda De Cell, a clinical psychologist  counseling the youths.  </P> <P> Mono County Sheriff's Investigator John Daniels, who interviewed some of the  teen-agers who had been on the lake, said they displayed a wide range of  emotions.  </P> <P> Some adopted a tough, stoic posture and appeared to be "hardened young boys,"  Daniels said.  </P> <P> Others took the tragedy harder, Daniels said. "Some had lost their best  friends."  </P> <P> Among friends and relatives of the other victims, grief was slightly more  public.  </P> <P> Cutter worked as a snow ranger for the U.S. Forest Service during the winter;  in the summer he was a Forest Service firefighter. His supervisor, Dean  McAlister, said Tuesday that Cutter had rescued people from the lake before,  but never under icy conditions.  </P> <P> On Monday, friends said, youngsters had banged on his door to warn him that  people had fallen through the ice. He left his house with the black-and-red  rope he had used on earlier rescues, the same rope that would lead to the  discovery of his body.  </P> <P> His wife, Terry, had run to the shore and watched through binoculars Monday  afternoon as her husband struggled to rescue the victims. As his body was  pulled from the lake Tuesday, she remained in seclusion in the couple's home. A  group of friends kept reporters away from the family, which includes three  young daughters.  </P> <P> "This is hard to believe, especially when it's someone you know, someone you  worked with," said Tim McMullen, a fire management officer for the Inyo  National Forest.  </P> <P> Friends of the other adult rescuer, volunteer firefighter Anderson, also  rallied around his family. Anderson, a retired school bus driver, lived in  nearby Sunnyslope with his wife, daughter and granddaughter.  </P> <P> Few knew the identities of the victims Monday night, but when the names of the  dead were released Tuesday, the shock broadened.  </P> <P> "Everyone in town lost a friend in this thing," said Remington Slifka, general  manager of the Convict Lake Resort. "It will be hard for the town to recover.  This lake is very special . . . it will be very hard to think of the lake in  those terms again."  </P> <P> Slifka and others said the lake's dangers should have been well known. Convict  Lake is fickle, they said. A week ago it was frozen over, but this past  Saturday most of the ice was gone. It did not freeze again until Sunday night,  Slifka said.  </P> <P> "Convict Lake is famous for being water one day, ice the next day," said  Slifka. " . . . All of the locals know this."  </P> <P> But Marsha Reiten, a friend of the Cutter family, reminded others that the  teen-age victims were from outside the area.  </P> <P> "Every parent ought to keep their kids off of ice," she said. "Don't let your  kids on ice."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Sheryl Stolberg in Convict Lake and researcher Tracy Thomas  contributed to this story.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES, PICTURES: A3, A16  </P></p>

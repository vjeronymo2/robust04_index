Some aerodynamic  characteristics and flowfield properties are presented.  <H5>  1. Rarefied Gas Numerical Wind Tunnel </H5>   Work is moving ahead on the development and implementation  of  the rarefied gas numerical wind tunnel (RGNWT) which is designed  for determining aerodynamic characteristics when a high-level  airfoil such as the space plane flies through rarefied gas.  High-precision, high-efficiency simulation techniques are a must  for three-dimensional full-airfoil simulations in rarefied gas.  For this purpose, the null-collision (NC) direct-simulation  Monte Carlo (DS-MC) method[.sup]1[/] is used where the mean  molecular lower limit per collision cell is no more than  approximately 1 and the computation time is short.  General-purpose use is made of a high-efficiency (uniform)  rectangular parallelepiped for the computation area, collision  cell shape, and data cell shape. The boundary conditions at the  boundary of the computation area are that the uniform flow at  the object upper flow and vertical and lateral boundaries are  disregarded, and the changes in the direction of flow at the  object lower boundary are disregarded in making approximations.  The object surface cells that are for determining the  aerodynamic characteristics of the object are divided into  shapes that are suited to the object shape independently of the  collision cell shapes. As to the gas molecule reflection  conditions at the object surface, a mixed form is assumed which  is a mixture of mirror-surface reflection and diffuse reflection.    The gas molecule model used is the variable soft sphere  (VSS)  model which was recently proposed as a high-precision,  high-efficiency molecular model.[.sup]2[/] We are also now  developing a molecular model for conducting high-precision,  high-efficiency simulations of actual gas effects such as  molecular spin, vibration, dissociation, electronic excitation,  ionization, and radiation.  <H5>  2. OREX </H5>   We used the rarefied gas numerical wind tunnel to conduct  three-dimensional rare flow simulations around the orbital  re-entry experiment vehicle (OREX). The collision (data) cells  and the object surface cells are diagrammed in Figure 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-01A>           Figure 1. Collision (Data) Cell and Object Surface </FIG>      Because the inter-molecular potential at high energy is  indeterminate,[.sup]3[/] we used values for the parameters in  the VSS molecular model which correspond to those of rigid  sphere models. We also assumed a uniform flow temperature  dispersion wall for the object surface. The figures which follow  depict the results with angle of incidence _a_ = 0 for  cases where flight is at a uniform flow Mach number  M[.sup][/] = 27 (speed ratio  S[.sup][/] = 25) in a rarefied flow with a  uniform flow Knudsen number Kn[.sup][/] = 10,  1, 0.1, and 0.01, with the OREX diameter as the standard  criterion.    The object axis (rotational) symmetrical surface infra  density and temperature distributions are depicted in Figures 2  through 5 for Kn[.sup][/] = 10, 1, 0.1, and  0.01. Along with the reduction (high-level reduction) of the  Knudsen number, the disturbance area in front of the object is  also reduced. The density reaches several tens of times the  uniform flow value in the vicinity of the forward stagnation  point, while the temperature exceeds a hundred times the uniform  flow value in front of the forward stagnation point. There is  also a high temperature region in the back flow of the object  which is several tens of times the uniform flow temperature.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-02A>             Figure 2(a).

Temperature Distribution; </FIG>     In Figure 6 are plotted the changes based on the Knudsen  number Kn[.sup][/] of the drag coefficient  C[.sup]D[/]. The drag coefficient declines along  with the decline in Kn[.sup][/]. The degree of  convergence in the computational results for the decrease in the  collision cell size is indicated on the diagram also, but the  convergence is inadequate at Kn[.sup][/] &lt;  0.1, and we see that it has become a largish value.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-04A>           Figure 6. Drag Coefficient; (Circle), Collision Cell = </FIG>    The distributions of both the non-dimensional (surface)  pressure  P[.sup]w[/]/(_r_[.sub][/]c[.sub][/][.sup]2[/])  on the OREX surface and the non-dimensional (surface) heat  transfer  Q/(1/2_r_[.sup][/]c[.sub][/][.sup]3[/])  are plotted in Figures 7 and 8, respectively, where  _r_[.sup][/] and c[.sub][/] are the  uniform flow density and thermal velocity, respectively. The  non-dimensional pressure is not very dependent on  Kn[.sup][/], but the non-dimensional heat  transfer declines considerably with declines in  Kn[.sup][/]. Both exhibit a gradual decline in  the conical portion.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-04B>           Figure 7.

Some of the simulation results are recorded in the  animation entitled "Monte Carlo Simulation of OREX" produced by  the Mathematical Analysis Department of the National Aerospace  Laboratory, and we wish to express our appreciation to Mr.  Fujino who cooperated in the animation production.    1.

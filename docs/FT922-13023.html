			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Observer: Modest tradition In their own view, Japan's 'yakuza' gangsters have always been an important part of the country's system. Without their administrative guidance, they claim, not only would crime be disorganised, but popular pastimes such as stock-price manipulation would lack coherence. Quite a different view is understandably taken by the police, whose growing frustration has led to the passing of laws designed to dismantle the yakuza's complex and ritual-laden organisations. Even so, the system has been flexible enough to provide for public hearings where several gang bosses have defended their 'rights of assembly' and 'freedom of expression'. According to one of them, what they lead is not gangs but 'chivalrous groups' upholding Japanese traditions against modern materialism and evil. A second boss, whose minders wore the characteristic hairstyle known as the punch perm, said his organisation was a 'law-abiding institution', which regretted that its methods and members had been 'misunderstood'. The hearings were intended to give the gangs a right of reply before the inevitable police crackdown. The police know the gangsters and the gangsters know the police, so there's no rush to arrest the yakuza, who are now banned from such lucrative activities as 'debt collection' and 'brokering civil disputes'. A further boss promised to 'accept the new law with modesty' - though whether that meant actually abiding by it, he didn't explain. Meanwhile another prominent gang member has offered Washington a choice of either defending the rights of yakuza, or having them boycott the Cadillacs and other US gas-guzzlers so much in vogue as an imported symbol of Japanese gangster tradition.</p>

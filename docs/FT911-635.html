			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Reform of NHS back on political centre stage - Health ANGRY exchanges between the prime minister and Mr Neil Kinnock at Commons question time yesterday brought the government's National Health Service reforms back to centre stage. Claiming to have evidence that queue jumping was 'the order of the day', the Labour leader repeatedly challenged Mr John Major to admit that 'the clinical needs of patients are coming second to commercial considerations.' To back his charges, Mr Kinnock quoted from a letter by Dr Kenneth Grant, district general manager for the City and Hackney Health Authority, to clinical directors at Bart's hospital on general practitioner fund holders (GBFHs). 'The reality of GPs holding their own budgets is that 'equity has gone out of the window',' he said. Denying the claim, Mr Major referred to another letter to a newspaper from a Mr Ray Rowden, whom he said was a member of both West Lambeth Health Authority and the Labour party. He quoted Mr Rowden as offering backing for the changes in resource allocation and dismissing Labour's support for the outgoing system as 'spurious.' 'Decisions before were arrived at by those that screamed loudest,' Mr Major quoted the letter as saying. Labour believes that, with the two parties level pegging in the national opinion polls, concern about the impact of the changes could prove a crucial factor in the coming general election.</p>

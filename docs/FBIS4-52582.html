			<p>CSO     [Text] Over the last three years the number of Indonesians  living below the poverty line declined by about 1.8 million  people (1.39 percent). In 1990 27.7 million Indonesians (15.08  percent) were living below the poverty line; according to a 1993  National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), this figure has dropped  to 25.9 million people (13.67 percent).    Minister of State for National Development Planning/Chairman  of BAPPENAS [National Planning Board] Ginandjar Kartasasmita,  Minister of State/State Secretary Moerdiono, Deputy Chairman of  BAPPENAS Rahardi Ramelan and Deputy Chairman of the Central  Bureau of Statistics (BPS) Sugito reported the results of the  1993 SUSENAS to President Suharto at the president's office in  Jakarta yesterday. The report also included preparations for  submitting the DIP [Approved Projects List], including REPELITA  VI [Sixth Five-Year Development Plan].    Ginandjar told the press that the decrease in the number of  people living below the poverty line or below the sufficiency  limit shows that development has resulted in fewer poor people,  in both absolute and relative terms.    The 1993 SUSENAS used new methods which are more accurate  and  broader and which had a lot of input from international  institutions, including the World Bank. "The World Bank used to  criticize the way we made our calculations," he said. "Now there  is a higher percentage of poor people in the villages than in  urban areas, whereas previously it was the opposite," Ginandjar  continued.    He also stressed that under the new way of calculating,  which  takes into consideration the pace of inflation and the price  index, the number of poor people, in the villages as well as in  the cities, has decreased in both absolute and relative terms.  "So as we come to the end of the PJP I [First Long-Range  Development] the number of poor people has declined from the 70  million at the start of the New Order (about 60 percent) to 25.9  million (13.67 percent). This is a very satisfying figure," he  said.  <H5>  Improved Method </H5>   Deputy Chairman of the BPS Sugito said that the method used  in 1993 for calculating the number and percentage of poor people  was an improvement over the method used in 1990.    He explained that the method had to be improved because  given  the developments that have taken place since REPELITA I there  are some commodities which the masses, even those of the lowest  class, had not consumed at that time but were being consumed a  lot now. Sugito said that formerly only 14 commodities were  consumed in urban areas and 12 in rural areas. Starting with  1993 and into the future 46 commodities will be used in the  nonfood commodities package. A distinction will be made between  rural and urban areas. The commodities will be the same, but the  patterns of consumption will differ.    For example, it turns out that expenditures for those 46  commodities are different for people in the lowest class in  rural and urban areas even though the commodities are the same.  The volume of consumption differs. For example, more meat is  consumed in the cities than in the villages.    Rice consumption is relatively higher in the cities since it  turns out that in the villages people consume corn, dried  cassava, yams, etc. as well as rice.    He said the number and percentage of poor people was  calculated by setting a sufficiency or poverty limit. The  figures used are SUSENAS's expenditure figures. The poverty  limit is calculated by adding the food sufficiency limit to the  nonfood sufficiency limit.    The food sufficiency limit used under the old method was  based on the minimum requirements for food in order to lead a  healthy life, i.e., the equivalent of 2,100 calories per capita  per day. The value of the food sufficiency limit was obtained by  calculating the rupiah value of 2,100 calories, without taking  into consideration the type of food commodities consumed.    Under the new method, the food sufficiency limit is  calculated by first determining the commodities package which  should be consumed by a person so that he can live a healthy  life, a caloric content of 2,100 calories. The BPS considers 52  food commodities representative of the consumption patterns of  lower-class people. The rupiah value of these 52 commodities is  defined as the food sufficiency limit.    Under the old method the nonfood sufficiency limit was  calculated by defining a number of nonfood commodities as the  commodities which should be consumed. A distinction was made in  the number of commodities in rural and urban figures, 14 for  urban areas and 12 for rural areas. This commodities package,  said the deputy chairman of the Central Bureau of Statistics,  was felt to be increasingly unrepresentative of the consumption  patterns of our developing nation.    Under the new method the package of nonfood commodities  covers 46 commodities, undifferentiated for urban and rural  areas. So the difference in the value of the nonfood sufficiency  limit between the urban and rural areas may be due to a  difference in the volume and price of the commodities consumed.    The nonfood commodities were selected on the basis of the  weight given to each commodity in the consumption pattern of the  people, reflecting the quality, price and frequency [of the  commodities] which the people consume.    Results of the Calculations    The Deputy Director of the BPS said that under the new  method  the poverty line for urban areas in 1993 was 27,905 rupiahs,  which consists of a food sufficiency limit of 23,303 rupiahs and  a nonfood sufficiency limit of 4,602 rupiahs. The rural poverty  line was calculated at 18,244 rupiahs, which consists of a food  sufficiency limit of 15,576 rupiahs and a nonfood sufficiency  limit of 2,668 rupiahs.    He also explained that based on the new method there were  8.7  million poor people (13.45 percent) in urban areas in 1993 and  17.2 million (13.79 percent) in rural areas. The number of poor  people thus totaled 25.9 million (13.67 percent) in 1993. Under  the old method the total number of poor people was 25.5 million,  9.1 million (14.20 percent) in urban areas and 16.4 million  (13.13 percent) in rural areas. The number and percentage of  poor people under the new method was thus not much different  from the figures obtained under the old method.    Under the new method, the number and percentage of poor  people in rural areas was slightly higher than under the old  method. On the other hand, the number and percentage of poor  people in urban areas was lower than under the old method. This  difference was caused, in part, by the fact that under the new  method the nonfood sufficiency limit for rural areas was higher  than under the old method, i.e., 2,668 rupiahs compared to 1,149  rupiahs. The figures for the poverty level and the number and  percentage of poor people at the provincial level in 1993 are  shown in the table.</p>

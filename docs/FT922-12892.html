			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Societe Generale profits rise sharply to FFr3.37bn SOCIETE Generale, one of France's biggest private sector banks, returned to profits growth last year with net profits rising by 25.8 per cent to FFr3.37bn (Dollars 601m), from FFr2.68bn in 1990. The result from the group, which recorded a fall in profits in the previous year because of a steep increase in provisions on debts and securities, comes towards the end of a season of mixed results from the French banking sector. Banque Nationale de Paris also reported a return to profits growth for 1991 after a difficult year in 1990. However, Paribas, the investment banking group, posted its first loss of FFr200m in 1991, and last week Credit Lyonnais announced a fall in profits after a dramatic increase in client risk provisions from FFr4.2bn to FFr9.5bn. Societe Generale, after sustaining a sharp rise in write-offs to FFr6.79bn in 1990, managed to reduce its provisions by 19.1 per cent to FFr5.49bn in 1991. The balance sheet total increased by 8.6 per cent to FFr1.22bn during the year, from FFr1.12bn. The bank said yesterday that, 'despite the difficult economic environment' last year, it had benefited from a strong performance from its market trading activities and from its operations in New York and Tokyo. The general level of demand for credit in France was dampened last year by high interest rates, but Societe Generale said that demand from commercial customers had been higher than that from individuals. The group's net banking income rose by 9 per cent to FFr35.41bn from FFr32.49bn, and gross profits increased 16.4 per cent to FFr10.51bn, from FFr9.03bn. Societe Generale saw gross profits from its domestic banking interests rise to FFr5.7bn from FFr5.3bn, and from its international interests to FFr2.6bn from FFr1.6bn . The property management division made static gross profits of FFr500m, and the group's income from market trading moved from a loss of FFr300m into gross profits of FFr600m. The specialist financial division saw gross profits fall to FFr1.8bn from FFr2.1bn . The board proposed holding the dividend, for the third year in succession, at FFr15 a share. Societe Generale's 'A' shares were stable yesterday at FFr533.</p>

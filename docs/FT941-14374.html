			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian farmers enjoying bumper year Australian grain farmers are seeing record or near-record production in the 1993-94 season, thanks to favourable spring growing conditions outside of Queensland, an increase in the area planted, and some 'excellent' harvest weather. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, total winter crop production is forecast to be 29.4m tonnes, only 700,000 tonnes less than the record grain harvest seen in 1983-84. This figure compares with the estimated 26m tonnes harvested last year. Mr Chrys Papadopoulos, Abare's crop and livestock economics branch manager, said that this should result in higher farm incomes, despite the likely reduction in average returns for wheat and barley. The country's wheat crop is estimated to be about 18.2m tonnes - up from 16.2m tonnes last year but still well short of the 22m tonnes harvested in 1983-84. However, the area sown this year, at 9.5m hectares, was significantly smaller than 1983-84's 12.9m hectares, indicating a much higher yield. The barley crop is forecast to be 6.8m tonnes, nearly 1.3m tonnes more than last year's record crop.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Mexico fires agents in drugs purge MEXICO has sacked 67 members of the federal anti-drugs squad, including 13 commanders, in a crackdown on collusion with traffickers. They will be arrested if investigations show proof of criminal activity, the attorney general's office said yesterday. A further 75 agents based in the state of Sinaloa, an important centre of trafficking, are reported to have been transferred to Mexico City for interrogation about links with the illegal drugs trade. The authorities have also detained for questioning Mr Rodrigo Esparza Cristerna, the attorney general's representative in the state, suggesting that investigations may reach beyond the security forces. President Carlos Salinas's administration has stepped up its campaign against drug trafficking in the wake of a shoot-out last month between rival gangs at Guadalajara airport when seven people were killed, including a Roman Catholic cardinal. The incident shocked Mexican society and brought home the ease with which cocaine rings operate in the country. Since then, a string of arrests has been made in an attempt to curb the Sinaloa cocaine cartel, culminating in the detention on June 8 in Guatemala of Mr Joaquin Guzman Loera, its alleged head. However, even these successes have proved controversial. Questions have been asked why all the initial arrests related to the airport shootings have been of Sinaloa cartel members, while no members of its Tijuana rival have been detained. Churchmen have also voiced doubts about the official theory that the cardinal, shot at point-blank range, was mistaken for a trafficker. There is some scepticism about the extent and durability of the drugs crackdown. The operation against Mr Guzman 'fits with the Salinas strategy of spectacular strikes that don't ultimately change the balance of power,' said Ms Denise Dresser, political scientist at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.</p>

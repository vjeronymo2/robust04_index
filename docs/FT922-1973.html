			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Stirling more than doubles to Pounds 2.44m STIRLING GROUP, which acquired fellow clothing manufacturer Ritz Design Group for about Pounds 19.2m at the end of 1991, more than doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.44m in the year to March 31. The rise, from Pounds 1.06m, was struck on turnover 72 per cent ahead at Pounds 68.2m. Reasons for the advance, said Mr Peter Sheldon, chairman, were several. The integration of the Fiona Rose nightwear business, acquired in 1990, with Bentwood's existing nightwear operation, played a part. Also important were improved manufacturing performances in the factories, tight cost controls across the group and the first-time contributions from Fiona Rose, E Gifford, the casualwear distributor acquired in July, and Ritz. Some 70 per cent of both Ritz's and Stirling's clothing output was supplied to Marks and Spencer. Before the Ritz buy, Stirling had laid off more than 200 of its workforce, and rationalisation of the expanded group had entailed the loss of a further 495 jobs, mainly from the closure of four smaller Bentwood factories. Some Pounds 1.78m had been set aside from reserves to cover the rationalisation costs. The accent was now on consolidation and no more job cuts were expected, Mr Sheldon said. Earnings rose from 2.23p to 3.08p, heavily diluted by the increase of the shares in issue from 37m to 86m after the Ritz buy. The proposed final dividend is lifted 15 per cent to 1.15p - 'especially pleasing for the Ritz shareholders who have only been with us three months', said Mr Sheldon - for a total of 1.65p (1.5p).</p>

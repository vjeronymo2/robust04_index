			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 25 May -- Last year's initiative to relay  TVPolonia satellite programs to the United States has ended in a  fiasco, TVPolonia director Leszek Wasiuta, said today at a  meeting of the Sejm Commission for Liaison With Poles Abroad and  the Senate Commission for Immigration and Poles Abroad.    "We at TVPolonia are all taking the fact that we could not  start relays in the United States as a personal failure. It is  not because of the lack of goodwill from the Polish side; we  failed because our American partner could not bear the burden,"  Wasiuta explained. An agreement with him was signed last year  during the chairmanship of Janusz Zaorski of what was then state  radio and television. The board of the Polish Television  Company will have to decide whether to continue this initiative.    Wasiuta added that the issue now is "whether we should be  looking for a partner by means of a Wall Street marketing bureau  for between $5,000 and $15,000 a month and sign an agreement  within three months, or whether we should apply the same method,  that is, to get in touch with a Pole who does not give any  guarantees but has goodwill." He said that TVPolonia  management's option is to employ a professional company, which  would look for a partner and check if "he has the money and  power to sell the television." The acceptance of that option  depends, however, on the board of the Polish Television Company.    In Wasiuta's opinion the relay of the program itself to  America poses no problem. The issue is whether Polish Americans  want to tune in to TVPolonia. "Production is a third of the  success that depends upon the ability to sell the product," he  said.</p>

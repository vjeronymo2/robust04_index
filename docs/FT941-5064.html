			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark moves lower The weekend settlement of the wage dispute in the German engineering sector set the tone for foreign exchanges yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. The pay deal - effectively a wage freeze - was at the lower end of market expectations and renewed hopes that the Bundesbank might quicken the pace of monetary easing. The central bank is expected today to announce a further easing in the repo rate - the indicator it uses to set the level of money market rates. The D-Mark finished lower in London against most European currencies, but was slightly firmer against the dollar and sterling. Analysts said President Clinton's political difficulties, arising from the Whitewater scandal, still remained of only minor concern to markets. The engineering industry wage settlement was widely interpreted as improving the outlook for lower German interest rates, but this reaction was tempered with caution. The March Euromark futures contract was only four basis points higher at 94.19 yesterday afternoon, indicating a fairly modest view of where rates are heading. Although the longer contracts reacted more positively - the December contract rose by 13 basis points to 94.98 - Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, said even these levels revealed 'continuing scepticism' about the prospect for lower rates. While most observers are anticipating an easing in the repo rate today, nothing dramatic is on the cards. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, said he did not expect a cut of more than five basis points; but Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank, said the market seemed to be looking for a 10 basis-point reduction. Mr Martin went on to say that the relative strength of the D-Mark and the fact that the bund market had recovered its poise - added to a fairly benign inflationary outlook - suggested that the Bundesbank had room for a cut of this order. The picture yesterday was of uneven D-Mark weakness: it finished lower against the Belgian and French francs, and the Spanish peseta, but was firmer against the Italian lira. The lira finished in London at L982.8, from L981.7 on Friday and a low yesterday of L984.3. Mr Hawkins said the weaker Italian currency appeared to be the product of recent opinion polls showing that a centre-right coalition government might now be more likely than a centre-left coalition. Italy faces a general election on March 27. International investors are said to favour the centre-left option because it improves the prospect of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, staying in government. He was previously the highly respected governor of the Bank of Italy. The weaker D-Mark lent a firmer tone to the dollar, which was also supported by the continuation of its recent recovery against the yen. The US currency closed in London at a high for the day of Y105.850, from Y105.515 on Friday. It ended in New York at Y105.545. Rumours that the Federal Reserve might tighten credit policy yesterday proved unfounded. Mr Norfield said the next move from the Fed would probably come after the meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Markets Committee on March 22. Mr Hawkins said the fact that the dollar had made so little headway, in spite of the heightened prospect of a move on German rates, 'says something about the political wariness now in the market about Whitewater'. Having been very much on the periphery of the market's focus, he said the financial scandal dogging the Clinton administration was 'starting to gravitate more towards the centre'. Mr Martin from Citibank, however, said Whitewater had not yet been much of a factor in the market's thinking. Mr Hawkins said a closer look at last Friday's employment report could also have contributed to uncertainty about the dollar. He said the important earnings growth and hours worked factors were, if anything, on the soft side and could have delayed the prospect of further Fed tightening. The appreciation of the dollar against the yen flows from the US administration's decision to reactivate the Super 301 measures allowing trade sanctions to be implemented - in this case against Japan. The market appears to have taken the view that, with Super 301 in its arsenal, the US will be less tempted to talk up the yen as a means of curbing its bilateral trade deficit with Japan. Liquidity conditions in the UK money markets were easy yesterday. The Bank of England put Pounds 1.8bn of liquid-ity into the system, equal to its revised estimate of the shortage. Sterling traded in a fairly narrow range to close marginally lower against the D-Mark and the dollar at DM2.5615 and Dollars 1.4906 respectively. Weaker than expected credit growth in January, a decline in housing starts and the German pay deal, all lent support to a further fall in interest rates. The June short sterling contract rose by four basis points to 94.94.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Cartels prove a hard nut for Japan to crack - Anti-monopoly body meets its match in construction sector WHEN the investigators from the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) raided Japan's leading construction companies last year, there was a collective disbelief that the commission would dare to dismantle the cosy relationships in the country's most politically-influential industry. But, a week ago, when the commission decided not to prosecute 66 construction companies for the self-confessed rigging of bids and fixing of contracts, there were knowing nods that the anti-monopoly body had finally met its match. It seemed the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had drawn a political line which the investigators cannot cross. Apart from bruising the FTC's reputation, the case aroused interest in Washington, which has negotiated a pact providing better access for foreign contractors in Japan's construction market. The US is especially interested in dango, or cartels, which it believes are rife in the construction industry and common in corporate Japan. In this dango, the 66 contractors routinely rigged bids for government projects worth Y81bn (Pounds 346.15m) in Saitama Prefecture, part of Greater Tokyo. They agreed among themselves which company would win a particular contract, then ensured all bidders were above the cost estimate submitted by that company. While government officials argue such cases are a rarity, the construction companies have publicly supported the concept of arguing it provides stability and enables smaller companies to compete. For fear of trade friction, these opinions are now kept private, but they are deeply felt. The US had a close-up view of the workings of dango, when it was found that 145 construction and related companies had rigged bids for 178 projects at a naval base near Tokyo in the late 1980s. Just over 100 of those companies have agreed to pay a total of Y4.7bn in compensation to the US government. In the present case, the punishment has been little more than a wrist-slap. The FTC has issued a 'cease and desist' order, and last week, representatives of the 66 companies appeared before the Ministry of Construction, which said 63 would be forbidden from bidding for select government projects for a month and three others for two months. The ministry is commonly perceived to represent the interests of the industry, and the post of construction minister is sought after by LDP parliamentarians, who rely heavily on the industry as a source of funds. The LDP has a construction 'tribe' of politicians, many of them from the party's largest faction, who ensure a steady flow of lucrative projects in their own electorates. Later this week, the ministry is likely to issue a formal instruction to the companies on the lines of the FTC's 'cease and desist' order. But an official admitted the month's suspension of bidding would have little impact on the companies concerned. 'We are fortunate that the period April-June generally has few big projects. If we had to impose this penalty during July or August, it would have been a disaster,' he said. The LDP argues that tougher penalties imposed on the construction dango, or a long court case, would have damaged the expected recovery of the economy. Although the 66 included most of the industry leaders, including Taisei, Kajima and Kumagai Gumi, other contractors and, perhaps, a few foreign companies might have wanted the work. Both Kajima and Taisei expressed 'regret' for having been involved in bid-rigging, saying they would 'strengthen their management systems' to ensure it does not happen again. The implication of the apologies is that this bout of 'dango' was an exception and not the norm, as Washington suspects. FTC officials are disappointed that the failure to prosecute has been generally interpreted as the commission buckling under political pressure. The commission, which has drawn praise from Washington for its extra vigilance in the past two years, argues that the Japanese legal system made a criminal prosecution virtually impossible. 'Under Japanese criminal law, we would have had to prosecute an individual, not a company; it was felt we would not win in this case. It's hard to win,' an FTC official said. Criminal charges, the first in 17 years, were filed in November against eight plastic wrapping makers controlling 97 per cent of the market, whose executives admitted they regularly held meetings to discuss market trends and plan price increases. The FTC official insisted further prosecutions would ensue, and the commission's interest in the construction 'dango' has not waned.</p>

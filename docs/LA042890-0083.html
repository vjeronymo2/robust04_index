			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY MEDFLIES WILL BE SPRAYED;  </P> <P> MALATHION: CAMPAIGN LIKELY WILL BEGIN MAY 11.  </P> <P> In a strong indication that malathion-bearing helicopters won't soon depart the  region, state agricultural officials announced Friday their decision to treat a  new, 34-square-mile infestation in San Bernardino County with up to eight  aerial applications of the pesticide.  </P> <P> The new aerial spraying campaign, tentatively set to begin May 11 over parts of  the cities of Highland and San Bernardino, will extend at least through the  beginning of July and may require weekly spraying during that period.  </P> <P> Don Henry, deputy director of the eradication project, added that because of  the growth of the Medfly infestation it appears that other new Medfly outbreaks  may face the same regimen of repeated aerial spraying.  </P> <P> The decision to spray San Bernardino is the first blow to the state's plan to  end repeated malathion spraying by May 9 throughout the Southland and rely on  the more benign treatment of releasing millions of sterile fruit flies, used to  breed the pest out of existence.  </P> <P> State Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss announced last  month that he expected an abundant supply of sterile flies from breeding  facilities in Hawaii, allowing an end to multiple spraying in old areas and  limiting spraying in newly infested areas to no more than twice.  </P> <P> Voss also announced that no area would have to face the grim prospect of being  sprayed once a week "since sterile insects will replace all bait treatments by  early May," according to a March press release.  </P> <P> Voss' decision, which was made in part to quell the public outcry over  malathion spraying, overruled the recommendation of the state's scientific  advisers in the eradication campaign who believed that spraying should not stop  in many areas because of concerns that infestation would grow in the spring and  there would not be enough sterile flies.  </P> <P> Indeed, over the last month, about 150 more square miles have become infested  with the pest and a new breeding facility in Hawaii has experienced production  problems, reducing the available supply of sterile flies.  </P> <P> Ed Layaye, San Bernardino agricultural commissioner, said the San Bernardino  spray zone probably will have to be treated completely with malathion spraying  because of the sterile fly shortage.  </P> <P> Layaye said he expected that the area will have to be sprayed on a weekly basis  because hot weather drains malathion's potency against insects.  </P> <P> Rex Magee, associate director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture,  said this week that the unexpected size of the infestation and the potential  shortfall in the sterile fly supply has forced the state to reassess if it can  safely phase out spraying in previously infested areas.  </P> <P> Voss was unavailable for comment Friday. Magee and Assistant Director Isi  Siddiqui, who is in charge of the eradication campaign, were also unavailable  for comment.  </P> <P> The latest spraying order brings the total area under malathion treatment to  about 470 square miles in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange and Riverside  counties.  </P> <P> With the warm weather, which sparks increased breeding by the Medfly, all of  the state's top advisers in the eradication campaign predict that more Medflies  will be found through the summer.  </P> <P> The new spray zone in San Bernardino and Highland is roughly bounded by Cajon  Boulevard on the west, 9th Street on the south, Palm Avenue on the east and  Piedmont Drive on the north.  </P></p>

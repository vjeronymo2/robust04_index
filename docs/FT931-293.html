			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Hoover executives axed over 'flawed' free flights offer HOOVER'S European president and two senior executives were dismissed yesterday after thousands of complaints from customers over its highly controversial free flights offers. Maytag, Hoover's US parent, said the Dollars 30m (Pounds 21m) cost of ensuring customers received their flights or compensation would be taken as a charge against its first-quarter profits. It admitted Hoover's name had been seriously damaged by the 'flawed' promotion, and is setting up a top-level task force to sort out the situation. 'We are very upset that the Hoover name has been damaged and consequently we made these management changes,' Maytag said. It admitted that the dramatic way in which it had reversed its usual policy of not interfering in the running of its subsidiaries reflected its displeasure over the affair. Mr William Foust, managing director of Hoover Ltd and president of Hoover Europe, was re-moved from his post, along with Mr Brian Webb, vice-president of marketing UK, and Mr Michael Gilbey, director of marketing services. Mr Foust has been replaced by Mr Gerald Kamman, president of Maytag's vending equipment company, Dixie-Narco, since 1988. Replacements for the other two managers have yet to be named. Maytag said the promotions in the UK and Ireland, which offered customers two free flights to the US or other holiday destinations in return for spending more than Pounds 100 on Hoover products, had resulted in 'tremendous difficulties in administration and implementation, plus significant unanticipated costs'. The travel operators retained by Hoover had been unable to fulfil their responsibilities and meet the high demand from customers. Some 200,000 customers had applied for free tickets, although Maytag was not sure if all of these qualified. To date, only 6,000 customers have flown. Thousands of others have complained about not receiving tickets, not being able to get the dates requested, or waiting for months without hearing the result of their applications. A hotline at Hoover Europe has been handling 2,000 calls a day. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, who has been calling for a Department of Trade and Industry investigation into the offer, called for the sacking of Baroness Denton, the consumer minister. 'The failure of the minister for consumer affairs to investigate this offer, in spite of receiving complaints from me since November, now means she has failed consumers and has to go.' Mr Leonard Hadley, Maytag chairman and chief executive, said the company regretted 'the inconvenience it has caused Hoover customers in the UK and Eire'. Maytag said all customers still waiting for tickets would get their flights or some form of compensation 'within the terms of the promotion programme'. An announcement was likely within the next few weeks. The parent company said it had been aware of the offer from the outset but not all the details. Problems had arisen after Hoover underestimated the likely response and overestimated the amount it would earn from commission payments on associated accommodation, car rental and insurance policy bookings. The Consumers' Association, which has received thousands of complaints about the offer, said it welcomed the 'high-level action' by Hoover to deal with the effects of a 'badly-administered marketing ploy'. The BBC consumer programme Watchdog said last night it was due to screen a programme next Monday alleging the travel company organising the offer has been trying to dissuade customers from taking up their flights. Sales campaign remained a flight of fantasy, Page 10</p>

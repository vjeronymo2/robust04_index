			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Single market far from being realised THE creation of the single market is still a long way from being realised according to a new study* of the European distribution and logistics industry which reveals big differences in comparative costs and practices. The distribution sector has traditionally been viewed as being at the leading edge of an integrated European market, but the report found there were still considerable barriers to a free flow of goods across borders. The study of six European markets found that transport infrastructure still largely reflected the priorities of national governments, leading to considerable disruption at borders. Railways, for example, still have a plethora of different voltages, signalling systems, operating rules, and loading gauges. The study found that delays at frontiers averaged two hours and were as high as eight hours at the Spanish border. Different taxation policies also affected the relative costs of distribution. Fuel costs may represent 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the costs of operating a vehicle but the study found that diesel prices at the pump varied between Ecu252 (Pounds 179) in France and Ecu365 (Pounds 259) in Italy. Vehicle excise duties also showed great differences. The EC has been trying to harmonise taxation policy, but is making slow progress. When total logistics costs were measured as a percentage of sales there was a marked difference between the Netherlands, at 4.62 per cent, and France, at 7.22 per cent. Mr Tony West, of Touche Ross, the management consultancy which helped prepare the report, said UK companies had not established a clear cost advantage in the logistics field. The study covered 836 companies in German, Spain, France, Italy, UK and the Netherlands. * European Logistics: Comparative Costs and Practice.

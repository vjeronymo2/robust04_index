			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zakharchenko, KAZTAG correspondent: "A Way </F> Out of the Crisis Is To Firmly Proceed Toward the Market and To  Have National Accord"]    [Text] Toward the end of last week, President Nursultan  Nazarbayev paid a visit to East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk  Oblasts.    At an aktiv meeting in Ust-Kamenogorsk, the president  introduced Yuriy Lavrinenko, the new head of the oblast  administration.    Subsequently the president arrived in Semipalatinsk where he  also introduced to the aktiv the newly appointed head of the  oblast administration, Galymzhan Zhakiyanov.    Speaking at these meetings, Nursultan Nazarbayev discussed  the current economic situation in the republic. As is known, it  is complex and, as the head of state stressed, in order to  overcome the situation sooner we should tighten procedures for  the allocation of credit to enterprises and proceed solely from  the real financial potential in resolving all issues.    Incidentally, the ways to overcome the crisis were outlined  to the fullest in the president's presentation at a session of  the Supreme Council and his message to members of parliament.  All residents of Kazakhstan should know the essence of these  ways, as well as the position of the republic leadership with  regard to solving domestic problems in order to avoid idle talk  of which there is frequently no dearth precisely because the  citizens are poorly informed.    Nursultan Nazarbayev gave the following example. Disabled  front-line veterans received preferences under 19 provisions.  Their combined monetary equivalent came to 300 tenge. In view of  this, the decision was made to replace numerous preferences that  by then were hard to figure out with the raising of retirement  benefits of this particular category of the population by 330  tenge in order to provide it with targeted social protection.  After all, not only veterans but also members of their families  took advantage of the preferences. Was this fair?    Revisiting economic problems, the president noted that  unprofitable enterprises are a heavy burden for the economy to  shoulder. All of them will soon be declared bankrupt. It is more  advantageous for the state to pay unemployment benefits upon the  closure of such production facilities than to subsidize them.  Getting rid of the continuously unprofitable enterprises will  make it possible to stop the growth of inflation and invigorate  foreign investment in the economy of the republic.    The head of state recalled that on 1 May the residents of  Ust-Kamenogorsk held a rally at which demands to return to life  as it used to be were aired. However, there is no return to such  life, and this is an objective fact. We must proceed more  rapidly toward market relations, stressed Nursultan Nazarbayev,  and grant to the people the freedom to labor for their own  benefit wherever and however they see fit. However, the state  will not reduce its care for retirees, handicapped, and the  employees of budget-financed institutions. Others should make a  living themselves. Nobody will sustain parasitism and laziness.  This is the main law of a market economy. We are now traveling  along the path that the entire civilized world has covered, and  we will only be able to achieve prosperity and welfare if we do  not turn off this path.    The president paid special attention to ensuring stability  in  our society in the absence of which favorable changes are  impossible. To maintain stability, it is necessary to ensure the  equality of all citizens and a balanced cadre policy proceeding  from the peculiarities of regions. It is important not to give  in to provocations that are capable of causing internal strife  and to strictly proceed from the law on pressing criminal  charges against individuals fueling interethnic discord.    Nursultan Nazarbayev also noted that there are those who  indiscriminately pick on the activities of Kazakhstan's  leadership. However, this is populism pure and simple. Let them  propose alternative ways to overcome the existing situation. It  is as easy as can be to exploit existing difficulties.    The president answered frankly numerous questions from  participants in the oblast aktiv meetings, including the most  sharply worded questions.</p>

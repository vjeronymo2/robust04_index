			<p>BFN     [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has  said the Pressler Amendment plays highly discriminatory and  harsh sanctions against Pakistan while the Indian missile  program was posing security threat to the South Asian region.  He was speaking at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in  Washington. During the intense session, the president made a  comprehensive presentation of a wide range of political,  economic, and strategic issues involving Pakistan-U.S.  relations. He, however, emphasized that relations between the  two countries should not be allowed to become hostage to the  Pressler Amendement. Speaking of nuclear nonproliferation, the  president said Pakistan cannot sign the treaty unilaterally in  the face of security threat posed by India's military build up  in the region and its hegemonic ambition. President Leghari  dilated in detail on the Kashmir issue and highlighted the human  rights violations being committed by Indian troops in the held  valley. The president earlier had a similar meeting with the  House Foreign Relations Committee headed by Mr. Lee Hamilton.    Addressing the influential Middle East Forum of the Council  of Foreign Relations, the president said the threat to regional  and global peace arises from the Kashmir dispute, New Delhi's  arms build up against Pakistan, and India's pursuit of a nuclear  weapons and missile program. He said security in South Asia  will improve dramatically if the core issue of Kashmir is  resolved peacefully. On Afghanistan, the president said Pakistan  sided with the Afghan resistance at a great cost and peril to  itself. Thus it contributed in small measure to the demise of  the cold war.</p>

He added  that progress has been achieved and if we continue in the same  manner, we can deal with the substance of the issue and make  progress.    Before making his statement, Clark met briefly with UN  envoys  Gustave Feissel and John Paul Kavanagh. In his statement, Clark  reiterated that the international community is satisfied that  both sides have shown goodwill, adding that interest has been  expressed on the higher levels of the international community.    Answering a question, Clark said he can give assurances that  implementation of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] will  not constitute a Cyprus solution. He added that the CBM's are  the principle that will lead to an appropriate climate to  discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue. Answering another  question, Clark said he disagrees with the view that the CBM's  are destructive, adding that his mission is to promote a  procedure that is supported by the United Nations.    Clark said it is important to achieve progress by the end of  February, when the UN secretary general will submit his report,  so that the UN Security Council can evaluate the whole issue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A bronze statue of Taiwan's late leader Chiang  Kai-shek was removed from a traffic circle in the southern port  city of Kaohsiung on Tuesday, a sign of the former first  family's declining influence. The four-meter two-ton statue  erected in 1971 was the last statue of Chiang on horseback in  Kaohsiung. Opposition protesters have vandalized the statue on  several occasions.    A spokesman for the Kaohsiung City Government said the  statue  was removed to ease off a traffic bottleneck at the circle, but  he could not say why 180 police officers were mobilized at 3 am  when the statue was being removed. The Chinese language UNITED  EVENING NEWS said the statue was quietly removed, and police  officers were ordered to the spot to avoid unnecessary trouble,  such as protest. An opposition legislator has said there are  more than 30,000 statues of Chiang Kai-shek across the island.</p>

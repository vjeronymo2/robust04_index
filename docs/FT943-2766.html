			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Absence of hat gives food for thought when choosing a restaurant Sir, I refer to the FT guide, 'Eating out in London', which accompanied the issue of September 10/11 and, in particular, to the photograph of Marco Pierre White of the Hyde Park Hotel Restaurant which accompanied your article, 'Attractions all their own'. I was amazed that Marco Pierre White was not wearing his chef's hat, nor were any of his colleagues for that matter. Also, Mr White's long forelock appeared to be at a 'dangerous' angle over the food he was working with. The photograph resembled a scene from 'Joe's cafe' rather than a kitchen in a top London hotel. By comparison, the chef at the Connaught Hotel, featured in 'At a glance' on the opposite page, is dressed in his 'whites' and hat, as are his colleagues also pictured. In the circumstances, I think I will opt to dine at the Connaught] C A McCann, 46 West Drive, Caldecote, Cambridge CB3 7NY</p>

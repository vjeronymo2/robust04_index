			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Investment in Britain rises tenfold Australian investment in Britain has risen more than tenfold, to almost ADollars 16bn (Dollars 11bn) since Australia lifted exchange controls a decade ago. This makes Britain the biggest single offshore home for Australian investment. According to a report by the Allen Consulting Group, 'Australia sends about 35 per cent of its offshore direct investment to Britain, which is eight times more than could be expected from the size of the UK economy.' Australia is the fourth largest overseas investor in the UK. The report also finds Britain is the second largest investor in Australia, although only 7 per cent of its offshore direct investment goes in this direction. The strength of investment ties is surprising, given the shift in Australian trade flows towards Asia and Britain's, toward Europe. Around 60 per cent of Australia's trade is now conducted with Asia, while around 56 per cent of British exports go to the European Union countries. The report points out that the wave of Australian investment in Britain over the past decade is largely accounted for by 16 companies - among them, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, which owns the Pearl and London Life insurance companies, and Foster's, the brewing company which takes in Courage. But it contradicts the widespread impression that much of this investment took place occured in the mid- to late-1980s, when the last wave of Australian entrepreneurs was at full power. The report says some ADollars 6.5bn was invested over the past five years, and cites a number of companies  -such as Amcor, the paper and packaging group - which has made an initial investment in the UK, as the first step to a European operation. The report suggests a range of reasons for Australia's investment interest in the UK, including cultural, regulatory and language similarities, and the opportunity for expansion into other European markets. It also says that some expansion-minded companies felt more comfortable operating in the UK than in the highly competitive US environment. 'One Australian manufacturing company commented that in Britain if you can be the low cost/best quality producer you will win market share, but in the US you may just bleed red ink as competitors keep down prices to hold market share.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enrique Lemus, from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The National Association of Private Enterprise,  ANEP, is sponsoring a series of activities to establish  conditions for participating in international free trade  agreements. ANEP General Manager Juan Hector Vidal has said  that the necessary efforts are being made to begin free trade  with Mexico. Negotiations between Costa Rica and Mexico have  been concluded, and, according to Mr. Vidal, the same trade  relationship will prevail between Honduras, Guatemala, and El  Salvador -- countries which comprise the northern Central  American triangle.    [Begin recording] [Vidal] Individual negotiations are  provided for in the general agreement protocol signed last year  in Guatemala. We know Costa Rica and Mexico signed last week,  and we are now trying to sponsor a northern triangle, in  conjunction with Nicaragua, to speed things up and achieve the  same conditions that Costa Rica now has with Mexico. Otherwise,  if we do not achieve the same conditions, preferential treatment  for Central American imports and exports could be lost.  Moreover, we risk a diversion of trade and investments to  Mexico given the advantages offered by the treaty with Costa  Rica.    [Lemus] What will happen to the CA-4 Group [Central American  Four]?    [Vidal] Well, a political decision has been made to expedite  the negotiations. You may remember that a large Mexican  delegation of private entrepreneurs and government officials met  with their counterparts from the northern triangle countries --  meaning Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- four weeks ago.  That was a visit... [pauses] I wouldn't characterize that as an  exploratory visit; it was a visit to establish the rules under  which Mexico would be willing to negotiate.    We now need to define the conditions under which we are  going  to negotiate. A trade and investment agreement is not reached  on the basis of impositions but through negotiations.  Accordingly, we are trying to inaugurate, under the auspices of  the ANEP, a seminar on rules of origin that are essential to  these kinds of negotiations, because this is how rules are  established for national products that are being traded. [end  recording]    Mr. Omar Rodriguez, a member of the ANEP, said that in El  Salvador's case, ANEP held a seminar on Monday to explain the  rules of product origin as they apply to free trade agreements.    [Begin recording] [Rodriguez] The rules of origin seminar  was organized by [words indistinct] and the ANEP to provide  training -- for Salvadoran businessmen and government officials  -- on rules of origin, which is basically the most important  issue in free trade negotiations.    [Lemus] What are rules of origin?    [Rodriguez] Rules of origin define the nationally-produced  components of each product prior to its exportation. In the  case of products included in a free trade agreement, rules of  origin define the country of origin's share in manufacturing the  product that is being exported. This is important because it is  meant to prevent three-way trade -- in other words, that  finished products be taken from a given country to, let's say,  Honduras so that Honduras can export it to Mexico as a Honduran  product, when in fact it is a product manufactured in another  country. This is what rules of origin try to prevent.    [Lemus] As for free trade agreement, it is known that Costa  Rica has already signed something with Mexico.    [Rodriguez] Costa Rica already signed a free trade agreement  with Mexico. This does not include other countries in Central  America. The northern triangle countries -- Guatemala, El  Salvador, and Honduras -- have organized joint negotiations with  Mexico. They will try to come to some agreement as soon as  possible, eventually establishing a relationship with the United  States and possibly with Canada. [end recording]    Last week Costa Rica signed a free trade agreement with  Mexico. Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador will do so jointly  when these countries' authorities feel conditions are favorable.</p>

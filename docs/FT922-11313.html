			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Last challenge to EC working hours Britain is to make a last ditch effort to amend the European Community's working-time directive to allow voluntary overtime to be worked above the 48-hour ceiling on the working week. The directive, scheduled to be agreed by a meeting of EC employment ministers next Thursday, will be the first European test for Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary. British ministers hope Luxembourg and Portugal will support a move either to raise the limit to 52 or 55 hours a week or to allow voluntary overtime on top of the 48 hours.  They will also continue to argue that working over 48 hours should be permitted if a risk assessment shows there is no danger to health or safety. In the past few months some moves have been made in the UK's direction. Some industries such as transport have been exempted from the directive, and the requirement of four weeks paid holiday a year has been lowered to three weeks for the first three years of the directive. There appears to be further room for manoeuvre on the period within which an average of 48 hours a week must be worked.  The UK and Germany favour six months, and a compromise of four or five months looks possible.  There may also be further movement on Sunday being 'in principle' the day of rest, which the government dislikes because it fears it would give a boost to the anti-Sunday trading lobby. It remains highly unlikely that the government will agree to the directive, but if enough progress is made on the aspects most strongly opposed by UK employers, it may discard a formal challenge to the legal basis. Some officials suggest that Mrs Shephard's arrival may have produced greater willingness to compromise on both sides and the Portuguese, who hold the EC presidency, are very keen to get a unanimous agreement - even though approval can be by qualified majority.  If there are sufficient signs of progress next Thursday, they may postpone a final decision until June. Officials have been emphasising that in spite of Mrs Shephard's liberal image she can be expected to take as hard a line as Mr Michael Howard, her predecessor, on both EC employment legislation and the next round of industrial relations law. On Europe there may be as much change as continuity.  Although Mrs Shephard has no desire to reverse the 'opt-out' won at Maastricht from extending the EC's power in the employment field, employment department officials say she will be more 'pro-active' than Mr Howard.</p>

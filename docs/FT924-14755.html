			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Observer: Back-wash It's all hands to the pump in customers' interests at Hewden Stuart, according to chairman Sir Matthew Goodwin. Witness the time he picked up a ringing phone in the Glasgow headquarters and found he was talking to a disgruntled forklift-truck operator. Twenty minutes later, a fitter was on site. But the performance isn't always as good when seen from an in-company viewpoint, the forthright Scot admitted to City analysts. A pump-hose he lately had delivered to his own home turned out to be leaky, and drenched him in front of the lorry driver who'd brought it. What was his employee's reaction? 'He just laughed and said: 'You're the chairman - you should see the service the customer gets'.'</p>

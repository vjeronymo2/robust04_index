			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK takeovers Tales of insider trading deals ahead of MAI's bid for Anglia Television read like the plot of a bad novel. But the Takeover Panel has again stressed the seriousness of the issue in its latest annual report. The problem was always likely to grow because of the ever-increasing complexity of bids - especially when so many are made across borders. Nowadays it is not unusual for several hundred people to be involved in preparing deals, inevitably raising the likelihood of leaks. The Takeover Panel exhorts companies to limit the number of people involved in bids to the absolute minimum. But it clearly cannot prescribe how many advisers should know about a specific deal. The onus must always be on bidding companies to ensure everyone keeps mum. After all, it is in their best interests so to do. Enterprise was badly disadvantaged in its bid for Lasmo by being forced into a premature statement when share prices started to twitch. Whether the Panel should force bidding companies into making their intentions public in this way is contentious. It could be argued that this protects the speculators most of all. It may also help prevent Aunt Agatha from trading in a false market. But that argument would carry more weight if statements were made out of market hours when private investors stand the same chance of trading the next day as professionals. The additional danger is that companies fearing takeovers could play dirty and try to force premature disclosures from bidders. The Takeover Panel should be equally aware of that danger, too.</p>

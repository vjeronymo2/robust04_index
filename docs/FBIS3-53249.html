At the same time, he stressed that understandings have  been achieved on several issues regarding the transfer of  civilian authority. On the phone from Taba is our correspondent  Netan'el Semrik:    A short time ago, the first week of the Taba talks ended.  Let us hear a statement made here a few minutes ago by the head  of the Israeli delegation, Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahaq:    [Begin Shahaq recording] Today we are concluding the talks  for this week, to my regret, because of last night's tragedy.  Most of the delegates are leaving to attend the funeral of the  Maj. Gen. Nehemya Tamari tomorrow. We had planned to be here  until tomorrow night, and we will return here next Monday [17  January] to continue the talks.    Over the past week, we continued the meetings of both the  Security and the Civilian Committees. We have not reached full  conclusion on any of the issues. We have, however, definitely  reached understandings on more than one of the civilian issues.  We will continue the negotiations in both fields next week.  [end recording]</p>

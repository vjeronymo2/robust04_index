			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEAR, CRISP SKIES DUE SUNDAY  </P> <P> The fog that enshrouded most of the Southland's coastal and intermediate  valleys the last few mornings will probably be back again today, but  forecasters say the overcast should begin moving out on Saturday, and that by  Sunday the weather should be crisp and clear.  </P> <P> Fog forced the diversion of several flights from Ontario International Airport  before dawn on Wednesday, and at least one flight was diverted on Thursday.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service issued a heavy fog warning Thursday morning for  inland highways, especially in the western San Bernardino Valley, but the  California Highway Patrol said there was no apparent increase in traffic  accidents.  </P> <P> Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts  for The Times, said the fog has been the result of a stationary low-pressure  system stalled off the coast that has been pumping cool, moist marine air  inland during the night.  </P> <P> Dittmann said this weather system should begin moving east this morning,  bringing with it a "good chance" of light drizzle in coastal, foothill and  mountain communities late tonight and early Saturday morning.  </P> <P> The weather system should be well to the east by Sunday morning, which should  dawn clear and cool with good visibility, the forecaster said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NORWEGIAN CHEF SHOWS A LIGHT AND NATURAL TOUCH IN CREATING DISHES;  </P> <P> CUISINE: ARNE BRIMI PREPARES A SPECIAL BUFFET IN LOS ANGELES TO HELP INTRODUCE  THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE EDITION OF HIS COOKBOOK.  </P> <P> Logs blazed in the fireplace, guests sipped straight shots of aquavit, and the  buffet table was laden with Norwegian salmon, roast venison and other dishes  prepared by one of Norway's leading young chefs, Arne Brimi.  </P> <P> The location, however, was not Norway but Los Angeles -- the Hancock Park home  of Norwegian Consul General Per A. Tollefsen. Brimi, 32, was there to talk  about his simple, natural approach to Norwegian cuisine and to introduce the  English-language edition of his cookbook, "A Taste of Norway."  </P> <P> "My philosophy is to keep the natural flavor. I try to show people that  everyone can do this," he said. Devoted to the outdoor life, hunting and  fishing, Brimi cooks at the Fossheim Turisthotell in Lom, Norway.  </P> <P> Like contemporary American chefs, Brimi emphasizes fresh, local ingredients and  is developing new interpretations of Norwegian cuisine while preserving old  ways of cooking. He has done this with such success that in 1985 he was named  Norway's chef of the year. Two years before, he was chosen game chef of the  year. In 1987 Brimi took part in the World Championship of Chefs in Lyon,  France. And in 1988 he was a member of the Norwegian team that won a bronze  medal at the International Culinary Olympics in Frankfurt.  </P> <P> For the Los Angeles buffet, Brimi prepared two versions of marinated raw salmon  (gravad lax), one flavored with dill and the other with juniper berries. He  also set out two styles of salmon mousse and sliced smoked salmon accompanied  by a platter of chive-topped scrambled eggs. Crisp pea pods accompanied a hot  dish of salmon in a light sauce based on salmon juices.  </P> <P> At the Fossheim Hotel, Brimi has a cure house where he hangs hams and sausages,  including venison pepperoni. Brimi brought some of the pepperoni to Los Angeles  and served it thinly sliced with a sauce of sweetened lingonberries and  aquavit. Pears stuffed with lingonberries garnished a platter of cold roast  venison, and a sauce of lingonberries and creme fraiche went with cold venison  that had been marinated with juniper, thyme, mint, red wine and red wine  vinegar.  </P> <P> Following his light and natural theme, Brimi served two fruit desserts -- pears  cooked with lingonberries and a bowlful of raspberries and strawberries topped  with caramel sauce. Both would be ideal for rich holiday dinners.  </P> <P> In Norway, a typical Christmas menu includes roast pork ribs -- not spareribs  but pork bacon with the ribs and rind attached. Dessert could be cloudberries  folded into sweetened whipped cream, Brimi said.  </P> <P> The following recipes for holiday desserts include the caramel sauce for fruit  that Brimi prepared in Los Angeles. The other recipes appear in his cookbook,  which has a section devoted to Christmas foods.  </P> <P> "A Taste of Norway" was initially published in Norway two years ago by the  Norwegian University Press.

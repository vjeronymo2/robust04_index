			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mirror benefits Market whispers that the Sun might be preparing a retreat from the current newspaper price war battle gave a big lift to Mirror Group Newspapers shares. Some traders said they understood that Mr Rupert Murdoch's flagship tabloid was preparing to raise its cover price by 2p to 22p. News International, the Sun's UK parent, flatly denied the talk but refused to comment on the length of time it intended to maintain its current stance. However, media analysts said the move would make sense as the Sun had achieved its goal of boosting circulation back above 4m and every penny off the cover price is a significant blow to profits. Hoare Govett estimates that, assuming maintained circulation, each penny reduction knocks Pounds 13.1m off full-year profits, which came in last year at Pounds 139m for the whole group. Mirror Group was also helped by news that Mercury Asset Management had raised its stake in the company to 19.01 per cent and that forecasts for national advertising expenditure had risen sharply. The stock ended 7 better at 138p on significant turnover of 5m. News International slipped a penny to 228p.</p>

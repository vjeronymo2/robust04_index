Spacek said that according to Goncz, Hungary does not see  the  Partnership for Peace as a substitute for membership, but rather  as an open opportunity for everyone. He also admitted the  possibility of individual admission into NATO for Central and  Eastern European countries. The two presidents agreed, Spacek  said, that it is necessary to emphasize the stability of the  region, which they consider a condition for carrying out the  Partnership for Peace.    Havel and Goncz assured each other that in the near future,  experts from both countries would set up contacts with NATO  military representatives on preparing the initiative. On the  topic of bilateral relations, the two presidents agreed that  they are interested in deepening economic and other cooperation.  Czech and Hungarian Foreign Ministers Josef Zieleniec and Geza  Jeszenszky also participated in the talks.</p>

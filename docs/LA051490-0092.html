			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES  </P> <P> Inroads for Blacks in Show Biz  </P> <P> The appointment calendars of blacks in Hollywood are suddenly getting very full  these days with the recent formation of two groups geared toward helping them  increase their clout within the entertainment community.  </P> <P> On May 2, about 100 lawyers, actresses, producers and film and record  executives attended the second meeting of the Black Entertainment Alliance,  whose goal is to "maximize (blacks') impact and potential for empowerment  within the music, film, television radio and video industry," said organizer  Anthony J. Tolbert, business affairs manager at MCA Records.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, 100 people attended the first meeting of the African-American Film  &amp; Television Assn. Saturday at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Robert Dockery Jr., co-founder of the latter group and president of his own  production company, said there are enough problems facing blacks in the  entertainment industry for both organizations to work on.  </P> <P> Citing the success of actor Eddie Murphy, filmmaker Spike Lee and TV talk show  hosts Oprah Winfrey and Arsenio Hall, Dockery said: "I think blacks are feeling  for the first time in many years a sense of hope that they can be a productive  part of the industry."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Register With Tech Ring  </P> <P> Can a fellow who once wandered around barefoot and was reputed to bathe  irregularly make it into the social register? Absolutely, if his name is Steven  P. Jobs and it's Stewart Alsop's "Social Register of the Personal Computer  Industry" that we're talking about.  </P> <P> Jobs, co-founder of the personal computer pioneer Apple, is just one of 650  corporate and industry leaders whom Alsop handpicked to be in the premier copy  of the $295 book that debuted May 1. The book is an adjunct to Alsop's regular  P.C. Newsletter that is published in Redwood City, Calif.  </P> <P> Unlike other registers that list the pedigree of its entrants, Alsop's offers  the kind of information that is the currency of the Information Age:  direct-line telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, the names and phone numbers  of assistants and, if you need to bypass all assistants entirely, their  electronic mail box listings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Fakes for Mom, Please  </P> <P> Giorgio Beverly Hills certainly took Mother's Day very seriously this year.  </P> <P> So seriously, in fact, that it ran special newspaper ads last week in 24 cities  to warn about fake fragrances -- under the Giorgio label -- made by  counterfeiters.  </P> <P> "Due to our increased awareness of counterfeit products being sold under our  name," the ad said, "we can only guarantee the authenticity of Giorgio Beverly  Hills products bought in authorized department and specialty stores."  </P> <P> Why all the hubbub? More fragrances are sold around Mother's Day than any other  time, except Christmas. "We want to educate the consumer about the seriousness  of the problem," said Michael Gould, Giorgio's chief executive.  </P></p>

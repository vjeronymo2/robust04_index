Scalfaro, looking ahead to the opening of the twelfth  legislature of the republic, declared, "I think this Parliament  has the right to work with tranquillity, to do well and do  much." The people of Italy "expect much" of the new houses he  said and went on to name the weighty issues of institutional  reform, the battle against unemployment and monetary policy.  The head of state said he felt it his duty to now break the  silence he had kept during the campaign to speak out with "a  truly great word of admiration for the Italian people who have",  he said, given "great democratic testimony to themselves, to  Europe, to the world."    After referring to the new electoral law and the string of  business and political corruption scandals which decimated the  ruling political parties over the past two years, since the  general election of April 1992, Scalfaro noted that the crucial  Sunday [27 March] and Monday vote also marked "the exit from the  scene of a series of figures even of the foremost rank, the  birth of new and recent movements." All this, he added,  "certainly represented a stage of great significance after that  of the referendum, another stage of great importance," with  reference to the national vote of April last year which forced  the change in the electoral law.    Driving home his main point, the head of state reiterated,  "There is need for stability, for great solidarity" and said he  himself, above the fray, could hope for the commitment of the  new Parliament "to one thing: the interest of this, our Italy."    On the institutional steps ahead of the inaugural session of  the new Parliament, set for April 15, Cabinet Undersecretary  Antonio Maccanico told newsmen that, the government led by  Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, in office since the end of April  last year, will remain in office until a new administration is  formed. "Before the new houses are convened, the cabinet will  meet to consider law decrees requiring government mandates  connected to the budget. These decrees will, obviously, be  examined by the new Parliament," he added.    On what is in the wings, Democratic Party of the Left leader  Achille Occhetto declared, "The vote was clear, it gave the  majority to the right. According to me, the president must give  the mandate to the one mainly responsible for the right-wing  front, that is, Berlusconi." Interviewed on the news program on  the public radio and television corporation's third channel, the  head of the party around which the Progressive Coalition battled  against the Berlusconi's Freedom Front added, "Then we'll see  whether Berlusconi is able to form a government on the platform  and the plan of relations with his allies. If he's not able,  we'll see later on."    Occhetto went on to speak of the need now for unity and  said,  "The Democratic Party of the Left had a splendid result and is  at the service of all in this direction, for the expansion of  all the others."    Moving over to another RAI interview, the party leader said  the right is self-sufficient and should be able to stand on its  own and promised "a severe, clear and precise opposition" from  the left benches and work for "the creation of conditions for an  alternative government."    On the failure of the Progressives to top the right at the  polls, Occhetto said, "I'm not blaming myself too much. We  faced the general election in the same way we faced the  administrative vote. There was an element of surprise. The  speedy organization achieved with all the company instruments of  the new political component acted as a glue for two different  right-wings. This effect went beyond our expectations," he  added.    A key factor in the staying in power of Berlusconi's Freedom  Front, the outspoken Northern League leader Umberto Bossi,  applied a farming metaphor in saying issues were now on  "shifting soil" whereas his League is the only force which is  "compact enough within" to work for change.    The man who sounded a sour note in the midst of victory  hurrahs on the right last night, in saying he did not want to  see Berlusconi in the premier's office and would never align the  League in government with the neo-Fascist "lynch mob," said  today that his alignment is the only one capable of "giving the  country a government." Speaking in his stronghold in Milan,  Bossi declared, "An enormous political responsibility has been  laid on the shoulders of the League. We have to form a  government and the only political force which is the elite in  government at this time is the League. Now we are going to deal.  We will take the first steps already in the upcoming 24 hours,"  added Berlusconi's ally in the north. He also warned, "If the  press pushes for government formation, we have the duty to go  forward with feet of lead because we are on shifting soil" and,  he added, "if someone goes on a shopping trip in the League, I  remind him we are compact and monolithic."    On the right, Giancarlo Fini, who steered his neo-Fascist  MSI  [Italian Social Movement] out of a political cul-de-sac to  become the National Alliance in league with Berlusconi, spoke of  the need for detente with Bossi in telling a press conference of  his two conditions for reaching a government-forming  understanding "based on documents and not on ideological  slogans."    First, said Fini, is "the impossibility" of a League member  to become premier "because the League is an expression of a  geographic area and not the entire nation." Second is that the  mandate go to Berlusconi, "at least in the initial phase."  Questioned on his "intellectual differences" with the League  leader, Fini quipped, "Never use the adjective 'intellectual'  with reference to Bossi."</p>

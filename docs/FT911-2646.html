			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Letter: A misleading link in the debate over capital requirements Sir, With the banking industry still dominated by the conviction that 'Too Big To Fail' rules, Paul Collins' argument for market-based bank capital requirements ('Prescription for a financial ailment', April 24) is particularly valuable. As he says, 'Less capital is not better. Nor is more capital.' The amount of capital needed is that which convinces risk-exposed investors and depositors to invest and deposit. It is misleading, however, to bracket the US with the EC in the debate over limiting the extent of government guarantees to depositors. The US, even in the wake of the savings and loans disaster, continues to concentrate on limiting the quantum of the guarantee, while leaving 100 per cent cover intact. The EC's plans are still under discussion but there is every hope that its proposals for a harmonised scheme will restrict cover to well below 100 per cent of whatever quantum is selected - as does the UK system. Only thus can the depositor discipline, which Mr Collins seeks, be achieved. It is surprising also to meet such enthusiasm for formula based capital requirements from an exponent of market discipline. The evidence is that the new, undiscriminating, 'credit risk' based system is risk-generative and any workable market risk add-on is likely to be so simplistic as to achieve the same result. Mr Collins' basic premise needs no such artificial support. If depositors can be convinced that they are at least partly at risk, the market will make capital requirements, imposed by supervisors, obsolete. Banks will vie with each other to demonstrate how well capitalised and risk averse they have become. On the other hand, if the US revision of deposit insurance leaves 100 per cent cover intact - at whatever level - the US taxpayer had better start saving up for a repeat performance.

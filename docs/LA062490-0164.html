			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS PROGRAMS FAILING GROUPS AT HIGHEST RISK  </P> <P> There is growing evidence that prevention programs aimed at stopping the spread  of the AIDS virus are failing to influence many of those at highest risk, and  experts say the reasons include a lack of imaginative approaches and a kind of  societal failure of nerve.  </P> <P> At a time when the course of the epidemic is shifting toward drug users, women,  adolescents and younger gay men, experts say the reluctance to design explicit  prevention programs specifically for those groups has left the next generation  dangerously vulnerable to infection. In interviews and presentations last week,  prevention specialists discussed the way that public policies and private  attitudes have contributed to the failure to unravel ingrained patterns of  sexual behavior and drug use among certain groups.  </P> <P> "There's been an American tradition of not talking about sex in explicit detail  . . . and of providing very inadequate health care for people with  substance-abuse problems," said Don C. Des Jarlais of Mt. Sinai School of  Medicine in New York City. "AIDS has upped the ante for those traditions."  </P> <P> It has been known for seven years that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  is spread through sex and through the exchange of blood by injection.  Nevertheless, 40,000 to 80,000 Americans are still becoming infected each year  with the lethal virus, federal estimates suggest.  </P> <P> In the absence of the ability to vaccinate people against the virus, health  officials and social-service groups have put their faith in education and  prevention -- an array of programs that includes counseling and testing,  public-service campaigns, school programs, street outreach and promotion of  condoms.  </P> <P> In some cases, prevention has been successful: The rate of new infections among  older gay men in large cities has plummeted. That is evidence, experts say,  that it is indeed possible to change that most mysterious and instinctive form  of behavior, human sexuality.  </P> <P> But research presented here at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS  offered ominous proof that, in other areas, prevention is failing, and that  many women, teen-agers and drug users continue to engage in unsafe forms of sex  and drug use and are being infected at rising rates.  </P> <P> For example, despite evidence that more and more intravenous drug users in San  Francisco say they avoid sharing or using dirty syringes, a federal study found  little change in other cities. And everywhere, researchers have found high  rates of unprotected sex among drug users and their partners.  </P> <P> Similarly, researchers reported scant use of condoms among teen-agers and women  of child-bearing age. And a study of young gay men in medium-sized West Coast  cities found that 43% had practiced unprotected anal intercourse, one of the  riskiest forms of sex, in the previous six months.  </P> <P> "What it says is new people are entering this pool and they are considering  themselves invulnerable," said Thomas J. Coates of the Center for AIDS  Prevention Studies at UC San Francisco. Coates and others criticized existing  prevention efforts as insufficiently explicit or intensive.  </P> <P> One difficulty is that the epidemic is not monolithic, said Dr. Alan Hinman of  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. It is many epidemics spreading  differently in different groups, each group having "unique social and  psychological characteristics . . . and patterns and standards of behavior."  </P> <P> For example, white and minority drug users often behave differently. Some use  different methods of injection, some share syringes with strangers instead of  friends. Prevention programs therefore must address different types of risk;  some alternatives will appeal to some groups and not to others.  </P> <P> Similarly, the sexual relationships of white and minority women are often  different. A woman's role in a relationship will determine how she can  negotiate safer sex. Young gay men may not identify with older gay men and  therefore may not respond to messages tailored to older men.  </P> <P> But the problem is not simply the complexity of the epidemic and the  inscrutable subtleties of behavior, researchers said. They also blamed societal  wishful thinking -- the belief that it is enough to tell people how the virus  is spread without giving them accessible tools to avoid it.  </P> <P> The researchers contended that it is unrealistic to ask many teen-agers to  simply avoid sex; they need to learn communication skills required to negotiate  safe sex. As Coates puts it, you don't teach a teen-ager to drive by telling  him how a car engine works; you put him in a car and show him.  </P> <P> Intravenous drug users, too, are often denied the tools to avoid infection,  researchers said. Public policies restricting access to addiction treatment  programs and sterile syringes have left many users with information about AIDS  risk but without realistic and immediate ways of avoiding it.  </P> <P> "Policies that impair condom or bleach distribution because they might lead to  increases in sexual activity or drug use ignore the data," Coates said in a  speech at the conference. "There are no data to support the adverse effects of  these programs."  </P> <P> "Prevention has to be a lot more than information," said Robert Battjes, of the  National Institute on Drug Abuse, in an interview. "To bring about behavior  change requires a great deal of intense effort. . . . We've got to be in there  intervening over and over again."  </P> <P> Ultimately, behavioral scientists agree that widespread behavior change is  impossible without changing social and community norms -- not unlike the way  public-health campaigns against smoking over the last two decades have changed  the image of cigarettes from glamorous to anti-social.  </P> <P> For that reason, they called for education and prevention programs that change  the way people feel about high-risk behavior -- for example, by making safer  sex seem not a poor substitute for the real thing but erotic, normal and  perhaps even patriotic.  </P> <P> They pointed to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation's controversial bus-shelter  poster showing a young, gay couple -- smiling, naked, holding up a condom and  draped in the flag. Above them, the slogan reads, "Life, liberty and the  pursuit of happiness."  </P> <P> Related STORIES: A3, A24  </P></p>

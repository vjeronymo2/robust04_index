The offer is two ordinary Aminex shares for every 11 Tuskar shares. Dealings in Aminex 5p ordinary shares were temporarily suspended yesterday at 6p in London and in Dublin at the company's request. The Aminex board said it would not proceed with the offer if Tuskar proceeds with its acquisition from Bula Resources of certain North Sea licence interests - principally a 0.90628 per cent interest in the Buchan Oil Field. Aminex is urging Tuskar shareholders to vote against the deal at the annual meeting. Aminex said the Buchan oil field was in decline and that abandonment liabilities attaching to the Buchan oil field's wells, platform and subsea pipelines when production ceased, were likely to become the responsibility of Tuskar in relation to the interest which it planned to acquire. Aminex believes that its growth potential far exceeds Tuskar's prospects and consequently the offer does not include any premium element. It is an Irish registered oil exploration and production company incorporated in 1979,</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference granted by President Eduardo Frei Tagle to </F> local and foreign journalists at La Moneda Palace on 13 March,  moderated by unidentified government official -- live]    [Excerpts] [Moderator] Manuel Maria Mesiger, of Madrid EFE.    [Mesiger] Mr. President, among the pending issues inherited  from the previous government are human rights, political reform,  and border conflict. Which do you regard as the most difficult  and which will you tackle first?    [Frei] Are you referring in general or to problems with a  specific country?    [Mesiger] In general.    [Frei] Well, in general, I believe that all of the issues  you  have mentioned are important. Human rights, border conflicts,  well, I do not think any has precedence over the others. The  subjects are quite varied because with border conflicts, for  example, we have made various degrees of progress with bordering  countries. We have made considerable progress during the past  years and will continue to do so. As for human rights, one of  the key and priority issues -- and the handling of this subject  was one of the achievements of President Aylwin's government --  as our government program states and according to our moral  beliefs, is that it is an unavoidable subject in a democracy  like ours. The human rights issue will be contemplated in all  our government actions -- that is, in the amending or  improvement of our laws -- as will field of education and  respect for all international treaties on the issue. I believe  I already said this is my speech last night, but Chile has a  tradition in the human rights field that we will consolidate and  strengthen.    [Moderator] Pilar Rodriguez, Megavision.    [Rodriguez] Mr. President. One criticism of the previous  administration was that it was not firm enough against cases of  corruption. You, however, said yesterday you would be very firm  in this regard. I would like to know if your firmness will  prevail over the political cost it may represent for the  political parties that support you.    [Frei] First, corruption in the public administration is a  problem that currently plagues any modern society. We know of  several governments that have been ousted due to corruption in  the political system. Chile is not immune to these dangers. We  are not an island in the world. We have clearly stated that  Chile has never been plagued by generalized corruption, there  have been some irregular actions, but I absolutely agree with  the measures taken by President Aylwin's government on the  subject, such as the case of Codelco [Copper Corporation] right  from the start. We want to reassert the necessary firmness with  which a government must act in this regard. It is not just a  question of making amendments or the use of legal tools, it is a  subject we can discuss with the opposition because it is a  national issue. As I stated last night, it is a matter of  attitude of the government servants. I want to establish a line  to be followed, as I stated last night, and I will follow it  right from the beginning and will demand that it be followed by  all my aides, be they mayors, governors, heads of services, or  representatives of public enterprises, etc. The entire state  apparatus. We will act firmly because we are aware that when  corruption sets in it is very difficult to eradicate. We will  act with firmness, no matter the political cost it may represent.    [Rodriguez] Even if this means dismissing servants guilty of  corruption.    [Frei] Definitely. I will not hesitate. We must act...  [pauses]... I think I have already proven this in some cases  before assuming the presidency. [passage omitted]    [Moderator] Carlos Briones, Deutsche Welle.    [Briones] Mr. President. Not long ago in Valdivia, two  outstanding Latin American geopolitical experts -- General  (Augustin Toro Davila), Chilean, and General (Edgardo Mercado  Jarin) -- pointed out the need for regional integration. The  fact that two geopolitical experts made such a remark took  people by surprise. I would like to now what line your  government will follow, especially regarding what has been  called the mega-project?    [Frei] Are we referring to Latin American regional  integration?    [Briones] Yes.    [Frei] The Chilean economy is currently open to the world.  Our priorities lie in the rest of the world. During the past  few years, practically one third of Chilean exports went to  Pacific Asia, one third to the American continent, and the other  third to the European Union. This has gradually changed during  the past years and now practically one fourth of our relations  are with Latin America. Therefore, without forgetting the  Chilean presence in the markets, this is reflected by our  participation in APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] --  within a few days, next week to be precise, the finance minister  will attend an APEC meeting. This will be the first time our  finance minister has officially attended an APEC finance  ministers meeting. By the end of the year, in Indonesia, we  hope to fully participate in this organization. At the same  time we are also present in the U.S. market. Everyone is aware  of our viewpoint regarding free trade agreements and NAFTA. We  are also continuing to strengthen our relationship with Europe,  the European Union, that has been a traditional Chilean friend  in all fields -- and from where our cultural roots and  civilization come.    Without neglecting all I have just mentioned, we want to  place special emphasis on Latin American integration. I said  this in my speech yesterday, we also discussed the subject  during the luncheon on 11 March with the visiting presidents.  Chile has cooperation agreements with practically every Latin  American country, with the sole exception of three countries  with which we are working on the issue. We do not only want to  work on the economic, commercial, and political aspects of the  integration of our nations, we also want to work on the  educational aspect. I have already informed the visiting  presidents that there is a UNESCO program, sponsored by the UN  Development Program, to begin deep-rooted changes in the  education, culture, learning, and teaching program for our  people. We want to carry out this program in the next few years  with other Latin American countries. This is our neighborhood,  our environment, where we share similar culture, a language, and  I think there is still a lot to be done in this field. This  development will allow us to compete in the great world groups  and to improve the living standards of our people. In Chile's  case, this significant increase in our commercial relations with  Latin American countries mostly involves manufactured goods, not  just raw materials as in the case of our relations with the  great powers. Therefore, we are going to place special emphasis  in this field. We are also talking about what has been called  open regionalism, which does not seek agreements that will close  Latin American doors to the rest of the world, but rather opens  them to the world community.    [Moderator] Maria Jose Errazuriz, EL MERCURIO.    [Errazuriz] Mr. President, when you were choosing the  members  of you cabinet, the Socialist Party complained about a lack of  communication with you and later talked about the need to  establish the new role for the member parties of the Coalition  of Parties for Democracy [CPPD] under your government. What role  will you give the CPPD member parties during your administration  and do you think this is the end of coalition as Senator Adolfo  Zaldivar stated?    [Frei] I am just starting my presidential term. During the  campaign and these past few days I have without doubt maintained  an incredibly fluid relationship with the CPPD member parties.  We are working with them, we have exchanged views, we have a  government program, we must continue working united and this is  what we are going to do. The situation of each party is,  obviously, different from what it was in 1989. The parties are  now more consolidated and organized. Together with the  ministers of the political sector we have established a strategy  and modus operandi to work with the parties throughout my  administration.    As for the coalition, as I stated last night, I believe the  president's authority plays an important role. All member  parties fully respect presidential decisions. Obviously, when  you have to elect 300, 400, 500, 600 government servants there  will always be someone not satisfied with the appointment. I  feel that my appointments have taken into account the political  balance and also respected excellence and the presence of the  various Chilean personalities. We will continue to work on this  with the political parties.    [Moderator] Luis Alvarez, REUTERS.    [Alvarez] Mr. President, I want to ask a question that may  sound rather repetitive. General [Augusto] Pinochet continues  to be controversial abroad and each time you were asked about  him, in your capacity as candidate and president-elect, you said  you would state your position regarding his presence as Army  commander after assuming the presidency. Although principles  are involved, I would like to know whether you, as President  Aylwin did at the beginning of his mandate, will ask Pinochet to  step down as Army commander because there is no reason for him  to continue in that post.    [Frei] The situation is quite clear. The commanders of the  Armed Forces, who assumed their posts shortly before President  Aylwin assumed the presidency -- according to the law and the  Constitution -- have the right to remain in their posts until  1997. I will respect the Constitution and the laws and, as we  have always stated, work to reach a consensus so that future  Chilean presidents will recover their authority to appoint the  Armed Forces commanders. This is the case in every world  democracy and this is a principle we will always uphold. As I  said last night, relationships in a state situation must be  impersonal. This is not a matter of personal choice, it is a  matter of impersonal relations within a state and we will work  on this guideline with the Armed Forces. Since I assumed this  position, our relationship has been incredibly fluid and we will  discuss the great subjects and the role the Armed Forces must  play in Chile after the year 2000.    [Moderator] Pablo Honorado, Channel 13 Television.    [Honorado] Mr. President, just before ending his mandate,  Former President Aylwin pardoned some individuals sentenced to  life for the attack on General Pinochet's motorcade during which  five of his bodyguards died. Yesterday Pinochet said he was  upset by the decision but that he respected it because it was  the president's prerogative. Right now there are some 70  prisoners charged with terrorist attacks. You have the  prerogative to pardon them. Will you do so if they request it?    [Frei] There is no policy established for pardoning  prisoners. I respect, have respected, and will continue to  respect and support all of President Aylwin's decisions. It is  a prerogative granted to the president by the Constitution and  the law and, in this specific case, it was a prerogative granted  him by Congress through an initiative of the opposition. I  reiterate, there is no policy on the subject. It is a case by  case decision. Each case must be assessed and exhaustively  studied separately. This is the way I will handle the subject.    [Moderator] Veronica Munoz, Radio Nacional.    [Munoz] President Frei, police actions -- in practice not in  theory -- during arrests, hold ups, and demonstrations  throughout Aylwin's administration were strongly criticized.  What does your government intend to do to avoid abuses that,  unavoidably, represent violations of human rights?    [Frei] As I stated at the beginning, our government will  always respect human rights, but we are also going to clearly  respect the authority, laws, as well as the police institutions.  Anarchy begins when there is no authority and, therefore, you  can only follow one single guideline in this regard. It is up  to the court to pass judgment on cases of violations of human  rights or abuse. We will clearly respect human rights, the  Constitution, the law, the legal procedures established by the  various institutions to safeguard public order and, thus, avoid  any sign of violence or terrorism in our society.    [Moderator] Ted Cordoba, Bolivian daily ULTIMA HORA.    [Cordoba] Regarding your interest in trade with neighboring  countries and regional integration, there are currently two  great projects: One is already underway between Bolivia and  Peru in the port of Ilo, and the other is a project you have in  mind to establish a development center in Arica. My first  question is, if the three countries regard these as competitive  projects, could they not establish a great port between Ilo and  Arica that will benefit the entire Latin American continent,  including Brazil, on the Pacific? My second question is: Please  expand your comment that following the visit to Chile of Ximena  Sanchez de Lozada [the Bolivian president's wife] there will be  talks on Bolivia's landlocked situation.    [Frei] Thank you for your question because, first, I want to  thank the Bolivian president for his gesture of asking his wife  to attend the presidential inauguration ceremony as an  expression of friendship -- not just with me but with the entire  Chilean people. We will continue to work on this subject, we  will enhance the significant progress we have already made.  Last October, during the meeting of the Rio Group, I had a long  chat with Bolivian President [Gonzalo] Sanchez de Lozada. We  discussed how to progress in every field of common interest.  There are many cooperation and infrastructure projects. With  determination and courage we will progress in these fields. I  want to paraphrase what President Sanchez de Lozada said when he  visited Chile: We will help Bolivia join the world. All the  projects you have mentioned fit in here. We have infrastructure  projects underway, we are building highways, we must improve our  railway services, and we must continue to progress in the  bioceanic integration route. In Northern Chile we have two or  three alternatives, we have others in Central Chile, and during  our chats over these past days with the visiting presidents,  especially with the Uruguayan president, we discussed the  possibility of establishing bioceanic routes, a tunnel, etc. We  have a great number of alternatives to improve physical  investments that will contribute to the integration of our  countries. We can make a lot of progress and we have the  commitment and approval of our governments and people to do so.    [Moderator] Jose Miguel Alfaro. Television Nacional de  Chile.    [Alfaro] Mr. President, you said yesterday that Chile is a  reconciled country. Yet there are numerous cases of violation  of human rights during the military regime that remain  unclarified and unjudged. What do you propose so that those  Chileans who still pine for their loved ones who were lost under  the military regime may, some day, with their mind in peace  shake hands, and look the military men -- who still do not admit  their crimes -- in the eye.    [Frei] One of the great achievements and successes of  President Aylwin's government has been to progress in national  reconciliation. This was his priority task, as he mentioned in  this first speech at the National Stadium when he assumed the  presidency. This has been reflected in many initiatives --  starting with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and  followed by a series of legal initiatives regarding reparation  for the victims -- about which we are all aware. Truth and  justice must never be yield in this regard. It is an unwavering  path. We can now say we know the truth but we can also say that  there are still cases for which justice has not been  implemented. My government will support and cooperate, with all  our effort and dedication, to enable the courts to conclude  outstanding cases, establish the truth, and implement justice.  This is necessary to complete Chile's reconciliation process.  I would like to quote from [Santiago Bishop] Msgr. Oviedo's  sermon yesterday, which was greatly commentated and applauded by  all Chilean sectors. He said, quote, without an inner decision  to reach reconciliation, no political or administrative power  can make it happen. Moreover, without efficient courts that  recognizes each and everyone's dignity, this inner decision will  falter and die. We must continue to tread on the chosen path  without risking all we have achieved so far, unquote. I feel  this phrase reflects the current feeling.    [Alfaro] Does your government have a concrete initiative, a  specific gesture, for concluding pending cases?    [Frei] Well, once we settle in, the new justice minister  will  contact the Supreme Court to cooperate and seek all mechanisms  to speed up these cases. [passage omitted]    [Moderator] Orlando Milessi, ANSA.    [Milessi] Mr. President, one of the concrete objectives of  your program is to fight extreme poverty. It has been said that  about 1 million Chileans will have been pulled out extreme  poverty by the end of your government. You said yesterday it  was time to end the rhetoric regarding poverty, about which so  much has been said. How do you propose to fight extreme  poverty? Where will you obtain the funds for this? Why was  nothing said about the crusade against poverty?    [Frei] Well, as you know one of the priorities of our  government is to fight poverty. We believe it was a priority of  the Aylwin government, and that great progress was made in this  field. In early 1990 an agreement on tax reform was reached  which provided additional income to fight poverty. This tax  reform was renewed last year thus allowing us to fight poverty  without causing a fiscal deficit, inflation, or upset the  macroeconomic balance. Regarding specific actions, first I will  preside over the social intraministry committee to fight  poverty. I will personally preside over this committee. I have  been working on this project with the ministers of the area to  come up with concrete proposal. We believe this subject is of  national importance and, therefore, are will invite private  sector organizations, like the Hogar de Cristo and similar  organizations that are in permanent contact with the poorest  sectors. We will invite all nongovernment organizations, the  commercial and production sectors, etc., and all Chilean sectors  because we believe this is a priority national issue. We will  permanently emphasize this subject and I believe that -- more  than just talking -- we need to know what to do, how to do what  is necessary, how to make the state apparatus more efficient,  how to control expenditures and investments in the poor sectors  and ensure they reach the people. Many times the money gets  never reaches its final destination due to the excessive red  tape, etc. We will work on this right from the beginning with  decisions and efforts of the entire state apparatus. [passage  omitted]    [Moderator] Persio Dalvel, Concepcion daily EL SUR.    [Dalvel] Mr. President. You have expressed the need to give  preferential treatment to the poverty problem. How do you  ratify that priority with the recent purchase of weapons for the  Army and the belief that the Armed Forces must be constantly  modernized?    [Frei] I firmly believe that there is no arms race nor that  the Chilean Armed Forces are purchasing new equipment. They are  merely replacing very ancient equipment. For example, the  Chilean Air Force wants to replace its Hawker Hunter planes that  are 25-30 years old and are no longer operational. We want our  Armed Forces to safeguard the country's integrity. Chile does  not have a bellicose attitude. We uphold peace and the  purchases Chile makes fall within that context: To protect our  territorial integrity and sovereignty. We will continue to work  in this direction. I do not see our struggle against poverty as  incompatible with an Armed Forces capable of responding to this  criteria which, as I have already said, is not bellicose but  rather for peace. [passage omitted]    [Moderator] Daniel Mazzone, EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO, of  Uruguay.    [Mazzone] Mr. President, you have just spoken of your  meetings with presidents of other countries, and you mentioned  Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle. He has said the  agenda included a highway that will cross Brazil down to Colonia  [Uruguay] and across the Colonia-Buenos Aires bridge. President  Lacalle proposes that the highway reaches Chile, thus giving  Chilean products access to the Atlantic. I would like to know  Chilean expectations in this regard, and if there are any  chances for the project.    [Frei] The bioceanic highway is a high priority in various  Chilean regions. During my campaign I was involved in several  conversations, even major meetings, that addressed this subject  in northern Chile last year.    Our country extends more than 4,000 km. In each region I was  asked for connection with Argentina, Bolivia, and other  neighboring countries.    These countries have their priorities about the routes to be  chosen. I attended a meeting in Iquique, for example, with  delegations of governors and mayors of southern Peru, Bolivia,  northern Argentina, Brazil, and even Uruguay, during which the  priorities on this subject were discussed.    Consequently, we cannot meet all of the demands and  implement  all of the initiatives. We have priorities and we will analyze  them from the viewpoint of Chile, to see how private investment  can participate in those projects, because they are large  projects. Chile has a law permitting concessions and the  participation of the private sector in the construction of  infrastructure.    President Lacalle and I talked about this bioceanic highway,  which in the case of Chile would require not only a study but  construction of a bridge that could operate all year round,  according to our current flow of passenger and cargo. This  deeply interests us and will receive careful consideration.  [passage omitted]    [Moderator] Ana Maria Ojeda, daily LA NACION.    [Ojeda] Mr. President, when you disclosed the members of  your  cabinet, you named former Senator Mario Papi as coordinator  between the Legislative and Executive Branches. I would like to  known what specific functions do you have in mind for him?    [Frei] The functions for former Senator Papi are not  functions for former Senator Papi. The debate has become  personalized. I am not seeking a post for former Senator Papi,  nor am I seeking a post for social democrats. I am creating a  post I deem necessary. Why? Because I was a member of Congress  and know what Congress is all about. I believe a fluid  relationship between the president of the Republic and the  legislators is very necessary. During the past few days I met  with practically all legislators and explained to them why I  created this post. We will establish the legal status of this  post, but he will work with me. He is working to establish a  fluid an permanent relationship between the president of the  Republic and more than 167 legislators. I want legislators to  be in permanent contact with the president, I want to maintain a  fluid relationship with them. I have experienced Congress and  believe this function is very important. Everyone agrees and in  the next few days we will establish the legal status for this  post. As of tomorrow Mario Papi will be doing this job which I  regard as essential. [passage omitted]    [Moderator] Guillermo Espinoza, Chilean daily EL SIGLO.    [Espinoza] Mr. President, I would like to know if your role  as commander of the Armed Forces, and the Armed Forces role as  guarantors of institutional order -- as stated in the  Constitution -- are compatible. If not, what can be done to  solve this problem?    [Frei] In my speech last night, I clearly stated I will be  president of all Chileans and the head of the Armed Forces as a  symbol of national unity. Article No. 32 of the Constitution,  Clauses 18 to 22 or 17 to 20 I think, list the duties and powers  of the president of the Republic. They are also mentioned in  other parts of the Constitution. I will follow these  guidelines. There are some legal and constitutional amendments  that I consider necessary so that these articles may be fully  implemented. For example, in the case of the appointment of the  commanders in chief, one article establishes that the president  is empowered to remove the commanders in chief and also has a  say in the promotion and retirement of Armed Forces members.  There are, however, other articles complementing this specific  article which prevent the president from exercising that power.  As I have stated before, we will continue to work on this  because we believe it is part of the effort to fully implement  democracy and what is the case in Chile today: to have the  president of the Republic fully respected, to have the Armed  Forces subordinated to the political power that has been  democratically elected by the people, and to have the government  respect the professional and nondeliberative role of the Armed  Forces. Our relations are, and will be, based on this. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa by Enzo </F> Cirillo in Rome; date not given: "Silvio, All Those Lies..."]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [Cirillo] Minister, are you upset by the  accusation that [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi made during the  debate with [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary]  Occhetto, namely, that you are a liar and that you provided  misleading figures concerning the state's accounts?    [Spaventa] Of course, and what I found most offensive was  the  way this lie was presented...    [Cirillo] The prime minister answered for you...    [Spaventa] Ciampi did a very commendable thing. His  solidarity made me very happy. I am very grateful to him for  what he did. [Spaventa ends]    Thus Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa broke the interview  "truce" earlier than expected. He made himself available to  answer questions. He even lost some of that self-control which  occasionally made him unsympathetic to many people. He spoke,  explained, joked.    [Cirillo] What would you have replied to Berlusconi had you  been in Occhetto's place?    [Spaventa] I would have simply answered the substance of the  question -- namely, that the gap between the forecasts and the  real situation must be blamed on the recession.    [Cirillo] In any case, the general state accountant's  calculations were wrong.    [Spaventa] (The minister, who, when speaking on television  and in the latest episodes of this electoral campaign, has  resurrected a slightly more marked Roman accent than usual,  stated:) I already explained the situation. The calculations  were only partly mistaken. As regards two-thirds of the gap --  some 10 trillion lire -- this was due to recession, which caused  a reduction in public income. As regards the remaining 5  trillion, clearly miscalculation was involved. This  miscalculation, however, was smaller than last year's, when the  gap was estimated at 15 trillion. Also this year's figures for  the first quarter, which were somewhat puzzling to tell you the  truth, did not help us at all to outline a precise picture for  the lira.    [Cirillo] In order to counter your line of defense,  Berlusconi referred to a CORRIERE DELLA SERA article by Mario  Monti, the rector of the Bocconi school, who spoke of the need  for a 20 trillion package to balance public accounts in 1994.    [Spaventa] I have gone through all my calculations again,  and  I have written a letter to CORRIERE, challenging my friend  Monti's figures. A 20 trillion package is not needed to balance  the state's accounts; I am more than ever convinced of this.  Monti's calculations are wrong, and his figures bear no  relationship to reality. I believe Monti's figures are very  questionable. [passage omitted]</p>

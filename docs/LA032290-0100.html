			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS PETITION TO RETAIN KOREAN LIAISON;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE MONEY, ABC DISTRICT OFFICIALS PLAN TO REASSIGN  THE POPULAR ADMINISTRATOR.  </P> <P> More than 100 Korean parents filled the ABC Unified School District board room  this week to protest the district's plans to reassign its only Korean  administrator, whom they say provides a crucial link between them, their  children and the school system.  </P> <P> The parents Tuesday presented school officials with petitions urging that  Howard Kwon be retained as coordinator of special programs rather than be  assigned to a classroom to teach. The petitions contained 350 signatures.  </P> <P> Kwon, 53, has been the special programs coordinator for 10 years. He is a  liaison between immigrant parents who speak limited English, the district's  1,600 Korean students and the school system.  </P> <P> "Many of the parents do not speak English," Kwon said. They do not understand  the culture, which causes a lot of conflicts between them and their children.  They come to me for help." Kwon said he also helps resolve conflicts between  the Korean youths and those of other cultures in the 20,000-student district,  which serves the cities of Cerritos, Artesia, Lakewood, Hawaiian Gardens and  part of Norwalk.  </P> <P> Kwon said that he will quit rather than return to the classroom to teach  English or social studies. The reassignment also would result in a pay cut of  about $15,000 a year, he said.  </P> <P> ABC school officials said Kwon's reassignment, which would take effect in the  fall, is part of an effort to trim about $5.7 million from the ABC district  budget over the next three years.  </P> <P> Kwon's position is among nine that are scheduled to be eliminated or left  vacant in 1990-91. "No one is being fired or laid off," Supt. Larry Lucas said.  Everyone has employment."  </P> <P> Officials acknowledge that Kwon provides a valuable service. "He has done an  invaluable job," said Deputy Supt. Michele Lawrence. "This has nothing to do  with his job performance."  </P> <P> She said the district will rely on four community liaisons, one of whom is  Korean, to help with cross-cultural communication. The district also has about  20 Korean employees, including 11 teachers, who speak Korean, Lawrence said.  </P> <P> A number of factors make the cutbacks necessary, Lawrence said. State funds  have not kept up with inflation, enrollment has declined, and health care costs  have increased.  </P> <P> But parents and students said they will continue to demand that officials  retain Kwon as an administrator.  </P> <P> "When we have problems we tell Howard. He tells us what to do. He is very  important to us," Artesia High School student Peter Rhee said recently during a  meeting of the Korean Students Club.  </P> <P> Parent Jong Kim told school board members Tuesday: "We wish to solve this issue  internally. But if necessary, we will take legal action to prevent the  elimination of the postion of Korean special education coordinator."  </P></p>

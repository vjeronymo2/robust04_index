			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Arab League Secretary General Ismat </F> 'Abd-al-Majid by unidentified correspondent; place and date not  given: "We Are Supposed To Mediate"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Why has the Arab League failed in  the conflict in Yemen?    ['Abd-al-Majid] We have not failed; we made enormous efforts  to defuse the conflict.    [DER SPIEGEL] But this has not prevented the fratricidal  war.    ['Abd-al-Majid] The Arab League does not have the right to  intervene in the internal conflicts of a member state. The  Republic of Yemen officially still exists as a unified state.  Nevertheless, the Arab League remains an important political  instrument, and that includes in the conflict in Yemen as well.    [DER SPIEGEL] What can you do?    ['Abd-al-Majid] Both parties to the war in Yemen now want to  negotiate. The Arab League has been called upon to mediate  between Sana and Aden.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you thinking of sending peacekeeping  forces under the green banner of the Arab League?    ['Abd-al-Majid] If both sides consider this appropriate, why  not?    [DER SPIEGEL] In other conflicts in the region, the League  has also been ineffective -- for instance, in Somalia.    ['Abd-al-Majid] No state whatsoever existed there, which  made the costly intervention of UN troops difficult.  International organizations cannot replace a state.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Arab League also stayed out of the  rapprochement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Not at all. By unanimously recognizing the  respective UN resolutions, we have clearly accelerated the peace  process.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are all Arab League members really ready to  recognize Israel's right to exist?    ['Abd-al-Majid] All, without any exception -- under the  precondition that all parties strive for a just peace on the  basis of "land for peace."</p>

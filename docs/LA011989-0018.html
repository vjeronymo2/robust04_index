			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: SHE'S PERFECTLY SUITED TO THIS SPORT  </P> <P> Erma Bombeck is taking a one-week vacation. This Best of Bombeck was originally  published in 1984.  </P> <P> </P> <P> All my life I have been looking for a sport that features a cute outfit that I  can wear to do my grocery shopping, requires no more effort than putting one  foot in front of the other, allows me to keep my next meal strapped to my back,  and offers the cheap thrill of having someone breathe heavily behind me.  </P> <P> I've found it! Cross-country skiing.  </P> <P> Imagine. No ambulance parked at the bottom of the hill. No tents at the finish  line offering blankets and intravenous feeding. No standing around trying to  find your pulse to see if it is accelerated.  </P> <P> I know there is a lot of curiosity about cross-country skiing, so I will try  not to get technical.  </P> <P> As with any sport, basically what we are talking about is coordination. I  cannot tell you how important it is to coordinate your entire outfit at one  time. The knickers should fit well and be something eye-catching, preferably  matching one's lightweight jacket. A cotton turtleneck or scarf tucked smartly  under a blouse is a nice touch. Socks should be dark to help keep the calves  from looking like piano legs. A lot of people wear thermal underwear, but  personally I find it too warm for the supermarket.  </P> <P> What I really love about the sport is that you don't have to wear those awful  caps that flatten your hair and make it look like an unmade bed. I prefer  earmuffs.  </P> <P> Another tip is to avoid needless exertion. That is why I fry my chicken the  night before and pack the knapsack with small bread-and-butter sandwiches,  thermoses of hot soup and hot chocolate, candy bars and, of course, a  corkscrew.  </P> <P> Setting your pace as you go is very important in cross-country skiing. If you  tear off in a kick-glide movement the way you are supposed to, you will never  meet anybody.  </P> <P> As with most sports, cross-country skiing improves with time and practice.  After a while, you learn that if you look too frightened to move, someone will  clamp your skis on for you, pull your gloved hands through your poles and never  leave your side.  </P> <P> As for the promise of great personal satisfaction, I wouldn't know. Maybe I  will discover that next week when I venture out of the parking lot.  </P></p>

The participants promised to continue aid for  Russia. At the close of the meeting, Finance Minister Theo  Waigel (Christian Social Union), who hosted the conference,  stated that the preconditions for sustained inflation-free  economic growth exist in Germany.    During the discussion of the second major topic -- aid for  Russia -- the G-7 representatives from the United States,  Germany, Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Canada  promised to continue the supportive measures for Moscow to the  agreed extent. At the same time, they declared their readiness  to support the conclusion of a comprehensive new rescheduling  agreement with Russia.    However, during their discussion with the Russian  delegation,  the finance ministers of the Western industrialized nations  expressed concern about the lack of progress concerning the  stabilization of Russia's economy. They called on Russia to  increase and accelerate its efforts to ensure macroeconomic  stabilization and to reduce the budget deficit, the creation of  credit, and inflation. Structural reforms, including secure  legal framework conditions, are indispensable for domestic and  foreign investors, because private capital must become the main  source for financing the transformation process.    The Russian delegation, headed by Finance Minister Sergey  Dubinin, assured the G-7 representatives of the new government's  determination to continue the reform process. "These reforms are  irreversible." According to Waigel, the Russian representatives  formulated the following goals in Kronberg: A balanced budget,  continuing fight against inflation, and an end to the dramatic  production decline. The budget deficit of the central  government, financed by credits of the Russian central bank, is  to be limited to 4 percent of the BIP in 1994, and the monthly  inflation rate is to be reduced to 7-9 percent by the end of the  year.    The ministers and heads of the central banks of the G-7 as  well as representatives of the European Commission welcomed the  promises of the new Moscow government. Yet they strongly  emphasized that a determined economic reform is the only way to  ensure the advantages of a free market economy.    The G-7 representatives stressed that comprehensive  financial  aid in the form of rescheduling agreements, export loans, and  initial credits by the international financial institutions have  already been provided. More funds can only be released once the  required preconditions are fulfilled. Opening up the market for  Russian products to a greater extent is also an essential  element of the G-7 strategy to support reforms.    According to Waigel, the Western finance ministers and heads  of the central banks agreed that particular attention must be  devoted to the social consequences of the transformation  process. A credible program of accompanying social measures,  designed to improve public acceptance of the reform process, are  indispensable. Thus, they agreed to cooperate with Russia to  improve the social network and the social infrastructure. They  pointed out, however, that the financial means required for  these tasks must be provided mainly by Russian sources. Yet the  World Bank might play a special role in helping Russia establish  efficient social infrastructures.</p>

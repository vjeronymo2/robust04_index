During a meeting with Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak, the state of economic and trade  relations between both countries was discussed, while  possibilities for investing in Poland were the topic of a  conversation with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy.    It was agreed during the meeting with Pawlak that both  countries' ministers responsible for commerce would prepare a  list of goods for mutual trade. The establishment of mutual  banking contacts was also considered important.    The balance of foreign trade was also discussed. The balance  is unfavorable to Poland. In 1992, there was a negative balance  of approximately $280 million. The deficit is due, among other  things, to large imports of Thai consumer goods, mostly textile  products (clothing and underwear), by private companies.    Thailand is ready to invest capital in Polish markets, Sejm  Speaker Oleksy said after the meeting with Thailand's deputy  prime minister.    On Thursday [17 March], on the third and last day of the  visit, the Thai politician will be received by President Lech  Walesa and will meet journalists.</p>

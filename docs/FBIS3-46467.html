Sources  close to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) said  that existing manpower was stretched to the limit yet the scope  of their work had become wider in view of political and economic  changes.    "We need to increase manpower. But it has become more  difficult to get the right people. We do want to have some Hong  Kong people joining us. But given the pay scale in the Chinese  Government, that is virtually impossible," one source said.    The First Department - in charge of economic matters -  monitors a wide spectrum of issues such as the mammoth Chek Lap  Kok plan; China-funded enterprises in Hong Kong and their  listing plans; and infrastructure plans in the Pearl River Delta  area, including border traffic.    The Second Department, whose duties are political affairs  and  civil service, is also faced with a heavy workload that covers a  series of constitutional and legal problems arising over the  changeover.    The office under the State Council, and headed by Director  Lu Ping, has four major departments with little more than 100  staff members.    The manpower shortage has been worsened by the need to  deploy  staff at the Beijing office of the Preliminary Working Committee  (PWC) formed a few months ago to give assistance to the working  body doing research and administrative work. A source said:  "Some HKMAO officials have had two offices: One in the HKMAO  headquarters and the other in the PWC office. There's no other  way out in the meantime, unless there are additional staff."  Officials, however, refused to say how many people they needed  to recruit.    Another difficulty was trying to seek more staff in the face  of the ongoing drive by Beijing to trim a bloated bureaucracy.  Moreover, sources said a senior-level reshuffle was imminent  following the transfer of vice-director Mr Wang Qiren to the  Bank of China and the retirement of an "old Hong Kong hand," Mr  Luo Jiahuan, who is a Joint Liaison Group (JLG) member.    Mr Wang's post, which has been left vacant for months, will  be taken by Wang Fengchao, head of the Second Department.    His deputy, Xu Ze, is set for promotion to head of  department.    Mr Luo, 66, will retire from the JLG office soon and be  succeeded by Chen Zuo'er, who is head of the First Department.    Mr Chen has participated in secret negotiations on the Chek  Lap Kok airport plan and is expected to sit on the Airport  Committee after he is posted to the territory.    Mr Xu and Mr Zhang, deputy department heads, have worked in  the HKMAO since the early 1980s. In their late 30s, the pair  are seen as rising stars in the HKMAO.    Another source said the rapid promotion of the younger  officers was also because the HKMAO was a less attractive part  of the Chinese bureaucracy.</p>

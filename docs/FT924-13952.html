			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Kanemaru urged to resign over Tokyo gang links THE disgraced 'godfather' of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, Mr Shin Kanemaru, was told yesterday to resign from parliament by a senior member of his own party, Mr Taku Yamasaki, the construction minister. The resignation call was ignored by Mr Kanemaru, leader of the LDP's largest faction, who is at the centre of a controversy over his violation of a political funds law and his links to gangsters. Mr Yamasaki, a member of a separate LDP faction, said Mr Kanemaru must resign because the gang links had undermined his reputation. The 'godfather' is said to have used those links in an attempt to persuade extreme-right wing groups to stop protesting against LDP leaders in recent years. The call by Mr Yamasaki was criticised by other government officials, but reflected the tension within the party over the sustained public criticism of Mr Kanemaru, who was recently fined Y200,000 (Pounds 935) for illegally receiving Y500m in donations from a parcel delivery company. Heads of four business organisations, including the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) and the Association of Corporate Executives, also demanded that Mr Kanemaru give up his parliamentary seat. Mr Kanemaru has been confident that he can ride out the criticism, but the controversy has forced him to keep a low profile. Public prosecutors, who announced that their investigation into illegal donations to politicians was over, have felt a need to respond to the continuing protests. They said yesterday that investigations into the Y500m may be re-opened, raising the possibility that some of the 60 politicians who later received a share of the money could be questioned. Meanwhile, Mr Kanemaru's faction has settled a few of its internal differences by announcing a new structure in which some power is transferred to groups opposed to Mr Kanemaru's chosen successor, Mr Ichiro Ozawa. The appointment of two new deputy chairman within the faction is likely to lessen the influence of Mr Ozawa, one of the more outward-looking of Japan's leading politicians. In the longer-term, the new power-sharing arrangement could weaken the ability of the faction and the LDP to decide on new policies, both domestic and foreign.</p>

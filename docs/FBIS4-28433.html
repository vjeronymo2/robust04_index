			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, the U.S.  imperialist aggressive forces occupying South Korea conducted  the so-called noncombatant evacuation operation exercise in  Pusan on 6 June. They conducted the exercise on all U.S.  soldiers and their family members who live in the U.S. bases  throughout South Korea. It is said, therefore, that the exercise  is aimed at checking their preparedness if they can rapidly  evacuate from South Korea in the time of a so-called emergency  situation. Furthermore, the noncombatant evacuation operation  exercise is conducted under the pretext of our nonexistent  nuclear issue at a time when the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppets lead the situation on the Korean peninsula to the  brink of war. This fact has become another example of showing  that their preparation for a northward invasion has been  accelerated to a practical stage [silchondangye].</p>

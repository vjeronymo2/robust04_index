			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Loyalist gunmen set out terms for ceasefire: Statement raises hopes of peace Northern Ireland's loyalist paramilitaries yesterday set out their terms for an end to terrorism in response to the IRA's ceasefire declaration, raising the prospect of a permanent end to 25 years of political violence in the province. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, which represents the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the two main terror groups, stopped short of offering an immediate cessation of violence. But it promised 'a meaningful contribution towards peace' once it is certain that the IRA ceasefire is permanent, that the Irish National Liberation Army has ended violence; that no secret deals have been struck with the republicans; and that Ulster's position within the UK is assured. The statement was dismissed as 'inadequate' by the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said the IRA 'has had the courage to take the initiative. The government and the loyalists have not'. Alderman Hugh Smyth, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, said the statement suggested that a ceasefire was possible if the loyalists received the right answers from the government and republicans. The loyalist command gave no timetable for a ceasefire. It said the decision would depend on the implications of the framework document for Northern Ireland's future being drawn up by the British and Irish governments as part of the peace process, which is unlikely to be published for several weeks. 'Change, if any, can only be honourable after dialogue and agreement. It is important that patience is shown to this body given the gravity of the debate required,' the command said. The announcement followed assurances to unionists from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, that the number of British troops in Northern Ireland would not be reduced until the government was sure that terrorism had ended. 'The crucial requirement is to ensure the security of the people of Northern Ireland is fully protected, and that is a judgment that has to be looked at very, very carefully,' Mr Rifkind said, during a visit to Berlin. He said a 'gradual reduction' in the military presence would only happen when violence had ended for a 'considerable' time. 'I am not envisaging any immediate changes of that kind'. His comments contrasted sharply with Wednesday's announcement by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that security was being scaled down. Troops have discarded steel helmets in favour of berets. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's executive, said Mr Rifkind's comments were 'particularly unimaginative and arrogant'. The presence of British soldiers was 'particularly provocative at this time'. Republican sources said that the combination of the government's cautious approach to security and the loyalist terrorists' delay in declaring a ceasefire would put pressure on the internal discipline of the IRA. However, security sources believe that the ceasefire will hold as long as the peace initiative progresses at government level. They also believe that loyalist violence can be contained. A source close to the loyalist paramilitaries said that the combined command's statement was part of a two-track strategy. The source said that loyalist terrorists wanted to play a part in discussions on Ulster's future, while leaving the option of violence open in case unionists felt threatened by the IRA.</p>

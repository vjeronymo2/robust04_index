			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Observer: Custom driven International acquisitions are never easy, but Sherwood Group, the Nottingham lace and lingerie manufacturer, has an unusual problem on its hands. It is buying Lepel, number three in the Italian brassiere market, and would like to sell a few of its chic Latin designs in the UK. But, for some reason that eludes Observer, Italian women almost always buy B-cup bras. (For the uninitiated, this is, well, middle-sized.) British women, explains Sherwood chairman David Parker, come in a much wider range of sizes. His technical experts are already considering how to adapt the Bologna production line to cope.</p>

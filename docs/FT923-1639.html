			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Bonds: ERM strains overshadow Kingdom of Spain's Dollars 1.5bn issue THE Kingdom of Spain's first venture into the US dollar sector of the international bond market was still receiving only lukewarm support for investors yester-day as attention remained focused on the fate of the European exchange rate mechanism. The Dollars 1.5bn bond issue, launched last Tuesday as European markets lurched into crisis, is due to be priced today. The issuer had hoped that stability would return to the markets following the French referendum on Sunday, but it seemed yesterday that Spain's offer was still likely to be overshadowed by events elsewhere. The launch has been made all the more difficult by a widening of spreads in the bond market since the issue was launched. With little activity in the secondary market, dealers have tended to widen spreads in recent days. The Dollars 2bn issue from Province of Ontario, brought last Monday at a spread of 48 basis points over US treasuries, was quoted yesterday at 56 basis points over. Italy's announcement last Friday that it was introducing a 12.5 per cent withholding tax on repurchase agreements also pushed up spreads sharply on supranational agencies such as the the European Investment Bank and World Bank. This has reversed a tightening of spreads on bonds issued by these agencies, which at first seemed likely to escape entirely from the Italian authorities' decision to impose tax only on bonds issued from now. The Kingdom of Spain's deal is expected to be priced at the upper end of the indicated spread of 42 to 45 basis points over US Treasuries. Even then, the lead managers could find themselves having to support the issue if the spread is not to widen further.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation State Duma Defense Committee, under the "Politics"  rubric: "`Partnership for Peace' Is Part of an Overall Security  System"]    [Text] The "Partnership for Peace" program basically  proclaims acceptable objectives and tasks to which Russia can  and should append its signature. However, there are several  objections with regard both to the accession procedure and the  contents of the actual program. The acceptance procedure (the  "16+1" formula) virtually deprives CIS countries of the right to  collective security. The 16 NATO countries decide whether a  particular country can participate in the program and basically  set the terms for participation. My second observation regards  the content of the program. First of all it envisages  standardization of the communications and then the weapons of  countries taking part in the program. This will naturally deal  a very serious blow to the interests of our military-industrial  complex. These two points are the most serious, and  representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Foreign  Ministry, and the Security Council have not yet provided answers  to these objections. It is true that, in addition to a market  agreement, a number of presentation programs have been  envisaged, and it is these programs which will in fact designate  the degree to which a particular state will participate in  signing up to the "partnership," and hence the costs to be borne  by that state in implementing the program. There are other  objections connected with Russia's status as a nuclear state  with a powerful military-industrial potential. Consequently  Russia is simply signing up to a program which has been  formulated without its participation, and this is somewhat  damaging to its prestige. Moreover, the program itself is a  veiled way of expanding NATO. All these issues need to be looked  at as a whole, and therefore we have reached two conclusions at  our parliamentary hearings. The first is this: If Russia joins  the "partnership," it should put forward a number of conditions  with a view to alleviating any negative consequences. The  second conclusion is that the "Partnership for Peace" program  should be regarded merely as part of the establishment of a much  more overarching security system linked to new realities  following the end of the Cold War.</p>

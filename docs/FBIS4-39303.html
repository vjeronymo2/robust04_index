			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that  his country is coordinating its efforts with the Cyprus  Government on possible new approaches in finding a solution to  the Cyprus problem. Speaking after a meeting in Moscow with  Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, Kozyrev also said that the  Russian Government wants a solution to be found for the Cyprus  problem as soon as possible, based on UN decisions on the  safeguarding of the Cyprus Republic's territorial integrity and  unity. Kozyrev added that he has discussed with Mikhailidhis  the possibility of new approaches to the Cyprus issue. In just  a few words, he said, we coordinated our watches on how we  should continue working on the issue by keeping in mind that  Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council.    Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis said that the discussion he  had  with Kozyrev centered on the next steps that will follow on the  Cyprus issue, after the UN secretary general's report to the  Security Council.    Mikhailidhis continued his contacts and this afternoon met  with the Russian Parliament President Ivan Rybkin. Later today,  he will be received by Patriarch Aleksey.</p>

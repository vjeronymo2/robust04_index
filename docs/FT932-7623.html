			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / It's lost that faltering feeling: A couple of weak spots in the UK economy do not detract from current optimism about the recovery Britain's economic recovery is still on track after a week of wayward statistics which left egg on forecasters' faces. For a day or two, reports that retail sales fell unexpectedly in April and manufacturing output dipped in March suggested that recovery was faltering. But these doubts were confounded by Thursday's equally surprising news that seasonally adjusted unemployment fell in April for the third month in a row  -by 1,400 to 2.94m. The week's blips have brought the recovery back to earth. Between December and February, manufacturing output increased by a spectacular 2.7 per cent after a year of stagnation, while in the same two months the volume of retail sales rose by 2.2 per cent. Such growth rates were clearly unsustainable. The latest hints of a corrugated upturn after months of the economy bumping along the bottom of the business cycle suggest that the recovery is likely to be moderate. This will be no bad thing, if it means that inflationary pressures stay subdued. But at the same time, the controversy surrounding Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary of the Treasury, amid reports of Treasury plans to cut health and social security spending, is a reminder of problems further down the line. The recovery could still hit the buffers. Recession in continental Europe is a growing worry for exporters although Britain may be increasing its share of total world trade. Britain's budget and current account deficits are more intractable problems that could one day trigger a crisis of confidence if financial markets believe they are running out of control. For the moment, however, international investors are relatively optimistic about the British economy, as evidenced by sterling's firm performance over the past week. Yesterday's news that the annual rate of retail price inflation fell last month to 1.3 per cent - its lowest level for nearly 30 years - while bank and building society lending grew by a larger than expected Pounds 2.9bn suggest that the UK may succeed in using sterling's devaluation since September to spur economic growth without falling prey to high inflation. However, the future path of inflation is likely to be upwards. But this week's news has also left a strong impression that something special is happening in UK manufacturing industry, which has emerged as the main beneficiary of the devaluation. April's fall in unemployment was unspectacular compared with declines of more than 25,000 in each of the preceding two months. But other official figures on Thursday showed that seasonally adjusted employment in manufacturing industry rose by 5,000 in March and by 11,000 in the first quarter after years of decline. 'You have to go back to the 1960s to find the start of a recovery in which manufacturing employment rises,' comments Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank. The last time that manufacturing employment increased for three successive months was in 1988, when the UK economy was booming. The long term post-war trend in manufacturing employment has been inexorably downwards: from a peak of 7.89m in June 1971 to about 4.2m today. Almost certainly, there are special factors behind the rise. Many companies were too quick to shed labour in the dark days of last September when business and consumer confidence slumped after sterling's forced departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. The labour market reforms of the 1980s and the much tougher disciplines imposed on managements by financial markets seem also to have encouraged a 'hire and fire' culture in Britain more akin to that of the US than Britain's European Community partners. Some growth in the manufacturing workforce could also reflect increased economic growth. But here government and independent economists are cautious. Nobody is suggesting that unemployment will not rise again. What is clear, however, is that manufacturers have come through the recession in reasonably good fettle. The 0.3 per cent fall in manufacturing output between February and March seems to have been statistical 'noise' rather than evidence of the recovery's fragility. Manufacturers report rising orders and expect further increases in output. The Bank of England says their profitability was maintained through the recession. Manufacturing productivity is growing strongly: up 7.8 per cent in the three months to the end of March compared with the first quarter of last year. Unit labour costs are falling: down an annual 2.9 per cent over the same period. By contrast, the Bank of England is forecasting a 9.8 per cent increase in the unit labour costs of west German manufacturers this year. Mr Spencer believes the improved fortunes of Britain's manufacturers could trigger 'an emulation effect' in other parts of the economy. There is some anecdotal evidence to support such hopes. Mr Charles Burton, joint managing director of Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, has noticed a change in his customers' requirements that might point to future economic growth. 'A financial institution, two retailers and even some construction companies have asked BSL to think about where in the UK they should expand their activities,' Mr Burton says. 'That is first time we have had such business since the late 1980s.' But manufacturing is too small a part of the economy to ensure recovery on its own. The key to sustained growth lies with the hitherto recession-shocked British consumer. Here too there are encouraging signs. April's surprise 0.3 per cent decline in retail sales compared with March has to be set against a sharp improvement in consumer confidence as measured by Gallup, the opinion poll company, and a survey this week from the Confederation of British Industry forecasting further increases in retail sales in May. The high levels of debt and debt-servicing costs, which have crimped consumer demand, may also be easing slightly. The accompanying chart, based on Bank of England data, shows how personal income gearing (which measures personal sector interest payments as a proportion of disposable income) has fallen to about 10 per cent from 14 per cent in 1990, largely because of falling mortgage interest rates. The recent slight rise in house prices may have halted the rise in capital gearing, the measure of outstanding lending as a proportion of consumers' financial and tangible wealth. One of the most hopeful indicators is the May Gallup survey of unemployment expectations. The 28 percentage point gap between the 49 per cent of respondents expecting unemployment to rise and the 21 per cent expecting it to fall was the smallest since May 1990 and suggests that fear of losing one's job is falling sharply. If so, the way will be open for a more broadly based upturn, supported by a more active housing market and increased personal borrowing. But the recovery is bound to be modest so long as the economy is weighed down by Britain's current account and budget deficits and the prospect of future tax increases and public spending cuts to correct these problems.</p>

			<p>National   Security   <F P=102> 94WB0031I Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 10 Mar 94 p 39-A </F> <F P=103> 94WB0031I </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Gutierrez] </F>   [Text] The drug traffic phenomenon in Mexico is not a risk  to the national security. This claim was made by Raul Campos  Rabago, representing the Office of the Attorney General of the  Republic at Mar del Plata, Argentina, where he is attending the  meeting of the Inter-American Committee for Control of Drugs and  Drug Abuse [CICAD].    Campos Rabago, commissioner of the National Institute To  Combat Drugs [INCD], told delegates from 24 countries serving on  the aforementioned committee that, despite his previous remark,  "The drug traffic is still not just threatening, but also  inflicting daily harm on the health and welfare of societies."    Participating as Mexico's representative at the committee's  meeting, which is being held in the Argentine province of Mar  del Plata, the official stressed, on this occasion, that  President Salinas de Gortari's administration is aware of this  situation. Hence, since the beginning of his term, he has given  the battle against drugs and drug addiction a priority status on  the government's agenda.    He added that the 1989-94 National Program To Combat Drugs  includes action for eradication, interception, repression, and  rehabilitation, thus dealing with the phenomenon as a whole.  Campos Rabago explained that this has been made possible by the  reinforcement of the Mexican institutions responsible for  combating crimes against health in all their forms.    He also noted that the National Institute To Combat Drugs is  the agency charged with coordinating the action taken in this  area by the federal and state governments, and by private  institutions, serving as a central catalyst for executing the  national strategy, through the Planning Center for Drug Control  (Cendro).    The INCD commissioner stressed that, although considerable  progress has been made, "the fact that the criminal associations  involved in the drug traffic are increasing their capacity to  evade each of our countries' coercive measures more every day  impels us to extend the battle not only to curb the supply and  the illicit trafficking, but also, primarily, to check the  demand. This can be achieved by preventing improper use of drugs  and psychotropic substances, and by rehabilitating addicts."    Attending this 15th regular session of the CICAD were  representatives from the United States, Venezuela, Colombia,  Chile, Trinidad and Tobago, Canada, Brazil, Bolivia, and the  Central American countries.</p>

This jargon of the opponent to dialogue is nothing but a  foolish attempt to evade their responsibility for the collapse  of North-South dialogue and justify the criminal war moves  against the North, which are now increasing the tensions in the  Korean peninsula.    It is an insult to and a mockery of the dialogue partner for  the South Korean puppet clique to twang the harp of "dialogue"  while bringing the situation of the Korean peninsula to the  brink of war after unilaterally breaking up the working-level  contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the  North and the South.    Yi Yong-tok said "if the UN sanctions are taken against the  North, the South will adopt all measures needed for  international cooperation." This revealed the invariable  intention to isolate and stifle the North at any cost with the  help of outside forces.    The Kim Yong-sam group must not act rashly, clearly mindful  that going towards a war after closing the door of dialogue  will, after all, tighten the noose around its neck.</p>

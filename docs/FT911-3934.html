			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (4): Palmtop has the punch of a PC HEWLETT-PACKARD'S palmtop computer, introduced today, is the size of a cheque book and weighs just 11 ounces but the HP 95LX packs all of the punch of an IBM-compatible personal computer. Built into the HP pocket-sized computer is Lotus 1-2-3, the most popular spreadsheet program. In addition, a phone book and appointments calendar comes installed into the HP palmtop. Further programs can be loaded by inserting solid-state memory cards. A plug-in demodulator unit enables the HP 95LX to receive text messages from cellular paging systems. It is aimed at technical and scientific users of its desktop PCs, and offers the power of a machine 10 times its size.</p>

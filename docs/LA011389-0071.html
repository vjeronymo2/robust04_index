			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NICHOLLS GETS HAT TRICK; KINGS BEAT BLUES  </P> <P> Bernie Nicholls said the coaches jumped all over the Kings after a lackluster  first period, and it apparently had the desired effect as Los Angeles came out  and blew St. Louis away, 7-4, behind Nicholls' 13th career hat trick Thursday  night.  </P> <P> "It was obvious we didn't play well in the first period," Nicholls said of a  period that saw only a single goal -- by St. Louis. "Give them the credit. They  didn't give us much. We got shouted at between periods and it got a little  hyper in here.  </P> <P> "You can't get excited after one bad period. We played well in the second and  third."  </P> <P> Nicholls scored his third hat trick of the season in running his goal scoring  total to 43 in 44 games, second only to Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh, who has  47.  </P> <P> After scoring the first Kings goal of the game, Nicholls completed his hat  trick with a pair of goals 64 seconds apart early in the third period to expand  what had been a 4-3 Los Angeles lead to 6-3.  </P> <P> Mike Krushelnyski added his 12th and 13th goals for the Kings, while rookie  Igor Liba added a goal and two assists.  </P> <P> Tony McKegney collected two goals for the Blues, his 16th and 17th of the  season.  </P> <P> The Kings have won two straight games after suffering through a five-game  winless streak. St. Louis has won only once in their last six games.  </P> <P> Steve Tuttle scored the only goal of the first period at 1:45. After Nicholls'  45-foot slap shot tied the game at 2:07 of the second period, McKegney rammed  in a 5-footer at 3:44 to make it 2-1 Blues. The Kings then reeled off three  straight goals to take command.  </P> <P> Luc Robitaille popped in a 10-foot rebound of a shot by Sylvain Couturier at  4:29 to tie the game at 2-2. Liba's power play goal made the score 3-2 at 8:45.  Liba deflected in Dale De Gray's shot from the blue line past goaltender Greg  Millen.  </P> <P> Krushelnyski's first goal at 14:27 of the second came on a 5-foot tap-in off a  pass from Liba to make it 4-2. St. Louis closed to 4-3 with 3:30 remaining in  the middle period when Rick Meagher beat Kings goalie Glenn Healy on a 20-foot  wrist shot.  </P> <P> "The difference tonight is we were down 4-3 going into the third, and we know  it's a one-goal game," said Blues Coach Brian Sutter. "We've got to play like  we did in the first two periods. We got away from what we do as a hockey team.  We let it slip away. You've got to play 60 minutes -- that's concentration.  It's not that didn't get any chances because we got the opportunities."  </P> <P> Kings goalie Glenn Healy won his 20th game of the season, tying him for the NHL  lead with Philadelphia's Ron Hextall.  </P> <P> "Fortunately we came out strong," said Healy, "and when you get a cushion you  tend to play with a lot more confidence."  </P></p>

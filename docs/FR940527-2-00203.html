Selection Criteria/Ranking Factors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Complete applications received from eligible applicants by the application due date are rated and scored by HUD. Regardless of the type of grant sought (Single Purpose or Comprehensive), applications are rated and scored against four factors. These four factors are discussed in more detail in subsection 3 of this Section E. Previous grantees of Small Cities Program CDBG grants also undergo a performance evaluation. The criteria for determining adequacy of performance are discussed in subsection 2 of this Section E.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Performance Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in Section C of this NOFA, previous grantees of Small Cities Program CDBG grants are subject to an evaluation of performance and capacity to undertake the proposed program. For purposes of making performance evaluations, HUD will use any information available as of the application due date. Performance also will be evaluated using information which may be available already to HUD, including previously submitted performance reports, site visit reports, audits, monitoring reports and annual in-house reviews. Grantees may be requested to submit additional information, if generally available facts raise a question as to capacity to undertake the proposed program. No grants will be made to an applicant that does not have the capacity to undertake the proposed program. A performance determination will be made by evaluation of the following areas:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Community Development Activities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The following thresholds for performance in expending CDBG funds have been established for FY 1994 and pertain to all Single Purpose and Comprehensive Grants:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> FY 1989 and earlier_Grants must be closed out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1990_Grant funds 100% expended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1991_Grant funds 75% expended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1992_Grant funds 30% expended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1993_Recipients must be on target with respect to the latest Small Cities Program Schedule received by HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  These standards will be used as benchmarks in judging program performance, but will not be the sole basis for determining whether the applicant is ineligible for a grant due to a lack of capacity to carry out the proposed project or program. Any applicant that fails to meet the percentages specified above may wish to provide updated data to HUD, either in conjunction with the application submission or under separate cover, but in no case will data received by HUD after the application due date be accepted.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compliance with applicable laws and regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An applicant will be considered to have performed inadequately if the applicant:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Has not substantially complied with the laws, regulations, and Executive Orders applicable to the CDBG Program, including applicable civil rights laws as may be evidenced by: an outstanding finding of civil rights noncompliance, unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; an adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual, unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; a deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations; a pending civil rights suit brought against it by the Department of Justice; or an unresolved charge of discrimination issued against it by the Secretary under section 810(g) of the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Has not resolved or attempted to resolve findings made as a result of HUD monitoring; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Has not resolved or attempted to resolve audit findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An applicant will be ineligible for a grant where the inadequate performance in compliance with applicable laws and regulations evidences a lack of capacity to carry out the proposed project or program. An application also will not be accepted from a unit of general local government which has an outstanding audit finding or monetary obligation for any HUD program. Additionally, applications will not be accepted from any entity which proposes an activity in a unit of general local government that has an outstanding audit finding or monetary obligation for any HUD program. The Director of the Community Planning and Development Division of the HUD field office may provide waivers to this prohibition, but in no instance will a waiver be provided where funds are due HUD, unless a satisfactory arrangement for repayment of the debt has been made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Performance assessment reports. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under 24 CFR 570.507, Small Cities CDBG grantees are required to submit Performance Assessment Reports (PARs) annually on the date when the grant was originally executed. For an application for FY 1994 funds to be considered for funding, the applicant must be current in its submission of Performance Assessment Reports. Failure to submit a PAR is not a curable technical deficiency under Section V of this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

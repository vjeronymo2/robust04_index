			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING;  </P> <P> BOB NORDSKOG IS 76 -- BUT STILL VERY MUCH IN THE FAST LANE  </P> <P> Bob Nordskog, 76, is showing no signs of slowing down.  </P> <P> The millionaire ocean racer-industrialist from Van Nuys will be at the helm of  his 38-foot powerboat Saturday for 120 miles of pounding across the surf at  speeds approaching 100 m.p.h. in the Race for Sight, event No. 4 in the Pacific  Offshore Power Boat Racing Assn. season.  </P> <P> Nordskog won overall in the first race, the Sweetheart, and won in his class in  the second race, the Rum Run, but had mechanical failure in the Ventura Channel  Dash in May.  </P> <P> The Race for Sight, which will help raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind of  San Rafael, Calif., will start and finish at Marina del Rey. It will consist of  two 60-mile loops -- from Marina del Rey south to Palos Verdes Point off  Redondo Beach, then north to Point Dume, west of Malibu, and return to Marina  del Rey.  </P> <P> Smaller boats will race only one lap, or 60 miles.  </P> <P> This will be the seventh Race for Sight and Nordskog, who is also president and  founder of the power boat association, has won six of them, including last  year's.  </P> <P> Weather conditions should help determine the outcome of Saturday's race. If the  ocean is smooth, Jim Duvall of Long Beach and his twin-hull catamaran, Crimson  Tide, which can skim over the water at 100 m.p.h., will be favored. Duvall won  overall in the Rum Run and Ventura races and has won the tunnel boat class in  all three starts.  </P> <P> If it is rough, Nordskog's 10-year-old Scarab, which has won 33 races in 36  starts, will be the favorite.  </P> <P> "Rough water is the equalizer," Nordskog said. "Duvall is faster than we are in  smooth water, but if it gets choppy, we take the advantage."  </P> <P> Nordskog built a new and faster boat, a 40-foot Fountain, for this season and  raced it in the last two races. It won the nontunnel class in the Rum Run, a  race around Catalina, in a heavy fog, but in the Ventura race it developed a  problem in the drive train that has not been resolved to Nordskog's  satisfaction.  </P> <P> "I know what the old boat can do and it's ready," he said. "It won its last  race, the Sweetheart, in March, and even though it's about 10 m.p.h. slower  than the new boat, it's probably more reliable."  </P> <P> Another potential winner is John Peters of Phoenix, in Honcho, a 41-foot  V-bottom boat that won in its class at Ventura. Other challengers include Karl  Koster of San Francisco, in a new 30-foot Kal Kustom that will be racing for  the first time, and Tom Hays of Pasadena in the 30-foot All Risk. A fleet of 25  boats is expected for all classes.  </P> <P> "The unique factor about our organization is that in 23 years, we have never  had a fatality, or even a major accident," Nordskog said. "You hear quite often  about accidents in the Atlantic, but not on our side.  </P> <P> "The water's the same, but the lectures and the penalties aren't. I lecture all  the racers on the important of safety at every race. . . .  </P> <P> "If we find a driver creates a dangerous hazard, we disqualify him for a day,  or a month, or if it's flagrant and something we cannot tolerate, we will  disqualify him for life."  </P> <P> The race will start at 10 a.m. The only viewing points will be from spectator  boats.  </P> <P> SPRINT CARS -- After a three-race weekend during which Ron Shuman, John Redican  and Brad Noffsinger were winners, the Parnelli Jones Firestone/California  Racing Assn. season returns to one-night action Saturday when Ascot Park holds  a 30-lap main event for the wingless sprinters. It will be the first race of a  three-night Budweiser American Sprint Car Series which offers $3,000 to top  finishers in semi-main events as well as the feature races.  </P> <P> Despite finishing sixth at Ascot and Tucson and 16th at Phoenix, Jerry Meyer  retained his series lead with 2,499 points to the closely bunched pack of Rip  Williams, 2,366; Shuman, 2,360, and Noffsinger, 2,343.  </P> <P> MOTOCROSS -- The first round of the Dodge Truck California Summer Series,  sponsored by the Continental Motosport Club, will be run Sunday at Glen Helen  Park in San Bernardino. The nine-race series will conclude Aug. 27 at Carlsbad  Raceway, former site of the United States Grand Prix. The CMC will also race  Friday night at Ascot Park. . . . Ventura Raceway will open its Coors/Kawasaki  summer series Saturday night.  </P> <P> Bob (Hurricane) Hannah, 32, a six-time American Motorcyclist Assn. national  champion and winner of 63 national events, will make his final competitive  appearance Sunday in the 250cc U.S. Grand Prix at Unadilla Valley in New  Berlin, N.Y. Other U.S. entries include Rick Johnson, who started his comeback  from a serious wrist injury by winning the Mammoth Mountain Invitational two  weeks ago, Jeff Ward, Micky Dymond, Johnny O'Mara, Broc Glover and George  Holland. World points leader is Jean-Michel Bayle of France, the 125cc world  champion.  </P> <P> VINTAGE CARS -- The Great American Race will end its 12-day trek across the  country Friday morning at Disneyland after stops Thursday in Holtville for an  afternoon rest and San Diego for the night. The old-time vehicles are scheduled  to reach Disneyland at 11 a.m.  </P> <P> HILL CLIMB -- The Millen brothers, Rod and Steve, New Zealand natives who live  in Orange County, will tackle Pikes Peak and its 156 turns in 12.5 miles Sunday  in different equipment.

Steve, 36, a two-time winner of the Mickey  Thompson Gran Prix stadium championship, will be in a General Tire Nissan V-6  pickup in the truck class.  </P> <P> OFF-ROAD -- Less than a minute kept Robby Gordon of Orange from winning his  seventh overall trophy in three years in the High Desert Racing Assn./SCORE  series last Saturday in the Fireworks 250 out of Barstow. After more than five  hours of desert racing, Gordon's '89 Ford truck finished 59 seconds behind Bob  Richey of Corona, driving a Porsche-powered two-seater Raceco buggy.  </P> <P> A course worker, Jim Cross of Hemet, was killed when he was hit by a vehicle  driven by racer Mark McMillin of Bonita, Calif., at a race checkpoint.  </P> <P> STOCK CARS -- Two Cajon Speedway drivers, Ed Hale and Tobin Whitt, have moved  up to second and third positions in the Winston Racing Series regional  championship behind Paul White of Temple, Tex.

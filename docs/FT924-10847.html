			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Criminal Justice Bill may be altered THE government yesterday indicated its readiness to amend further the Criminal Justice Bill following protests from bankers that the bill's provisions on insider dealing and money laundering could restrict them unfairly. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government did not want to undermine financial services in London. He said the bill, which was published on Friday, could be amended to take account of legitimate concerns. 'I am certainly prepared to listen. I have no interest in imposing on the City legislation that is going to disrupt legitimate business,' said Mr Nelson in an interview with the Reuters news agency. Mr Nelson accepted that the consultation period leading up to the introduction of the bill last week had been too short to respond to all concerns. He said the government had faced the threat of infraction proceedings by the EC. The latest protests at the bill were made on Monday by the British Bankers' Association. Lord Inchyra, the director general, said the association was concerned that senior bankers could inadvertently fall foul of the law.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMARENA CASE DEAL DENIED BY OFFICIAL  </P> <P> Mexico's attorney general Monday categorically denied allegations by U.S.  attorneys that he approved an "under the table" agreement to hand over a  Guadalajara doctor to American officials for trial in the 1985 murder of drug  agent Enrique Camarena.  </P> <P> In a written statement, Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said it is  "absolutely false" that he authorized a swap of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain  for a Mexican fugitive in the United States, as federal prosecutors have  charged.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie set a hearing for Friday on  a defense contention that charges against the doctor should be dismissed  because of "outrageous (U.S.) government conduct."  </P> <P> The judge directed prosecutors to produce at the hearing anyone who knows  anything about the doctor's arrest. Rafeedie said he wants to know how high up  knowledge of the Alvarez case went in the government.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. William Fahey said he assumes that knowledge of the  operation went to "fairly high levels" within the Drug Enforcement  Administration.  </P> <P> Prosecutors in Los Angeles filed a legal brief and affidavits in U.S. District  Court last Friday alleging that representatives of the Mexican Federal Judicial  Police, which answers to the attorney general, asked that "the arrangement be  'under the table' between governments" so as not to "upset" Mexican citizens.  </P> <P> According to the brief, the doctor had previously been detained in Mexico, but  the deal fell through when DEA officials refused to pay a $50,000 advance to  federal police who promised to bring him to the United States. Informants later  advised the DEA that the doctor "had paid a bribe" to Mexican police to be  released, the brief states.  </P> <P> It adds that after the deal fell apart, Los Angeles-based DEA operative Antonio  Garate Bustamante arranged the April 2 abduction of Alvarez through contacts in  Mexico. Garate, a former Mexican policeman who has admitted working for drug  traffickers at one point, was promised "a $50,000 reward" plus expenses.  </P> <P> Garate has said that the original swap plan was arranged by Federal Judicial  Police Cmdr. Pablo Alleman and Jorge Castillo del Rey, a former commander of  the same agency.  </P> <P> "The supposed authorization (by Alvarez del Castillo) is absolutely false," the  attorney general said. "Mr. Castillo del Rey was retired from the Federal  Judicial Police July 1, 1989, and never had any contact with the attorney  general of the republic."  </P> <P> Castillo del Rey has been arrested in connection with the doctor's kidnaping.  Officials deny Alleman was involved in any negotiations.  </P> <P> Camarena was kidnaped outside the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara in February,  1985, tortured and killed.  </P> <P> The DEA had sought Alvarez, a gynecologist, for his alleged role in reviving  Camarena during torture sessions and questioning about his knowledge of  official corruption and involvement in drug trafficking.  </P> <P> "In December, 1989, Garate was contacted telephonically by (MFJP) Commandante  Jorge Castillo del Rey, who sought to meet with Garate and representatives of  the DEA in Los Angeles," the legal brief states.  </P> <P> At the Dec. 13 meeting, the account continues, "Castillo del Rey advised that  he was present in the United States with the full knowledge and authority of  the attorney general of Mexico."  </P> <P> Mexican officials were willing to give up Alvarez in order to get their hands  on a Mexican fugitive, a banker believed hiding in California "because he was  alleged to have stolen approximately $500 million from various politicians in  Mexico," the brief states.  </P> <P> The DEA reportedly agreed to find the fugitive and deport him as an illegal  alien.  </P> <P> Garate continued negotiations by phone with Javier Orosco-Orosco, the chief of  the MFJP fugitive detail in Mexico City. But he demanded "$50,000 in advance  for an airplane and other expenses to transport Alvarez-Machain to the United  States," according to the prosecution account.  </P> <P> Alvarez's lawyer, Robert K. Steinberg, said he has subpoenaed U.S. Atty. Gen.  Richard Thornburgh and DEA Director Terrence Burke to testify about his  client's arrest. But, he indicated that he and the prosecutor probably will  agree to introduce written declarations by the two high-ranking officials at  Friday's hearing.  </P> <P> Four other Camarena defendants are on trial in Los Angeles federal court.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John Kendall in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff Pittencrieff, the Edinburgh-based oil and gas and communications company, yesterday reported a 73 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.51m for 1991. The communications business contributed 55 per cent to turnover and 40 per cent to gross profits compared with 25 per cent and 23 per cent respectively in 1990. The directors believed that, in due course, the mobile communications business should establish itself as a major corporation in its own right and as a consequence, a number of options including demerger of the oil and gas business were being considered. Group turnover for the year almost doubled to Pounds 10.2m. Earnings emerged at 17.25p (14.01p) and a final dividend of 3.5p makes a 6p (4.5p) total.</p>

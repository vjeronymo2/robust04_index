			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Congress moves to ban deficits CONGRESS is preparing to curb its most important power, to decide on taxation and expenditure, by seeking to amend the US constitution to ban budget deficits. The House of Representatives budget committee has begun hearings on a balanced budget constitutional amendment, and Mr Thomas Foley, the Speaker of the House, says he believes an amendment is likely to pass this year. Support for a balanced budget amendment - which if passed by Congress would then need to be ratified by three quarters of the states - comes mainly from Republicans and conservative Democrats. But left wing Democrats like Senator Paul Simon of Illinois or Congressman Joseph Kennedy of Massachusetts are also backing slightly different proposals with the same aim. Congress has made several attempts to tie its own budgetary hands since the US federal deficit began to spiral out of control in the 1980s, but with the deficit expected to top Dollars 400bn this year, they have clearly failed. The Gramm Rudman Hollings law of 1985 set a target of balancing the budget by 1991, and inflicted mandatory spending cuts if Congress and the president could not agree on a budget that met the law's targets for the deficit in intermediate years. The law had some effect, but was largely circumvented, and in 1990 it was replaced by a budget compromise between President George Bush and Congress. This agreement, which President Bush now regards as a mistake, raised some taxes but in return imposed caps on discretionary spending. Perhaps most importantly, it introduced a 'pay as you go' rule, whereby any measures that would increase mandatory spending such as unemployment benefits or social security payments would have to be offset by higher taxes. Even this apparently stringent discipline, however, has not held back the deficit from its giddy upwards spiral.</p>

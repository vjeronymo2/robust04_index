			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Administrators draft a concluding chapter - Andrew Jack on the final stages of the long drawn out sale of most of the Maxwell businesses There may be a long epilogue to come, but the administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation are drafting a concluding chapter to their magnum opus following the sale of most of the businesses in the public empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Creditors to MCC may be able to receive much of the benefit through a dividend early in the new year, as the proceeds of the sale of the group's principal businesses in the US trickle through. Accountants at Price Waterhouse and their advisers will still need perhaps as long as a decade to finish tracing assets, pursue litigation and unravel in the most efficient manner a network of 400 MCC companies. But substantial realisations to creditors will come shortly from the sales of Official Airline Guide (OAG) to Reed Elsevier in September for Pounds 417m, and of Macmillan to Paramount Communications earlier this month for Dollars 552.75m (Pounds 371m). Still outstanding in both cases is the 'pre-packaged' Chapter 11 exit under US insolvency law which will permit completion of the sale of the companies. That requires expiry of the 'bar date' on new claims against the Maxwell businesses from creditors who are not yet identified. For both OAG and Macmillan, these will have expired in the next few weeks. Mr Mark Homan, one of the joint administrators and head of insolvency at Price Waterhouse in London, is confident that his team has done all it can to find any outstanding liabilities. 'We have identified what the books reveal; heaven knows what they don't show,' he says. The presence of a 'bar date' beyond which no new claims will be admitted is one of the advantages Mr Homan will concede of US over English insolvency law - where the position is more ambiguous. Another is the presence of a specialist US bankruptcy court, which he says has helped the speed of the process. Against that, the administrators have been forced into a very delicate and unprecedented process of negotiating a path between the sometimes contradictory procedures of the two jurisdictions - the result of MCC's directors filing for protection in New York at the same time as the group entered administration in London. If there are no new claims before the bar dates, Mr Homan says: 'That will leave us free to upstream the money.' The proceeds will then pass through two intermediate holding companies before being repatriated to the MCC parent for a distribution. There are still issues to be finalised over the tax bills on the sales. The administrators need to take care to ensure they do not liquidate any companies in the MCC network before taking full advantage of offsetting any proceeds against tax losses elsewhere in the group. Mr Homan says he was happy with the way in which OAG and Macmillan were sold: the former by negotiated settlement as a result of some of the technical and regulatory difficulties involved; the latter by sealed bids, which he believes to be highly unusual in a US insolvency. He says Paramount's offer was significantly above the next highest price to 'make us feel the process was justified' despite some tensions at the time. Not all money will go to the unsecured creditors in the group: there are preferential stockholders in OAG to be paid first, for instance, as well as mortgage payments to deal with. There are also professional fees, which he estimates will finally total 3 per cent of realisations. Including lawyers and bankers, the total will run to Pounds 60m or more. 'I've had incredible value,' he says. 'It's unfair to criticise such dedicated professionals.' Some money from sales of the non-US MCC businesses has been retained to fund existing and future costs. That has included about Pounds 100m from some 20 businesses and 40 properties, leaving just a handful of assets left to sell. In the US, the only significant remaining asset is Standard Rate &amp; Data, the advertising industry information service. It remains because it might have been sold with OAG, since they share a common computer system. In the event, Reed did not want to buy the company, so it is being marketed separately. It is likely to raise somewhere in the Dollars 80m-Dollars 100m range. A few more millions will come from some companies which could have been sold with Macmillan, such as the Advertising Black Book. Any remaining proceeds for creditors will come from claims against third parties. Mr Homan is reluctant to be drawn on the subject, but says: 'We are considering a claim against the auditors' - Coopers &amp; Lybrand. There may also be legal action against other professional advisers, and insurance companies reluctant to pay up. In addition, Mr Homan says cryptically that he is considering actions to recover 'not trivial sums' from creditors who may have gained an unfair advantage above others by transferring assets at undervalue or obtaining undue preferences. He says that there may be recoveries in the 'high tens of millions' as a result of investigations work into tracing money illegally removed from the group. The administrators are still running a 1,000-line computer programme to help determine the value and timing of dividend payments. There may be an intermediate one in January, or a single larger sum in March once the US bankruptcy proceedings are complete. On current estimates of realisations, it is believed that the total is likely to be around 40p in the pound, towards the upper end of the 22p-43p range quoted earlier this year before an additional 9p from the proceeds of any successful litigation. Meanwhile, Mr Homan is beginning to reflect on the wider lessons to be learnt from the administration, not least of which is his concern at arbitrageurs who have traded about half of MCC's debt since its collapse. He says they often pester his staff in a hungry search for information which it may not be in the best interests of creditors to reveal. Since they keep changing, it is difficult to keep them informed. He also argues that their interests are fundamentally divergent from other creditors  -often favouring break-up to reconstruction of a business.</p>

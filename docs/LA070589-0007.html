			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET LEGISLATURE, IN FIRST, REJECTS KREMLIN APPOINTEE;  </P> <P> OUSTS OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY AFTER 3 YEARS IN POST  BECAUSE OF POOR PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's new, independent-minded legislature for the first time  Tuesday voted to boot a deputy premier out of his job, despite a last-minute  change in rules aimed at pushing through the Kremlin's choice to steer foreign  economic policy.  </P> <P> The vote served as proof, if the Soviet leadership needed it, that political  maneuvering may not be enough to get an appointee through the current Supreme  Soviet. It also demonstrated the importance the legislators attach to improving  the stagnant Soviet economy.  </P> <P> The official in question, Vladimir M. Kamentsev, has served nearly three years  as chairman of the Foreign Economic Commission, charged with setting foreign  trade policy. He has been entrusted, among other things, with establishing  joint ventures with Western companies.  </P> <P> He also is a member of the Council of Ministers, the highest executive and  administrative body in the country, similar to the U.S. Cabinet.  </P> <P> But deputies accused him Tuesday of incompetence, criticized him for failing to  do enough to import foreign medicines and belittled him for an inability to  speak foreign languages.  </P> <P> One legislator accused him of nepotism, while another criticized him for  thoughtlessly permitting the sale of raw materials and other national assets  necessary for domestic industrial expansion.  </P> <P> "Kamentsev has been in this post for a long time, and we know the results,"  said Anatoly Sobchak, a lawmaker from Leningrad.  </P> <P> Sobchak told the Parliament that the country's foreign trade performance was  "disastrous" and added, "I feel Kamentsev does not have the moral and  professional right to occupy this post."  </P> <P> Kamentsev's appointment was the first to be officially rejected by the  Parliament, although nine other candidates out of 57 Kremlin nominees were  dropped after discussion or stepped down voluntarily.  </P> <P> On Friday, Kamentsev was rejected when he received 246 votes out of the 419  deputies present under rules that required all appointees to receive an  absolute majority of the Supreme Soviet's 542 deputies.  </P> <P> But Monday, the rules were changed, requiring only a simple majority of the  deputies present, and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov submitted Kamentsev's name  again. On Tuesday, Kamentsev received 200 votes out of the 419 cast.  </P> <P> The official Tass news agency explained Tuesday that the rules were changed in  an effort to do away with "a practice inherited from the old Supreme Soviet,"  which met for a few days each year and where voting was usually unanimous.  </P> <P> After the vote Tuesday, Ryzhkov said he would submit a new candidate for the  post but added that he still supported Kamentsev.  </P> <P> Kamentsev, 61, a former deputy minister of the Fishing Ministry, revealed in  legislative debate last week that the Third World debt to the Soviet Union had  reached about $140 billion at the official exchange rate.  </P> <P> He said the Soviet Union hopes to recover about 50% of the debt by methods such  as inviting "manufacturers to come and work in the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> He was interrupted by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who said 50% is too  little and urged him to "do more work on this problem."  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet convened June 26 and was given new oversight powers under  Gorbachev. Its members were elected from the larger, popularly elected Congress  of People's Deputies. Previously, members of the Supreme Soviet voted as one in  approving Kremlin appointees and decisions.  </P></p>

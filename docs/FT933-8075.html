			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Berkshire Council chief to quit MR Tony Allen is resigning as chief executive of Berkshire County Council at the end of November. The council, which during his tenure has pioneered contracting-out of services to the private sector, now intends to devolve power further. It plans to allow more autonomy to the people who chair committees and to replace the office of chief executive, with a 'corporate manager'. The council, jointly controlled by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, said this was 'one of the most radical reorganisations in local government'. Mr Allen is believed to disagree with some of the plans.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / US tempers outrage over spying: Christopher points up broader interests The US yesterday maintained its tone of outrage over the arrest of an alleged Russian spy at the Central Intelligence Agency, but officials made clear that they had broader interests at stake in their relationship with the government of President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the administration would 'take every measure to protect the US and to prevent such activities from being carried out in the future'. He insisted, however, that Russia's progress towards elective democracy and a market economy was more important to the US's strategic interests. 'Events in Russia over the past few weeks have revived our fears about the future. The dangers in Russia are very real, but I would want to emphasise that these events should be put into perspective,' Mr Christopher told the Senate committee on foreign relations. US officials were certainly not under the illusion that the KGB's successor agencies had entirely given up operations in the US, nor has the CIA stopped spying in Russia. Nevertheless, Monday's arrest of Mr Aldrich Ames, a senior CIA official, makes it more difficult for the administration to argue publicly for large sums of financial aid to Russia. Charges filed against him in a federal court alleged that he continued spying for the Russian foreign intelligence service, in return for a total of Dollars 1.5m, after the break-up of the Soviet Union. Senator Dennis DeConcini, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, called last night for a 60-day freeze on aid to Russia. 'We're handing over Dollars 2bn to the Russians, and it seems to me it's not asking too much to ask them to back off this kind of stuff,' he said. Russia yesterday sought to play down the issue, pointing out that both countries continued to spy on each other. 'It would be inappropriate to blow this story into a political scandal. After all, intelligence, even in a changing world, remains intelligence, with its own specific methods and interests,' Itar-Tass said. 'Nothing has changed,' said Mr Vyacheslav Trubnikov, first deputy director of the External Intelligence Service recently. The latter was hived off from the former KGB with the Soviet Union's collapse, while domestic operations were concentrated in a new Security Ministry which in December was replaced by the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. The Russian paymasters of Mr Ames and other spies were doubtless seeking the same sort of information as most other intelligence agencies, with the added suspicion that their former cold war enemy was seeking to make the most of chaos in the former Soviet Union. Russia's new weaknesses range from political instability, a loss of water-tight borders as a result of the Soviet Union's collapse, and the creation around it of a dozen new states, which Russia says are also spying on it. Without giving details, one Russian security source, obviously proud of the public news of a Russian success in penetrating US intelligence, said yesterday that Mr Ames had been an important agent. Mr Ames's former role in counter-intelligence would have given him access to sensitive details of the CIA's own agents in the former Soviet Union, as well as to the CIA's efforts to ensure that it was not penetrated in turn by the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, US officials appear to be ready to smooth over the row so long as Russia is willing to go through the motions of contrition. Among other gestures, the US would like Russia voluntarily to withdraw those of its diplomats who were involved with Mr Ames. It would also like Russia to refrain from expelling the CIA's station chief in Moscow, which in the cold war years would have been a traditional tit-for-tat measure. Although the CIA is smarting over the discovery of a 'mole' so high in its ranks, the case may help the agency make the case for preserving the US intelligence budget, which has come under fire in Congress as overblown for the post-cold war era. Mr James Woolsey, director of central intelligence, has argued that the CIA is needed more than ever both in tracking new threats such as terrorism or nuclear proliferation, and in economic intelligence, which he has described as 'the hottest current topic in intelligence policy'.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Food and Drink: Guide to the food guides The Good Food Guide (Which? Books Pounds 14.99), in spite of its editors' foibles, has served the UK and its readers well, raising standards and bringing to the judgment of food, wine and service a typically British approach. Amateur in the finest sense of the word, it has relied on readers' letters for restaurant recommendations and has been a commercial success, selling more than 60,000 copies annually with a small staff and limited expenses. But the guide needs to respond to changing circumstances. Its faithful readers are growing older and its younger ones are not in the habit of sitting down and writing letters after every meal to provide it with the raw material it relies on. It offers a Freepost service but an easily detachable fax report form would also be a help. The Consumers' Association has released Tom Jaine, the editor, from his contract and spent several months searching - so far unsuccessfully - for a suitable replacement. Over lunch of risotto with clams and oxtail en crepinette with pureed potatoes at Aubergine, London, SW10 (tel: 071-352-3449) Jaine explained why editing a national guide was becoming increasingly difficult. While standards had risen sharply in London, and culinary fashions have come and gone during his five-year tenure, outside the capital a gastronomic vicious circle prevails. This was created, Jaine felt, by special event eating. Outside London, people tend to eat out less frequently and only when the occasion demands - a birthday, anniversary or wedding. Restaurants have two to three busy days and nights a week, usually at weekends, and so keep prices high. High prices stifle demand, people therefore go out less and the circle is perpetuated. Jaine's gloomy prediction was that in the future only hotels and pubs may survive outside London. (A recent Gallup survey found that the British public prefers staying in and watching television to eating out). The invaluable independence of the Good Food Guide becomes obvious when it is compared with its competitors. The Egon Ronay Guide sponsored by Cellnet (Pounds 13.99) is the most comprehensive, thanks it would appear to close collaboration with the American Express database, but the print is small and the spine and binding inadequate. The AA Best Restaurants in Britain (Pounds 11.99) is sponsored by Abbey Well water and, although the print is clear, the maps are surprisingly poor and the decision to list all restaurants beginning with T together - The Dorchester, The Ivy, The Savoy, but surprisingly not The Ritz - I found confusing. The Ackerman Charles Heidsieck Guide (Pounds 14.99) is as effervescent as one would expect from its association with a champagne house. My main gripe here is that this guide, while informative, is not at all critical. I also find photos of empty restaurants off-putting - one good reason for staying in and watching television. There are even more guides to London restaurants this year. Harden's (Pounds 6.95) remains the most concise, up-to-date (complete with a list of restaurant closures) and most user-friendly in terms of format and price. Its ratings for food, service and ambience, however, have become too restrictive. The first edition of the Evening Standard London Restaurant Guide (Pounds 9.99) is disappointing. Although it benefits from two authoritative, incisive writers, Fay Maschler on food and Andrew Jefford on wine, and has the clout of a big organisation behind it, I was left with two nagging questions. Why did it cost 50 per cent more than the other two London guides and why does it have to have such a smelly plastic cover? This year I have overcome two major reservations against the Time Out Guide (Pounds 6.99) and use it more than any other London guide. Its cover too is awful - as is the Good Food Guide - and its A4 size is inconvenient. But it is comprehensive, including a down-to-earth account of a meal in London's only Burmese restaurant, Maymyo in Herne Hill, and its area index, with restaurants listed by area and then by cuisine, is highly practical. Most of all, I appreciated its breakdown of London restaurants by cuisine. It made me realise that if one is tired of eating out in London one is tired of eating out.</p>

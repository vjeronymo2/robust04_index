			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (18): Not so obscure objects of desire - Cars There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth. Range Rover became a cult car by pure chance. In the 1990s it is the smart car beautiful people everywhere like to be seen in. But it started life as something quite different. Land Rover had been building rough, tough four wheel drives since the late 1940s. British farmers were big customers. Land Rover reckoned that there might be a market for a car a farmer could use on the land all day and then take his wife out in that night. So in 1970, Range Rover appeared as the ultimate dual-purpose car. Only a group of men could have thought that one up. Picture the scene. Farmer proposes an evening out with dinner and theatre. Wife puts on her new frock and high heels. Farmer brings mud-plastered Range Rover, reeking of cow manure, to front door. Wife takes one look and declares: 'If you think I'm getting into that disgustingly filthy thing in these clothes, you must be mad. Get the Jaguar - now]' Like the US cavalry, the horsey set rode to the rescue. Accustomed to hauling hunters behind primitive Land Rovers, they eyed the Range Rover approvingly. With a big V8 engine and full-time four-wheel drive it was perfect for towing a two-horse trailer on the road to meets or across fields at point-to-points. Then a new kind of customer appeared. They did not own chunks of Wiltshire, but hoped to give the impression that they did. Reluctantly at first Land Rover offered them Range Rovers with power steering, four doors instead of only two, automatic transmission and diesel engines. Out went plastic seats and rubber mats; in came Connolly hide and Wilton carpet. Land Rover concedes that at least nine Range Rover owners in 10 never dirty the tyres by driving off tarmac, and that the severest obstacle most climb is a high curb outside a Chelsea restaurant.</p>

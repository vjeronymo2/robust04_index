			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> TAMMY A GRANDMA -- CALL HER AUNTIE  </P> <P> Evangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker rejoiced today over the birth of their  first grandchild and told their radio audience that their son-in-law fainted  twice in the delivery room.  </P> <P> James Martin Chapman, weighing 6 pounds, 10 ounces, was born Saturday to the  Bakkers' 18-year-old daughter, Tammy Sue, and her husband, Doug Chapman, 26, at  Piedmont Regional Hospital in Rock Hill, S.C.  </P> <P> Tammy Faye Bakker said she loves the baby but not her new title. "Grandma --  isn't that awful?" she said. "I think I'll look for a new name -- something  like Ta Ta or Auntie Tammy." Tammy Faye said the baby has her eyes. "It came  out with these big, bright sparkly eyes and it was licking its lips," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Rates tense The Bank of France's decision to increase its emergency lending rate yesterday sent further tremors through European money markets, writes Stephanie Flanders. French cash rates rose sharply after the Bank of France's raised interest rates in the morning. They continued to face upward pressure as the currency drama continued, with investors striving to cover short franc positions. One month rates rose to 10.5 per cent on the bid side, up nearly 250 basis points, while three month rates ended the week nearly 100 basis points higher than Thursday's close, at around 8.90 per cent on the bid side. Trading in French futures initially painted a rather different picture, because some thought that the crisis meant lower French interest rates by the autumn, whatever happened to the franc in the meantime. The September Pibor contract rose over 25 basis points during the morning, but the confusion was such that it retreated rapidly in the afternoon, closing 5 basis points down at around 92.62. 'The fact that at one point we had the September Pibor, cash rates and the French stock market all going up at the same time shows just how uncertain the situation is,' commented Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global Markets in London. In German money markets, events were dictated early on by the Bundesbank's decision to issue three-day treasury bills at a rate of 7 per cent. The issue was intended to remove some of the excess liquidity caused by the last few day's interventions, which otherwise might have sent call money rates down to dangerously near the 6.75 per cent official intervention rate. The immediate result was a fall in German call money rates to around 7.02 per cent, compared with Thursday's level of 7.15 per cent. But observers pointed out that by leaving the treasury bill rate at 7 per cent, the German central bank had conspicuously failed to signal a cut in official interest rates at Thursday's council meeting. 'In the past', said Julian Callow of Kleinwort Benson, 'the Bundesbank has cut the three-day treasury bill rate to the discount rate, or even lower, prior to reducing the discount rate itself. The fact that it chose not to do so suggests to the market that it does not want to cut rates.'</p>

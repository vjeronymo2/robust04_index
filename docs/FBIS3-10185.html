According to the poll, at  least 63.7 percent of deputies and senators would vote for a  constitutional amendment eliminating Petrobras' [Brazilian  Petroleum Corporation] exclusive right to prospect for and  exploit petroleum. The proposal, with majority support in  Congress, provides for maintaining the union's monopoly, with  the possibility of opening the sector to private enterprises  through concessions.    This is the main result of an IBEP questionnaire that 104  deputies and 25 senators, classified by party, ideology, and  region, answered during the first week of February. Of the 64.7  percent who favored the idea of the government granting  petroleum concessions, 20.5 percent believe that the change is  "necessary for promoting competition, to the benefit of  consumers"; 16.5 percent maintain that this formula will  preserve "national interests"; while 15.2 percent believe that  it is "necessary for meeting the fuel demand." For 12.5 percent  of those polled, the end of the monopoly is "inevitable" because  of the lack of public funds for investment.    The polled sample, which covered 20 percent of the Chamber  of  Deputies and 30 percent of the Senate, reveled that some  congressmen consider "insufficient" the proposal made by IBEP.  Of those polled, 5.8 percent favor a radical change to move the  public sector even farther away from controlling the economy.  Only 25.5 percent of polled congressmen do not want the end of  the state monopoly, arguing that it is "not necessary" (9.8  percent); "harmful to national interests" (9.4 percent); and  "harmful to Petrobras interests" (6.3 percent). Only 4 percent  of those polled declined to give an opinion.    The Constituent Congress also supports the liberalization  trend in the electric power, telecommunications, mining, and  petrochemical sectors. According to IBEP data -- this  enterprise has regularly evaluated congressmens' opinions since  July -- a majority of deputies and senators want those sectors  to be "jointly run" by the state and private eneterprises. In  this poll, 55.9 percent of congressmen supported the "joint  management" option -- details of which were, however, not given  -- for the electric power sector and 47.2 percent for the  telecommunications infrastructure field.    The same trend was observed in the mining sector: 49.6  percent of those polled believe that "joint management" would be  ideal, 40.2 percent believe that those areas should remain in  private hands, while only 6.3 percent want them to remain in  state hands. In the petrochemical field, 80.4 percent of those  polled favored either the "joint management" or "private sector"  options. Those polled also favored privatization of port  services.    Other data from the poll strengthen the indication that the  Constituent Congress does not have the nationalistic features of  the National Constituent Assembly (1987-1988) which designed the  current Constitution. The majority of deputies and senators  (55.9 percent) believe that the different legal and taxation  conditions applying to Brazilian enterprises with local capital  and to Brazilian enterprises with foreign capital, which are  provided for in the Constitution of 1988, are "undesirable."  According to the so-called "liberal" congressmen, elimination  of these restrictions can produce a regular inflow of foreign  investment into the country.</p>

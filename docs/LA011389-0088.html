			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ARRIVALS;  </P> <P> CAVALIERS, ONCE THE NBA'S DOORMATS, NOW ARE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR  </P> <P> Once, there was a pro basketball team so laughingly mismanaged, so lacking in  talent and support that it made the Clippers, Indiana Pacers and other National  Basketball Assn. have-nots seem successful by comparison.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, the Cleveland Cavaliers defined futility in professional  sports. They were owned by the notorious Ted Stepien, the poor man's George  Steinbrenner. They dealt away promising players and draft picks with such  frequency that league officials had to intervene. They were called the  Cadavers.  </P> <P> But not anymore. The team that will play the Lakers tonight at 7:30 at the  Forum is nothing like those abysmal Cleveland teams earlier in the decade.  </P> <P> Though it may strike some as incredible, Cleveland has the NBA's best record at  25-6. The Cavaliers, whose franchise-record 11-game winning streak was ended at  Seattle Monday night, lead the Central Division by 4 games over the Detroit  Pistons, one of last season's championship finalists, and by 5 over the  star-saturated Atlanta Hawks.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers have accomplished this restoration with planning, stability,  leadership and, most of all, talented young players. A laughingstock in the  early '80s and a rebuilder in the middle of the decade, Cleveland, as Magic  Johnson recently said, may be the team of the '90s.  </P> <P> Indications are, however, that the precocious Cavaliers may reach that level  sooner, perhaps even this season.  </P> <P> Under the stable ownership of the Gund brothers, George III and Gordon, the  savvy reconstruction of General Manager Wayne Embry and the patient teaching of  Coach Lenny Wilkens, the Cavaliers seemingly have the talent and temperament to  mount a serious challenge in May and June.  </P> <P> They have one of the league's best transition offenses, led by guards Ron  Harper and Mark Price, who account for an average of 38 points a game. They  have a formidable inside game, due to Brad Daugherty, perhaps the NBA's best  young center, and all-star forward Larry Nance.  </P> <P> Their swarming, rotating defense has held opponents below 100 points in 20  games, 19 of them victories. They also have a mostly veteran supporting cast,  led by John (Hot Rod) Williams, that has been favorably compared to Detroit's  deep bench.  </P> <P> It seems that all that the Cavaliers lack is experience. So far this season,  though, their immaturity has surfaced only occasionally. Until the last-second  loss to the SuperSonics, Cleveland's last defeat was by the Lakers on Dec. 13  at the Richfield Coliseum. That game also was the Lakers' last road victory.  </P> <P> But NBA skeptics look at Cleveland's youth and believe -- hope? -- that playoff  pressure will postpone the Cavaliers' charge until the '90s.  </P> <P> "Ever since we went 8-0 in the (exhibition) season, I think people were  thinking we were going to fall apart in the regular season," Harper said. "It  just showed that a bunch of young players who play together can win games. Once  we get to the playoffs, if we get the home-court (advantage), ain't no telling  what we can do."  </P> <P> Embry's enthusiasm, however, is more temperate.  </P> <P> "You never know with a young team," he said. "I guess people would have a right  to be skeptical because of our youth. But also, young teams are unpredictable.  </P> <P> "We are very conservative. We know the NBA. We are in a very tough division. It  could change. But our attitude is, let's not get carried away with what our  record is, because it's not important. Let's just be pleased with our progress,  because we haven't won anything yet." Actually, they already have won something  -- respect from the rest of the league.  </P> <P> Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff recently proclaimed: "I don't see any  weaknesses there."  </P> <P> Pat Riley, the Lakers' coach, said he detects similarities in the current  Cavaliers and the Lakers, circa 1980.  </P> <P> "It's an innocent climb they are making," Riley said. "It's got to be a fun  time for them, because they are learning about themselves. We were that way in  1980. I guess we should check back in 9 years and see if (the Cavaliers) are  still together.  </P> <P> "They know they are talented, but they don't have to play yet with a lot of  expectations. It's easy to play from that position. It's going to be  interesting to see if they can sustain it in the second half of the season. I  think they will."  </P> <P> Wilkens, always the cautious type, stopped short of making any claims after the  loss to Seattle in the opening game of the Cavaliers' Western trip.  </P> <P> "I don't know if we're an elite team yet," he said. "But we are a very good  team."  </P> <P> This development has not taken place overnight. Or over a season, either. It  began back in 1983, when the Gunds mercifully bought the team from Stepien and  vowed patience and persistence in trying to build a winner.  </P> <P> They took a major step toward that in the summer of 1986, hiring Embry as  general manager and Wilkens as coach. Just before their official appointments,  the Cavaliers had a bountiful draft, which Embry helped supervise.  </P> <P> That draft week was an unusual time for Cavalier management. Embry was in  transit between a lesser position at Indiana, and, with the league's blessing,  he advised both the Pacers and Cavaliers on prospective first-round picks.  </P> <P> After trading Roy Hinson to Philadelphia to receive the first overall pick of  the draft from the 76ers, the Cavaliers selected North Carolina's 7-foot 1-inch  Daugherty, who was said by some to be too soft to dominate in the NBA.  </P> <P> Then, with the eighth overall pick, which the league sold to the Cavaliers to  make amends for Stepien's mistakes, they selected Harper, from Miami of Ohio.  </P> <P> That week, the Cavaliers also learned that Williams, who was drafted in 1985  and is now a valuable sixth man, had been cleared of point-shaving charges at  Tulane and was eligible to play.  </P> <P> And finally, amid all the other draft-day activity, the Cavaliers completed  what appeared to be a less significant deal by acquiring the draft rights to  Georgia Tech's Price from the Dallas Mavericks for a second-round pick and  future considerations. Gordon Gund has called it the most important week in the  franchise's history.  </P> <P> And Embry said: "That draft gave us a good foundation. We got a quality center  and two guards."  </P> <P> In 1986-87, Harper was the runner-up in the NBA's rookie-of-the-year balloting  and Daugherty showed promise, but Price did not immediately live up to  expectations, and the painfully young Cavaliers finished 31-51, missing the  playoffs.  </P> <P> Last season, however, Price's outside shot returned, enabling Embry to trade  guard Kevin Johnson, the club's 1987 first-round pick, along with Mark West,  Tyrone Corbin and the 1988 first-round pick to Phoenix for Nance and Mike  Sanders.  </P> <P> Embry said that he hesitated giving up a first-round pick but that he and  Wilkens belived that the Cavaliers needed to improve their inside game with  Nance, who is averaging 18.3 points and 8 rebounds this season, and their  half-court game with Sanders, a former UCLA star.  </P> <P> Not long after the trade was completed in February, the Cavaliers' new  combination began to thrive. They won 11 of their last 13 regular-season games  before being bumped off in the first round of the playoffs by the Chicago  Bulls.  </P> <P> All along, Embry and Wilkens have concentrated on bolstering the Cavaliers'  bench. Journeyman Craig Ehlo was signed in 1986 and has become a defensive  specialist. Reserve center Chris Dudley, from Yale by way of Solana Beach, was  taken in the fourth round in 1987. Guard Darnell Valentine was acquired from  Miami for a second-round draft pick. And Tree Rollins was signed as a free  agent to back up Daugherty and, as it turned out, Dudley.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers have seemingly made all the right moves, for once. But at the  time, question marks abounded:  </P> <P>  -- Could Daugherty be the dominant center around whom to build a team?  </P> <P> Daugherty's critics labeled him not aggressive enough, a criticism similar to  what Kareem Abdul-Jabbar heard coming out of UCLA in 1969. "I watched him from  the time he was a freshman to his senior year, and he showed tremendous  improvement each year," Embry said of Daugherty, who is averaging 19.1 points  and 9 rebounds. "He was only 20 coming out of college, which meant there was  greater growth in the future.  </P> <P> "Whoever gave him that soft label is certainly mistaken. He's anything but  soft. In fact, his body's still toning up more. I've always liked his touch  around the basket and his fundamental skills. Very seldom do you find a center  that passes the way he does."  </P> <P>  -- Could Harper, despite his outstanding rookie season, develop an outside  shot to give him a complete offensive game?  </P> <P> A 6-foot 6-inch guard whose specialty is driving to the basket, Harper averaged  22.9 points and 4.8 assists as a rookie. But last season, he missed 24 games  with a sprained ankle and shot just 46% from the field, and his scoring average  dipped to 15.4.  </P> <P> However, Harper said that over the summer, he worked at developing a better  outside shot to augment his drives to the basket. This season he leads the  Cavaliers with a 20.6 scoring average and is shooting 51.7%.  </P> <P> "Last year, everybody was saying I was through," Harper said. "So I went home  and worked hard on my game, trying to add something new. Everybody thought that  I could just go to the hole. But I'm still developing as a player."  </P> <P>  -- Which Price would show up in 1988-89, the one who shot 40.8% his rookie  season or the one who shot 50.6% last season?  </P> <P> This was a $5-million question to the Cavaliers. During the off-season,  Washington signed Price to a 5-year, $5-million offer sheet, which the  Cavaliers promptly matched. Price is currently the team's fourth-leading scorer  at 17.7, is shooting 51.4% and has made 24 3-point shots.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of things going on my first year," Price said. "I wasn't  playing a lot of minutes. I had to adjust to the NBA. Plus, I was out a month  after an appendectomy. After that, I wasn't in playing shape the rest of the  season. It was a real struggle. But last season, I was healthy and things  turned around."  </P> <P> Price improved his scoring average from 6.9 points in 1986-87 to 16 last  season. Not coincidentally, his salary went from $175,000 to $1 million. "I  can't go out thinking I have to prove I'm worth a million dollars," Price said.  "I've played pretty well this season, but I only know one way to play. I can't  change that, no matter what I'm paid."  </P> <P>  -- Could Wilkens, who reportedly lost his job in Seattle in 1985 because of a  perceived inability to relate to a young team, handle this collection of NBA  prodigies?  </P> <P> "Absolutely," Embry said. "Lenny's demeanor, meaning his patience and teaching  abilities, is very compatible to coaching younger players. He's obviously  proven he can coach. He's calm, but he can be firm. He has demonstrated the  ability to establish discipline, too."  </P> <P> Thirty-one games into the season, the Cavaliers have answered every question  and almost every challenge. But, perhaps a little surprised themselves,  Cavalier players say they are not looking beyond tonight's meeting with the  Lakers, who handed the Cavaliers only their second loss in the last 14 games.  </P> <P> "I don't think any of us thought we'd have the kind of record we have at this  point," Price said. "It's a long season. Everybody knows we can't continue at  this pace. But we're trying to be consistent. We still have Detroit and Atlanta  to deal with during the season and eventually in the playoffs. Those teams will  be tough to beat, since they've been there before. That's where we're trying to  get to."  </P> <P> As good as the Cavaliers are now, the scary thought to the rest of the NBA has  to be the possibility that they will get significantly better. After all,  Daugherty is 23, Price and Harper are not yet 25 and Williams is 26.  </P> <P> "I think we can get better because of our youth," Embry said. "Even Larry  (Nance) is just 29, and there still is growth to be had with our youth  players."  </P> <P> Said Harper: "We're still trying to learn the game of basketball. We're  definitely gonna get better."  </P></p>

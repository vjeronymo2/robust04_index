			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades Matsushita debt rating MOODY'S has downgraded the long-term debt ratings of Matsushita Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturer. It was one of just two Japanese companies which had held a triple-A rating from the US credit rating agency. Matsushita's rating, as well as that of three of its subsidiaries, was downgraded to Aa2 from Aaa. The subsidiaries are MCA Funding, Panasonic Capital and Panasonic Finance. Moody's also downgraded the long-term debt rating of MCA, the US entertainment group owned by Matsushita but not financially supported by it, to A2 from A1. The revised ratings reflect Moody's concern about weakening fundamentals in Matsushita's core consumer electronics business. Sluggish retail demand in Japan is expected to continue to put pressure on this business, while the depressed capital expenditure is likely to hit the group's information, communication and industrial equipment businesses, Moody's said. Japan's consumer electronics market has been further depressed by a lack of new products. In November, Matsushita reported a 66 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year to March 1993.</p>

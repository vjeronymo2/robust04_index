			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Christian Salvesen rises 12% CHRISTIAN Salvesen, the distribution, specialist hire and manufacturing group, yesterday announced slightly higher than expected profits and a 10 per cent dividend increase. Pre-tax profits rose 12 per cent, from Pounds 36.1m to Pounds 40.4m, in the six months to September 30, helped by strong growth from mobile power generator hire and steady gains from UK distribution. All divisions increased profits except for Salvesen Brick, the specialist brickmaker which continued to suffer from lower prices. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said the group's main markets were affected by recession. 'Despite that, we're well ahead,' he said. The distribution division, where customers include Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury, increased operating profits 8 per cent to Pounds 16.8m. New contracts helped profits in the US and Benelux, although the lorry drivers' strike reduced profits in France by Pounds 250,000. The loss-making Langnese-Iglo contract in Germany, which was fully provided against in previous years, was terminated on November 30. Aggreko, which hires out power and temperature control equipment, escaped the downturn in UK construction because of its wide customer base. Profits increased 33 per cent to Pounds 15.4m. About Pounds 1m of profit came from supplying equipment to the Barcelona Olympics. Manufacturing, which includes food services, saw profits fall Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 10.3m after the brick division's profits fell Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.5m. Turnover increased 3 per cent to Pounds 254.5m while operating profits gained nearly 12 per cent to Pounds 43.6m. Interest costs were Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 2.9m). Proceeds from the Pounds 28.5m sale of Salvesen (Oilfield Technology), where Pounds 11.2m was booked as an extraordinary profit, helped reduce net borrowings Pounds 20m to Pounds 60.7m. Gearing fell from 35 per cent to 23 per cent. Earnings increased to 10.12p (9.01p). The interim dividend is lifted to 3.2p (2.9p). COMMENT These figures earned well deserved applause and Salvesen's shares gained 15p to 346p, an all time high. Distribution continued to provide the backbone and although markets such as the UK look mature, there is further growth in Europe. But Aggreko was the star performer, even discounting the one-off gains in Barcelona. Its strengths are that it makes its own equipment and owns its distribution network, allowing healthy margins and flexible deliveries. The same advantages are now being applied to temperature control equipment, recently introduced in Europe from the US, and initial results are promising. Full year profits of Pounds 74m put the shares on more than 18. This does not look excessive. But after rising nearly 40 per cent in the last year, the shares may need a breather once follow through buying from the results dies down.</p>

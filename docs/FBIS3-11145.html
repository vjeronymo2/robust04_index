			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jose Angel Talavera, alias El Chacal, head </F> of the 3-80 Northern Front, by Luis Adolfo Diaz and an  unidentified reporter on 16 March in Caulatu; from the "Trench"  newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Talavera] In the agreements recently reached with  the government, we were promised that land would be given to  3-80 Northern Front combatants to help them return to civilian  life. At a meeting on 15 March, certain difficulties and  problems arose, which hindered the demobilization of some of the  3-80 Northern Front's fighters -- a demobilization scheduled for  16 March. These people need to rejoin civilian life because  these peasants do not have... [pauses] they live in abject  poverty; they have no place to live; and so on.    They have been hoping that the government will give each of  them a small plot of land, enough to survive, and that they will  be given technical and financial assistance, as was agreed in  past negotiations. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta, who  represents the government in these talks, said he was acting in  good faith, but he noted that decisions are made in Managua. He  added that the land problem had to be resolved in Managua and  reviewed in Managua with various ministers -- I think  specifically with Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo.    In turn, today we suspended the surrender of weapons of  150-200 combatants. The government and the 3-80 Northern Front  agreed to discuss this issue in Managua over the next four days.  We have a representative there who is talking to the government  in an effort to find a way for the government to buy or give  plots of land to these peasants to allow them to rejoin civilian  life the day they surrender their rifles. This has to be done  so they can start working.    [Diaz] How did Minister Mendieta explain the fact that the  government is now claiming it is unable to keep its promise,  especially given that, when the first 100 men surrendered their  weapons, he said the government would indeed comply and that it  was capable of complying?    [Talavera] There is problem; there is a problem with the  central government. I do not know whether President Violeta  Chamorro has failed to authorize all of the available resources  to ensure that all demobilized 3-80 Northern Front commando  units rejoin civilian life. Nevertheless, we are witnessing a  huge difference between promises and actions. This creates  distrust among those peasants planning to demobilized. They are  conveying these feelings to us. These people were prepared to  demobilize today.    They told us they were very disappointed in the government  because they were extremely interested in surrendering their  rifles, rejoining civilian life, and farming the land. I do not  know whether the failure to comply was caused by a lack of  maturity or responsibility on behalf of the government. The  government has failed to comply with a promise it is completely  capable of complying with. We know perfectly well that it has  funds. The government spends a lot of money on other less  important areas. This, however, should be a high priority area,  because peace would be established throughout northern  Nicaragua. All of these combatants would be contributing to the  country's economy.    [Reporter] Why are negotiations not being held in Managua  with the Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] Higher Council, instead of  here in Caulatu?    [Talavera] We are working on that. We will see if the  government allows us to hold the next meeting in Managua to put  an end to this phase of violence in northern Nicaragua. If this  happens, we will have a chance to talk with members of the  cabinet, and the ministers can come up with solutions for these  people to enable them to finally rejoin society.    [Reporter] Do you need the government's permission to go to  Managua?    [Talavera] Obviously we need the government's permission, as  stipulated in the agreements.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Talavera] Yes, international observers have limitations  too.  They have told us that without the central government's  permission, they cannot transfer from here to Managua any  combatant of the 3-80 Northern Front who has not demobilized or  who does not have an I.D. card issued to demobilized members.  It is the government's responsibility.    [Reporter] Do you not feel like a prisoner in these  enclaves?    [Talavera] Not really. Of course, I believe there is some  disadvantage in holding the negotiations in this area instead of  in Managua, where talks would have more coverage. If that were  the case, the government would have to be more sensitive to  national and international repercussions because we would have  more chances to talk with domestic and foreign journalists.  This could benefit us in the sense that, although it is  feasible to find a peaceful solution for violence in the  northern region, this subject has not been accorded the  importance it deserves.    [Reporter] What if the government does not allow you to go  to  Managua to conduct this phase of the negotiations?    [Talavera] I believe this is something the government can  do.  If there is real willingness, I believe the government will  permit a delegation of the 3-80 Northern Front staff to travel  to Managua to follow up on the negotiations and put an end to  violence in northern Nicaragua. The government has the last  word. We in the 3-80 Northern Front are willing to lay down our  weapons, but we demand compliance with the agreements. We hope  the agreements do not turn out to be empty promises, as in  previous years with the RN.    [Reporter] Commander Chacal, the RN Higher Council will meet  with the economic cabinet tomorrow. What actions will the RN  Higher Council take on your behalf to expedite your  demobilization?    [Talavera] They have plans. They will have the chance to  meet with several cabinet members. We have confidence in the  representatives of the RN Higher Council. This will be their  first opportunity to review the RN's problems in general. They  have our confidence and our full support. We hope the  government will listen to them, and that it will not merely make  empty promises as it has done in the past. We hope specific  agreements will be reached tomorrow at the meeting with  representatives of the RN Higher Council.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: James Beattie falls to Pounds 6.83m Profits at James Beattie, the West Midlands-based stores group, declined from Pounds 7.73m to Pounds 6.83m pre-tax over the year ended January 31. Sales, excluding VAT, improved 10 per cent to Pounds 74.6m. Investment income and interest fell 24 per cent to Pounds 1.89m. Earnings per share slipped to 9.8p (11.3p) but an increased final dividend of 4.6p lifts the total from 5.75p to 6p. The directors said the results were achieved in a retail climate 'dominated by unremitting trading pressures throughout the year.' The company is due to open its ninth store, at Aylesbury, in September.</p>

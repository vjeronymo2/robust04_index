			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Money back if the quality is right - In A Nutshell Ten per cent of businesses which qualify for the BS5750 quality assurance standard recoup their costs within two years while half recover expenditure within three years, according to a survey by SGS Yarsley, the third largest UK certification organisation. The average cost of registration for companies employing more than 75 people is Pounds 70,000, comprising registration fees of Pounds 6,000, consultancy fees of Pounds 4,000 and internal staff costs. Savings were made on overtime payments, administration, cutting out unnecessary procedures and staff productivity, the survey of 100 companies showed. Fifty two per cent of companies registered because of pressure from large customers; 21 per cent to improve efficiency; and five per cent to cut waste. While just over 7 per cent of UK companies are wound up each year only 0.2 per cent of BS5750 companies fail, SGS said.</p>

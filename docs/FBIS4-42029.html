			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kiev [no date as received] -- Five  representatives of the World Bank's preparatory mission who were  working here 6-27 June held their concluding meeting today at  Ukraine's Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs. From the  Ukrainian side, the following took part in the meeting: Yuriy  Karasyk, Ukraine's minister of agriculture and foodstuffs; Borys  Kyrychenko, chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture and  Foodstuffs' directorate for foreign economic ties; and Mykola  Shkarban, chairman of the Association of Ukrainian Farmers.    The experts from the World Bank submitted for consideration  a  memorandum of a project for the restructuring of Ukraine's  agriculture. It defines the structure of a possible guarantee  fund for the preliminary financing of agricultural export,  develops the structure for the supply of resources for  agricultural production, and proposes assistance in creating  land registry schemes, etc. According to the project, the  granting of technical assistance will begin in September or  October.    As Mykola Shkarban, chairman of the Association of Ukrainian  Farmers, informed a UNIAN correspondent, the World Bank is  allocating $20-30 million for the restructuring of Ukraine's  agriculture, of which $10 million is for an appraisal of the  country's land resources. However, in total the World Bank  could, as part of this project, allocate $1.2 billion but this  amount will be allocated only on condition that the Ukrainian  Government fulfills the following demands: controls emission,  reduces the budget deficit to a minimum, and lifts restrictions  on exports and creates a single system of hard currency  conversion. However, in Mykola Shkarban's words: "Ukraine is  not fulfilling these conditions and is not likely to do so in  the near future and that is why we will receive only the  projected $20-30 million from the World Bank. In addition, the  shortage of private regional companies engaged in supplying  means for agricultural production (they make up 15 percent of  the total while the remainder is carried out by the  Ukrahrotekhservis and Ukrahrokhim concerns) significantly  hinders the expansion of investment in Ukraine. The amount  invested, therefore, depends on expanding the network of such  private dealers. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 25 (YONHAP) -- Pusan subway workers went  on strike Saturday morning, joining their colleagues in Seoul  and on the National Railroads and worsening the country's  transportation woes on the third day of the work stoppage.    On the national railroads, sharply reduced train runs  continued for the third consecutive day as only 1,161 striking  workers, or 16.3 percent of the roughly 7,000 strikers, had  notified the government as of 10:00 A.M. Saturday of their  intention to return to work.    To normalize train operations, the Korean National Railroad  will utilize some 100 novice locomotive engineers starting next  Monday and train more engineers next month, depending on the  number of returning strikers, Korean National Railroad  Administrator Choe Hun told reporters.    He added that his office has decided to sack 210 striking  engineers for their roles in the walkout.    In view of the strike's grave effect on exports, Choe said,  the emergency railroad transportation program would put emphasis  on hauling cement, oil and containers.    He stressed that he has no intention of talking with  Chongihyop, the private "unregistered" union of locomotive  engineers which is leading the strike, to brush off the attempt  by "some impure-minded engineers to resolve the problem  illegally."    Chongihyop has asked the Korean National Church Council to  mediate between it and the Korean National Railroad, a request  that the council has accepted.    On the other hand, Seoul subway lines managed to maintain  near-normal operations thanks to the utilization of 217  non-striking engineers. But on lines run by the Korean National  Railroad, including Seoul-Inchon and Seoul-Suwon, train run  intervals were between 30 and 40 minutes.    As of 11:00 A.M., 2,704 striking workers, 34 percent of the  8,724 Seoul subway workers, had returned to their jobs, up some  1,000 from Friday. But only 30 engineers had returned, or 3  percent of the 1,300 engineers who joined in the strike.</p>

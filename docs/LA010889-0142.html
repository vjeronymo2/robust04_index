			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ART NOTEBOOK: L.A.'S 'ART AGAINST AIDS' -- A CREATIVE CONTRIBUTION TO FINANCING  THE BATTLE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles art world is mobilizing for "Art Against AIDS," a fund-raising  campaign to benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles and the American Foundation for  AIDS Research. More than 200 artists have contributed paintings, drawings,  photographs and sculptures to the campaign, which will be capped with a VIP  dinner at the home of campaign co-chairs Ted and Susie Field.  </P> <P> Plans -- including entertainment and guests' names -- are still in formation  for the Jan. 29 celebration. Tickets are $1,000.  </P> <P> An inaugural exhibition/reception at the Murray Feldman Gallery on Dec. 14  raised $700,000 and drew top names from West and East Coast society, as well as  dozens of artists, buyers and browsers.  </P> <P> Works have been donated by artist committee co-chairs David Hockney and Sam  Francis, as well as Ed Ruscha, John Baldessari, Jonathan Borofsky and Dennis  Hopper. In addition, the campaign and benefit committees include many of the  city's notable philanthropists and arts patrons, including Jane and Michael  Eisner, Edythe and Eli Broad, David Geffen, Ariadne Getty, Veronique and  Gregory Peck, Richard Koshalek and Rusty Powell.  </P> <P> Said Hockney: "It is particularly poignant that the creative community so  ravaged by AIDS has rallied together to fight the disease."  </P> <P> The exhibition is free and open to the public through Jan. 29 before moving to  San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis and other U.S. cities. For information  about "Art Against AIDS" or the Jan. 29 dinner, call (213) 552-6922.  </P> <P> "Art Against AIDS," The Murray Feldman Gallery, 8687 Melrose Ave. (in the  Pacific Design Center), West Hollywood. Open Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m.  to 6 p.m., and Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.  </P> <P> BRAUER'S HOUR: More than 30 watercolors and gouaches by Arki Brauer will be on  display at Jack Rutberg Fine Arts beginning Saturday.  </P> <P> Among the most renowned of modern-day Viennese artists, Brauer was a co-founder  of the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. His works, characterized by  visionary Utopias populated by amorphous creatures, have led to exhibits in  many of the modern art museums of Europe. Brauer is designing the Brauer House,  an architectural commission from the city of Vienna.  </P> <P> The exhibit concludes Feb. 28.  </P> <P> Jack Rutberg Fine Arts, 357 N. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 938-5222. Open  Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.  </P> <P> DOUBLE VISIONS: The real world rendered surreal is the link between painters  Malinda Beeman and Christopher Warner, whose works will be on display at the  Koplin Gallery until Feb. 4.  </P> <P> Beeman's work, reminiscent of Henri Rousseau, manipulates natural landscapes  with vibrant color and varying perspective. Warner uses composites of differing  natural scenes, from the Los Angeles River to the mountains of his native  Montana, to produce paintings that contrast the traditional American West with  man's alteration of the landscape.  </P> <P> Beeman is an instructor at the University of Houston; Warner was recently  featured in a group exhibition at the Otis Art Institute. This is the first Los  Angeles solo show for both artists.  </P> <P> Koplin Gallery, 8225 1/2 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 656-3378. Open  Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.  </P></p>

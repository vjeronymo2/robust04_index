			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DINING OUT: CONTEMPORARY CUISINE OF NEW ZEALAND IS HOT  </P> <P> There was a time when getting anything more interesting to eat in New Zealand  than roast leg of lamb was chancy at best.  </P> <P> This year, with the country celebrating its 150th anniversary, diners will find  that things have changed dramatically. In cities as well as in small hotels and  lodges in the countryside, restaurants are bringing contemporary cuisine to New  Zealand and making use of the country's extraordinary ingredients.  </P> <P> From kiwi fruit and Granny Smith apples to fish such as orange roughy, New  Zealand's bounty is familiar on U.S. tables. We found that eating the real  thing in the country of its origin is often a different experience.  </P> <P> Orange roughy, a firm white fish with mild flavor -- nice enough, as served in  the States -- reveals a sublety of previously undiscovered texture and flavor  when eaten only hours from the sea.  </P> <P> "We have better and fresher raw ingredients in New Zealand than almost any  country in the world," said Annabel Langbein, director of a company  specializing in developing new markets for New Zealand produce around the  world. She also writes extensively for several food magazines in Australia and  New Zealand.  </P> <P> "The country is small and getting food to market is easy, but it's only been  recently that chefs have begun to realize what is here. Things are changing  rapidly.  </P> <P> "Besides," she said, "bluff oysters are in season."  </P> <P> Never turning down an invitation for oysters, we set out on a whirlwind tour of  Auckland restaurants. Anticipation replaced our jet lag as we settled into a  table at Antoine's.  </P> <P> A small restaurant in an old house, it's an oasis of quiet on a busy street  with lots of nighttime activity. Antoine's is one of the top restaurants in  Auckland, but nothing quite prepared us for the prices. Appetizers were about  $18 New Zealand, main courses about $30 (about $12 and $20 U.S.). We had heard  that New Zealand was a bargain.  </P> <P> This was only our first stop, so we chose a selection of starters. A soupe de  poisson ($15 New Zealand), as flavorful as any in France, came with strong  garlic mayonnaise. Chunks of fresh local fish had been steamed and then tossed  in a lemon cream sauce and served on a tender and crisp pastry shell ($18 New  Zealand). Our favorite, a hot blue vein cheese souffle ($18), was served with  cream on a bed of spinach.  </P> <P> When we opened the souffle we found a perfectly poached egg in the center. The  flavors of cream, blue cheese and poached egg were irresistible. We often read  about dishes like this but seldom see them on menus.  </P> <P> Main courses at Antoine's include a different version of cassoulet, a rich stew  with lamb and venison ($30 New Zealand) and a chicken breast filled with a New  Zealand Bourguignon cheese -- similar to a Brie -- and coated with sesame  seeds, baked and served with a light tomato and fresh basil sauce ($30 New  Zealand).  </P> <P> Then we headed across town to The French Cafe. Next to the post office, The  Cafe was casual and packed with diners. White walls, an open kitchen and a rear  courtyard for dining gave the place a contemporary feeling.  </P> <P> Its prices are reasonable. The menu is eclectic -- with Cajun, Oriental, French  and Italian dishes. We tried stir-fried vegetables ($5 New Zealand), richly  flavorful French fries ($2.80) and char-grilled pork fillets ($10.90), which  were served with a Chinese plum sauce, and a watercress and pear salad.  </P> <P> We didn't try the baked lamb with sweet potatoes, but did sample the sweet  potatoes, a variety raised by the Maori. They were out of oysters.  </P> <P> We ended our evening with a stop at the Verandah Bar &amp; Grill, near where we  began and just down the street from Antoine's. The restaurant is upstairs in an  area of shops and boutiques, and it's always crowded. It's open seven days,  noon to midnight.  </P> <P> Again they were out of oysters. Everyone, it seems, eats bluff oysters in  season, and we were beginning to despair of ever having them. Instead, we chose  dessert and coffee. Tarte tatin arrived slightly warm with a rich caramelized  taste and tender crust.  </P> <P> Growing apples, according to Langbein, is a major New Zealand industry. They  are grown for flavor, not for appearance, so when on sale they usually are not  shiny and waxed. The chocolate cake was suitably dark and heavy.  </P> <P> We also tried the poached pears with a lemon chocolate sauce and heavy cream.  The combination of chocolate and lemon in the sauce was surprisingly good.  Desserts are all $7.90 New Zealand. Large cups of good cappuccino ($2.50) made  a perfect ending.  </P> <P> The next day we headed for Victoria Park Market, which has stalls selling  everything from T-shirts to local crafts. After the night's feasting we thought  a visit to the Victoria food halls and a little light grazing might be in  order.  </P> <P> Although very casual, the fast-food stalls turn out surprisingly good fare,  from chicken wings to hand-cut French fries. The candy market sells all-natural  butterscotch candies, which make a nice dessert.  </P> <P> Dinner in the Longchamp, the dining room at The Regent of Auckland hotel, was  everything Langbein had promised. Chef Serafin Bueno Sanz combines Spanish  influences with the exceptional produce of New Zealand.  </P> <P> We ordered bluff oysters as a first course. Small and plump, they had a  slightly crunchy texture and must rank with the best in the world. These  oysters are never exported.  </P> <P> After the oysters we had a tartare of marinated salmon and crayfish with  avocado, a dish that could have been a disaster had not the ingredients been  totally fresh and full of flavor. A rich chicken consomme followed. It was  accompanied by a deep-fried chicken wing.  </P> <P> Rather than a sorbet, Sanz served us a cold soup of fejoias and lime. The  perfume of the fejoias, a local fruit, created just the right antipication for  a main course of a medallion of veal accompanied by deep-fried crayfish.  </P> <P> Finally, there was a hot lemon souffle filled with marinated apricots. The dish  arrived quivering and slowly began to fall -- the sign of greatness in a  souffle. A small dish of cold caramel parfait, topped with three raspberries,  came with the souffle. This was as Langbein described it: "A very serious  restaurant." The prix fixe dinner came to $78 New Zealand each.  </P> <P> Whenever we asked for restaurant recommendations in Auckland, people invariably  mentioned Moose Lodge in the country near Rotorua. So with only a couple of  days to spare we decided it might be worth the 2 1/2-hour pilgrimage by car  south of Auckland.  </P> <P> Aside from the view it commands out over Lake Rotoiti, Moose Lodge has the  cooking of Noeline Officer to recommend it. She and her husband Errol own Moose  Lodge, and Noeline shops each day to gather the ingredients for her exceptional  dinners that include such specialties as carrot and ginger soup, freshly caught  fish and desserts such as an apricot dacquoise that is worth traveling any  distance for.  </P> <P> Noeline willingly shares her recipes, and we took several home. We have seldom  eaten such food. Everyone gathers for drinks and conversation in the living  room, then sits at a long table with the Officers in the formal dining room.  It's like being invited to a great country house for the weekend.  </P> <P> Guests at Moose Lodge have breakfast and dinner included in the daily rates,  which are $500 New Zealand a day for two.  </P> <P> But all dining discoveries in New Zealand don't have to be grand. Waiting for a  bus in Rotorua we decided to get a quick lunch in a McDonald's -- something we  never do in a foreign country. What we found was surprising -- real shakes with  ice cream and milk and no additives, French fries that really tasted like  potatoes, even hamburgers that tasted of grilled beef and fresh lettuce.  </P> <P> New Zealand has given us some lasting memories of great meals.  </P> <P> Recommended: Antoine's restaurant, 333 Parnell Road.

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): How to work out that CGT bill FOR SOME time, I have been buying investment trust shares through a savings scheme, but I don't know how to calculate liability for capital gains tax when I come to sell them. Suppose I have a given number of shares. The older half was bought when the market was low and the newer half was bought at a dearer price. I sell half the shares. Have I sold the old cheap ones or the new dear ones? If you have been buying the shares monthly (starting after the end of the tax year 1984-85), then this is what you do. 1. Multiply the cost of the first month's purchase by the RPI for the second month, and divide the answer by the RPI for the first month (unless the RPI for the second month is lower than that for the first month - in which case, you simply leave the cost unaltered). 2. Now add the cost of the second month's purchase. 3. Multiply the total by the RPI for the third month and divide the answer by the RPI for the second month (unless the third month's RPI is lower than the second month's - in which case you leave the total unaltered). 4. Now add the cost of the third month's purchase and continue in the same way as before, month by month, up to the last purchase before the sale (provided that the sale took place at least 10 days after that last purchase: see * below). 5. Multiply the total by the RPI for the month of the sale and divide the answer by the RPI for the month of the last purchase (unless the RPI for the sale month is lower than the RPI for the month of the last purchase - or, of course, unless the sale took place in the same month as the last purchase). 6. If you have sold half the shares, then you simply subtract half the total from the proceeds of the sale: the answer is your chargeable gain or your allowable loss. If you have sold a third of the shares, you take a third of the total, of course, and so on. (Between April 1985 and October 1992, these are the months whose RPI was lower than the previous month's: July and September 1985, June and July 1986, July and December 1987, November and December 1990, July 1991, and January and July 1992). *If the sale took place in the nine days after the last purchase (or, by chance, on the same day as that last purchase), then the shares which you sold are treated as coming primarily out of the last purchase (and there is no indexation relief on the cost of that last purchase). The balance of the shares sold come out of the indexed pool, which is calculated along the lines set out above - except that in paragraphs 4 and 5, 'last purchase' should be read as 'penultimate purchase.' If you have been buying the shares quarterly, or at some other interval, the 'second month' and 'third month' in paragraphs 1 to 4 above should read as 'the month of the second purchase' and 'the month of the third purchase.' There is an alternative way of doing the calculations, so we suggest you write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London WC2R 1LB, and ask for a copy of SP3/89 (Unit trust and investment trust monthly savings schemes). The alternative method is too complex to be explained in this necessarily brief reply, unfortunately: SP 3/89 runs to 28 paragraphs. You could also ask your own tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares) and CGT16 (Indexation allowance: disposals after April 5, 1988). If your first purchase was made before April 6 1985, the initial calculations are a little more complex than the rule set out in paragraph 1 above, but the pamphlets will help you to find your way through maze of rules laid down by parliament. (If you have not kept a record of the RPIs published in the FT since you started investing, you should find them in a local reference library - in volume H** of Simon's Taxes, for example). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

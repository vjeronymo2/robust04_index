			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 12 (AFP) -- The United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been authorised to take  aid to some 267,000 Burundian refugees in camps in southern  Rwanda, UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said Tuesday [12 April].    Foa also said that close to 10,000 other people, fleeing the  violence in Rwanda, were seeking refuge in the region.    Some 8,100 refugees had just arrived in Zaire, Foa said,  adding that the information was still incomplete. Among these,  she said, there were 5,000 Burundians who feared an explosion of  violence in their country, 2,000 Rwandans and 1,100 Burundian  refugees from Rwanda.    Foa said the UNHCR had not seen the kind of exodus from  Rwanda it feared might occur, perhaps because people were afraid  to move.    The Burundian prime minister had given the UNHCR permission  to cross the border between Burundi and Rwanda to take supplies  to the Burundian refugees, Foa added.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Optimism on Cyprus talks Turkish and Greek Cypriots are coming close to agreement on the essentials of a package of confidence-building measures on the divided island, the UN special representative, Mr Joe Clark, said yesterday. 'My impression is that at the talks, we are drawing quite close to an agreement on the basic elements,' he said after meeting the Turkish-Cypriot leader, Mr Rauf Denktash in Nicosia. Mr Clark launched the talks between Mr Denktash and Cypriot president Glafcos Clerides on February 17. His deputy, Mr Gustave Feissel, has shuttled between the Turkish and Greek sectors of divided Nicosia to secure agreement. The UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has said he expects an agreement on the package by the end of March.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Markets: Bank stocks; flying so high, falling so low - Wall Street THE WILD and unpredictable swings in share prices this year weeks have left investors understandably light-headed, and none more so than those who follow the banking sector. If the market as a whole has taken investors on a roller-coaster ride, investors in bank stocks must feel as if they have been strapped into the back seat of a jet fighter during an aerial stunt routine. During the first quarter bank shares reached for the sky, with the index of bank stocks compiled by broking house Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods rising 12 per cent in the first three months of the year. It easily outpaced the 3.6 per cent return on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the 4.1 per cent return on the Dow Jones industrial average. Around mid-April, however, the bank sector fell into a dramatic nosedive, and by the end of this week the 12 per cent gain recorded by the Keefe, Bruyette index had suddenly shrunk to a meagre 2 per cent gain. In contrast, after this week's record-breaking rally, the Dow was up 6.7 per cent and the S&amp;P 500 up 3.4 per cent on the year. So, what is wrong with the banks? They have been the centre of attention for the best part of this year because a dominant influence on market sentiment has been a growing fear of a rising inflation rate and higher interest rates, factors which affect banks more directly than any other industry sector. Thus, when investor anxiety over last week's bad inflation numbers peaked this week - at the moment the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee was meeting in Washington DC to discuss whether to change monetary policy in light of the inflation data - bank stocks were in the centre of the firestorm. Of course, bank stocks have fallen so far because they flew so high in the first place. Three factors were behind the first quarter boom in the banking sector: an industry-wide consolidation process that was producing big mergers and takeovers; an improvement in earnings following cost-cutting programmes and a major clean-up of balance sheets; and low domestic interest rates, which boosted banks interest margins - the highly profitable difference between the low interest rates banks pay to depositors on their short-term assets and the higher rates banks earn on their loans and longer term investments. These factors, plus the realisation that the big money-centre banks in New York and San Francisco had put the worst of the Latin America debt crisis behind them, contributed to a feeding frenzy in the sector. After mid-April, however, the of feeding frenzy turned into a selling frenzy. Some damage can be attributed to profit-taking in the wake of a first quarter reporting season that displayed strong earnings across the industry. According to figures compiled by American Banker, net profits at the top 25 banks in the US were 56 per cent higher in the first quarter of 1993 than in the same quarter a year earlier. That sharp improvement was achieved in the wake of a big drop in banks' non-performing assets (down from 2.89 per cent of all assets to 2.06 per cent) and a widening in banks' average interest margin of 17 basis-points. As is often the case, after companies have announced profits that matched or exceeded expectations, investors sell some of their holdings to lock-in gains earned on the good earnings news. Yet the decline in bank stocks was about much more than profit-taking. Given that widening interest margins were a key factor in the strong earnings reports, it was not surprising that when anxiety about higher short-term interest rates took hold, investors, fearing a big squeeze on bank interest margins, began to bale out of banks. Now that the scare over interest rates has temporarily abated, the future should look rosier for bank stocks. Not necessarily. Investors worry that continued weak demand for bank loans, a slowdown in the pace of industry consolidation, and doubts about banks' ability to sustain recent earnings improvements, make the sector unattractive over the intermediate-term. Ironically, investors are shunning bank stocks at a time when Wall Street remains relatively bullish on the sector. In the past week several big brokerage houses, including Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney, have put out buy recommendations on bank stocks. And James McDermott, of Keefe, Bruyette forecasts that earnings per share from the 140 banks he covers will be up 15 per cent in the second quarter of this year. If investors begin to take note of his, and other analysts', optimism, bank stocks could soon be heading for the skies again.  ------------------------------------------- Monday        3449.93   +    6.92 Tuesday       3444.39   -    5.54 Wednesday     3500.03   +   55.64 Thursday      3523.28   +   23.25 Friday        3492.83   -   30.45  -------------------------------------------</p>

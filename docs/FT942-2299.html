			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Japanese bank merger off A Japanese regional bank has pulled out of a finance ministry-inspired merger with two competitors, a setback to government attempts to reorganise the weakest local financial institutions. Mr Yukio Shimodate, managing director of Kita-Nippon Bank, in Morioka, northern Japan, announced over the weekend his decision to withdraw from a proposed merger with bad debt-laden Tokuyo City Bank and Shokusan Bank. The merger would have threatened the survival of Kita-Nippon, he maintained. The plan, proposed in April by Kita-Nippon with MoF backing, ran into intense opposition from customers and businesses, on the grounds that Tokuyo's bad debts would weaken the other partners. A Kita-Nippon consumer group had collected 20,000 signatures opposing the scheme, in an almost unheard of confrontation with government policy. Unions were also anxious that the costs of writing down some of Tokuyo City's estimated Y100bn bad debts would hit bonuses and add to the risk of branch closures. This was to have been the largest of a series of regional bank mergers orchestrated by the MoF in an attempt to encourage them to share costs in the face of growing competition in local banking from Tokyo-based city banks. Most regional banks have a solid client base of local business borrowers, but some second tier banks have built up problem loans from over-lending in the late 1980s. The three in the aborted merger are second tier banks.</p>

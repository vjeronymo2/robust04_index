			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued  the following statement on 31 January in connection with the  United States overturning [twijibo opkko innun] the DPRK-U.S.  agreement for the peaceful solution of the nuclear problem on  the Korean peninsula.    The statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman:    The process of the peaceful solution of the nuclear problem  on the Korean peninsula now faces a grave challenge. The United  States is creating a grave crisis which can lead the situation  to a catastrophe [paguk] at a decisive juncture when the  DPRK-U.S. talks can be rescued from a stalemate and when the  prospects are opened for a package solution of the nuclear  problem.    As is known, the DPRK and the United States agreed toward  the  end of last year that they will hold a third round of talks,  that the United States will stop the Team Spirit joint military  exercise for 1994, and that we will accept a limited inspection  [hanjongdoen pomwiui sachal] necessary to ensure the continuity  of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards on  our nuclear sites, as a present measure for a package solution  of the nuclear problem. Accordingly, with extraordinary  patience and utmost broadmindedness within the framework of the  DPRK-U.S. agreement, we have discussed with the IAEA Secretariat  the scope of the inspection for ensuring the continuity of the  safeguards.    However, the IAEA Secretariat intentionally ignored our  special position of tentatively suspending the validation of  the withdrawal [haengmugi chonpa pangji choyak taltoe hyoryok  palsaengul imsi chongji sikin] from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT], and foolishly attempted to realize an overall  inspection [chonmyon sachal] which is comparable to returning to  the treaty [choyak pokkwie manmongnun], which could be settled  through the DPRK-U.S. talks in the future, rather than an  inspection to ensure the continuity of the safeguards. This not  only clearly contradicts the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement,  but also is a matter which cannot even become an object of  discussion at all at this time when the U.S. nuclear threat,  which brought about our withdrawal from the treaty, remains  unremoved, and when the issue of the IAEA's partiality remains  unresolved.    This notwithstanding, the United States, the party to the  talks, instead of making efforts to correct the improper steps  of the IAEA Secretariat, has completely reversed the promise on  conducting inspections in order to purely guarantee the  continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord. Rather, the United  States is officially urging us to accept the full-scale  inspections [chonmyon sachal] which the IAEA Secretariat has put  forward.    Worse still, the United States has set a time limit and is  assuming an ultimatum-like attitude that if we do not accept the  IAEA's demand, the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks cannot be  held and it cannot but take the road to impose sanctions against  the DPRK.    What is graver is that by once again bringing up the issue  of  conducting special inspections of two military sites which have  nothing to do with our nuclear activity, the United States  stands in the van of the international-pressure commotions  against us. This is a brazen-faced betrayal of the party to the  dialogue.    After all, it becomes clear that the fact the United States  has been busy talking about the solution of the nuclear issue  through talks is a delaying tactic to make a pretext to crush us  and to buy time needed for this.    The United States' anti-Republic crushing maneuvers are  clearly shown in a new war-provocation maneuver which has been  sought in the behind-the-scenes DPRK-U.S. talks. Contrary to  its repeated promise of not using armed forces, including  nuclear weapons, and of not making a threat through armed  forces, the United States is persistently trying to conduct a  large-scale nuclear war exercise against our Republic, including  the Team Spirit joint military exercise.    U.S. official circles are now saying that if the Team Spirit  joint military exercise cannot be conducted, they plan to  continue another joint military exercise against the DPRK and  are openly raving that if the exercise cannot be held in South  Korea, it should be held even in Hawaii.    We have raised the issue of discontinuing the Team Spirit  joint military exercise as a major agenda in the DPRK-U.S.  dialogue. This is aimed not at taking off the signboards of the  military exercise but at basically removing the U.S. nuclear  threat against us.    While enforcing the nuclear war exercise against the  dialogue  partner, the United States assumes the impudent attitude of  claiming that the nuclear issue be resolved. This cannot but be  a mockery of us and a negation of the dialogue itself.    In particular, what cannot be overlooked is that U.S.  hard-line conservative forces are full-fledgedly hurrying to  deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea as one of the attempts to  gain military supremacy over us.    There is no one who believes that the United States--which  employs a smile strategy as if it were interested in withdrawing  the nuclear weapons at talks and which runs wild to deploy  Patriot missiles against the partners behind the scenes--has the  will to resolve issues.    This nonetheless, the U.S. State Department spokesman's  sophistry that the deployment of missiles cannot be regarded as  a provocation of us can be said to be extremely brazen-faced.    The United States' reckless, new war-provocation maneuvers  do  not end here. The U.S. Administration dispatched the director of  the Central Intelligence Agency to South Korea early in the new  year and made a plot to strengthen intelligence gathering on the  North. This strongly implies a full-fledged stage of the  maneuvers for war preparations. It is not difficult to think  that the United States will take a road to find a pretext to  enter a practical military activity.    Considering the facts, it becomes obvious to everyone that  the fact that the IAEA Secretariat has premeditatedly delayed  negotiations with us, waited for the monitoring cameras' film  and batteries to run out, and made the attempt of full-scale  inspections by means of a collusive method of additional  inspections [chuga sachal] is a premeditated U.S. strategy.    All facts clearly show that the United States has no will to  peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and  invariably seeks its inner intention to crush our Republic  through strength.    Regarding the current emergency situation [uigi sanghwang]  evoked by the mean and extremely dangerous traitorous acts of  the United States, the DPRK Foreign Ministry solemnly declares  its position as follows:    First, in the event the United States reverses the promise  made with us, we no longer are bound to the promise made with  the United States [miguki uriwa han yaksokul kkunnae twijipo  omnundamyon urido toisang migukkwa han yaksoge kusoktoeji  anulgosida].    The promises we made with the United States include all the  steps and commitments of good will, such as suspending the  validation of the withdrawal from the NPT, freezing all nuclear  activities, and abandoning the graphite-moderated nuclear  reactor system, which we have unilaterally made for the  U.S.-DPRK talks and for the peaceful solution of the nuclear  problem.    Second, if the United States does not want the DPRK-U.S.  talks, we are not in a position to insist on them. It is a  great miscalculation [kodaran osan] if the United States thinks  the DPRK-U.S. talks is any gift to us. The reason we  consistently insisted on negotiations with the United States  from the first stage of the emergence of the nuclear issue was  to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue, not because we wanted  anything from the United States.    We have lived up to now without relations with the United  States, and we can and will live on ever so.    Third, in the event the United States wants to make any  other  choice, we will also choose the reciprocal countermeasure. [kue  sangunghanun taeung pangdo] The right of choice is not only  that of the big countries. The U.S. hard-line, conservative  forces should take all responsibility for the catastrophic  situation that could come about. The South Korean authorities,  who are thoughtlessly following this, can never be free from  this responsibility.    [Dated] 31 January, 1994, Pyongyang</p>

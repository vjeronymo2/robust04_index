			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Food: Hobbling but still happy in Hong Kong's finest - Grand Hotel / Nicholas Lander puts the Mandarin to the test and comes up smiling HOTEL INSPECTORS and travel writers are continually searching for new ways of putting the top hotels of the world to the test. Some years ago a Sunday paper sent reporters to London's most expensive hotels and demanded a manual typewriter at 2am. My way of putting the Mandarin, Hong Kong to the test was more original, if slightly more painful. When I arrived on my first night I was having trouble walking owing to a ripped muscle. At 8.30 am the following morning I was lying in the doctor's office on the second floor of the hotel awaiting a miracle cure and the end to my distress. The rest of that day was spent in a lonely but very comfortable bedroom looking out, when the rain allowed, at the Hong Kong Club and the hypnotic harbour. Early evening I was ready for a gentle stroll and immediately appreciated the Mandarin's two most coveted assets - its staff and the hotel lobby. First, an assistant manager then a duty manager came to ask about my health. During the rest of my stay I was continually impressed by a level of service that managed to be prompt and professional, polite and yet friendly. The hotel's management structure - an Italian general manager, Chinese and European line management, including one Norwegian and the rest predominantly Chinese and Filipino - may be unusual but it is highly effective. The lobby itself is not large, only 3,000 sq ft, with a raised area the same size comprising the Clipper Lounge, but it is THE place to view le tout Hong Kong. Conveniently located opposite the Star Ferry it is not only the entrance to the hotel but also a thoroughfare between Connaught and Chater Streets. The lobby monitors those who have just come from Kowloon as they scurry to their offices in the Central District and many more who call in for a relaxed drink before the boat home. It is a canvas for the guests to decorate and I sat down and stared unashamedly. The Mandarin - built in 1963 - is ancient by Hong Kong standards and, with only 25 floors, petite (the Crown Plaza nearby, soon to be the tallest building in Asia, boasts 78). Viewed from an incoming Star Ferry it looks squat, almost fat, but very secure. These external characteristics are mirrored internally. When the Mandarin was built land in Hong Kong was less valuable than it is today and the internal walls, a generous 3ft thick, keep out the noise from neighbours and plumbing. However, they also preclude drastic change. In 1963 bidets and separate showers were unheard of and, although no five star hotel would be without them today, this internal solidity still precludes their introduction. The Mandarin management seems acutely aware that its customer profile is changing. The quintessential Mandarin guest of the 1960s and 1970s was invariably a businessman who had time for all the hotel's services. Today's business traveller - younger and with less time - wants shortcuts not initially part of the hotel's makeup. Hence the somewhat incongruous appearance among the Floris collection in the bathroom (sadly, no nailbrush) of a packet of soap flakes and an extendable drying line for those who cannot take advantage of one of attractions of travelling in the Far East - the laundry service. And there is still a 24 hour room service, although there is heated discussion among the hotel management as to whether an electric kettle and instant tea and coffee in the rooms would not go against the Mandarin tradition. But in Hong Kong, with an indigenous population of 5.6m and 120,000 visitors a week, the bedrooms are only a small part of an hotel's raison d'etre. Everyone eats out, and the hotels have not turned their back on non-residents, as is so often the case in London, but instead have converted their restaurants, bars and public areas into bustling meeting places. I never saw the Mandarin's Coffee Shop quiet or the Clipper Lounge without a small expectant queue. In its ten food and beverage outlets the hotel serves more than 3,000 meals a day. More than 60 per cent of the hotel's 950 staff are involved on this side of the operation and there is a tasteful attention to detail - even mundane morning cereal becomes a delight when served with fresh papaya. My only culinary disappointment was the hotel's Chinese restaurant, the Man Wah, in spite of its exciting close-up views of the Bank of China and Hongkong and Shanghai buildings. I knew it was time to pack my bags when the Mandarin lobby began to work its magic on me. Walking out of the hotel's Business Centre I bumped into a friend from the North of England whom I see but once a year - at a wine weekend in the Highlands of Scotland.

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The Centre City Development Corp., the city agency in charge of downtown San  Diego's redevelopment, decided Friday to withdraw a recommendation to increase  densities on three blocks near the waterfront.  </P> <P> The decision delays for now a proposal by Torrey Enterprises, which wanted to  build a skyscraper 500 feet tall on one of the blocks. The tallest building  allowed on the block will remain at about 20 stories, or about 200 feet.  </P> <P> A majority of the CCDC board of directors said any decision on increasing  densities will have to wait until the Navy completes a more detailed plan for  development of its property.  </P> <P> The Navy has plans for a massive reconstruction of its property, consisting of  eight blocks between Pacific Highway and Harbor Drive, south of Broadway.  </P> <P> The Navy's land is next to the block on which Torrey Enterprises wants to  build, and CCDC is concerned about increasing densities and height in the  absence of more details about the Navy's preliminary plans, still several  months from completion.  </P> <P> Torrey Enterprises recently announced plans to build a $90-million, 39-story  office and residential high-rise on the southeast block of Pacific Coast  Highway and E Street.  </P></p>

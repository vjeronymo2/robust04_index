			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: German election sets tone for markets - Currencies Foreign exchanges will start their week digesting political events, but key economic releases will also shape the pattern of trading. The point of departure will be the outcome of yesterday's national poll in Germany. A victory for the ruling coalition of Chancellor Kohl has been widely discounted by the markets. If this result transpires, further D-Mark strength can probably be expected, though the 'good news' is already in the market. The shock outcome would be a more left-oriented coalition. This scenario would cause D-Mark weakness, possibly driving the Bundesbank into raising interest rates to protect the currency. The other important poll was yesterday's Finnish referendum on whether to join the European Union. Good economic prospects, and the prospect of a yes vote, have recently buoyed the Finnish markka, dragging other Nordic currencies in its wake. A yes vote would lend further strength to these currencies, though continued volatility is likely in the run-up to the EU referendums in Sweden and Norway in November. In terms of statistics, the key release will the US trade figures on Wednesday. A number of economists are predicting a large merchandise trade deficit, of about Dollars 17bn, which could prompt a bout of dollar selling. A possible counter would be an improved bilateral trade account with Japan. Some analysts say that the stronger yen, and rising economic growth in Japan, favour this outcome. In the UK, the release on Friday of the third quarter gross domestic product figures will be closely watched. If, as many economists suspect, they show a picture of slowing economic growth, this will underline the pre-emptive nature of last month's rise in interest rates, lending lustre to sterling assets, and sterling. German M3 money supply, and producer inflation, figures are expected this week. Assuming a Kohl victory, they will shed light on the potential for a further fall in official rates.</p>

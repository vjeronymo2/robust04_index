			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Arts: The superficial Mr Director As a piece of liberal journalism, Fay Weldon's 1978 play Mr Director is a lively piece of satire. Debbie, a 14-year-old recurrent absconder who has had an extensive sexual history and three abortions, is under the 'care' of an institution for disturbed girls. Care? Its director is a blase cynic who shirks his responsibilities. His underlings, Marion the frustrated lesbian and Harry the former child molester, place Debbie, as a guinea pig, in the new solitary-confinement box. They switch the temperature up or down to make her 'acknowledge authority'. Now that we know about pin down and other abuses in similar institutions, this set-up is far from ludicrous. But it is also far from being a play. None of Weldon's characterisations are decently fleshed out. She gives glib, sassy thumbnail sketches of her characters  - Manny (Mr Director) also has a rebellious wife, Helen, who brings a reporter, Steve, to investigate the situation - and gives everyone lively dialogue. We get to know a fair deal about five of the characters, and Weldon means us to keep seeing them in different lights. It is, of course, all clever. Manny and Helen are the cleverest of the six characters, and Weldon is clever enough to turn Manny's own wit against him. The best lines go to Helen. She points out, bitterly, that girls like Debbie only get penalised because men are so alarmed by women acting as independent agents in sexual matters. Or, as she puts it, 'Only fuck when fucked'. What men cannot abide in women is 'free quasi-male sexuality.' OK: but never for a moment do we enter these people's nervous systems. Weldon has deflated her characters into pithy cartoon figures. Smart, clear lines; versus a terrible lack of emotional depth and sincerity. At the core is Debbie, who spouts and spouts whenever we are allowed to hear her. Yet, even in a small theatre like the Orange Tree, we seem to be watching her from a great distance. Her spiel sounds like so much verbatim reportage. Michael Elwyn directs this revival. His six actors give performances with as much polish and as little depth as the play. At the Orange Tree, Richmond, until November 27</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Good timing is the key for a flutter on BT3 - Do-it-yourself investor Bernice Cohen provides her own handy guide for those thinking of putting money into the new issue AS A committed DIMI (do-it-myself investor) relying on my own research to manage a share portfolio, I have learned by painful experience that correct timing is as important as good stock selection for achieving profits. So, like thousands of small investors weighing the merits of the BT3 share issue, I ask myself if this is the right time to put money into BT. I use a mnemonic, 'gains are fast,' to search for small capitalisation growth stocks with big prospects. It also proved appropriate for Glaxo, the giant pharmaceutical company, during its outperformance from September 1990 to spring 1992. Many press reports are covering the fundamental aspects of BT but 'gains are fast' incorporates a belt and braces approach, considering both fundamental and technical data. So, how does BT measure up to my criteria? G - growth in earnings per share (EPS) should at least have doubled over the past five years. Astonishingly, for such a huge organisation, BT's EPS more than doubled (from 15.1p to 34p) between 1985 and 1991. Since then, recession and redundancy costs have marred this record, resulting in an EPS for 1992 of only 19.8p. A - annual earnings per share growth should exceed 20 per cent. This year, a profits rebound of more than 46 per cent is forecast widely; accordingly, EPS should recover by more than 20 per cent. I - institutional support helps to improve trading liquidity. The strenuous efforts of lead broker SG Warburg to encourage massive institutional support have been reported widely. This could keep the share price high before the issue is launched - excellent news for hard-pressed UK taxpayers but less promising for small investors. N - new products or management, or a new high in the share price, or niche markets which confer strong growth advantages. BT's early monopoly position enhanced shareholders' returns, but more competition and closer regulation might prevent a repeat performance. S - supply/demand for the shares. Small capitalisation plus demand encourages a rising share price. For BT, the UK's largest quoted company with a capitalisation of more than Pounds 25bn, the supply/demand balance depends crucially on growth prospects. As a major force in the rapidly expanding global telecommunications industry, BT could become a highly attractive investment because it has long-term appeal for two different types of investor: income-seekers and growth-seekers. This decade, BT could be a rare but profitable hybrid - a 'growth utility' generating healthy capital gains with steadily rising dividends. Since 1985, gross dividends have more than doubled. A growth utility is surely the ideal Pep investment. A - ambitious owner/managers are eager for success. Chairman Iain Vallance wants BT to become a global operator, but early attempts were unsuccessful and the 20 per cent stake in MCI is too recent a development to be judged. R - rich in cash companies have no debt. BT is in one of the most cash-generating businesses, with a miniscule 14 per cent of debt. E - efficient management builds leading, not lagging, companies. Efficiency is revealed by savage cost-cutting, vast improvements to customer services, and that astonishing triumph of modern technology - vandal-proof public 'phone booths. F - fundamental facts inform on the present and prospective share price. Forecast profits for 1994 imply earnings per share of about 32p. A price of Pounds 4.30 produces a forward price/earnings ratio of 13.4. This compares with BT's historic p/e of 21, 23 for Cable and Wireless, and 19.6 for Vodaphone. P/e ratios of around 20 suggest the market rates telephone network companies as growth stocks. If the forward p/e for BT reaches 15 by December 1993, the BT share price would rise to Pounds 4.80; by July 1994, a forward p/e of 20 could lift the price to Pounds 6.40. A - act if growth falters. I bale out rapidly on profit warnings, setbacks, or if a chart falls below its uptrend. S - stock market direction. Few shares prosper in falling markets, but the performance of different sectors since the start of 1993 might give clues on BT's position as that rare investment entity, a growth utility. Since December 31 1992, the highest sectors - gold, aerospace engineering and property - have all been classic late cyclical sectors. Meanwhile, traditional growth sectors languish at the foot of the performance tables: food retailing, brewing and distillers, and health and household. Telephone networks show a modest rise. The fact that late cyclical sectors are star 1993 performers suggests we could be nearing the peak of a mature bull market, which is already discounting recovery in the real economy. An investment in BT now could prove timely, as utilities are hot favourites with institutional investors when other sectors look stale or fully valued. T - technical analysis. What does the share price chart imply? I find charts give good guidance on buying and selling decisions, and in assessing the potential for a share price rise. It is impossible to show them in sufficient detail here, but my reading of them suggests that a year-end target price of Pounds 4.80 looks feasible and a target price for mid-1994 of Pounds 5.50 on the fully-paid shares looks possible. To reach Pounds 6.40, though, the price would have to break out of present trends. EPS has fallen over the past five years. But, if both technical and fundamental projections hold, then the prospective capital gain, plus the predicted 13.3 per cent gross dividend yield for this coming year, suggest BT is a good Pep investment proposition now.</p>

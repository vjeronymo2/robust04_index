			<p>BFN     [Text] Odessa [no dateline as received] -- Warships that  have been mothballed here for two years will soon undergo repair  at a specialized Ukrainian Navy shipyard, which is being set up  in cooperation with Odessa enterprise No. 108 and other  specialized enterprises, Ukraine's navy commander Vice-Admiral  Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy told UNIAN on 14 June. He added that the  Ukrainian Navy command had cancelled a contract with the  commercial company FTF [as received] for the repair and  replacement of equipment at the large assault-landing vessel  "Ilya Azarov" and other ships.    "We are planning to use the renovated ships to improve the  combat readiness of fleet units rather than for holiday cruises  in the Mediterranean," Bezkorovaynyy said.</p>

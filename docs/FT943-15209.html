			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: All others are but vanity - Style All things in fashion are cyclical. And the return of the vanity case to the luggage of the international traveller is a perfect example. However, the weighty 'train cases' that Phileas Fogg carried around the world in 80 days, with their inlaid wood compartments and glass bottles, are not quite the thing for today's pacey lifestyle. The most interesting of the new vanity cases are those which are light and yet functional. Although, if you can afford the Sky Caps necessary to carry your luggage, people like Tanner Krolle and Louis Vuitton still make those extraordinary hand-crafted pieces (which become heirlooms to a future generation) and have done so since the Victorian times. Supermodels, usually the first with something practical for the daily flights, are sporting tough-looking cosmetic cases with reinforced edges by She-umura (Pounds 150 at Harvey Nichols) or the plastic vanity case by Bendels of New York in the store's distinctive brown and cream house stripe. This is more squashy - more washbag than handbag - and has foldable trays for jewellery and cosmetics. It goes inside a Prada rucksack or gets held as an extra piece of hand luggage and only needs to accommodate the mini bottle of Evian and a Phillipe Stark toothbrush if you travel extra light. Gucci has a series of travel cases, including a rather serious but well thought out tan leather case at Pounds 470. It has room for bottles and vanity mirror, without being so heavy that you'd need a course of weight lifting before the trip . Gucci's smaller round case (Pounds 145), reminiscent of a 1950s design, would take all the cosmetics you'd need for an overnight stay and fit neatly into a carry on bag. Practical and inexpensive, Herve Chapelier provides the nylon washbag/vanity case, either in blue Oxford stripe or in smart plain navy, mustard red or black. (Stockists 071 589 5755). Prada, the status label of the moment, has several practical nylon bags in every size to fit neatly inside another bag. But Prada does not actually offer the vanity case or its modern interpretation yet.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENENDEZ BROTHER CUT LEG IRONS, DEPUTIES SAY  </P> <P> A chain binding the legs of Lyle Menendez, accused with his brother, Erik, of  murdering their wealthy parents, was found cut nearly through in a Santa Monica  courtroom lockup Friday in what sheriff's deputies reported as an escape  attempt, authorities said.  </P> <P> However, Lt. William Sieber of the sheriff's fugitive warrant escape detail  said he did not know whether the incident constituted an escape attempt.  </P> <P> "We simply know that the (leg) chain was tampered with and with individuals of  this profile it has to be looked into . . . two of the links of the chain had  been cut."  </P> <P> The brothers had been waiting for a morning hearing before Superior Court Judge  James Albracht when a deputy, who was removing Lyle's leg chain, noticed that  the second link on each end of the chain had been cut nearly through, Sheriff  Sgt. Bob Stoneman said.  </P> <P> "It was cut to the point that all it could take was pressure by stepping on  it," Stoneman said.  </P> <P> Later, deputies searched the County Central Jail cells where the brothers are  held and found handwritten documents that may be evidence of an escape attempt  and filed an attempted-escape report, a sheriff spokesman said. However, no  cutting tools were found, Sieber said.  </P> <P> Authorities said they will not know until the handwritten notes are analyzed if  Erik was involved.  </P> <P> Sieber noted that both brothers were still wearing waist chains in the lockup  when the deputies noticed the damaged leg chain. He said if they had tried to  escape, "They would have had to run like penguins."  </P> <P> Lawyers representing the brothers discounted the escape attempt report.  </P> <P> "It wasn't cut through," said Gerald Chaleff, who represents Lyle. "There is no  evidence that they found anything like that. Nobody mentioned to me that anyone  had cut through any chains."  </P> <P> Erik's attorney, Leslie Abramson, said the judge informed the lawyers around  lunchtime that a sheriff's sergeant had advised him that deputies had  discovered a "defective" link.  </P> <P> "Then, the chains were miraculously whipped downtown before we could look at  them," Abramson said. "There never was any evidence that Lyle was sawing his  chains at any time. For all we know they found a defective link in a chain.  </P> <P> "They subjected the boys to very vigorous searches at the courthouse this  morning. They did not find anything. . . . I do not believe for a second that  Lyle or Erik created whatever defect might have been in the chain. And I find  this whole thing remarkably suspicious."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliott Alhadeff, the prosecutor, said he really did not  know much about the escape-attempt report.  </P> <P> "It appears the sheriff is taking it seriously," he said.  </P> <P> The brothers have been held since their arrest in a high-security area of the  jail, and no additional security measures have been taken in light of the  alleged escape attempt.  </P> <P> Lyle, 22, and Erik, 19, were arrested by Beverly Hills detectives in early  March and charged with murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty, in their  Beverly Hills mansion Aug. 20. The brothers pleaded not guilty.  </P> <P> No date has been set for their preliminary hearing as the prosecution and  defense jockey over what evidence can be made public.  </P> <P> The brothers were brought to court Friday for a hearing requested by a  psychologist on whether the tapes of a psychotherapy session should be returned  to him.  </P> <P> Unlike the morning session when they wore civilian clothing, the brothers were  returned to court in the afternoon wearing jail blues.  </P> <P> Judge Albracht barred the public from the courtroom Friday, rejecting appeals  for admission from media attorneys and relatives of the defendants. Lawyers  from both sides met with him behind closed doors to discuss the controversial  tape recordings, said to be the prosecution's key evidence.  </P> <P> The judge said he believes there is a "legal necessity for closing most of  these proceedings," despite objections from lawyers representing three major  news organizations that the action was both unwarranted and unconstitutional.  </P> <P> Cardboard was placed over the windows and an armed sheriff's deputy was  stationed outside the door, as lawyers began wrestling with the issue of  whether taped conversations between the two defendants and their psychologist  are confidential.  </P> <P> Psychotherapy sessions are usually confidential, but prosecutors argued that  threats allegedly made by the defendants in conversation with their Beverly  Hills psychologist, Jerome Oziel, cancel out any requirement of  confidentiality.  </P> <P> The audiotapes were among evidence seized in a search of the psychologist's  Sherman Oaks home in March, hours before the arrest of Lyle Menendez. Erik  surrendered to authorities several days later.  </P> <P> The tapes allegedly contain statements implicating the brothers.  </P></p>

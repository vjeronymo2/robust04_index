			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: United Breweries planning financial restructuring United Breweries, controlled by Mr Vijay Mallya, yesterday told its AGM that it had tabled new financial restructuring proposals to its bankers. In April UB, formerly Wiltshire Brewery, announced that it had breached bank lending agreements after a Pounds 7.2m write-down of the value of its 77-strong pub estate. Guinness Mahon, its adviser, has led the talks with the banks. They include Allied Irish Bank which sold 37 pubs to Wiltshire Brewery in 1992, National Home Loans and Allied Trust Bank. The banks' exposure is less than Pounds 10m. Details of the restructuring plan were not disclosed but they were believed to include at least one proposed UB acquisition.</p>

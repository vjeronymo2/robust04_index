			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- The government is holding  consultations among relevant ministries to raise next year's pay  for civil servants by 6 percent to 7 percent.    The Economic Planning Board [EPB] said Thursday that the  government has already begun detailed calculations to hike  public employees' salaries next year at a rate similar to this  year's 6.2 percent.    In addition to the pay rise, the government is considering  increasing the number of primary and secondary school teachers,  judges and prosecutors slightly. It is also considering a  differential payment of managerial job allowances, which are now  uniformly paid to officials of grade four and above, so that  those doing a good job would receive better treatment.    This year's salary for civil servants is 90 percent of that  for state-run businesses and the government may push its  employees' salaries up to 94 percent next year and 97 percent in  1996. From 1997, pay for officials would be the same as that at  state-run enterprises, according to an EPB official.    Meanwhile, the government will freeze the total number of  employees next year under its principle of "small government,"  except that it will newly employ 2,000 more school teachers and  50 additional judges and prosecutors.</p>

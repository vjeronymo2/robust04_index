			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored by Panama  Bureau through 11 January; source follows in parentheses after  each item.    Social Investment Fund (FIS) sources have reported the FIS  will receive over 270 million quetzals this year through  contributions from government and international agencies. The  sources have explained the FIS will receive 50 million quetzals  from the government, 116 million quetzals from a World Bank  loan, and 104 million quetzals from the German Development  Agency. Foreign financing was made possible thanks to the  executive passing of the regulation on FIS activities.  (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 5 Jan 94 p 65)    The National Statistics Institute (INE) has reported that  inflation grew by 11.64 percent in 1993, the level expected by  government authorities. Inflation grew by 1.31 percent and 1.22  percent in November and December of 1993, respectively,  representing a sudden increase in monthly inflation as compared  to previous months. The government could not meet the objective  of reducing inflation, which totaled 14.22 percent, by 8 points,  in 1992. The INE has concluded that the increase in the cost of  vegetables and fruits in December caused the hike in inflation.  (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1758 GMT 5 Jan 94)    The Central Bank of Guatemala has reported that as of 30  September the public foreign debt totaled $2.1 billion. Of this  amount, $1.5 billion corresponded to the public sector and  $619.8 million to the Bank of Guatemala. This report cited a  debt reduction of $124.6 million with respect to 1992, of which  $85.7 million came from the Bank of Guatemala and $38.9 from the  public sector. The foreign debt-gross domestic product  relationship increased from 21.6 percent by the end of 1992 to  18.7 percent in September of 1993. (Guatemala City EL GRAFICO  in Spanish 6 Jan 94 p 62)    The National Cotton Council director has reported that  cotton  production in the country generated $13.9 million in revenues  during 1993, a 1.7-percent increase with respect to 1992.  According to cotton producers' estimates, national production  will disappear in Guatemala within two years. The source  concluded the decline in international cotton prices has  continued, forcing several countries out of the market. (Mexico  City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2357 GMT 6 Jan 94)    A study conducted by UNICEF's Social Planning Secretariat  has  revealed that 25 percent of the Guatemalan population is  suffering from poverty. The document has reported that poverty  is growing 5 percent annually. The study also highlighted the  low social security coverage in urban areas, which is even worse  in rural areas. UNICEF has concluded that some 77.6 percent of  Guatemalan children suffer from some degree of malnutrition.  (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1904 GMT 8 Jan 94)</p>

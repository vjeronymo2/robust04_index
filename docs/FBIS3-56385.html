He was commenting on the outcome of the three-nation summit  ending in Moscow on Friday [14 January].    "After all, all those missiles are part of the former Soviet  Union's property and each republic, including Ukraine, can claim  for part of it. We will handle it in a way wanted by the  Ukrainians," the minister said. "As far as I know, they prefer  to obtain fuel grade uranium reprocessed from the nuclear  warheads, he said adding "we respect their right".    On the other hand, said the minister, "the Belarussians want  to receive their share of the weapons in money, and why not?"    The minister ruled out any extra payment to Kiev, saying it  would be humiliating to Ukraine itself and a very strange thing  for Russia to do.    Kozyrev said the United States had agreed to allocate some  $60-70 Mn to pay for the cost of transporting the weapons from  Ukraine to Russia. He described the spending involved as high  but inevitable, given that the operation must be carried out in  a way that would preclude any new Chernobyl-style accidents.    Incidentally, said the minister, the operation was caused by  a technological necessity rather than by a desire to snub  Ukraine. The missiles must be dismantled where they were  assembled and Russia alone had such facilities, Kozyrev said.    More importantly, he went on to say, the leaders of the  three  countries meeting in Moscow on Friday reaffirmed their political  will to get the problem resolved. The minister believes  technical problems to be secondary.    The assurances of security guarantees given to Ukraine by  Russia and the United States were similar to those which the co-  founders of the non-proliferation treaty - the U.S., Britain and  Russia - offered to all signatories under a Security Council  resolution, Kozyrev said. These automatically covered any  country, including Ukraine, if it gives up its nuclear status,  he said. However, the minister said that security guarantees  would be effective only after Kiev joined the non-proliferation  treaty as a denuclearized nation. But he does not rule out the  possibility of some sort of "Ukrainian specifics."    On the Russian-American summit itself, Kozyrev said human  rights had also been high on the agenda. The two sides were  somewhat at odds on the issue of Russian pullout from the Baltic  states and the plight of ethnic Russians there, he said.    Unlike the Americans and other western countries which start  with troop withdrawals, said the minister, we think it more  correct to begin in reverse order. "We are ready to pull out  troops," he said, "but will the Balts be prepared to observe  human rights in full measure?" While sharing President  Yeltsin's position on the issue, I think Mr. Clinton's statement  of commitment to the human rights situation in the Baltic states  is one of the achievements of the Moscow summit, the Russian  minister said.</p>

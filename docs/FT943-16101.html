			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Arts: Judith Weir at the Cheltenham Festival - Music In the current funding climate, the Cheltenham International Festival of Music deserves a party just for surviving to have a 50th birthday. Ticket sales this year are looking good enough to suggest confidence in the future  -a tribute to John Manduell, who retires as programme director this year after no less than 25 years in the job. A festival which has spent half its life under the leadership of one man is likely to have a distinct profile, as Cheltenham indeed does. Together with Aldeburgh, it is one of the two UK summer music festivals with an emphasis on living composers. Perhaps the spa town gentility of Cheltenham has always tended to favour the kind of new music that is unlikely to offend, but that matters less these days than it used to. In the 1960s music had to be difficult to be accorded serious study. Now the user-friendly composer has become fashionable. Alongside minimalists like Glass and Adams, Cheltenham's favoured composers have started to sound quite gritty. Michael Berkeley and Judith Weir (both have had operas premiered at the festival in recent years) are most in evidence, Berkeley because he is due to take over as Manduell's successor next year. In the case of Judith Weir, the festival offers the opportunity to catch up on a couple of orchestral scores commissioned and first performed by foreign orchestras. Music, Untangled forms part of the closing concert on July 17; Heroic Strokes of the Bow, which started life in 1992 with the chamber-sized Westdeutsche Sinfonia, was included in the BBC Symphony Orchestra's programme last weekend. Like everything by Judith Weir, the piece says what it wants to say and no more. It lasts about 15 minutes, starting with massed violin bow strokes to reflect the title and proceeding to further distinct groups of ideas, which do not so much develop as occasionally collide with each other. The work was inspired by a blue painting by Klee, but Weir says she feels that it has turned out more a shade of grainy dark green. I cannot claim to have heard either of these colours in the music. What is present is a desire to make every scrap of material tell in the way that Stravinsky use to, for example in the Symphony in Three Movements. Weir's score loses its sense of direction in the middle, but revives towards the end with statements that build up a feeling of cumulative power, of having set a goal and achieved it. For this performance she had the right performers, but the wrong venue. Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra had prepared the music diligently to give it the exactness that it needs, but the resonant acoustic of Cheltenham Town Hall did its best to undo their good work. Similarly, there seemed to be a lot of detail carefully rehearsed in Holst's The Planets after the interval, if only we could have heard more of it. The festival continues with opera and ballet, more concerts, and a complete cycle of the Beethoven String Quartets.</p>

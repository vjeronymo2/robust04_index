			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Tsongas backing boosts Clinton GOVERNOR Bill Clinton took another step towards uniting the Democratic party behind his run for the White House yesterday by winning the endorsement of Mr Paul Tsongas, who mounted the strongest challenge to him during this spring's primaries. Mr Tsongas declined to endorse Mr Clinton immediately after he withdrew from the race, but was due to announce his endorsement in Boston yesterday after winning an opportunity to speak to the Democratic convention in New York next week. 'Bill Clinton won the nomination and I did not. Were I the victor I would expect him to endorse me,' said the former Massachusetts senator. Mr Clinton and Mr Tsongas often differed during the primary campaign. Mr Tsongas accused his opponent of 'pandering' to voters with his call for a cut in taxes on middle income families. Mr Tsongas sought to convert the Democratic party to a more business-oriented economic policy. Nevertheless, the Arkansas governor yesterday hinted that he might offer more than a speaking slot to Mr Tsongas, should he win the presidency. Barely a month ago, segments of the Democratic party establishment were keeping Mr Clinton at arm's length, even though he had enough votes to win the nomination. But the Clinton campaign has gradually brought together one-time critics, such as Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, who this week agreed to make the formal speech nominating his fellow governor at the convention. Mr Clinton still has differences with Mr Jesse Jackson, whose demands posed many problems for Democratic nominees at the 1984 and 1988 conventions, or with Mr Jerry Brown, whose unconventional campaign won him more than 600 delegates and who wants Mr Clinton to accept his 'humility agenda'.</p>

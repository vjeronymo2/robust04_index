			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Advance in earnings at Swire Pacific Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong-based property, aviation and trading group, saw 1993 profits improve by 5.4 per cent to HKDollars 4.66bn (USDollars 603m). This follows a 43.5 per cent advance in net earnings in 1992. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said the progress was achieved despite difficult operating conditions in the airline industry and a significant reduction in profits from the sale of investment properties in 1993. Last week Cathay Pacific, Swire's 51.8 per cent-owned airline, reported a 23.8 per cent drop in profits largely on the back of recession in key markets, especially Japan, and increased competition. Group earnings, which were at the top end of analysts' expectations, were lifted by the group's aviation units and strong growth in net rental incomes. Shareholders are to receive a dividend of 85 cents on the 'A' shares and 17 cents on the 'B' shares, increases of 10.7 per cent over 1992. Swire's property division made a smaller contribution than previously, chiefly because of the reduction in profits from the sale of investment properties, which stood at HKDollars 396m last year and HKDollars 838m in 1992. This year and next the property outlook will be enhanced by the group's commercial developments in Quarry Bay and the sale of further residential units in Robinson Place - both on Hong Kong Island. The group says that it will continue to expand its property investment portfolio, which was valued at HKDollars 56.18bn at the end of last year, following last year's HKDollars 2.85bn site purchase with Citic Pacific. The industries division turned in flat earnings, with gains offset by exceptional losses at Taikoo Engineering and provisions for closure costs at Swire Magnetics Holdings' manufacturing operations and Swire Duro's paint factory, which has been replaced by a new operation with ICI in Guangzhou.</p>

Sino-British relations deteriorated in 1993 because of the  wrangle over and the break in the talks over Hong Kong  elections, and the Beijing government has altered the original  idea of cooperating with the British side to fulfill the goal of  a "smooth transition" and has instead adopted the strategy of  cooperating with the Chinese people in Hong Kong to safeguard  stability in the transition period. The Chinese side has not  completely closed the door to talks. As long as Governor Patten  revokes the draft election bill which has been tabled in the  Legislative Council, it will be possible to restart the talks.  However, the Chinese side does not place great hopes on this.    In 1994, Beijing will speed up the PWC's work. First, it  will announce a new group of PWC members as soon as possible.  According to sources close to those organs in charge of Hong  Kong and Macao work, as far as new PWC members are concerned,  there will be a small number of "moderate democrats," such as  Cheung Ping-leung of Meeting Point, presidents of post-secondary  colleges, will be appointed, and efforts will also be made to  gradually recruit people from religious circles, the social  service sector, and the grass roots.    As far as the economic sphere is concerned, the Beijing  government will strive to persuade Hong Kong businessmen to  invest more in tertiary industry (the service sector). Tertiary  industry in the mainland is still far behind that of most  developing countries, and its output value only accounts for 27  percent of overall GNP, which is lower than the world average.  In the new year, the Beijing government will vigorously develop  tertiary industry and increase employment opportunities and  national income. Its development pattern will be in line with  1993's State Council document No. 20--The "Basic Thinking on the  Development Plan for Tertiary Industry Throughout the Country."  Because of insufficient capital, one of the foci of attracting  foreign capital is to strive for the participation of Hong Kong  businessmen in tertiary industry.    According to the policy on tertiary industry drafted by the  Foreign Investment Administration of the State Council Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the Beijing  government encourages businessmen from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and  other foreign countries to develop vast stretches of land. The  State Council will relax restrictions on some provincial and  city economic development zones and strive for the participation  of large, listed [on the Hong Kong stock exchange] real estate  companies in the development of vast stretches land. However,  certain restrictions on real estate investment must be imposed  on Hong Kong businessmen, and one of the restrictions is to  strictly examine and approve investments in luxury houses,  villas, resorts, and golf courses. Moreover, Hong Kong  businessmen will be encouraged to take part in the  reconstruction of old city areas and to invest in ordinary  commodity houses.    Various local governments will also "impose strict control"  over land supply. Last year, land use rights sold by Shanghai  Municipality were reduced to three square km (20 square km in  1992), and the supply of land in Shenzhen City also dropped to  32 hectares in 1993 from 45 hectares in 1992. In the new year,  various localities will still impose appropriate controls on the  supply of land.    The Beijing government is still opening the retailing  industry and tertiary industry to Hong Kong businessmen, but  some official restrictions have been imposed on running  supermarkets. The main points of the restrictions are:  Businessmen from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries are  not allowed to run supermarkets and wholesale businesses alone.  In the five special economic zones and five cities and  municipalities, Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and  Dalian, Sino-foreign joint ventures are allowed, to run one to  two supermarkets and to run retailing businesses on a  cooperative basis with special approval.    In the new year, the largest area invested in by Hong Kong  businessmen will be communications and transportation. Apart  from investing in railways and ports, Hong Kong businessmen can  also build solely invested wharfs reserved specially for owners  of goods, run airport terminals and airlines through joint  ventures, and so on.</p>

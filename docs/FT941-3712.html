			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Observer: On manoeuvres So much for the senior service. One of the odd aspects of the resignation of Sir Peter Harding as chief of the defence staff is that the Army's Sir Peter Inge, the eldest of the three service chiefs, has leapfrogged Admiral Sir Jock Slater, the vice chief, to take control of the country's defences on a temporary basis at least. Inge is regarded as a 'soldier's soldier' rather than a 'Whitehall warrior', so he might well be the forces' favourite for the job on a permanent basis. The other oddity is that, while Sir Peter has resigned as chief of defence staff, he has not resigned as a marshal of the RAF and so remains technically on the 'active service' list along with all the other five star officers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Amal Movement's leadership on 27 February </F> -- read by announcer]    [Text] The movement's leadership denounces the appalling  massacre committed by Israel and its agents against our people  worshipping at Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. It  believes that this crime is a new link in the chain of Israel's  daily acts of aggression against our people in occupied  Palestine and south Lebanon. The movement's leadership stresses  that the pattern of mass murders is uniquely perfected and  practiced by Israel, and what happened a few days ago at the  Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and today in Sayyidat al-Najat Church  are the best proof of this.    Today's abominable crime, which Israel is using along with  its other daily aggressive acts against the south to show that  Lebanon is unstable and insecure, will only increase the  Lebanese people's determination to cling tighter to the state  and its institutions and increase their unity and solidarity in  the face of any aggression against Lebanon.    While expressing solemn grief over the martyrs and the  wounded in today's incident, the movement extends condolences to  all Lebanese and emphasizes its solidarity with and  participation in the mourning scheduled to be observed tomorrow  by the Lebanese state. The movement prays to God Almighty to  have mercy on the deceased, grant speedy recovery to the  wounded, and continued peace and national unity to Lebanon.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: COMIC STRIPS  </P> <P> Back on the 'Far Side': New installments of the cult comic strip "The Far Side"  will return to newspapers across America on New Year's Day, following a  14-month hiatus. Cartoonist Gary Larson took a break on Oct. 30, 1988, from one  of the most successful panels in comic-strip history. During that time,  newspapers ran reprints of earlier "classic" cartoons. The only thing Larson  drew on his sabbatical was an album cover for jazz guitarist Herb Ellis -- in  exchange for guitar lessons. "I feel very fresh and recharged, and I'm sure a  reduced work load will play a big role in maintaining that feeling," Larson  said. "But, as I'm sure anyone who has had an opportunity to take a full year  off will agree, that first Monday morning back at work is quite a sobering  experience."

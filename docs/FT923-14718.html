			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (9): A workplace solution - What industrialists want 'DEVALUATION does not offer a solution to the fall in Italian industry's competitiveness,' says Mr Stefano Micossi, head of the research department at Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation. There has been speculation over the lira's parity in the ERM and expectations of a downward realignment. However, Mr Micossi says such a move would provide only temporary relief by stimulating exports and slowing imports, before being quickly followed by a sharp spurt in inflation. The trade figures reflect the difficulties of Italy's manufacturers in producing goods that are competitive in world markets. Since 1989 export volumes of intermediates and investment goods have been on a downward trend, while imports have continued to rise. The volume of exports of consumer goods stopped growing in 1990. Increasing globalisation has led to a higher propensity both to export and import. However, during the last decade import penetration has grown significantly more rapidly than the exports/production ratio. Moreover, growth in import penetration appears to be structural and independent of the economic cycle. Price competitiveness of Italian manufactured goods has fallen about 6 percentage points against EC trading partners since the beginning of 1988. This worsening position makes it increasingly difficult to compensate for import penetration by raising exports. Mr Micossi emphasises, however, that the solution must be found in the workplace rather than through exchange rate adjustments. These would, in any case, be subject to political constraints because of the lira's adhesion to the ERM's narrow band. Tackling costs, particularly the payroll, is the central issue. Last year industrial wages recorded a 9.1 per cent increase, against inflation of 6.4 per cent. The gap created by wages moving significantly ahead of inflation is a constant feature. Even when Italy's retail price index bottomed at 4.7 per cent in 1987, industrial wages rose by 8.6 per cent. There is a marked contrast, however, between the increase in the cost of labour per unit of output in the period 1986 to 1988 and the last three years. From an average of 2.8 per cent it has risen to 6.6 per cent. The productivity improvements that were won by the restructuring in Italian manufacturing in the early and mid-1980s had been fully exploited by the end of the decade. 'Tight control over wage increases is a necessity,' says Mr Micossi. He believes fundamental changes are required in wage structures and bargaining procedures. 'All forms of automatic adjustment and indexation must be abandoned.' At present, wage negotiations take place at national, industry and plant level. Mr Micossi says this is too complicated and contributes to runaway payroll costs. Italy's industrialists would prefer to negotiate national agreements on wages every two years, with non-wage aspects of labour contracts being decided every six years. Industries would need to be better defined than the present broad categories. There would be no place for plant bargaining under such a framework. Industrialists regard the expiry at the end of last year of the scala mobile  -the moving staircase system that indexed part of the pay packet - as a step in the right direction. Notwithstanding the nostalgia expressed by some trade unionists, it seems unlikely that the scala mobile will be revived. Confindustria believes overhauling wage bargaining procedures is not enough, and that Italian industrial relations needs more profound change. According to Mr Micossi, the conflictual ideology - at best an uneasy coexistence - that has guided relations between employers and employees over the past 40 years, must be changed. 'We must abandon the lines of trench warfare and co-operate,' he says. Competitiveness would benefit from an industrial relations system which does not place obstacles in the way of part-time working, job mobility and other forms of flexibility. Italy has not benefited from the working practices that other more competitive industrial countries, particularly Japan, have adopted. It often seems closed to outside ideas. 'It is a cultural matter. There are few businessmen who genuinely want more investment in Italy by foreign firms,' explains Mr Micossi. Italian competitiveness is also damaged by the excessive costs imposed by the inefficient infrastructure of services and public administration. 'National and local utilities, the banking system, distribution, government offices and local authorities provide services with a poor quality-cost ratio. Yet these are non-tradables that are not subject to exchange rate discipline,' says Mr Micossi. The industrialists' complaints enjoy authoritative support. Addressing the Bank of Italy's annual meeting at the end of May, the governor repeated observations that he had made on previous occasions about unsatisfactory productivity and price growth in the tertiary sector. 'Promotion of competition in national and local markets is needed in order to compensate for the absence of international competition,' said the governor, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Mr Ciampi and the captains of Italian industry are fortunate in being spared the inconveniences and disservices suffered by normal members of the public at the hands of local and central authorities, the post office, the telephone corporation, the railway and urban transport systems, banks and much of the tertiary sector. The Italian man-in-the-street would certainly not disagree with Mr Micossi's claim that there is room for efficiency improvements. 'Italy's public infrastructure and service sector need the kind of radical restructuring undergone by industry between 1982 and 1985,' Mr Micossi says. That would definitely give Italian manufacturing industry a huge competitive boost.</p>

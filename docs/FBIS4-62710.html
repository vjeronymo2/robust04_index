			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] On 30 April 1994, the Ukrainian president signed  the edict "On Trade and Economic Missions Within Ukraine's  Diplomatic Delegations Abroad." In accordance with the edict,  trade and economic missions will be created within Ukraine's  diplomatic delegations abroad. They will represent and protect  Ukraine's interests in the sphere of external economic activity  in the relevant countries. Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers has  been authorized to ensure the implementation of measures for  organizing the work of the trade and economic missions.    The edict approves the Regulations on the Trade and Economic  Missions Within Ukraine's Diplomatic Delegations Abroad. These  Regulations specify the main work and functions of the trade and  economic missions, their structure, and procedures for financing  and resolve the question of interrelations between the missions  and ministries and other central organizations of Ukraine's  state executive authority, and so on.    In view of the creation of trade and economic missions  within  Ukraine's diplomatic delegations abroad, Ukrainian Presidential  Edict 313 of 17 August 1993 "On the Regulations on Ukraine's  Trade Missions Abroad" has been invalidated.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / IT sector warns of skills shortage THE UK faces a shortage of information technology skills which might lead to an exodus of computer software and service companies, according to leading IT companies. Mr Paul Aspin, southern region industrial business manager for International Business Machines, said: 'Companies can now base themselves wherever in the world the relevant IT skills are, and use international networks to transmit data from there.' Mr Aspin, who is also a board director of West London Training and Enterprise Council, warned that unless the relevant skills were developed, the IT industry would move to continental Europe and elsewhere. Investment in IT training per person in the UK is half that in Japan, according to Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive of ICL, the computer group. Lack of training by companies has meant that people who have the skills are poached by companies at increasingly higher pay levels. Dr Phil Blackburn, chief executive of the West London Tec, said: 'Short-term recruitment ends up eating up funds that would be more effectively allocated to long-term training.' The Tec yesterday launched the IT Skills Forum, for which it has targeted Pounds 1m to be spent on joint projects with members of the forum, such as IBM, ICL and British Airways, to ensure that skills are developed. As part of its programme, it is conducting a skills survey to track the emerging skills needed by users. The first phase of the survey has disclosed that 90 per cent of IT users have no data processing or IT department responsible for transmitting skills. The survey also reveals that most people who learn to use computers do so by sitting next to someone with experience.</p>

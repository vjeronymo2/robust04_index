			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The fatal shooting April 8 of a suspected thief by a San Diego police officer  has been ruled justifiable by Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Edwin L. Miller.  </P> <P> Officer Derek Diaz shot auto-theft suspect Gregory J. Markley through the chest  during an arrest after Markley ignored Diaz's commands to stop reaching toward  his belt, according to Miller's report dated June 5 and released Monday.  </P> <P> The Diaz had a 6-inch knife and a set of bolt cutters at the time of the  arrest, San Diego Police Department spokesman David Cohen said.  </P> <P> "It was reasonable for officer Diaz to believe the rubber handles of the bolt  cutters were pistol grips and to react defensively when Markley reached for  them," Miller's report stated.  </P></p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Arts: Tuck and Patti - Jazz I was determined not to enjoy husband and wife team Tuck and Patti from the moment I saw them likened to Wes Montgomery and Sarah Vaughan and Fred and Ginger on London's billboards. When the compere at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday warned us that we were about to experience an evening of love and togetherness I almost bolted for the door. But, shucks, after 14 years of togetherness and 11 years marriage, the cuddly couple really have found an irresistible way of spreading connubial bliss. Tuck Andress, a 1970s throwback in large white suit, permed hair and gormless expression, plucks adeptly at a large semi-acoustic guitar while the missus, Patti Cathcart, a contralto cross between Joni Mitchell and Chaka Khan, does likewise with the heartstrings. 'Love relates both night and day, doesn't matter where you are,' she boomed generously to Horace Silver's 'Togetherness' tune. They make an extraordinarily relaxed pair. Their molasses-laden material - which ranges from 'The black mining hills of Dakota' to Cyndi Lauper's 'Time after time' - washed pleasantly over us, Patti being both reassuring and comfortably raunchy in her vocal acrobatics. 'People tell me I don't sing the blues,' she complained to squeals of approval, 'Well ah do ever time ah wear these shoes . . . I got those high heeled blues.' Tuck, who spends most of his time slavishly accompanying her tear-jerking cadenzas has his moment too: when Patti leaves to recharge her emotional batteries. After an overlong comic interlude, a la Rowan &amp; Martin, the guitarist launched into a powerful, percussively harmonic version of Michael Jackson's 'Mirrorman,' of all things. Although black and white images of soppy Sonny and Cher are conjured up by this extraordinary double act, they have tremendous musical value. Even a cheerless number about a mute crippled girl whose wheelchair has rolled to the cliff's edge is no cause for real sadness when Patti sings it. Tuck and Patti perform good tunes, simply and with panache. If they exploit the sentimentality of the permed classes, so be it.</p>

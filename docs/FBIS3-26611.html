David Clinton, brother [as received] of U.S.  President Clinton, said earlier after a visit to Shanghai:  "Shanghai is a charming metropolis; no wonder so many American  firms and enterprises are investing in Shanghai or seeking  cooperation with it." German Chancellor Kohl, who visited  Shanghai recently, predicted that Shanghai was going to one of  the world's noted cities.    Foreigners' praises of Shanghai are not unfounded. In the  last few years, the Shanghai Bund and Puxi District have  established 10 great exchanges in securities, metals, coal,  agricultural materials, petroleum, the chemical industry, grains  and oil-bearing crops, automobiles, building materials, and  technology -- rapidly turning Shanghai from a regional into a  national market, which saw a total turnover of 1 trillion yuan  in 1993. In the newly developed Pudong District, called by West  Germans the "world's largest work site," hundreds of buildings  have sprouted up over two or three years, turning Pudong into a  new industrial district in Shanghai.    Shanghai authorities have decided to make six major moves in  financial structural reforms this year: First, to vigorously  foster and develop a financial market system, with emphasis on  the foreign exchange, currency, gold, securities, and insurance  markets. Second, to push ahead with efforts to commercialize  banks so as to allow the separation of policy-dictated questions  from commercial financial affairs in the four great specialized  banks, and to steadily pursue an asset-liability ratio and risk  management. Third, to continue expanding the opening up of  financial institutions and the introduction of more foreign  counterparts. There are now in Shanghai 26 foreign banks from 11  countries or regions, most of them making profits. This year  Shanghai will try to attract more investment from foreign  financial institutions. Fourth, to continuously expand both the  scope and the range of financial businesses. This year will see  the starting of off-shore loan business, home mortgaging, and so  on. Fifth, to accelerate progress toward electronic finance;  build a Shanghai credit card network, so that one credit card  will be good throughout the city; and meanwhile, to put the bill  clearing and exchange system on an electronic footing. Sixth,  the make the People's Bank function as a Central Bank, thus  strengthening macroregulation and control.    These moves undoubtedly will turn Shanghai into a national  financial center. Mao Yingliang, director of the Shanghai  People's Bank, stated that apart from functioning as a national  foreign exchange swap center, the Shanghai Securities Exchange  now has been confirmed in its status as a national center;  meanwhile it also is becoming a national capital and monetary  discount center, rapidly moving marketization.    The most noteworthy thing is that the Shanghai municipal  authorities are preparing a series of moves to rebuild the bund  into a financial thoroughfare. In old times, the Shanghai Bund  used to be a financial center. The 112 tall bank buildings are  still there. Many of them used to be quite famous in the Far  East and world, such as the cluster of buildings characterized  by the American Bank and Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank buildings,  which had been dubbed an "expo on modern architecture." Owing  to political changes, starting from the 1950's, some of these  bank buildings were turned into government offices or  residential buildings, schools, or factories. To regain the  Bund's erstwhile status as a financial center, the authorities  have decided to restore those buildings still meeting the basic  needs of financial institutions to their former roles. According  to reports, the Shanghai Municipal Government building in the  Bund, which used to house the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank,  recently has been put up for sale by open bidding, with a  minimum price of $150 million, which has attracted the interest  of many big domestic and foreign banks. The Hong Kong and  Shanghai Bank has submitted its price offer. The highest bidder  reportedly is a certain mainland bank.    It seems that Shanghai is on its way to becoming a New York  Wall Street. As the Shanghai Municipality's leading role in  China's economic development increases, the rebuilding of the  Shanghai Bund into a financial center becomes increasingly  urgent.</p>

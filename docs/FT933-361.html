The protective footwear manufacturer came to the market in May through the reverse takeover of TSW, the former independent television contractor for the south-west of England. The result, relating to May and June, was achieved on turnover of Pounds 5.02m and after TSW closure costs of Pounds 460,000. The comparable figure was a loss of Pounds 3.6m, restated for FRS 3, after closure costs of Pounds 5.06m, on turnover of Pounds 18.8m. Earnings per share were 1.96p (losses of 16.5p). The interim dividend is 1.04p (2p). Pro-forma results, prepared to show the performance of the continuing business, showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 533,000) resulting from lower interest charges. Operating profit, however, was down at Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.47m) on lower turnover of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 16.3m).</p>

Recipients of funds under Part I must agree, with respect to the costs of the program, to make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward such costs in an amount that is not less than 25 percent of such cost or $1 for every $3 of Federal funds provided in the grant. [Sec. 399H(b)(1)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. In determining the amount of non-Federal contributions under A. (above), the recipient may include only such contributions as are in excess of the amount of such contributions made by the State toward the collection of data on cancer for the fiscal year preceding the first year of funding under this announcement. CDC may decrease the amount of non-Federal contributions required if the State can demonstrate that decreasing such amount is appropriate because of financial hardship. [Sec. 399H(b)(2)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants will be notified of the details regarding criteria for defining ``financial hardship'' and the process for deciding eligibility when they become available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Non-Federal contributions may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services.

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A woman who assisted her boyfriend's escape from Mercy Hospital by helping him  kidnap a private security guard surrendered early Wednesday and told  investigators she was tired of running, a sheriff's spokesman said.  </P> <P> Investigators arrested Teresa Juliana Reyes, 24, of the 5000 block of Skyline  Drive in San Diego shortly after 4:30 a.m. on suspicion of conspiracy to  kidnap, kidnaping and escape with force. She remained in County Jail at Las  Colinas on Wednesday in lieu of $510,000 bail.  </P> <P> Reyes approached a police officer early Wednesday at 14th Street and Broadway  in San Diego and volunteered to surrender, the spokesman said. Deputy Edward  Augustine took her into custody.  </P> <P> Investigators are still searching for Reyes' boyfriend, Michael Ismael Valadez,  27. He had been taken to the hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound after a  car chase Jan. 26 with National City police. He was arrested on suspicion of  narcotics and weapons violations and was being held on a no-bail warrant on a  robbery charge.  </P> <P> On Jan. 29, Reyes was given permission to visit Valadez. When she arrived at  Valadez's room, she told the guard stationed outside the door that she had a  bomb and a weapon in a sack, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Reyes and Valadez then forced the unarmed guard, 28-year-old John Lowery, to  take Valadez, in a wheelchair, to the first floor and then out to Reyes' car,  the spokesman said.  </P> <P> At Lowery's request, the pair let him go in Tijuana. Lowery made his way back  to the border and telephoned the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Lowery is an employee of Wackenhut Corp., a security firm under contract to the  sheriff.  </P></p>

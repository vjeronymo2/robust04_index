			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara--The acrimonious debate surrounding Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller's allegation that funds raised for Bosnia  by the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) have been diverted for  other purposes looks set to grow in the coming days.    If Ciller can provide proof to back her allegations then  this  may prove to be the reef that the RP actually flounders on,  colliding head on with the concept of "Islamic purity." If,  however Ciller cannot prove her allegations then this could be  the last straw in terms of her overall credibility, with  disastrous effects on her True Path Party (DYP) politically.    While Ciller and the government remained silent on the  subject on Thursday [24 February], Sevket Kazan, a leading  member of the RP, tried to disprove the allegations by producing  bank dockets he claimed showed the money had gone to its  rightful destination. Bosnia-Herzegovina's Ambassador to Ankara  Hayrudin Somum, for his part, confirmed to the Turkish Daily  News that he had personally witnessed the transfer of DM 50,000  (approx. TL 540 million) and $60,000 (approx TL 1.08 billion)  from the RP to Bosnia President Alija Izetbegovic, for which he  said a receipt has been issued.    Somum said the transfer took place at Istanbul airport on  June 20 last year, as Izetbegovi was leaving Turkey after one of  his many visits.    Ambassador Somum indicated however that he was not aware of  any other transfers and "could not say anything for sure on this  subject."    There have been some suggestions that the recent petty  corruption charges the RP has faced, and especially those  concerning its mayoral candidate for Istanbul Tayyip Erdogan,  may in fact have rebounded as sympathy for the party. Some  analysts have argued that the great manner in which the media  has focused on relatively small corruption charges against the  RP when the other parties are currently accused of much greater  graft may actually translate into sympathy for the Welfare camp.    But Ciller's claim this time carries the potential of doing  the party a lot of damage if it can be substantiated. Ciller  reportedly claimed to deputies of her True Path Party (DYP)  during a party group meeting on Tuesday in Parliament that the  RP had not sent the money it collected for Bosnia and that she  had proof to this effect which she would disclose later. This  claim was leaked to the press by deputies attending the meeting  which was closed to journalists.    State Minister Necmettin Cevheri confirmed reports of the  claim when he announced on Wednesday that there were indications  that of the TL 26 billion collected by the RP, TL20 billion was  unaccounted for. He added that the prime minister's office had  started an investigation concerning allegations that this TL 20  billion had been diverted.    Cevheri suggested that such an investigation would also be  good for the RP because it would prove, as the party's leading  officials were claiming, that nothing irregular had taken place.  Bosnian Ambassador to Ankara Hayrudin Somum was quoted in the  Turkish press on Thursday as saying that they had been exhorting  organizations gathering funds for Bosnia to cooperate with the  Turkish Red Crescent Society, the Directorate for Religious  Affairs and their embassy in Ankara in order for aid to reach  its goal effectively.    Somum appeared to be saying in this way that if all of the  money in question had been sent as the RP was saying, this had  not gone to Bosnia through his embassy.    The general director of the Turkish Red Crescent Society,  Unal Somuncu, was also quoted in the press on Thursday as saying  that "not a penny had come to them" from the Welfare Party for  Bosnia.    The deep concern in the Welfare camp in the face of these  developments was more than apparent in the statements of the  party's leading figures on Wednesday and Thursday.    Analysts say that if the government can prove a serious case  of corruption involving the RP and that funds gathered for  Bosnia had indeed been diverted--presumably for campaign  purposes--then this could do the party immeasurable damage in  terms of its image as a "clean Islamic party."    What makes this charge worse than the charge of having  houses  built illegally on land belonging to the ministry (which RP  Istanbul mayoral candidate Tayyip Erdogan is facing) is that  this charge is a direct affront to one of the deepest and  holiest tenets of Islam: namely "thou shalt not steal the  orphans' share." To do so, according to Islam, is something  that even Allah cannot forgive.    Addressing deputies from his party, Kazan, the deputy  chairman of the RP's parliamentary group, on Wednesday accused  the government as well as other sections of society in Turkey of  trying to do all in their power to prevent his party from coming  to power.    "They would even get rid of democracy if they felt it  necessary to prevent the RP from coming to power," Kazan had  retorted angrily.    Going on the offensive against the charges leveled at this  party, Kazan said it was during President Demirel's term as  prime minister that money had actually been diverted. He said  that of the TL 12 billion that had been collected, TL 3.9  billion had been used to buy clothes and TL 215 million had been  used to buy wheat and sugar to send to Bosnia. Kazan alleged  that the remaining money had been seized by the government while  it was in a special account in Vakifbank.    This allegation was strongly denied on Thursday by President  Demirel's office which said in a written statement that the TL  12 billion mentioned here had been presented by the director of  religious affairs to Demirel who had immediately handed it over  to the representative of the Turkish Red Crescent Society in  front of press cameras.    Talking to the press later on Wednesday, Kazan had  distinguished between his party and members and sympathizers of  the party who he said had collected funds for Bosnia.  Maintaining that none of this money had entered into the  party's safe, Kazan said he did not know how much money had been  collected by party members and sympathizers.    Kazan added that they did not use banks to transfer the  money  which they handed to the Bosnians directly on certain occasions.  He claimed that a representative of the Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic had always been present on these occasions. During  a press conference on the subject on Thursday, Kazan  contradicted his statement of the previous day that no bank had  been used in the transfer of the money and produced bank dockets  to prove that transfers had been made.    These appeared to go some way in allaying the accusations  leveled at his party and left the field open to its accusers to  produce the proof they claim to have.    The bank dockets he produced covered an estimated DM 2.5  million as well as $73,000.    When asked why the money had been sent to a bank in Germany  Kazan pointed to the name of the bank and asked reporters to  investigate the matter for themselves.    He suggested that this was a bank account used by the  Bosnians, although he did not clarify whether it was the Bosnian  government he was referring to or other Bosnian groups.  Repeating that his party had no direct connection with the  gathering of funds for Bosnia, Kazan indicated that some members  of the party had merely presided over the gathering of and  transferring of funds for Bosnia as "observers."    He appeared to try and explain why it was that his party had  these dockets if it was not directly involved in the gathering  and transferring of aid as it claimed.    Kazan also distributed letters of thanks from Bosnian  officials to the press in which the RP was thanked for aid that  had been sent to Bosnia.    The Bosnian Ambassador Hayrudin Somum will hold a press  conference this morning to clarify the situation from their side.    Following Kazan's disclosures on Wednesday eyes have now  turned to Ciller and her government, who first leveled the  accusation against the RP, to prove that their charges are  correct.    Analysts say that if the prime minister cannot prove the  allegation against the RP, this could be disastrous in terms of  her image and could harm her party's prospects in the upcoming  local elections.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government, which announced on 29 March a  package of external economic measures aimed at opening the  Japanese market and slashing Japan's current account surplus,  intends to use the package as a momentum to resume the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which broke off without any  agreement. Prime Minister Hosokawa is said to have been eager  to display his leadership in mapping out the package by adding  specific figures to a draft package. Chief Cabinet Secretary  Takemura shows confidence in resuming the framework talks,  saying, "(The United States) appears to have been surprised that  the Japanese Government has mapped out this good package in a  short period." With many issues, including the issue of tax  cuts, left untouched, however, the government will certainly  face a rough sailing in working out a set of concrete measures  to implement the package by the end of June, and it is  unpredictable how the government will patch up relations with  the United States which remain chilly following the breakoff of  the framework talks.    Explaining to a group of Japanese reporters at the Prime  Minister's Official Residence on the afternoon of 29 March why  the package envisions the 1994 ratio of Japan's current account  surplus to the GDP at 2.8 percent, the prime minister said,  "Although some have argued that it would be difficult to set  such a figure, we would be unable to have the United States  understand the package if we do not present such a figure in the  package." A top government official has said: The figure of 2.8  percent was once excluded from the draft package in the face of  backlash from bureaucrats who asserted that "the figure may be  taken as Japan's international commitment." The figure, however,  was resurrected on the morning of 28 March in respone to strong  instruction from the prime minister's official residence.    The package, however, only indicates a direction and that  the  government will have a rough way in working out a set of  concrete measures to implement the package by the end of June  shortly before the Naples summit (the summit talks of  industrialized nations) is held. As for tax reform, the  government, in the package, clearly indicates that "it will seek  to reform the current tax system within this year" on the basis  of decisions the ruling coalition parties will make at the end  of their consultations during June, and it reveals the intention  to continue cuts in the income tax. Speaking at a news  conference on the evening of 29 March, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Takemura called the reform of the current tax system "Japan's  commitment to the United States," saying the government will  "assume the responsibility" to make a decision on reforming the  current tax system during June. However, what sort of decision  the ruling coalition parties will make on the reform of the  current tax system remains uncertain because of backlash within  the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan.    In the macroeconomic area that the United States has most  strongly demanded, the Finance Ministry has opposed reviewing  the plan for public investment, citing financial difficulty, and  as a result, the package does not indicate a specific amount of  increase in the public investment. While the package envisions  the 1994 ratio of Japan's current account surplus to the GDP at  2.8 percent, the United States has insisted on 1 percent. In  this way, there is still a wide perceptional gap between the two  countries.    The prime minister's reputation was slighted following the  breakoff of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. If the package  contributes to restoring his reputation, it would serve as a  leverage for him to overcome difficulties on the domestic  agenda. His leadership will again be tested in working out the  set of concrete measures to implement the package.</p>

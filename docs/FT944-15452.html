			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh talks on international rubber pact set for February A third attempt to negotiate a new international rubber pact will be made in February after consuming and producing countries failed to agree on the crucial issue of the reference price during two weeks of talks in Geneva. The 1987 International Natural Rubber Agreement, which expires on December 31, will be extended for a further year when the pact's governing council next meets in Kuala Lumpur at the end of November. Producing countries had argued for a 5 per cent rise in the reference price which has remained virtually unchanged at 196.84 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo since 1979. However, consumer nations, led by the European Union, refused to budge. The rubber agreement is the only remaining international commodity pact with price stabilisation provisions under which buffer stock operations are used to keep the market price of rubber within a fixed range centred on the reference price. Mr Peter Lai, chairman of the United Nations-sponsored negotiations, said after the talks ended on Friday that there was 'much sympathy' for an increase in the level of the lower indicative price - the price below which the buffer stock manager may, but is not obliged to, buy in stocks to prevent further falls. There was also 'the same measure of sympathy' for a more frequent review of the price range than the present 15 months. Another area of disagreement, the duration of the new accord, was unlikely to pose much difficulty, Mr Lai added. The options are a 3-year or 5-year accord with the possibility in each case of a 2-year extension. Thirty-one countries took part in the Geneva talks, including the most important exporters and importers. The next round will be held in Geneva from February 6. The argument over the reference price arises from different views of market prospects. Producers say price levels set by the 1987 accord do not guarantee farmers' livelihoods and are leading to production cuts at a time of rising demand. Prices this summer reached their highest levels for more than six years. Consumers believe market conditions do not justify a rise in the reference price of rubber, maintaining that recent price rallies have been driven by short-term factors and by speculators. One possible compromise is a rise in the indicative price, which is related to production costs and is therefore an important signal to growers, while leaving the reference price unchanged.</p>

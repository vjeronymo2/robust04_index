			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> TRASH HAULER'S REQUEST FOR RATE HIKE TERMED EXCESSIVE  </P> <P> With one member absent Tuesday night, the Compton City Council decided to put  off a decision on whether to raise residential trash collection rates. Mayor  Walker R. Tucker has been ill and unable to attend council meetings this month.  </P> <P> The city's trash hauler, Murcole Inc., is seeking a rate increase of 17.16%.  That would push the current monthly rate from $11.32 per residence to $13.26.  </P> <P> The city staff told the council in a memo that the request is excessive because  the consumer price index has risen only 4.9% and dumping fees at landfills have  not gone up enough to justify such a high rate hike.  </P> <P> The city staff is recommending that the rate be raised to $11.94, which would  be a 5.5% increase. The council is scheduled to take up the issue again at its  meeting next Tuesday.  </P></p>

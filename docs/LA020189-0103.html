			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-AIDS BIAS PLAN SURVIVES OPPOSITION  </P> <P> Opponents of a proposed anti-AIDS discrimination ordinance for Los Angeles  County showed up in force Tuesday intent on forcing the Board of Supervisors to  overturn its support for a law that they claim would compel health-care workers  and others to run the risk of contracting AIDS.  </P> <P> It was the largest public protest so far to the anti-discrimination law, but  there was no indication that the public lobbying had changed any minds.  </P> <P> Supervisors tentatively approved the sweeping ordinance in a 3-2 vote more than  two weeks ago. It would bar employers, landlords, schools and businesses in the  county's unincorporated areas from discriminating against those who have or are  suspected of having acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> The law, which is to be be up for final vote next Tuesday, would make it  illegal to exclude AIDS victims, people infected with the AIDS virus or those  an employer suspects of carrying the virus from jobs and promotions.  </P> <P> The ordinance is milder than similar laws, in Los Angeles for example, that  call for special enforcement by the city attorney's office. The county law  would leave it up to individuals to initiate complaints through the courts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Forcing People'  </P> <P> Opponents of the ordinance contend that the county proposal is untenable and  protects AIDS victims at the expense of health-care professionals, restaurant  workers and others who fear that even nonsexual contact with an infected person  can spread AIDS. Under the proposed county law, people with such fears could  not legally refuse to treat or serve people with AIDS or who are suspected of  having AIDS.  </P> <P> "We have to stop the AIDS epidemic, but not by forcing people to become exposed  (to the virus)," said Leslie C. Dutton, president of the American Assn. of  Women, an archconservative organization.  </P> <P> LaVonne Wilenken, a registered nurse and president of the California Nurses for  Ethical Standards, told supervisors that her experience in hospital maternity  wards shows that even such precautions as using protective gloves are  inadequate in safeguarding health-care workers from infected blood or other  fluids.  </P> <P> "I have little children at home, and I love my job," said Wilenken, "but I'm  here to tell you that we're not protected, and . . . what's going to happen is  I'm going to have to quit doing what it is that I love."  </P> <P> The AIDS virus is spread primarily through exchanges of semen and blood,  usually through sexual contact or contaminated hypodermic needles.  </P> <P> U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, the American Medical Assn. and other  professionals have said that doctors and nurses have a professional  responsibility to provide care for people with AIDS and that the risk of  infection is minimal if proper precautions are observed. A small number of  health-care workers have contracted the virus through accidental punctures from  needles contaminated with infected blood.  </P> <P> Members of the county Commission on AIDS, which pushed for the ordinance, have  said the law is needed to quickly resolve discrimination complaints and to  ensure that those afflicted with AIDS do not hide their infection because of  fears that they will be victims of bias.  </P> <P> Dave Johnson, who chairs the United AIDS Coalition, an umbrella group for  organizations that help AIDS sufferers, backed the proposed law and said  Tuesday that it would send a strong message that "all human life is valuable  and worthy of dignity."  </P> <P> In postponing a final vote until next week, board chairman Ed Edelman sought to  ensure that the three supervisors who originally backed the ordinance would be  present.  </P> <P> Supervisor Deane Dana, a conservative, had joined his liberal colleagues,  Edelman and Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, in approving the ordinance.  </P> <P> Dana was out of town Tuesday, so opponents of the proposed law, which included  a number of black constituents from Hahn's South-Central Los Angeles district,  zeroed in on him in hopes of persuading him to reconsider his vote.  </P> <P> Hahn remained silent in the face of their pleadings, however, and later his  chief deputy, Mas Fukai, said his boss has no intention of switching his vote.  </P></p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Management: New route to the top position - A report that predicts personnel directors' increasing clout in the boardroom Personnel as a corporate function has changed radically in the past 10 to 15 years from a comparatively low-grade advisory position to one that fills a strategic role in business management. Who says so? Personnel experts do, perhaps not surprisingly, in an attitude survey* carried out by Spencer Stuart, the headhunting company. The survey, which quotes anonymously from some of the leading experts in the field, suggests that the role has evolved markedly in recent years to the point where it is now being treated as vital in many boardrooms. In line with its greater importance, however, there has been a streamlining of personnel management and more frequent farming out to contractors of several personnel responsibilities. 'Narrow personnel specialists in areas such as training, remuneration, pensions and selection will increasingly be outside the company,' it says, leaving those personnel directors who survive at the core of the organisation to assume more general responsibilities in the future. The report says that while it has been exceptional for personnel directors to become chairman in the past, it will become more common as they gain the breadth of experience that will make them candidates for the job. Is this wishful thinking? Certainly, there is a consistency in the comments collected in the interviews. One executive said: 'Personnel people are now much more part of running the business. They are getting credit for understanding the business and some will eventually end up running it.' Another argument was that the best personnel official was in a position to see the totality of the organisation. 'Personnel has the unique opportunity to see across all business lines, in a way that even finance cannot,' observed one respondent. The comments appear to reflect a recognition that people are now considered to be the most valuable assets of many businesses. Perhaps this has long been the case but it is only comparatively recently that senior executives have been saying so and addressing what this means in terms of corporate strategy and organisation. Among the findings in the report was a deep resistance to the term 'human resource manager'. Many saw it as meaningless American jargon, reflecting a ruthless manipulative approach towards people. Others saw it as distinguishing the new-style strategist from the old-style professional involved in caring and looking after people. Some pointed out that personnel had a very limited meaning in the US. Whatever the nomenclature, the general feeling was that if personnel responsibilities were only administrative there was no justification for a personnel manager taking a seat on the board. A boardroom personnel role involved defining, inspiring and guiding organisational change, said the respondents. Nigel Dyckhoff, the Spencer Stuart partner who compiled the report, says: 'The main conclusion is that whereas 10 or 15 years ago we were talking about personnel as an advisory function, in 10 years' time it will probably be the best way to the top. It is moving from a caring job to a strategic job.' *Point of View, Spencer Stuart and Associates, 16 Connaught Place, London W2 2ED. Telephone 071 493 1238.</p>

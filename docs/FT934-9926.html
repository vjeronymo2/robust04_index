			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (8): The agony and the ecstasy - Industry IN THE glass-making town of Marinha Grande in central Portugal workers protest over the imminent closure of their factory, which has been near bankruptcy since 1985. Some 500 jobs are at stake. But Mr Luis Mira Amaral, minister for industry and energy, is not over-concerned. Nearby, he has just opened a plastics factory that he is confident will be competitive on European terms. 'We have to let companies that are non-viable fall by the wayside and give our support to those that are going to be successful in the single European market,' he says. The incident sums up the agony and the ecstasy that industrial Portugal is going through today. The government is letting non-viable, uncompetitive companies die while it is saving its support, considerably bolstered by European Community funds, for the success stories. 'We can't waste time or spend money on firms that are not going to be viable in the new Europe,' says Mr Mira Amaral. 'We have to conserve our resources for the companies that will be able to compete at an international level.' It is not a question of Portugal's traditional industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear, wine, ceramics and metallurgy fading away in the wake of new industries and technologies, but of separating the obsolete from the thriving. 'I don't believe there is such a thing as an obsolete sector or industry,' says Mr Mira Amaral, 'only successful and non-successful companies.' Indeed, the initial findings of a study on Portugal's comparative advantages commissioned by 40 Portuguese companies and institutes from Mr Michael Porter, the famed Harvard economist, emphasise that Portugal needs its traditional industries for new technologies and industrial sectors to evolve from. Portuguese industry is facing three principal problems: the international recession has hit hard at a country strongly geared to exports; the older generation of industries such as ship building, steel, fertilisers, textiles and clothing are now open to competition for non-Community countries which, Mr Mira Amaral insists, compete with unfair practices; and, finally, the single European market has further opened up what has up to now been a fairly protected sector. Government policy for meeting these challenges is based on four principles: using EC funds to support viable, modern companies in all sectors including the country's traditional industries; deriving the maximum industrial benefit possible from Portugal's natural resources, particularly in the areas of forestry and mining; making a special effort to modernise and develop the electro-mechanical industries including vehicles, components, transport material and electrical and non-electrical machinery; and encouraging foreign investment. But Mr Amaral emphasises that Portugal will be more and more selective with the foreign investment it supports with incentives. 'I only want to back foreign investment that contributes significantly to the improvement of Portuguese industry,' he says. 'That means projects that improve our capacity for management and organisation, develop our human resources, contribute to diversifying our industrial base and lead to new markets.' The minister points to the district of Setubal, south of Lisbon, as an area that has been transformed by foreign investment. This is where the Es450bn Ford-Volkswagen plant, the biggest foreign investment ever made in Portugal, is sited amid a cluster of other big foreign projects. 'No other industrial region in Europe offers the infrastructure, the closeness to the capital and the climate of Setubal,' boasts Mr Mira Amaral. But it is also true that the jobless rate in Setubal is higher than in then rest of the country. Ship building, steel and heavy chemical industries have been closing down and the workers aged over 45 that are made redundant find themselves unemployable by the new industries that are springing up around them. 'These men are too old to be recycled and will have to be absorbed by the service sector or low-technology industries,' says Mr Mira Amaral. 'But it is our hope that the new projects in the region will dynamise the growth of services and basic technological firms to employ them.' Officially, the unemployment rate in Portugal is a low 5.6 per cent. But government opponents insist that statistics are not a true reflection of the jobless rate and that a lot of unemployment is masked by part-time working and unpaid wage arrears. Unemployment is forecast to rise to 8 per cent in 1994.</p>

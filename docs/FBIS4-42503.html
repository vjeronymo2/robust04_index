			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- The SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany] leader, Rudolf Scharping, does not rule out a  coalition with the liberals [Free Democratic Party] after the  Bundestag election, even after the FDP decided at its party  conference in favor of a coalition with the CDU/CSU Union. The  FDP had "not said that if the Union had a poor election result,  it would go into opposition," Scharping told BILD AM SONNTAG  newspaper. On the eve of the elections, the "supply of partners  will be greater than the demand."    At the same time, he once again rejected the idea of a grand  coalition. The goal of the Social Democrats was to become the  strongest party: "We will always find a partner in that event,"  Scharping added. "Exclusive rights for small parties" could not  be arranged with him. [passage omitted]</p>

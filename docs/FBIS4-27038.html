			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News analysis" by staff reporter Zhang Baoxiang (1728 1405 </F> 4382): "Treaty Signed, Differences Exist"]    [Text] Brussels, 23 Jun (RENMIN RIBAO) -- On 22 June,  Russia and NATO signed a framework document on the "Partnership  for Peace." Sergio Balanzino, deputy secretary general of NATO,  said this would contribute to the "peace and stability of  Europe." Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev described the move as  "turning to a new chapter of bilateral relations."    In order to sign the "framework document," both NATO and  Russia made compromises and concessions. NATO recognized  Russia's power status and agreed to "implement an extensive  partnership scheme commensurate with Russia's size, important  position, and capabilities" and to have dialogue with Russia on  issues of common interest. Meanwhile, Russia no longer stuck to  the principle that NATO must sign a legally binding "protocol"  which would recognize its power status.    On the surface, both Russia and NATO achieved the main  things  they wanted: NATO succeeded in getting Russia to sign the  "framework document of the Partnership for Peace," whereas  Russia's power status was recognized by NATO. But in reality,  their conflicts have not been settled yet.    The basic difference between NATO and Russia is who should  play the lead in the security affairs of Europe. Russian  Defense Minister Grachev suggested that Russia and NATO should  establish a "strategic partnership" to jointly undertake the  responsibility of defending the security of Europe. However,  Balanzino said, "NATO is the most powerful organization for  European defense" and should "play a leading role" in defending  the security of Europe." Balanzino also said that NATO would  neither reach a "new Yalta" agreement with Russia nor draw a new  "boundary of Europe" with Russia. It seems that such  differences concerning the future pattern of European security  will not be settled in the short term.    A related issue over which both parties are at odds is the  eastward expansion of NATO. In Russia's view, due to  "historical and geopolitical reasons," Russia has major  strategic and economic interests in Central and Eastern Europe,  hence it objects to the absorption of Central and East European  countries into NATO, saying that this is a practice of  "isolating" Russia. Balanzino stressed that NATO's expansion  "does not intend to isolate Russia" but "contributes to the  stability of Europe," and that Russia neither has the "right to  supervise" nor the "right to veto" NATO's eastward expansion.    Another major difference is how to consult each other about  security issues. Russia has asked for the establishment of a  formal and automatic consultation system with NATO on European  and global security issues. NATO agreed to hold dialogue with  Russia on security issues, but it did not agree to establish an  automatic consultation system.    In addition, Russia also stressed that the CSCE is the  supreme organ responsible for European security and NATO is a  military organization subordinate to the CSCE. However, NATO  insisted on objecting to this view, saying that NATO is the  "pillar" of post-Cold War European security.    As far as the issue of European security is concerned, NATO  needs Russia and vice versa, and it is impossible to have real  stability in Europe if either of the two parties is excluded.  It was precisely because both parties are soberly aware of this  point that they signed the framework document for the  partnership of peace. However, both parties have divergent views  on the question of how to cooperate with each other in Europe.  Russia intends to "jointly administer" Europe with NATO,  whereas NATO undoubtedly reckons itself as the "key player." In  view of this, Russia and NATO must go through a relatively long  process of bargaining or even conflict before their relations  can be readjusted and the new pattern of European security  finally takes shape.</p>

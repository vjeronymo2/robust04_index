			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gabriela Zavatti] </F>   [Text] Venezuela has joined advanced technology in  telecommunications with the submarine cable system "Americas 1,"  the first digital fiber optic system in Latin America, which  will permit the transmission of television, voice, and  digitalized data, leaving behind the analogue system.    Laying of the first cable began yesterday, at 1400, starting  from the shores of Camuri, on the central coast, aboard a  British ship bound for Trinidad. The procedure will take 24  hours, after which our country will be connected to the system,  which will be offered to domestic and international users on 1  September.    At the national level, the project is being financed by  CANTV  [National Telephone Company of Venezuela]. At the same time, 53  communications companies representing 46 companies are also  participating. Total investment amounts to $230 million; the  project contemplates a network of 7,500 km of fiber optic cable.  Venezuela is the second largest investor in the project,  surpassed only by the United States. In addition, it constitutes  one of the cable's land connections, at Camuri. The national  telephone company plans to recover its investment in two years.    Manuel Caceres, CANTV's vice president for international  operations, called the system an "information superhighway" that  will unite the country with the rest of the world, at the  required speed and efficiency. It will connect Venezuela with  North America, the Caribbean, and South America, in order to  offer digital telecommunication services between the continental  area of the United States, St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands,  Trinidad and Tobago, and Brazil.    The system has four branches. The first, from St. Thomas to  a  deep interconnecting point in the Atlantic at a distance of  1,700 km to the south, was installed on 5 January 1993. The  second was from that interconnecting point to Trinidad, over a  distance of 583 km. The third--whose laying began  yesterday--connects Trinidad with Camuri at a distance of 781 km  and the last, which ties in the interconnecting point in the  Atlantic with Fortaleza, Brazil, at a distance of 3,000 km was  installed on 19 January 1994.    The "Americas 1" is only one of the projects in the  telecommunications field; another is Columbus II, whose cable  will be added to networks that go in the direction of Mexico,  the United States, and Europe, reaching places as distant as  Turkey and Israel.    CANTV has also planned the construction of a coastal cable  that borders Venezuela and joins the Colombian system to have  access to fiber optic cables of the Caribbean.    It will also encourage cable networks from the United States  in the direction of Japan, where the connection with Korea, Hong  Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore is already being negotiated. The  most important Venezuelan telephone project in the international  area is the fiber optic belt, which will cover the entire planet  in the future.    The first of the fiber optic submarine cables that involved  Venezuela directly was that which began to be installed  yesterday, at a cost of $60 million.    This technology transmits a signal by means of a beam of  light that has to be revitalized every 130 km with a repeater.  This first course will have 10 repeaters.    The fiber optic, protected by a double armature of copper  and  steel, is the size of a human hair, and among its advantages is  that of guaranteeing the greatest capacity and best quality of  communications in traffic, high velocity of telephone  transmissions, and of special services in voice, data,  television, and video.    The cable uses two and three pairs of fiber in its first and  second connections, respectively, to Trinidad, which will allow  the establishment of 8,000 calls per pair each second.    The French firm Alcatel is responsible for manufacturing the  cable, repeaters, and auxiliary equipment, as well as for marine  and land supply and installation. The testing period will begin  at the end of March in order to start commercial operations at  the beginning of September.</p>

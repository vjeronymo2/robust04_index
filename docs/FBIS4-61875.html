			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The management of the North Caucasus railway has  suspended all train traffic through the territory of Chechnya  because of a sharp increase in banditry on this stretch of the  railway. Abramenko, our correspondent in Rostov-on-Don, reports  that on 6 May, nine freight trains were looted in broad  daylight. Damage caused is estimated at several billion rubles.  All freight for Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Dagestan is now being  stocked on safe stretches of the railway.    Deputy Russian Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray and Chechen  President Dzhokhar Dudayev have been informed about the problem  and about the measures taken by the railway management.</p>

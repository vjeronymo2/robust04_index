			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 28 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Vice-Premier  Zeljko Simic said on Friday [29 January] all Yugoslav citizens  who had been in Croatian territory at the time of the outbreak  of Croatia's war of secession in 1991, and who had since  disappeared must be tracked down. Croatian authorities are  willing to release those from the list of 980 missing persons  who should be found to be in prisons or camps, said Simic on his  return from Geneva, where he had met on Thursday with Croatian  Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Mate Granic.    Yugoslav officials will be permitted to go to Croatia and  investigate the circumstances in connection with the  disappearances. Simic and Granic agreed on the setting up of a  joint commission for the affairs of refugees, missing persons  and humanitarian assistance. The talks with Granic took stock  also of other sensitive issues between the two countries, such  as the restoration of PTT, road and railway communications, said  Simic.    He explained that the problems discussed at Geneva could not  be solved without the participation of the `third party.' He  was referring to Krajina Serbs, whose views he said were  indispensable and whose legitimate interests had to be taken  into account in dealing with the problems.    Roads and railways linking Yugoslavia and Croatia pass in  part through the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.), which has  been proclaimed by the local Serbs in those parts within the  arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia where they are the  majority population, in response to Croatia's violent secession  from the former Yugoslav federation and trampling on their  rights.    Simic said he was travelling to Zagreb on February 12 as  part  of regular monthly exchanges of visits by Belgrade and Zagreb  ranking officials.</p>

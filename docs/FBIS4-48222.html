			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 14 May -- Eritrea has today denied that it  has a biased stance in favor of either side in the fighting  currently raging in Yemen, and called for ending this fighting  and resorting to peaceful dialogue.    This came in an Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry's  statement  distributed by the Eritrean Embassy in Kuwait.    The statement, a copy of which was sent to KUNA, said that  "the Eritrean stance towards the conflict in Yemen calls for  ending the fighting and appealing to reason and the logic of  dialogue in such a way which achieves the interest of the Yemeni  people and move it away from the slides of rupture, displacement  and misery".    He added that "from this logic, we repeat the appeal to the  two parties to the conflict to end the fighting and resort to  peaceful dialogue in such a way which preserves the interest of  the Yemeni people, and the security and stability in our region  in general".    The statement described the news which suggested a biased  Eritrean stance in favor of one of parties in the Yemeni  conflict against the other as being "untrue and harms Eritrea's  positive role to find a peaceful solution to the crisis, and it  harms Eritrea's relations with all the Yemenis alike".</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Yeltsin fails to win better access to western markets for Russian goods - Few crumbs for Russia PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday failed to extract from leaders of the world's seven richest industrialised nations an end to 'discrimination' against Russian exports but expressed satisfaction with a Dollars 3bn fund to support Russian privatisation. Having said all along that his main task at the summit was to gain better access to western markets, the Russian leader admitted afterwards that his biggest disappointment was that 'in response to my energetic urging' they answered ''yes, yes, we understand but it is difficult to solve this problem''. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said, the Russian leader recognised the need for his country to make more progress with market reforms - for instance, in getting rid of some of the 'extraordinary subsidies they have there' - in order to claim the same treatment as members of Gatt, which Russia has applied to join. The G7 economic declaration simply promised yesterday to support Russia's application to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and to 'intensify' efforts to remove cold war restrictions on sensitive exports to former communist countries. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, confirmed that plans were afoot to transform Cocom, the Paris based watchdog for sensitive exports to former communist countries, into an agency, including Russia, to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Describing the new privatisation fund as 'the most concrete result of the summit', Mr Yeltsin said he was also pleased at having been treated as an equal by the G7 leaders, who invited him to attend their summit next year in Naples. 'You understand, there was not this atmosphere of a student being taught by teachers  .. but one of equality and mutual respect,' he said. He added he was in no hurry for the G7 to become the G8 but he was sure it would happen with time. Mr Yeltsin promised his Japanese hosts that he would 'definitely' pay an official visit to Japan in October despite cancelling twice in the past year. But he said he had warned Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, against expectation of fast progress in retrieving the Kurile Islands, seized by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war. He said Japan should co-operate more in assisting economic reforms so that Russians will live better and be more relaxed about a solution of the territorial question.</p>

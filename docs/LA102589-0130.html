			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> Protection for S&amp;L: Guardian Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach,  worried that it might lose $56 million in gains generated through accounting  procedures, has arranged for First Interstate Bank to protect it against such a  loss.  </P> <P> The agreement concerning Guardian's $1-billion servicing portfolio is the first  to protect a thrift or mortgage banker from losses that could occur when  borrowers pay off home loans earlier than the institution estimated that they  would, said Brian Cosgrove, an executive at First Interstate in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Thrifts such as Guardian sell many of the loans they originate to investors,  but the thrifts continue to service the loans, a low-risk operation that  provides them fee income. In addition to recording the fee income, the  institutions can also estimate how much they will earn in servicing fees over  the lives of the loans, reduce that amount to its present value and record it  as a gain.  </P> <P> But when interest rates fall and borrowers pay off their loans early by  refinancing them, the thrifts must write off as a loss a portion of those gains  they recorded.  </P> <P> The agreement between Guardian and First Interstate is designed to reimburse  Guardian for any servicing loss it must take as a result of falling rates and  early payments of mortgages. The bank insures against that loss through  hedging, a strategy of trading in options on the bond market to offset  investment risks.  </P> <P> First Interstate has a large options trading desk, Cosgrove said, that can  handle hedging operations more efficiently than most S&amp;Ls or mortgage  bankers.  </P></p>

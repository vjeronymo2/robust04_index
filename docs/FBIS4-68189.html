			<p>BFN     [Text] Greece has rejected Turkey's demarche claiming that  members of the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] are being trained on  Greek territory. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said  that the competent Turkish deputy foreign minister summoned the  Greek ambassador in Ankara and lodged a demarche claiming that  members of the PKK are being trained on Greek territory.    The spokesman stressed: Statements and demarches by Turkey  that cause artificial tension have no meaning; Greece will not  become an accomplice in creating an artificial climate of  tension. Venizelos said: Greece condemns every act of violence  and terrorism. There is no official representation of the PKK  in our country. Greece is a pluralist state of law, with a  legal order; whoever violates that legal order is punished. And  he also noted that there is no meaning for Turkey in attempting  to export its domestic problems.</p>

And that  it also made a number of criticisms of the [Lebanese]  government, especially with regard to the attitude of state  institutions, which have begun to act as part of the private  sector.    The prominent leader told AL-HAYAH that a major part of the  talks held by the Hizballah delegation in the Syrian capital  over three days was devoted to the upcoming Syrian-U.S. summit  between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and the  situation in the south and western al-Biqa'.    He quoted senior Syrian officials as saying that the  al-Asad-Clinton summit represents an important and fundamental  opportunity to emphasize Syrian constants and principles, which  refuse in any way to abandon a single inch of the Golan, the  south, and western al-Biqa', and which support the fateful link  between the Lebanese and Syrian files. Namely, on the basis of  rejecting separate solutions and refusing to allow this or that  party to monopolize the situation, as was the case with the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    The leader stressed that the Lebanese and Syrian tracks are  now like one track, and that Damascus does not accept priority  being given to one track over the other, because it believes  that the solution has to be comprehensive.    On the situation in the south, the leader emphasized that  there is a common reading between Damascus and Hizballah of the  aims behind the continued Israeli aggression. "Tel Aviv is  seeking to include the security question at the top of the  Syrian-U.S. summit agenda, so that this issue will dominate the  other major issues." It was agreed to seize the escalation card  from Israel's hand in order to deny it the opportunity, so that  the security question will not dominate the political file to be  discussed between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton.    The leader stressed that Israel "has begun again to shell  civilians in the south and western al-Biqa' before the the  Syrian-U.S. summit. The aim is to drag us into the game of  haphazard bombardment. But we will not be dragged into this  trap, at least for the time being, lest we achieve for Israel  what it is seeking to achieve. However, we can reply later,  that is after the Geneva summit proceedings have ended."    He added that "Hizballah still has all the options that  allow  it to reply to the Israeli escalation. But it reserves the  right to choose the timing and method it deems suitable. It can  from now pursue a policy of self-restraint until the summit  concludes, while choosing a method capable of exerting pressure  to halt the Israeli aggression on civilians."    The leader noted that the Hizballah delegation raised a  number of issues during its talks with Khaddam. They included  the following:    "-- Hizballah's concerns over the move by some circles close  to [Lebanese] Prime Minister Rafiz al-Hariri to normalize  relations with Israel. This was reflected through participation  in the water conference held in Ankara recently, and also  through articles published by a Lebanese newspaper and signed by  figures dealing with financial and economic matters.    "-- The attitude of some official institutions and  departments, which have begun to act as though they are private  companies. This prompts us to ask about the fate of the  brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination treaty between  Lebanon and Syria, which will be difficult to translate into  something that can achieve cooperation in view of the absence of  public establishments in Lebanon.    "-- The fate of the investigation the government pledged to  the Chamber of Deputies to conduct into the `airport bridge  massacre' which took place on 13 September last year, as a  result of which 50 people were killed or wounded. The  investigation has still not been completed, as though some  people are trying to keep this file open to prevent those  directly responsible from being punished for what happened. We  will not keep silent about procrastination and will continue to  demand that the investigation be completed until those  responsible are identified.    "-- Hizballah's view that the government has been negligent  in many spheres, contrary to what it promised to achieve in the  ministerial statement, even though we were harmonious when we  decided to withdraw confidence from it." [sentence as published]    On the Syrian position on the remarks made by the Hizballah  delegation, the prominent leader said that the party was given a  promise that these issues will be raised at the Lebanese-Syrian  summit to be held between Presidents Ilyas al-Hirawi and Hafiz  al-Asad in Damascus after the conclusion of the Syrian-U.S.  summit and in the presence of Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih  Birri and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.    It is understood that Damascus is still calling for calm in  Lebanon and for further cooperation and dialogue among all  parties, saying that regional and international conditions do  not allow any shocks that are difficult to control. It  understands some of the remarks and the motives for them.  However, it believes they can be overcome without reducing the  role played by the government. If there are criticisms, they  should be raised in order to strengthen the arena and effect  action.    Damascus did not raise with the Hizballah delegation the  question of resuming dialogue between it and the prime minister.  This was confirmed to AL-HAYAH by the prominent leader.  However, a ministerial source did not rule out the possibility  of resuming contacts between the two sides, but at a later  stage. That is, after Syria explores the U.S. position and the  extent of President Clinton's willingness to fulfill what he  promised to do, namely to reactivate the peace talks and  extricate them from the present deadlock.    On the mission for which the U.S. Congress delegation  visited  Damascus and its tour of a number of west al-Biqa' villages  which were the scene of ferocious fighting during the Israeli  invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 -- the tour which coincided  with the Hizballah delegation's visit to Damascus -- the  prominent leader pointed out that "there is no link between our  visit and the presence of U.S. Congress members." He reiterated  that the presence of Hizballah's delegation and U.S. Congress  members in Damascus at the same time was not an attempt to  arrange a meeting under Syrian auspices or to prepare the  atmosphere for negotiations by correspondence.    The leader denied that the U.S. Congress delegation's  mission  was discussed on the periphery of Hizballah's talks with  Khaddam. He said that Hizballah "is adhering to its position and  is refusing to hold any meetings or exchange any correspondence  with the Americans, because they lack the characteristics that  qualify them to play the role of a broker, on the grounds that  they are a concerned party."    The leader cited what Hizballah had told representatives of  the International Committee of the Red Cross and humanitarian  organizations, namely that all those captured by Israel --  Lebanese and Palestinians -- on Lebanese territory must be  released as a condition for handing over the bodies of Israeli  soldiers Hizballah has. He denied that Israeli pilot Ron Arad  is in Hizballah's custody.    He pointed out that Hizballah has no information about the  possibility of the Red Cross or UN humanitarian organizations  making a new attempt. He stressed that Hizballah's position is  clear, "and our condition is the release of all prisoners and  detainees."</p>

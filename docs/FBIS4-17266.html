			<p>BFN     [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur stated in an  exclusive interview with Interfax that Moldova's membership of  the CIS and the economic union was a manifestation of good sense  and not a move towards the restoration of the USSR, as the  opposition had claimed.    "We have gone through different stages of settling economic  problems, we have applied different methods and we have come to  the conclusion that we should join the CIS. Today, I want to  confirm that together with this we will continue the reforms and  the policy of integration with the West," Snegur stressed.    Snegur wanted the CIS economic space to become "transparent"  so that all customs barriers be lifted and a single commonwealth  be established to ensure movement of capital in all directions.    "Our policy provides for economic integration with the East  and the West and for neutrality," Snegur pointed out.    Speaking on settlement in Transdniestria, Snegur emphasized  that good opportunities had recently appeared not only for a  dialogue with Transdniestria but also for settlement of all  problems of this region. Snegur intends to take active part in  consideration of the issues concerning the status of the left  bank of the Dniester and to make his participation considered  and gradual.    "This means to look for mutually beneficial compromises. We  have already gone through the phase of wanting to solve problems  from a position of stubbornness. To demonstrate our seriousness  we agreed that Transdniestrian representatives would participate  in Russian forums with the Moldovan delegation at the CIS summit  in Moscow," Snegur said. He also hoped that the Moldovan  parliament would back the desire of Gagauzia to be an autonomy,  however, "within the composition of Moldova."    On the decision of the Russian Gazprom to reduce gas  delivery  to Moldova by one third, Snegur said the problem would be solved  positively for Moldova in the near future since Moldova had  prepared some production to be sent to Russia in order to pay  for the gas delivery.</p>

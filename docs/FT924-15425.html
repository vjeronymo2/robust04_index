			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / US renews military aid pledge to Israel THE US has given a written commitment to maintain present levels of military aid to Israel, in a move interpreted by the Israeli government as evidence that Washington will continue to bolster the Jewish state's regional qualitative military advantage. The assurance, contained in a letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin from acting secretary of state Lawrence Eagleburger, followed last month's package of military assistance for Israel to help offset Israeli objections to the proposed US sale of up to 72 F-15 fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia. The package, including the supply of Apache and Blackhawk helicopters and 'prepositioning' of US military equipment in Israel, was in addition to the Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1bn) Israel receives in annual military aid from the US. It is the latter that Mr Eagleburger promised to maintain. It amounts to almost half of all US annual foreign military aid. Israel is permitted to spend almost Dollars 500m on procurement from its own military industries. Israeli officials are extremely pleased with these developments. They said they believed the commitments would be honoured regardless of who won the US presidential election next month.</p>

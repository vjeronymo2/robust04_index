			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 27 June TASS -- Ukrainian President "Leonid  Kravchuk has won 40 per cent of votes in the presidential  marathon, his major rival ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma 35 per  cent," Rukh nationalist movement leader Vyacheslav Chornovil  said on Monday.    Chornovil said the information is based on reports from Rukh  observers at polling stations.    Earlier today, reliable sources told ITAR-TASS on Monday [27  June] that Kravchuk has taken the lead in 15 out of 24 Ukrainian  regions in the nation's second presidential elections.    He was supported by the residents of the western, central  and  partially eastern and southern regions of Ukraine.    Kuchma has gained advantage over Kravchuk in the Crimea, the  Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Odessa, Kharkov  and Chernigov regions.    Since the Central Electoral Commission has not announced the  preliminary results of voting yet, journalists have to base  their reports on information provided by regional electoral  commissions and other sources.</p>

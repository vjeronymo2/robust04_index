			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Letter: Champions of alternative policies Sir, Too much of the debate on non-executive directors (NEDs) and their role in helping Great Britain plc improve its performance is centred on the top 500-1,000 companies. The well known, and usually demanding, candidates for NEDs at this level can have their effectiveness reduced by being starved of or smothered with paper and having their access to internal or external sources of alternative views restricted, but they are clearly using their undoubted clout with increasing authority. The governance problem is at the next level, in the 10,000 private and public companies, employing 200 to 2,000 staff or more, that have external shareholders - whether institutional, family, ex-directors or others - and a narrow corporate culture. They probably have one or even two NEDs (excluding ex-chairmen and family trustees) on their boards, but such directors are unlikely to have the breadth of experience to handle all the accounting, finance, remuneration and industry technical/competitive issues the boards need to discuss. In the absence of independent advice on issues that trouble them, they will feel it necessary, for reasons of solidarity, to go along with the management view. This is the key problem in the NED approach to good corporate governance. It is no good trying to cajole boards into having more or more powerful NEDs than they want, but boards are increasingly willing to allow NEDs to call on independent personal advisers on issues of strategy, finance and remuneration. It is by increasing access to such information that non-executive directors will be effective, not just as watch dogs, but as champions of the alternative policies that boards need to consider.

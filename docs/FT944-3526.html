			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / George Michael denied speedy appeal hearing The pop star George Michael yesterday suffered a further blow in his legal battle to free himself of his contract with Sony, the record company. The singer had applied for a speedy hearing of his appeal against Mr Justice Jonathan Parker's ruling in June that he should stand by the contract he signed with Sony in 1988. Sir Thomas Bingham, the Master of the Rolls, said yesterday that Mr Michael's lawyers had 'failed to come anywhere close' to showing that his case had the urgency required to enable him to jump the long queue of other pending appeals. Sir Thomas, sitting with Lord Justice Hoffman and Lord Justice Waite, said Mr Michael had to wait until February 1996 before the courts would hear the latest round of his multi-million pound action. Mr Charles Gray QC, for Mr Michael, had told the judges the case was urgent and the singer was 'horrified' by the prospect of long delays. Mr Gray said that Mr Justice Parker's ruling meant the singer was tied to Sony until 2003 - and 'probably longer' - but that as he was genuinely unable to work for the company, his recording and musical career were frozen. Mr Michael's career was becoming 'a wasting asset'. He added that Mr Michael's last two albums had made gross profits of Pounds 60m, the lion's share of which had gone to Sony. 'Millions and millions of people all over the world listen to this man's music. There is deprivation over a huge field.' Concern in the industry about the implications of the case also justified the appeal being heard quickly, he said.</p>

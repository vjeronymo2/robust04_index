			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Malaya Group acquires Heron Motor for Pounds 16m Malaya Group, the USM-quoted motor distributor, yesterday confirmed it had acquired by auction Heron Motor, the motor dealership arm of Mr Gerald Ronson's Heron group, for Pounds 16m cash. Having beaten 13 other bidders in 'an exceedingly close race', Mr Nick Lancaster, Malaya managing director, said the consideration was 'a fair market price' and suggested Malaya was successful because it was more easily able to meet manufacturers' franchise requirements: it is obliged to dispose of the Rover and Land-Rover dealership in Bow, a sale expected soon. The consideration is to be met by a placing of some 67.3m new ordinary shares at 20p apiece to raise about Pounds 13.5m and new borrowing facilities of Pounds 3m from Midland Bank. Mr Lancaster said the price included Pounds 6.75m for goodwill and the rest for the net assets. The goodwill was high, he said, because of the quality of the London-based HR Owen trade name, the main part of Heron Motor along with HMG (Bromley) and Stockport-based Hollingdrake. The deal had taken a week longer to strike because raising the equity was 'tougher than we thought', he added. Malaya directors are to pay Pounds 1.93m to subscribe for 9.66m shares out of a possible entitlement of 16.6m for Pounds 3.32m. Mr Lancaster said the deal would give the group a portfolio evenly balanced between volume cars (trading under the Citygate name) and specialist cars. Turnover of the combined group will be about Pounds 240m to Pounds 250m. Heron Motor was the last trading business to be sold by Heron International. Holders of Pounds 378m debt in HI have been offered Pounds 142m cash for 51 per cent by HNV Acquisition, which is controlled by US entrepreneur Mr Steven Green and has Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Michael Milken's family trusts as backers.</p>

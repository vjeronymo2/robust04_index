			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY'S GYPSIES BATTLE OLD BIAS;  </P> <P> ETHNIC CONFLICT: NEITHER COMMUNISM NOR DEMOCRACY HAVE ENDED DISCRIMINATION. A  FRANTIC BATTLE IS UNDER WAY TO RAISE THEIR DEPRESSED STATUS.  </P> <P> Hungary's impoverished Gypsies, long shunned by their countrymen, are likely to  be ignored as the country struggles to reform.  </P> <P> Concern is growing that the Gypsy population -- estimated at 500,000, or one in  20 Hungarians -- will be toppled or barred from the democratic bandwagon  sweeping through Central and Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Some predict that the poor, once-migratory grouping will miss out entirely on  economic, social and political improvements. Hate literature and graffiti in  Budapest stating "Gypsy-free zone" and "Let's go kill the Gypsies" attest to  the racial discrimination they have long been subjected to.  </P> <P> "Democracy is not going to help the Gypsies," predicts Pal Farkas, an  ebullient, if pessimistic, Hungarian Gypsy politician who recently lost his bid  for a parliamentary seat on the Hungarian Social Democratic ticket.  </P> <P> Easily recognized among ethnic Hungarians because of their distinctive dark  skin, hair and eyes, Gypsies have been scorned for centuries as shiftless and  conniving. In 1987 the Hungary's Communist government funded a genetic study of  Gypsies that purported to prove that Gypsy "criminality" is hereditary.  </P> <P> Today Gypsies are mounting a frantic political assault to improve their  conditions. But observers say the effort is neither coordinated nor unified.  Rather, it is torn by factional infighting as fierce as that between Gypsy and  non-Gypsy.  </P> <P> Every Gypsy leader interviewed for this article denigrated the political  efforts of all the others.  </P> <P> Political observers say the incoming Democratic Forum government is unlikely to  take serious steps to help the Gypsies, despite campaign promises. They say  many Hungarians' hatred of Gypsies, coupled with the depressed economy stemming  from 45 years of communist mismanagement, provides little incentive to resolve  the Gypsy problem.  </P> <P> Like Native Americans, Gypsies are an indigenous grouping that has been  converted into a dependent, deprived society. They are at the bottom of the  social ladder in terms of income, employment, education, infrastructure,  medical care and housing, according to Anna Csongor, a Hungarian researcher  specializing in the education of Gypsies.  </P> <P> "The ideology of the (political) parties seems to be 'a country with so many  problems can't face the Gypsy problem,' " said Gypsy Jeno Zsigo, who directs  the Gypsy Social and Cultural Development Center in Budapest.  </P> <P> Zsigo said 70% to 80% of Hungarian Gypsies live in poor areas. Many urban  Gypsies are now homeless and suffer frequent physical attacks.  </P> <P> Ten or so Hungarian Gypsy parties sprang up before the March and April  legislative elections. The groups received a government campaign subsidy of  about $16,000, but many Hungarians resented this tiny support, calling it a  waste of money.  </P> <P> In a historic step, two Hungarian Gypsies were elected to the new 386-seat  Parliament. But another, Agnes Daroczi, who holds a university degree, lost  even though she cut a deal with the non-Gypsy Alliance of Free Democrats'  Party. In exchange for a position on the slate, Daroczi agreed to keep her  Gypsy identity secret and deliver the Gypsy vote.  </P> <P> Daroczi's Phralipe (Brotherhood) Party, a Gypsy political movement, seeks a  revival and development of traditional Gypsy culture, plus official recognition  of the Romani language.  </P> <P> Other parties, like the Truth Party of New Hungarians, led by a retired Gypsy  truck driver, favor assimilation into the mainstream Hungarian culture.  </P> <P> Farkas, the politician, said he urged fellow Gypsies to abstain from voting in  the elections to demonstrate Gypsies' political impact. Leaders say relief from  a multitude of social and fiscal burdens will require a concerted political  effort, though such unity seems unlikely.  </P> <P> "The Gypsy organizations lack an intelligentsia, and the intelligent Gypsies  are not organized," said Janos Bathory, chief counselor of the Hungarian  Council of Ministries for National and Ethnic Minorities.  </P> <P> Bathory, who campaigned with the winning Hungarian Democratic Forum, decides  how government aid is distributed to minorities including Jews, Germans, and  Czeches.  </P> <P> Aid does little to alleviate the Gypsies' problems, which are staggering.  </P> <P> "They are the only group in Hungary with any significant amount of illiteracy,"  said Csongor, the researcher. The majority in Hungary work at unskilled jobs or  are musicians or artists, she said.  </P> <P> During the Nazi Holocaust, an estimated 50,000 Hungarian Gypsies perished.  Hungarian nationalism and Gypsy poverty have helped trample the survivors or  their descendants.  </P> <P> In Romania, where Gypsies are believed to make up nearly 20% of the 23-million  population, five Gypsy or Rom people were elected to the new legislature.  </P> <P> But Romanians have also branded the late, hated dictator Nicolae Ceausescu as  having "Gypsy blood."  </P> <P> In Hungary, most of the formerly nomadic Gypsies have been settled for hundreds  of years. The vast majority live in the nation's poorest villages where  education is minimal and jobs are unavailable. They are expected by the  government to fend for themselves.  </P> <P> Education is a serious problem. Many Gypsies distrust state schools. They view  teachers as apathetic at best and intolerant or patronizing toward children at  worst, Csongor said.  </P> <P> Her husband, Gyorgy Mezei, a social worker, said Gypsy children in Budapest  have been fainting recently in school due to malnutrition.  </P> <P> "Fifty percent of the Gypsies don't finish compulsory education," said Zsigo,  also a social worker.  </P></p>

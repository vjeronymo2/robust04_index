			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3-A GIRLS;  </P> <P> MATER DEI SHUTS OUT SANTA BARBARA  </P> <P> The Mater Dei High School girls' soccer team accomplished plenty on Saturday  with its 2-0 victory over Santa Barbara for the 3-A championship at Gahr High  School.  </P> <P> * The Monarchs gave the school its first Southern Section title in a girls'  sport.  </P> <P> * They gave a proper send-off to Marty Breen, who announced Saturday that he  will step down as head coach after 11 years at Mater Dei, the past four as the  girls' coach.  </P> <P> * They set a school record for shutouts in a season -- 20 -- which ties Agoura  as the second-best mark in Southern Section history; Laguna Hills recorded 23  in 1986-87.  </P> <P> But what really seemed to make the Monarchs' day was a quick, postgame  announcement by Breen.  </P> <P> "OK, everyone is to meet Monday at 3 p.m. at Mater Dei," he said. "I'll need  you to turn in your uniforms . . . but you can keep the sweats."  </P> <P> Judging by the players' reaction -- a near-deafening team scream -- the sweats  must be as important as the championship plaque that they took turns holding.  </P> <P> "I couldn't feel any better," Kari Marshall said. "No way could you ever have a  better ending to your senior year than this."  </P> <P> Saturday's match seemed over after the first half, if not sooner. The Monarchs  (23-2-2) dominated Santa Barbara in nearly every aspect of the game, and got  goals from Susan Steiner and Robyn Camarillo.  </P> <P> Mater Dei outshot Santa Barbara, 8-2, in the first half and 15-7 for the game.  </P> <P> "When you come into (the Southern Section title game), you hear all this hype  about the team you're going to play," said Camarillo, who assisted on Steiner's  goal. "I think when we got out there, it was kind of a letdown."  </P> <P> Many of the Monarchs said that the intensity of Saturday's match did not  compare to their semifinal match Tuesday against Canyon. Mater Dei won that  game, 1-0, in sudden-death overtime.  </P> <P> "Yeah, we came here expecting the best," Marshall said. "We're kind of glad it  turned out this way, I guess."  </P> <P> Santa Barbara (24-2-2), which lost just one game in the regular season -- to  Thousand Oaks -- seemed to have trouble keeping any momentum going. In contrast  to Mater Dei's excellent passing and trapping skills, the Dons utilized a  long-passing approach. It didn't get them very far, not with the Monarchs'  stellar defense.  </P> <P> "They were pretty much the most aggressive team we've played this year," Santa  Barbara's Maria Guerrero said.  </P></p>

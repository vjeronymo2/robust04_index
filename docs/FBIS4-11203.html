			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 22 Apr (AFP) -- Hundreds of  demonstrators protested this Friday against President Carlos  Roberto Reina, whom they accuse of continuing during his first  three months in office the neoliberal economic policies of the  former administration of Rafael Callejas.    In this first demonstration against the administration that  took office on 27 January, the marchers demanded measures to  counter the high cost of living and an end to mandatory military  service, one of the promises Reina made during his election  campaign.    Upon taking office, Reina asked Hondurans for 100 days to  organize measures that would give a "human face" to the economic  adjustment program and which would diminish the protagonistic  role of the military in state affairs.    The demonstrators accused Reina of not keeping his promises  and demanded a price freeze to halt inflation, which increased 7  percent in three months; reactivation of the agrarian reform;  and land grants to peasants.    Rafael Alegria of the National Federation of Rural Workers  gave a speech saying that Reina must change the economic  policies inherited from the former administration.    Juan Almendarez, a pacifist leader, demanded a dialogue with  the government and popular sectors to unify support against  "pressure from international organizations" of credit which  demand the economic adjustment measures. He warned that "if  urgent measures are not taken, there may be social instability"  in Honduras.</p>

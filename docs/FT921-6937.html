			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Saab Auto slices losses to SKr1.39bn SAAB Auto has reported a SKr1.39bn (Dollars 232m) loss, after financial items, for 1991, down from a loss of SKr4.64bn in 1990. Sales rose 2 per cent to SKr15.01bn, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The final-quarter result was particularly heartening for the company, which is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US. This fell to a loss of SKr134m from a SKr881m deficit last time. The company said its recovery through 1991 reflected the fruits of a strong productivity performance and extensive restructuring, including the closure of Saab's Malmo plant and concentration of Swedish assembly operations at Trollhattan. It said it increased its share in important markets despite the impact of depressed economic conditions on sales. In Sweden, market share rose to 9.6 per cent from 8.5 per cent in 1990. The figure was the highest recorded by Saab Auto since 1986.</p>

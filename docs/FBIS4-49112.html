			<p>BFN     [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party  committee, conducted investigation and study in Tianjin New  Technology Industrial Park on 20 April and sponsored a forum  with the responsible comrades of relevant districts and bureaus,  in which he stressed: The days of bringing into full play the  scientific and technological strong points in the municipality  symbolize the occasion in which the municipality's economy is  becoming prosperous. Various social circles across the  municipality should firmly foster the thinking of science and  technology being the primary productive force; unite as one;  double their efforts; further accelerate the development of high  and new technologies; and accelerate the transfer of high and  new technological results, the industrialization of high and new  technologies, and the construction of new-tech industrial parks  and zones in the municipality so as to bring into full play the  scientific and technological strong points of the municipality.    Participating in the investigation and study activities were  Zheng Zhiying, member of the municipal party standing committee  and secretary general of the municipal party committee, and  responsible comrades from the districts of Nankai and Xiqing.    Gao Dezhan and his entourage first looked into the  enterprises located in the new-tech industrial park, including  Tianjin Land-Seabed Oil-Drilling Equipment and Technology  Development Company, Wantong Electronic Machine Company,  Dongfang Electronic Development Company, Xinxing Electronic  Company, and Tianjin Jinke Electronic Corporation Ltd. They  also went deep into the workshops of production and sale  departments to learn about the situation in technology,  equipment, and the contingent of staff members and workers.  They also heard the briefing given by the responsible comrade  of the municipal science and technology commission with regard  to the situation prevailing in the municipal new-tech industrial  park.    The present scope and high and new technologies of the  municipal new-tech industrial park have achieved rapid  development under the correct leadership of the municipal party  committee and the municipal people's government and thanks to  the support given by the State Science and Technology Commission  and various social circles. At the end of March this year, the  number of enterprises in the new- tech industrial park reached  1,140, which accommodated 30,000 employees. Total income earned  by the enterprises of technology, industry, and trade in the  park in 1993 topped the figure of 2.2 billion yuan and showed a  100 percent increase over 1992. The capital construction of the  new-tech industrial park has entered the stage of  overall-planned development. Construction has been carried out  in the four fields of establishing industrial enterprises and  the enterprises of bringing their function into play,  implementing the state policies, and exerting influence. The  park has also deepened its reform in various projects and  created a relaxed environment for high-and-new tech enterprises  to persistently enforcing the brand-new mechanism. The park's  function of turning the high scientific and technological  results into productive forces has been steadily enhanced and  played a promoting role in industrializing and  internationalizing high and new technologies. Over the past few  years, the municipal industrial park has accumulated over 1,500  new products of high and new technologies. Of these new  products, a large number of key products have reached the  advanced standards at home and abroad and begun to enter  international markets.    During the forum, Gao Dezhan first acknowledged the obvious  achievements scored by the municipal new-tech industrial park  over the past few years. He pointed out: Tianjin is filled  with talented science and technology personnel, has obvious  strong points in science and technology, and should take greater  steps in having science and technology make the municipality  prosperous and strive to do something more worthwhile in this  regard. Efforts should be made to bring into full play the  municipal strong points in talented personnel, higher  educational institutions, the state scientific research  institutes, and in policies and industries. We should truly  achieve in bringing the municipal scientific research strong  points into play and enable the municipal program of  industrializing high and new technologies to achieve faster and  better progress.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: The general demand set by the  municipality for scientific and technological work is to  accelerate the development of high and new technologies, the  transfer of scientific and technological results, the  industrialization of high and new technologies, and the  construction of new-tech industrial parks and zones. By making  full and good use of the conditions and policies granted by the  state, the new-tech industrial park should do a good job in the  following three aspects: 1) Accelerate the establishment of  high-and-new tech enterprises. 2) Apply high and new  technologies to rebuilding the out-dated enterprises and provide  equal treatment devoid of prejudice to out-dated enterprises as  long as they conform to the conditions of high and new  technology. It means that we should not only grasp economic  growing points but also apply high and new technologies to  arming the enterprises based on the existing foundation. This  is an important way to make the municipal economy prosperous.  3) Make full use of the laboratories and conditions of higher  educational institutions and scientific research institutes  throughout the municipality.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: In accelerating the construction in  the industrial park, we should proceed from reality; create new  ideas; and make full use of existing conditions. Meanwhile,  efforts should be made to straighten out the managerial systems;  to manage what deserves to be managed; and to delegate rights  that deserve to be delegated so as to enable various circles to  be enthusiastic in development and to make contributions to  accelerating the development of such industrial parks and zones  by proceeding from the whole situation and taking coordinated  action.    Gao Dezhan emphatically pointed out: While accelerating the  development of the new-tech industrial park, we should also  attach great importance on scientific and technological work.  We should create new ideas and measures and make a new  breakthrough this year to integrate between the task of having  science and technology be aimed at production and construction  and that of having production and construction rely on science  and technology. In particular, we should give priority to the  following five key points in turning the scientific and  technological results into practical productive forces: 1) High  and new technologies should be industrialized; 2) Out-dated  enterprises should be reformed with high and new technologies;  3) We should apply high and new technologies to increasing the  variety of new products; 4) The technical progress of  enterprises should be accelerated, the products' quality should  be upgraded, and the cost and consumption of enterprises should  be lowered; 5) The practical and advanced technologies of  agriculture should be popularized so as to promote agricultural  development. Gao Dezhan pointed out: Successfully integrating  science and technology with production requires the common  efforts made by several circles. The units of production,  construction, and management should truly foster their sense of  science and technology; upgrade their enthusiasm and initiative  in applying the scientific and technological results; and foster  the thinking of science and technology that mean funds, time,  and benefits. Higher educational institutions and scientific  research units should vigorously upgrade the quality of their  scientific and technological results, increase the applied  benefits of them, and do a good job in rendering services. We  must integrate the appraisal of scientific research units with  their practical results. As for those that have scored benefits  in applying the scientific research results, we should give them  a handsome reward if they deserve commendation. As for those  who have long failed to turn out research results and whose  results have not been applied for a long time, we should adopt  measures to handle them. The departments of government and  those in charge of the work should enhance macro readjustment  and control, study the methods of encouragement and support, and  give encouragement in policies to the applied scientific  research results. Government departments, departments in charge  of the work, as well as higher educational institutions and  scientific research units should commonly make efforts to  successfully conduct the work of turning the scientific research  results into productive forces, to accelerate the program of  having science and technology make the municipality prosperous,  and to again create a splendid image of Tianjin.</p>

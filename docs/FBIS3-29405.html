The leading Japanese electronics manufacturer said it is the  world's first microchip capable of processing moving images  produced by video cameras.    With current technology, a desk-size computer system would  be  needed for similar processing.    NEC said potential applications of the chip include a  computer- based multimedia terminal that would handle image and  voice data, as in teleconferencing.    The chip, 15.1 by 15.6 millimeters, comprises 10 million  transistors, 64 processors for image processing and a  two-million- bit memory device, NEC said.    The processors, through parallel data processing, make it  possible to perform 3.84 billion calculations per second, NEC  said.</p>

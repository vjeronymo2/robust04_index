			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASSINETS OLD HAT  </P> <P> I enjoyed Peter Greenberg's article in The Savvy Traveler on "Nursery at 25,000  Feet" (Jan. 29), but he did not do his homework. Pan Am, an American carrier,  has offered bassinets since its first 747 took off. They must be ordered ahead  of time but are available on 747 equipment.  </P> <P> (Wish my local travel section was as good as yours.)  </P> <P> CLAUDIA BRITLIN  </P> <P> Friendly Travel  </P> <P> Alexandria, Va.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEORGE, PLEASE LISTEN TO BARBARA  </P> <P> During a recent celebration marking the 25th anniversary of Head Start, the  exemplary federally funded preschool program for poor children, First Lady  Barbara Bush lavished praise, and made a heartening promise: "George Bush knows  our children need more," she said. "He has pledged that every eligible  4-year-old should have a head start in life."  </P> <P> At present, Head Start serves 37% of the eligible 4-year-olds and 18% of all  eligible children between 3 and 5. More than 488,500 youngsters benefit at a  cost of $1.4 billion. It would cost $5 billion to fully fund the comprehensive  program, according to the Committee on Education Funding.  </P> <P> It's unrealistic to expect President Bush to triple the funding when he  proposes his budget next week, given the deficits and competing national  priorities. But he should significantly expand Head Start. It works.  </P> <P> Head Start children learn to think, develop language skills and gain  confidence. They are far less likely to be held back a grade, according to a  congressional study, or be assigned to special education classes. Poor children  who attend high- quality preschool programs are more likely to graduate from  high school and attend college or obtain job training, according to a  definitive study by the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation in  Ypsilanti, Mich., and less likely to get pregnant, go on welfare or get  arrested.  </P> <P> The program is expensive. It costs to provide education, meals, medical  attention and dental care. But the investment pays off. According to the  High/Scope study, every dollar invested saves $6 in future social costs.  </P> <P> Eleven million children have benefited since President Johnson launched Head  Start in 1965. Today's children need more. Barbara Bush is right.  </P></p>

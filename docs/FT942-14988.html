			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Electorate does want new direction Sir, No political career is ever damaged by praising the party leader and who would want to stand in the way of Giles Radice's path to power. Yet I would question his assumption (Letters, April 14) that the opposition should not say what it is about. We've gone too far in trying to over-compensate for our folly in offering long and insane shopping lists in the early 1980s. Now we offer nothing much at all. Except commissions. 'What do we want?', 'Wait and see' is hardly an exciting slogan. Those who want to hand power over to a European central bank don't need an economic alternative. The electorate does and the nation is fed up with stumbling decline, everything getting worse, the feeling that this government cannot even find a course to be blown off. It wants to be part of a nation which is going somewhere and which can deliver what the people expect of the system: jobs, economic growth, rising well-being, the maximisation of living standards. All is possible and the public have moved ahead of us in their willingness to accept the necessary measures. After 16 years of marching the wrong way down a dead-end street they want leadership in a new direction. Unless we capture that tide as did Mrs Thatcher in 1979, and Labour in 1963, we become wise, statesmanlike, friendly, commautaire and irrelevant. Austin Mitchell, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

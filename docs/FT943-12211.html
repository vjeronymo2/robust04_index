			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Dutch bank launches benchmark DM deal BNG, the Dutch municipal finance bank, yesterday pushed on with its strategy of establishing benchmark issues in non-guilder currencies with the launch of a DM750m offering of five-year eurobonds. Last week, the bank launched a Dollars 1bn five-year eurobond offering, its first benchmark since it was awarded triple-A debt ratings one month ago. Joint lead manager Goldman Sachs said this policy was the best way of appealing to a wide variety of investors. However, syndicate managers said that, in spite of the attractive spread of 27 basis points over five-year German government bonds and the bank's strong following with European retail investors, the deal was too large given current demand. They added that institutional investors were unwilling to buy D-Mark bonds ahead of tomorrow's auction of five-year bonds by Treuhand, the German privatisation agency. Sears, Roebuck, the US retailing and insurance group, is planning to launch a global, asset-backed issue of around Dollars 1bn in the next month. The securitised offering will be backed by the company's credit card receivables, worth Dollars 20.4bn. CS First Boston has been mandated to lead-manage the triple-A rated issue, which could be the first in a series. The company is planning to file a shelf with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which could cover several years of issuance. Fixed-rate funding currently accounts for 86 per cent of the company's borrowing. 'In the next year or so this will be closer to 75 per cent,' said Ms Alice Peterson, company treasurer. This would be a comfortable mix given the current capital market environment. Bayerische Landesbank launched a Y30bn three-year bond issue yesterday amid rumours that the European Investment Bank may tap the euroyen market soon. Syndicate managers expect a Y50bn to Y100bn three-year issue from the EIB, to come either today or after this week's auction of 10-year Japanese government bonds. Moody's has downgraded the long and short-term ratings of Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, to A3 and P2 respectively from A1 and P1. Both ratings have been on review for possible downgrade since February. Around Dollars 13bn of long-term debt is affected.</p>

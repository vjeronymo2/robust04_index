			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (2): The trend is still decidedly upwards - Consumer credit / A look at evidence from the high street The rise in consumer credit in the past year, which has reflected the growing confidence in the high street, has not been a smooth one, and the latest rise in interest rates has further highlighted the fragility of the recovery. However, the trend is still decidedly upwards. Figures for 1993 showed how much the consumer credit market had recovered from the recession, and 1994 has so far built on this. According to the Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), new lending by its members was up 25 per cent last year at Pounds 13.1bn (1992: Pounds 10.5bn). The biggest rise was seen in the store instalment sector, where new credit rose 46 per cent to nearly Pounds 1bn (Pounds 664m). Storecards themselves showed only a 12 per cent rise to Pounds 3.4bn (Pounds 3.0bn), reflecting the trend among retailers to offer promotional credit to bolster sales. There was a steep climb in the number of unsecured personal loans which jumped 36 per cent to Pounds 2.1bn (Pounds 1.5bn) last year. Motor finance also staged a good recovery. The FLA figures show a 34 per cent rise in motor finance credit in 1993, Pounds 5.5bn being taken out by customers against Pounds 4.1bn in the previous year. The trends so far in 1994 give a mixed picture of the demand for credit, although an overall positive one. The April tax increases and the rise in interest rates in September have both had effects, the first feeding through slowly to dampen consumer spending and the second raising the cost of credit with a negative effect on demand. Inflationary evidence since then, in the rest of the developed world's economies as well as in the UK, has raised expectations of further rises in interest rates. It was just such a fear which was attributed to the slowdown in consumer credit in August. According to the FLA, consumer credit was up 12 per cent at Pounds 3.1bn (Pounds 2.8bn) year-on-year, and up 44 per cent on the July's total. However, this latter jump was due to August car sales which received their annual boost from the impact of new registrations. The overall consumer credit rise on an annual basis was lower than in previous months. David Hardisty, chairman of the FLA, said: 'The government underestimated the fear factor and put up rates when confidence was still too shaky.' Personal loans slipped 1 per cent to Pounds 256m from the previous month, although they remained 30 per cent ahead of the year before. Store cards were also down from July, falling 9 per cent to Pounds 375m, but showing a 58 per cent rise year-on-year. Infolink, the credit information group, has produced similar findings. Tracking credit inquiries by its customers, its research showed demand to finance houses - which provide finance for cars, store cards and 'in-house' store credit - 18 per cent ahead in July year-on-year, retail 6.7 per cent up and new car loans 3.6 per cent ahead. These were nearly all less than the previous month's rises. Brian Bailey, chairman of Infolink, said: 'It is possible that this reflects a stabilisation in the pace of recovery, rather than a genuine lack of spending confidence.' Official statistics are somewhat at odds with industry data - although the upward trend is similar. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) reported lending to consumers at record levels in August after a slight dip in July. On a three-monthly basis, total consumer lending was put at Pounds 1.58bn to the end of August, up from Pounds 1.15bn in the previous quarter. Higher net lending by finance houses jumped from Pounds 324m in July to Pounds 486m in August, according to the CSO. Underpinning the recovery in consumer spending are changes to the types of credit being used. Retailers, for example, have been handing over their card and credit systems to finance houses. 'Retailers are focusing their attention on retaining customer loyalty and concentrating on what they do best,' said John Morgan, managing director of Personal Finance at Lombard North Central, the financial services group. Retailers have also been moving away from option and budget cards in recent years, opting instead for promotional credit. This might typically offer consumers not only more frequent sales bargains, but also cheaper credit with which to buy them. Mr Morgan estimates that as much as 50 per cent of high street stores' sales are bought on promotional credit. Many of the high street retailers have farmed out there credit businesses. In 1989 Storehouse, the BHS, Habitat, Mothercare and Richards retail group, sold its card business with 400,000 customers, accounting for about 8 per cent of the group's turnover, to Yorkshire Bank. Four years ago, GE Capital, the financial services business of General Electric of the US, paid Pounds 183m for the financial services business of Burton, the high street clothes group. The deal brought GE a card holder base of 3m and the management of several other retailer card operations. GE also took over the credit card operations of The House of Fraser, which has 1.1m customers. House of Fraser pays GE Capital a fee and the deal is initially for 15 years. GE also acquired the motor loans business of Mercantile Credit, a subsidiary of Barclays. Lombard paid Pounds 100m for Thorn EMI Financial Services and Trinity House Finance. Store cards and consumer credit business for Thorn EMI's retail outlets, including Rumbelows, are owned by Lombard, which also looks after new business for Granada and Visionhire. 'Consumer confidence is returning, although it does seem to be slowing down, and this is showing through to the credit market,' says Mr Morgan. 'But people are shopping around and retailers and credit providers are having to respond.'</p>

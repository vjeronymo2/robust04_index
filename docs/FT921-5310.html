			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Operating loss at TWA increases to Dollars 353.5m TRANS World Airlines, the US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn and currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, made an operating loss of Dollars 353.5m in 1991. This compared with a Dollars 162.3m deficit in the same period a year earlier, and a small Dollars 24.3m profit in 1989. The 1991 figure came on revenues down from Dollars 4.6bn to Dollars 3.66bn. TWA sold a number of assets during the year and these included leading routes between three US cities and London's Heathrow Airport - which were acquired by American Airlines. Most of TWA's operating expense items were lower year-on-year, including fuel, which fell from Dollars 898.4m in 1990 to Dollars 647.7m. However, the overall slump in revenues outweighed the reduction in total operating costs, from Dollars 4.77bn to Dollars 4.01bn. At the after-tax level, the operating loss is transformed in a small net profit of Dollars 48.3m, thanks largely to the Dollars 681.7m gain on asset sales, against Dollars 205m. Interest expenses were Dollars 287m, against Dollars 302.8m.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (18): Basically in sound health - The United States / Declining bond yields are a signpost to recovery US ECONOMIC growth seems likely to accelerate in the second half of the year after a disappointing first six months, reflecting the positive impact on consumer and business spending of a decline in long-term interest rates to the lowest levels since the late 1960s. The most spectacular sign of cheaper borrowing costs was the recent decline of the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond to below 6 per cent for the first time since it was issued in 1977. Yields on most long-maturity bonds are at their lowest levels in a generation, reflecting investors' confidence (possibly misplaced) that inflation will not pose a threat for the foreseeable future. The trend toward lower long-term interest rates, under way for several years, should steadily improve the outlook for interest-rate sensitive sectors, such as cars, consumer durables, business equipment and residential housing. It seems likely to outweigh the slightly negative impact on growth of the mild fiscal contraction imposed by the Clinton administration's first budget, signed last month. But growth will probably remain subdued by historical standards, reflecting low rates of domestic saving and investment, weak consumer confidence and relatively high debt burdens. The contraction still under way in defence-related industries and the uncertainty associated with the planned radical overhaul of healthcare (one seventh of the economy) could also reduce growth in the short run. Real gross domestic product is likely to grow at an underlying annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent, double the 1.3 per cent rate in the first half but well below the 4-5 per cent rates typical in past US recoveries. The consensus is that GDP will continue expanding at this steady pace, or perhaps a shade faster, next year. The pattern of growth, however, will be distorted by the extensive flooding in the mid-west in July and August. Crop damage and disruption of business activity could reduce growth by 0.5 percentage points in the third quarter. But rebuilding of damaged infrastructure and a rebound in farm output will probably add at least this much to GDP in the final quarter of this year and in the first period of 1994. Confidence in the economy's underlying health has been bolstered by the largest upward revisions to past growth rates in 20 years. Last month, the Commerce Department announced benchmark revisions which showed that the 1990-91 recession was shallower, and the subsequent recovery stronger, than previously estimated. The peak-to-trough decline in GDP was only 1.6 per cent, not 2.2 per cent. Since the recovery began in the spring of 1991, GDP growth has averaged nearly 2.5 per cent, rather than the 2 per cent previously reported. The scale of revisions was huge. The estimate for GDP in the second quarter released in August, for example, was 1.6 per cent higher than the estimate published in July. Thus, although growth was lower than expected in the first half, the level of national income was actually higher. The recent slowdown has to be seen as a reaction to unsustainably rapid growth in the second half of last year (when GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.6 per cent), which in turn reflected the bringing forward of bonus payments to avoid the expected increase in personal taxes in President Clinton's first budget. Over the last four quarters, growth has averaged just under 3 per cent. The composition of growth is encouraging. In the year to the second quarter, the volume of gross private investment grew by 8.8 per cent, far outpacing a 3.4 per cent increase in real consumer spending. The capital formation, moreover, was concentrated in productive business rather than residential housing, which expanded only modestly. Led by a surge of investment in computing equipment, business spending on durable equipment rose 14.6 per cent in real terms. Government spending, by contrast, was flat, reflecting the fiscal inhibitions imposed by a decade of record budget deficits. The popular notion that the US is experiencing a 'jobless recovery' is hardly supported by the data. The unemployment rate has fallen more than a percentage point to 6.7 per cent in the past year. Weekly claims for unemployment insurance fell to 316,000 at the beginning of September, the lowest level in four years and far below the peak of over 500,000 reached during the recession. Employment figures confirm this picture of a steadily improving labour market. Since its trough in February last year, non-farm payroll employment has risen by 2.2m to 110.3m, comfortably surpassing the previous peak in 1990. What the overall trend masks, however, is variations between sectors. Service sector employment (especially in healthcare) has risen substantially, but manufacturers have steadily eliminated jobs: at 17.7m, the current level of manufacturing employment is nearly 10 per cent below its pre-recession peak. But this is more a reflection of efficiency gains in US factories than of a broader malaise in US manufacturing: productivity has risen by more than 5 per cent in the past year, and the length of the average workweek is at its highest level in 25 years. The forecast of steady US economic growth is not without risks. Some analysts believe US share prices have risen too fast and could tumble, undermining consumer and business confidence. The weakness of foreign trade continues to sap the economy's domestic vitality: but for a rising trade deficit, the US would have grown by 3.6 per cent in the year to the second quarter, rather than the 2.9 per cent actually record. But, two years into the recovery, the best guess is that the business cycle's natural momentum will keep the economy rolling forward.</p>

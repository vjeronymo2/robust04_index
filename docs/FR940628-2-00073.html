The notice will soon be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the request of some of the workers and the company, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The investigation findings show that Western Geophysical Company purchased the Geophysical Services Division of the Halliburton Company in January 1994 whose workers were certified for TAA under an earlier certification, TA&hyph;W&hyph;27, 776. As a result, some of the former Halliburton workers laid off from Western Geophysical do not have the required 26 weeks to meet their personal eligibility requirement. Accordingly, the Department is amending the subject certification to show that Western Geophysical is a successor-in-interest firm to Halliburton Geophysical Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendment notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29, 802 is hereby issued as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> ``All workers of Western Geophysical Company, Houston, Texas, the successor-in-interest firm to Halliburton Geophysical Services, Houston, Texas, engaged in seismic activities related to oil and gas exploration who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after April 25, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Signed in Washington, DC, this 15th day of June 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=4 --> Violet L.

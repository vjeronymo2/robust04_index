			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Court fines Ralph Lauren for copying rival's design: Yves Saint-Laurent claims victory is important step for fashion world Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, yesterday set a new trend in the industry by winning FFr2m (Pounds 230,000) damages in a Paris commercial court after suing Ralph Lauren, the leading US fashion designer, for copying one of its dress designs. It is commonplace in the fashion trade for leading designers such as Saint-Laurent and Ralph Lauren, to sue counterfeiters, or 'knock-off merchants', at the lower end of the business. But this is the first case of its kind involving two such prestigious names. The case, conducted with all the drama of the fashion world, concerns a black tuxedo dress sold in 1992 by Ralph Lauren's boutiques which Saint-Laurent claimed was copied from one of his 1970 designs. Mr Pierre Berge, chairman of Saint-Laurent, was fined FFr500,000 yesterday by the same court after Ralph Lauren complained about allegedly defamatory remarks he made concerning the case in Women's Wear Daily, the US fashion trade magazine. Ms Francine Summa, Saint-Laurent's lawyer, said after the hearing that Mr Berge 'would have been better off keeping his mouth shut'. Yet the Saint-Laurent camp's disappointment at that defeat was dwarfed by its glee over its triumph in the main case. 'We're very satisfied with the outcome,' said Mr Christophe Girard, company secretary. 'It's an important step for us and the entire industry.' The drama of the tuxedo dress began in late 1992 when Saint-Laurent's lawyers spotted a magazine picture of a Ralph Lauren dress which was similar to the 1970 design that the French designer had reinterpreted for his autumn 1992 collections. Counterfeiting is a serious problem for the leading fashion houses of Paris, Milan and New York, all of which have assembled heavyweight legal teams to crack down on illegal copies of their designs and trademarks. Saint-Laurent spends around FFr50m a year fighting counterfeiting. Chanel, another French house, is believed to spend FFr30m. However, the black tuxedo case is the first to have raised the sensitive subject of designer 'copy-catting' in the law courts. Until now, designers have balked at taking legal action over such issues because of the difficulty of proving that one design was actually copied from another. Ms Madeleine Cotelle, the judge in the black tuxedo case, summoned models wearing the Saint-Laurent and Lauren designs to her courtroom so she could inspect them. Ralph Lauren declined to comment on yesterday's ruling. It said it would wait until the judge's report is published later today before deciding whether to appeal.</p>

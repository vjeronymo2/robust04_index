			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All of these changes are designed to enhance the administration and functioning of the marketing agreement and order to the benefit of the industry. If implemented, these amendments might impose some costs on affected handlers and producers. However, the added burden on small entities, if present at all, would not be significant because the benefits of the proposed amendments are expected to outweigh the costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. They are not intended to have retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], any additional handler reporting and recordkeeping requirements, including any new reports and the two succeeding fiscal periods record retention, that might result from the proposed amendments would be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The provisions would not be effective until receiving OMB approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Material Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The material issues of record addressed in this decision are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Whether to redefine ``ship or handle'' to include shipments of potatoes within the production area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) whether seed producers should be provided representation on the committee and whether there should be authority to change committee size and composition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) update ``Districts'' to list the current composition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) whether to require the committee to consider, at least every six years, whether to recommend changes in committee size or reapportionment of committee membership;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) whether committee procedures should be changed to require a simple majority of all members to constitute a quorum, pass a motion or approve a committee action, except to change committee size would require a unanimous vote;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) whether the $1 per carload maximum rate for handler assessments should be removed and assessments be permitted on a rate per hundredweight of assessable potatoes handled and whether there should be authority for the committee to impose late payment/interest charges, accept advance assessment payments, and borrow monies in an extreme emergency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) whether there should be authority for container marking and labeling requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) whether to add provisions for the Secretary and the committee to verify the accuracy of reports filed by handlers, protect the confidentiality of such information, and require each handler to maintain records of potatoes handled for at least two succeeding fiscal periods to verify required reports specified in the rules and regulations; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

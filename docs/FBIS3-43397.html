			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Government Unable To 'Govern With a Firm Hand' -- "The  government does not seem to have any plan of action for halting  the violence in the run-up to the election, being unable to act  decisively for fear of ANC [African National Congress]  reaction," declares the page 6 editorial in Johannesburg THE  CITIZEN in English on 4 January. "Is it too much to expect the  government to govern with a firm hand until the election decides  whether it is put out of office?" "Weakness in that regard is to  the disadvantage of both, because, to put it simply, both are  held to blame for what is happening and both need to ensure that  not only is the playing field levelled, but nobody tries to dig  it up or disrupt the decisive election match that will be played  on it shortly."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Self-Defense Units Part of Violence in Townships --  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 6 January in a page 12  editorial believes township self-defense units, SDUs, "are part  of the problem of violence in the East Rand townships of  Katlehong, Vosloorus and Thokoza." THE STAR has established  that "internecine warfare between rival SDUs in Katlehong is a  factor in the bloodletting in the township. As an ANC official  in Katlehong notes, ANC supporters find themselves in conflict  with one another. His statement is important for another  reason: it repudiates the official mythology that SDUs are  apolitical rather than ANC-aligned organisations. The ANC  admits that it has to intervene to restructure SDUs in the  troubled East Rand townships." THE STAR concludes from the East  Rand violence and the ANC admissions that withdrawing the  Internal Stability Division from the townships "will aggravate  rather than solve the problem, as the Goldstone Commission  warned last month."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Negotiating Urgency Has 'Dissipated' -- "Constitutional  negotiations and the operations of the Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] are being conducted in a rather desultory and  sloppy manner," says a page 6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS  DAY in English on 6 January. The editorial refers to the  "arm-twisting between the Freedom Alliance [FA] on one hand and  the NP [National Party] and ANC on the other over preconditions  for further talks," saying "it seems that we have returned to  the phase of 'talks about talks' which, when conducted between  the ANC and NP, went on for years. That kind of time is no  longer available." "Exacerbating this problem is the fact that  almost all the TEC decisions taken in the absence of the Freedom  Alliance create new problems and obstacles to a final  settlement." The "refreshing sense of urgency" demonstrated by  negotiators in November "has all dissipated now."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Self-Defense Units 'Banditry' in Townships -- Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 6 January in a page 6 editorial comments  on the "war" among self-defense units on the East Rand, saying  the SDUs "quickly deteriorate into armed bandits." It is a  tragedy that "they have to do work that the police should be  doing," and that "they are not answerable to anybody." It is  "laudable" that the ANC is "trying to rein them in," but "the  problem has to be tackled at a much deeper level to stop  banditry in the name of self defence in the townships."</p>

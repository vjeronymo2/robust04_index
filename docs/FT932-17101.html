			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major backs claim on Maxwell THE PRIME minister yesterday supported an appeal for interim payments to be made from the remaining funds of occupational pension schemes plundered by Robert Maxwell. Mr Richard Page (C Hertfordshire South-West) said that the trustees of the Maxwell pension funds would be meeting later this month to discuss the common investment fund which stood at about Pounds 180m. He asked Mr Major to contact the trustees and urge a partial distribution so that pensioners could have payments while the 'missing millions' were found and a long term solution put in place.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho buys coal interests in S Africa Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate dominated by Mr Tiny Rowland for more than 30 years, is to acquire all the coal interests in the Eastern Transvaal of Agip, the Italian oil and gas company, for R70m (Pounds 11.1m). The acquisition is to be made by Duiker Exploration, Lonrho's 73 per cent controlled South African arm. The acquisition includes two operating collieries, and additional coal reserves yet to be developed. Lonrho expects the deal to double its coal export capability to about 3m tonnes a year, through its shareholding in Richards Bay Coal Terminal.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sime Darby profits up 12% at half-time Sime Darby, the Malaysian-based conglomerate which claims to be south-east Asia's biggest multinational, has announced pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 1993 of MDollars 420m (USDollars 150m), a 12 per cent rise on a year ago. Group turnover was up 18 per cent to MDollars 3.9bn. Sime Darby, once plantation based, is involved in a wide range of activities including motor vehicle assembly, the oil and gas industry, heavy equipment franchises, property and, most recently, the power sector. Sime's operations in Hong Kong, where it is the main automotive and heavy equipment distributor, contributed most to overall group profits through activities in Malaysia, particularly in the fast expanding infrastructure sector. Pre-tax profits on Hong Kong operations increased to MDollars 95m from MDollars 72m in the six-month period compared with the equivalent period in the previous year. Pre-tax profits on Malaysian operations went up to MDollars 94m from MDollars 79m. Pre-tax profits were generally unchanged across most other divisions of the company although there was a steep fall in profits in the plantations sector.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Gowrings incurs Pounds 953,000 deficit Gowrings, which runs motor dealerships, park homes and restaurants, finished 1991 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 953,000, including exceptional charges of Pounds 342,000. That compared with a deficit of Pounds 432,000 in 1990, which took in exceptional credits of Pounds 80,000. Mr John Fowles, chairman, said the second half trading loss fell to Pounds 230,000, against Pounds 381,000 in the opening period. The final dividend is held at 1p, although that still leaves a cut in the year's total, from 3.25p to 2p. Losses per share were 10.6p (4.5p). Benefiting from reorganisation, the motor side made a trading profit of Pounds 314,000, against a loss of Pounds 191,000 which included Pounds 156,000 attributable to the sold Fleetlease. The leisure division incurred a trading loss of Pounds 236,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 160,000.</p>

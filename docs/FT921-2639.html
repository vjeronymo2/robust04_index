			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92 (Ballot Box): Missing link The inhabitants of Worcester Park have good reason to feel miffed at tonight's Conservative party political broadcast. 'John Major. The Journey,' concentrates on the prime minister's path from obscurity to 10 Downing Street. Though it lingers at length on the prime minister's Brixton boyhood, there is no mention of leafy and well-heeled Worcester Park where young John also spent many a formative year. Could it be that that cosy interlude just failed to square with the story-line?</p>

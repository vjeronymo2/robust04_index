			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Leading Article: US struggle for the centre IT HAS been a strange election year in the US and only a fool would rule out further twists and turns of fate. But the current probable outcome is that the battle for the the White House will be fought between President George Bush for the Republicans and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas for the Democrats. This promises to be a classic struggle for the centre and one which should offer at least a reasonable choice. Mr Clinton proclaims now, as he has in the past, that he is an architect of change. He comes armed with a pocketful of programmes and an inclination for intervention. He does not consider industrial policy a dirty word, but he is no visceral protectionist. He senses that the issues most concerning his country - health, education, welfare, crime, drugs, investment, taxes - are those that can and should be addressed by an activist government. Still, Mr Clinton does not seem to be a classic free-spending Democrat, even though the Republicans will try and paint him as such. Mr Bush won the presidency on the Reagan legacy and, after some departure from it, now says he is back on course. This means less government, less regulation, lower spending and lower taxes. It does not exclude programmes to meet specific needs, but it is more inclined to let the market, and the individual, decide. Mr Bush is basically happy with the status quo. Uneven recession Mr Clinton must argue, as the challenger, that there is something fundamentally wrong with the US economy. Mr Bush, as the incumbent, must hope it will come right in time of its own accord, with more than a little help from the Federal Reserve. The latest numbers suggest it might, though whether to the point that it becomes his decisive ace-in-the-hole is questionable. This recession has not only been long but its severity has been unevenly distributed. Confidence in recovery may be equally spotty and hurt the president in states he needs to carry - California, for example. Mr Bush brings to the fight a foreign policy record Mr Clinton has had no opportunity to match, and the issue of experience in external affairs must be an asset. But it far from clear that it ranks high on the list of public concerns at present, nor is it an impregnable asset. There is an impression that this administration has somewhat lost its way since the Gulf war: it is bogged down in the Middle East, and aggravating Israel profoundly, which might cost at the polls; it is short of ideas on how best to aid the former Soviet Union and unable to achieve a break through in Gatt or, probably, bring to signature this year the North American Free Trade Area. Still, holding the foreign policy cards usually works to a president's advantage. Clinton's character Neither man enjoys the confidence of their party's activists, which is probably to their credit, since neither the Democratic left nor the Republican right have much more than slogans to offer now. But the country is patently disenchanted with politics-as-usual and both are more than usually political. The Democratic Party's reconciliation with Mr Clinton is at this stage much less than the Republicans with Mr Bush. There is a lot of professional admiration for Mr Clinton's handling of the many allegations laid against him, but his character, in the broadest sense, is an issue in ways in which, rightly or wrongly, Mr Bush's is probably not. If he seriously stumbles, his party would run a mile. Mr Clinton, however, has advantages over and beyond being from the south, currently a Republican stronghold, and not living in Washington. He is much younger than Mr Bush, who shows his age sometimes, and probably more articulate. This would be useful in any debate betwen the two, but not necessarily predictably, as the Reagan-Carter confrontation proved. It would be good if the battle between them could be joined soon, even though the election is still more than seven months away. This would be preferable to the current unedifying partisan battle between Mr Bush and the Democrats in Congress, from which the country emerges no wiser and no more assured that the policies that will guide it are rooted in sense.</p>

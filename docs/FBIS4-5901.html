			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party (DLP) has decided to study various ways to help  resettle North Koreans fleeing from Siberian logging camps, Rep.  Paek Nam-chi, the party's policy coordinator, said Friday.    The party plans to meet with the government to discuss  creating a special public fund, considering the enormous cost of  providing the North Koreans with vocational training and housing.    Some 170 escapees, out of an estimated 25,000 loggers at  Pyongyang-run camps in Siberia whose human rights are allegedly  violated on a routine basis, are said to be seeking asylum in  the South.    Seoul pledged on Wednesday to help them resettle either in  the South or in a third country in accordance with international  law.    Paek said, "helping the North Koreans resettle here is  better  for them than only giving them financial support. And as it is  difficult for the government alone to deal with their  resettlement, the government needs to induce businesses or other  private organizations to provide support."    The most important thing, he added, is to avoid a split in  national opinion on supporting the North Korean loggers from a  humanitarian point of view.    "As both the ruling and opposition parties empathize with  each other on the issue, we are willing to study jointly with  the opposition party some National Assembly measures if  necessary."    Paek said that the government needs to work out policies on  a  long-term basis to handle those who have escaped or will escape  from North Korea.    "We will collect detailed data about the West German policy  toward East Germans who escaped from East Germany and study  devising legal and institutional measures," he said.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: Other Markets TOKYO Technical selling is feared in equities after the downward break through 18,000 in the Nikkei-225 on Friday. Dealer support is expected to be limited by the Labour Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow, and ahead of interim earnings from the banking sector on Thursday and Friday. FRANKFURT Autumn press conferences approach a nervous market from BASF on Monday, and Bayer on Thursday. Twelve days ago the third of the 'Big Three' German chemical companies, Hoechst, saw profits down 40 per cent after nine months and a worse performance in the September quarter. Wednesday and Thursday bring conferences at Metallgesellschaft and Commerzbank, with hopes of a dividend rise at the latter. PARIS After rising French consumer expenditure in September, and in the third quarter of 1993, James Capel expects a decline of 0.3 per cent in October as an increase in social security contributions depresses disposable income. ZURICH November CPI figures for Basle and Geneva are due this week. Smith New Court expect falling Swiss rents will help to depress the indices to around 2.5 per cent from the 3.4 per cent recorded in October, providing further evidence of the improvement in the domestic economy. A raft of press conferences include ABB and Merck on Tuesday; Nestle is expected to give sales forecasts, and Alussuise nine-month sales figures, at their autumn news conferences on Wednesday. STOCKHOLM Nine-month results from the ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Swedish/Swiss engineering combine are expected in Sweden and in Switzerland. Analysts expect ABB to report a slightly lower profit for the period, while forecasts for the full year remain reasonably positive, particularly in light of the economic situation prevailing in Europe.</p>

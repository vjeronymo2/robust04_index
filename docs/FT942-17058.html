			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Delay threatens pensions' growth Millions of holders of personal pensions may be losing up to seven months' growth for their savings each year because of delays in transferring their National Insurance contributions to their personal pensions. The possibility of delays was confirmed in a letter from Mr William Hague, the pensions minister, to Mr John Denham, Labour MP for Southampton Itchen. The time-lag arises because the payments from the Department of Social Security can be made only after an employer has submitted the end-of-year PAYE tax return. The return is needed so that the minimum contribution to be made to the personal pension can be calculated. Mr Denham called on the government to look at where the delays were occurring. If it was in the late submission of tax returns, then more pressure should be brought on employers to deal with them promptly. He said: 'The exact figure for each person will obviously depend on the performance of their own pension fund but, year in, year out, seven months' worth of growth lost could make a huge difference to the pension that is paid out.' No information is collected centrally on the normal length of delays or the sums which might be foregone in pension growth. However, some Pounds 3.5bn in contracted-out pension contributions was paid into private pensions for 4m people in 1991-92, the last year for which figures are available. Mr Hague's letter said payments were normally made between May and October following the end of the tax year. The Contributions Agency, an executive arm of the DSS, said the longest period for processing payments would normally be no more than six weeks after it had received the tax return.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Bangemann set for new term Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, will have his term as one of Germany's two European commissioners extended next year, the liberal Free Democratic Party said yesterday. FDP general secretary Werner Hoyer said Chancellor Helmut Kohl had agreed to renew Mr Bangemann's appointment in talks on Friday with foreign minister and FDP leader Klaus Kinkel. The renewal of his appointment would depend on Mr Kohl's 12-year-old centre-right coalition retaining power in elections on October 16. There had been speculation in Bonn that Mr Bangemann and his colleague Mr Peter Schmidhuber, a member of the Christian Social Union, would be replaced when their current term expires. Political and diplomatic sources said last month that Mr Kohl, the Christian Democrat leader, and Social Democratic (SPD) opposition leader Rudolf Scharping had agreed that members of their two parties should take up the commission posts. The main candidates were said to be Mrs Birgit Breuel, president of the Treuhand privatisation agency, for the CDU, and deputy SPD leader Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 40% advance at Ex-Lands Ex-Lands, the property investment trading company run by brothers Robert and Graham Bourne, reported a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 914,000 to Pounds 1.27m for the year to June 30. The company raised Pounds 36m during the year by issuing new shares and convertible loan stock, most of which was spent on industrial and office trading properties. As a result, net assets increased from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 31.9m. Net assets per share rose by 23 per cent to 28.7p, or 31.1p on a fully diluted basis allowing for conversion of the outstanding loan stock. Turnover grew from Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 5.16m, reflecting acquisitions and the consolidation of Clubhaus, a German leisure company formerly held as a joint venture with Mr Mark McCormack's International Management Group. Ex-Lands spent Pounds 41m on acquisitions during the year, about half of which was bought from banks which had been left holding property as a result of bad debts. Mr Robert Bourne, joint chief executive, said that such deals allowed the company to acquire properties which could be improved by intensive management and some investment. Most of the property is being held as trading assets for re-sale in the near term. Discounting the convertible loan stock, which matures in 2020, gearing is 23 per cent. Earnings amounted to 0.98p (1.06p) and a dividend of 0.42p (0.35p) is recommended.</p>

At a Tuesday news conference in Moscow he stressed  that the visit did not worsen relations between his country and  Russia.    Commenting on the negative response of the Abkhaz leader  Vladislav Ardzinba to the plans of sending a peacekeeping force  to Abkhazia, Advadze said that Russia, the U.S. and the UN "have  the power to bridle aggressive separatism." According to the  ambassador, Ardzinba was guided by separatism when he launched  the war, even though he spoke of Abkhazia's willingness to join  Russia. The diplomat added that Ardzinba "will not agree to any  treaties or compromises, he will not be content with any  federation or confederation, he wants only full independence."    The ambassador stressed that the United States and the UN  Security Council like Russia before them have supported Georgia  in matters of territorial integrity.</p>

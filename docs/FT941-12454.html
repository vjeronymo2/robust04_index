			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Travel: The Anglo barbarians are at the gates - The advantages of a Fortress Tuscany policy SOMEWHERE in Provence. What a secretive, timorous dateline that is. But frankly, a little secretiveness these days is not amiss for, since Peter Mayle popularised this part of the world, I have been receiving barely veiled threats of bodily harm. None of my expatriate neighbours here wants to read another word about Provence. They are fed up with travel pieces about the Luberon hills, ruined stone farmhouses, goat cheese and olive oil, peasants with gold teeth and berets, picnics in lavender fields, etc. They complain that A Year in Provence is superficial and over-romantic. The real source of their irritation, I suspect, is that Mayle has wounded their self-esteem: thanks to the book's popularity, British expatriates in Provence have now become social and literary cliches in their own right. Worse, in bringing down thousands of curious visitors from Birmingham, Watford and Ipswich (some of whom - horrors - may buy a house), Mayle has turned the British expat, once a rare creature, into a common or garden variety just one step above the British summertime hoi-polloi. At any rate, it has been hinted that I move on and write about somewhere else. There is only one other place I can think of that has the same sunny and sensuous Mediterranean beauty, the same hardy peasant culture, the same farmhouse-and-goat-cheese appeal to refugee Britons with disposable incomes. What is more, no one has yet written A Year in Tuscany. Florence. Good Heavens. And I thought the Luberon hills crowded in summer. Here the tourist season goes on all year and there is barely room to swing a guidebook. It took me an hour-and-a-half of tramping around the city last night just to find a hotel with a room free. At dinner I was squeezed on to a shared table opposite a large party of Florentines. How vain and self-absorbed they were in their designer glasses, their jackets thrown around their shoulders. They pranced and preened and pouted and tossed their perfect locks, and that was just the men. I had thought the French went to great lengths to appear sophisticated. The Italians make them look like potato diggers. But is this really a city of culture? There is something unhealthy about the relationship between the purveyors of historical culture and its consumers. Many fine and noble things remain, no doubt, from one of civilisation's great ages. But I question their mass-marketing for the delectation of modern barbarian hordes. I am not comfortable in places where large numbers of individuals tour the streets with video lenses screwed permanently into their eye sockets. My enthusiasm for art wavers when its prerequisite is a two-hour queue outside the Uffizi. Great masterpieces are a dime a dozen in this city, but try finding a parking space. When it comes to culture in Florence, I am afraid I must be counted a philistine. The Crete. I am not the first person to have discovered the glories of rural Tuscany, but I feel like it. Suddenly I understand why Tuscany is such a serious rival to Provence for British affections. The Crete, the pale, undulating, chalk hill-country that begins south of Siena, is the most sensuous I have ever passed through. This is a landscape which, particularly after the summer harvest, is like bare human skin. It is smooth and rounded and dipping. The feeling of nakedness is enhanced by the huge, empty sky. The Crete is also dramatic, its elements of landscape so frugally allocated on this great and nearly empty sweep of land that the whole is reduced to the elemental. Here, a single line of dark cypresses dominates the crest of a barren hill. There, a solid, four-square farmhouse of soft ochre colour stands silhouetted against a dark sky. This is an idealised landscape, so striking that it feels more like an archetypal model than a real and every-day thing. Montalcino. There is something of the model, too, about Montalcino. It is the quintessential Tuscan hill town, a collection of sturdy 16th century stone houses, piazzas, flagged streets, churches and a medieval castle all held within thick walls on the summit of a narrow ridge. The views of the Crete from almost anywhere in the town are superb. Once the poorest town in the region, it is now one of the richest, thanks to the Brunello vineyards that surround it. I took a room in one of the town's two hotels. It was surprisingly difficult to find accommodation in even the most frequently visited Tuscan towns. Unlike Provence, Tuscany is not geared up for large numbers of tourists. And unlike Provencal villages, which can become ghost towns when people close up holiday homes and move back to London, Paris or Geneva, Tuscan villages seem to remain active, working places. Schoolchildren, bakers, grannies and other real-life characters can still be found there. Montalcino was my base for forays to other hill towns. My favourites? One was Pienza, conceived as a utopian 'new town' and planned down to the last detail. It does not bear much resemblance to Milton Keynes or other British new towns, though; built by Pope Pius II in the 1450s, it is so medievally pretty that it was used for the filming of Romeo and Juliet. The other is Montepulciano, a scale-model renaissance city, an elegant, palazzi-strewn mini-Florence built in the hills. In Provence, hill towns were built by peasants and local war-lords; in Tuscany, popes, kings and renaissance architects had other ways of building. Just as pleasurable, though, was a visit to the Montalcino barbershop. Awaiting my turn to climb into one of its old-fashioned swivel chairs, I could not decide which was more interesting: watching the flow of evening strollers on the Via Matteotti outside, or looking at the photos in Oggi magazine. In peering into private lives, the Italian paparazzi, I would say, still have the edge over the British tabloids - just. Sant'Antimo. Enough Oggi. I am feeling clean and uplifted. This Sunday morning I visited a Cistercian abbey. Not only did I stroll the olive groves and cypress lanes that surround this austere and lovely Romanesque building, I attended a mass. The sun slanted in through tall arched windows, aromatic smoke from the censor billowed, and from the throats of four white-robed monks came the heavenly hymns and harmonies of Gregorian chant. I think I could take to the monastic life. But good clean living builds an appetite. After mass I zipped over to the walled village of Sant'Angelo in Colle, locally reknowned for its restaurant, Il Pozzo. What should I discover inside, though, but the dining room taken over by a coach-load of cheery Cheshiremen collectively known as the Winnington Wine Club, on their 13th annual outing to a far-flung, winey destination. And how did they find the local plonk? Jolly good vino, they said. I sloped off to find lunch elsewhere. Somewhere in Tuscany. There is no getting around it: the coach-loads in Tuscany very much resemble the coach-loads in Provence. The Mediterranean world is firmly on the tourist map and there are very few parts of it left undiscovered. The great miracle is that Tuscany, like Provence, has managed to retain its character. The Winnington Wine Club, bless their souls, can do their worst. Nonetheless, the local expat community can get rather shirty about intrusions on to their territory. When you pay a fortune for a ruined farmhouse you expect exclusiveness. If I have resorted to a cowardly and imprecise dateline, once again, it is because I have received threats, once again. Yesterday, I visited an English family who, in real life, have rather responsible jobs in London. Their retreat is in the least developed portion of Tuscany, the green, forested hills that lie between the Crete and the Tuscan coast. Here in an isolated 16th century hill-top fortress they live like medieval nobility ready for a siege. 'You're not going to Peter Mayle us]' said the mother in dismay, distracted from overseeing the family olive grove, wheatfield and sheep herd. 'People should know that there is malaria here,' said the daughter, taking a moment off from hand-pressing the grape harvest. 'And wolves,' growled the father, gazing beadily out over the battlements. 'Wolves that eat tourists.' If they were exaggerating slightly, I do not know that I can blame them. Summer visitors are one thing. But what is the point of having a Tuscan fortress if all London buys Tuscan fortresses? Already, Chiantishire to the north has fallen to Anglo barbarians. Florence crumbled long ago. Far to the west, the Luberon is besieged. The more remote parts of Tuscany and Provence are holding out, but for how long? The situation is grave, the future threatening. But I think I may have learned a thing or two in Tuscany. If anyone knows of a walled Provencal fortress for sale, would they please get in touch? Both Tuscany and Provence are less crowded in spring and autumn, when good weather can make them a delight. Many small companies specialise in home rentals and self-catering in both areas. A list of some of the better ones can be had from the Association of Independent Tour Operators, 133a St Margaret's Road, Twickenham, Middlesex, TW1 1RG. Tel: 081-744-9280.

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / French conservatives increase majority FRANCE'S conservative opposition increased its majority in Sunday's by-election for the National Assembly seat of Lille-Ouest in the Nord region, writes Ian Davidson in Paris. The National Front candidate also substantially increased his support, further confirming the growing strength of the extreme right-wing party. Mr Marc-Philippe Daubresse, centrist (CDS) mayor of Lambersart, romped home with nearly 78 per cent of the vote in the second round of voting, compared with nearly 47 per cent in the first round. Mr Nicolas Crochet, the National Front candidate who had driven the Socialist party candidate into third place in the first round a week earlier, raised his share of the vote in Sunday's run-off from 15.7 per cent to 22.1 per cent. In some cantons he captured as much as 35 per cent of the vote.</p>

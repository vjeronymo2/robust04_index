			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- Opening the debates  of the Crans Montana Forum conference's second plenary session  on "Economic Perspectives for the Middle East in the Aftermath  of the Israeli-PLO Peace Accord," PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat said  that from its side, the PLO "has always viewed the declaration  of principles signed at the White House as the first step in the  peace process which started in Madrid in 1991, in order to open  a new chapter in the Middle East based on peaceful coexistence,  relations of good neighborliness, cooperation, solving problems  by peaceful means, dialogue, and arbitration."    "To arrive at this stage," said the PLO leader, "we have and  still are conducting arduous, long, and difficult negotiations  with the Government of Israel in many places, in Washington,  Oslo, Paris, Davos, and Cairo."    "Today, we are meeting at this forum in Bucharest, the  capital of Romania, which was among the first countries that  have worked forcefully and that made constructive proposals and  creative initiatives to realize just peace in the Middle East  region and to find a negotiated settlement and just peace to the  cause of Palestine," said Yasir 'Arafat.    The PLO leader added that since his arrival in Bucharest he  had concluded important and constructive negotiations with  President Ion Iliescu, negotiations which dealt among other  things with fostering the peace process, its success and the  implementation of the agreements signed between the PLO and the  government of Israel.    PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat concluded his speech with an  appeal:  "I call for the carrying out of the requirements of this  agreement and its articles on all the Palestinian, Arab, and  Israeli bilateral and multilateral tracks. Any delay in  implementing this agreement will gravely endanger the peace  process and will open the way in front of the extremists, no  matter what their identity is or their beliefs are, to destroy  the peace process, and to be the reason behind causing the fall  of more innocent victims on both the Palestinian and Israeli  sides."</p>

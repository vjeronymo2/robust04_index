			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ari'el Sharon: "Why Now?"] </F>   [Text] Irrational antagonism has been and is an emotion  shared by the two political blocs. I have observed it both here  and there. When it rages, falsification, distortions, and  deception occur. "Heavy guns" are either engaged, or give their  assistance freely; they range from absent-minded professors down  to self-anointed orientalists, from a journalist who shot his  own hand during the war to another who has written one thing and  its opposite several times over.    I do not propose to waste my time on any of these, nor on  some Knesset activists who have been vigorously demanding my  ousting from the Likud. For my part, I intend to leave them all  in and to cooperate with all of them. With each on the merit of  his talents and capabilities. Because what we need is unity.    I believe I represent the Likud stands in the political,  security, settlement, economic, and social spheres.    I owe them no explanation. I do owe one to the many  thousands of ordinary Likud members who wonder why I have  spoken up, and why now.    The security situation is deteriorating. The government  argues that this is the much-desired peace, but meanwhile, it is  sowing seeds of war. Jerusalem is turning into the Palestinian  state's capital before our very eyes, yet the government is  doing nothing to prevent it. The danger is right here. And the  Likud is paralyzed. It is 1994, yet the Likud is still talking  about the 1977 autonomy.    This is what caused my rallying at this time to avert the  war  in which the government is liable to entangle us. I want to try  to unite the large national bloc, which must launch action at  once.    First of all, the political process must be halted, and  withdrawal should be stopped. No more withdrawal. Terrorism is  to be tackled seriously and eliminated before it causes war in  the heart of Israeli cities. We must regain full control of  Jerusalem and rid it of the incipient "Palestinian government  complex." We must enhance our hold over the entire city.    All national bloc factions must start formulating a  clear-cut  political plan at once .    "He is a schemer: He plotted against Begin and against  Shamir, and now he is plotting against me." [Netanyahu's  remarks about Sharon] No humility whatsoever. The comparison  to Mr. Begin, even to Mr. Shamir, is pretentious and ludicrous.    True, I often argued with Mr. Begin when I served on his  government. For instance, I totally disagreed with him on the  matter of autonomy, which will commence the establishment of a  second Palestinian state.    Conversely, I helped him make peace with Egypt, set up  settlements, make the difficult decision to bomb the nuclear  reactor in Baghdad, and wage a war on 'Arafat and the PLO in  Lebanon. Is that scheming?    I intensely disagreed with Mr. Shamir, who committed a  momentous, historical error in consenting to participate in the  Madrid conference without demanding, as precondition, that the  arms race be arrested, that terrorist organizations disbanded,  and the Palestinian refugees problem resolved in countries of  their current residence. I further disagreed with his  unwillingness to fight the intifadah with appropriate means,  with his inuring the nation to the existence of terror victims  as a matter of fact, and with his allowing the establishment of  the PLO's government residence in Orient House in Jerusalem. Is  that scheming?    Jewish history will not pardon his two blunders: his failure  to nip the intifadah in the bud and to prevent the establishment  of the Palestinian government's residence, both of which  occurred while he was prime minister, and both of which could  have been prevented. We may disagree with the prime minister,  and sometimes it is our duty to do so.    "Sharon was unable to obey authority in other  frameworks, too," Mr. Shamir added.    I would like to tell you about the other frameworks, of  which  Mr. Shamir is apparently oblivious.    In the 1950's, I insisted that successful retaliation  operations could be staged, and I carried them out. I was one  of the few generals who insisted, who were absolutely certain  that we would win the Six-Day War. And it came to pass, and I  shared in it, and I was successful.    In 1973, I insisted that the Suez Canal could be traversed,  that failure could be turned into victory, and I did it. I  insisted on driving 'Arafat and his terrorists out of Beirut,  and they were indeed driven out.    At one time, I insisted on establishing the Likud, and  despite the contempt and derision, I was successful, enabling a  new regime to rise to power for the first time in Israel's  history.    I insisted that 100,000 apartments could be built and that  tens of thousands of other apartments could be renovated in a  short period, in a bid to resolve the housing problems of  hundreds of thousands of immigrants and homeless Israeli  families, and I did build them.    "He is seeking rehabilitation," they said.    I am not the one who should seek rehabilitation. I never  needed it. Those who brought Palestinian terrorism into Israel  -- the same people who conducted a hideous, dangerous, unethical  political campaign during the Peace for Galilee war [Lebanon  war] -- they are the ones who need rehabilitation. And they  will never have it.    "It is undemocratic; a candidate has already been  elected," they argue.    The new leadership has been granted a whole year of grace,  not the customary 100 days. I would have been happy had they  been able to do their job. Unfortunately, this leadership has  been unable to unite the ranks and launch a genuine political  struggle against the government's foul-ups.    As will be remembered, Likud leaders correctly contended  only  weeks after the last elections that although it had been  democratically elected, this government should be replaced,  because it did not have a mandate to carry out the drastic  actions it was attempting. I would like to ask you: Am I to be  forbidden to demand of my party, the Likud, which I cofounded,  the same thing the Likud leadership rightfully demanded on a  national level, namely -- new elections?    "Sharon did not participate in votes on no-confidence  motions, the highest expression of anti government  struggle," the chairman further cried out.    I participated in some, in other instances my absence was  offset by the other side, and as for the thing in general, it  has long become a hopeless farce.    Only people who have never built a house, planted a  vineyard,  plowed a field, or paved a road can think that words are "the  highest expression" of anything. Action is the supreme  expression of anti government action, as is the bolstering of  Jewish settlement throughout Jerusalem, the Golan Heights,  Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, and the Jordan Rift Valley.    More families in settlements, new roads connecting  settlements, new kindergartens, the absorption of immigrants,  strengthening Israel's last defense line against withdrawal to  the 1948 borders. An indefatigable information campaign abroad  -- this is the main struggle, and this is what preoccupies me.    "His move will harm unity and the Likud's prospects of  returning to power," they add.    On the contrary, unity will grow. I have proposed  establishing a united national bloc, a "superbloc" while  maintaining the framework of existing parties. The joint  appearance will give the national bloc an enormous impetus and  bring it many new supporters. If open primaries are held by  members of the entire national bloc and its supporters, one  candidate acceptable to all will be elected.    "He brought on the downfall of the previous  government," they spin their yarn.    The responsibility for the Likud government's downfall lies  with the team that ran the elections, and those people are the  ones who are spreading false rumors today. They conducted an  bungling election campaign. They refused to display  achievements -- and there were many of those -- out of  "extraneous" internal considerations. Knowingly, they initiated  the split in the Likud camp already during the preliminary party  elections. They wanted an "attractive Likud," they sought "to  restore the Likud's old glory," and they are still pursuing  their quest today.    "In what way are you abler or better?" they ask.    The question is not whether I am better or abler, but rather  whether I am more experienced.    What matters today is not the personal fate of one candidate  or another, what matters is the fate of the country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Sakinform interview with Zurab Abashidze, ambassador to the </F> European Union and diplomatic representative to NATO: "European  Union's Interest Focuses on Georgia"; time and date not given]    [Text] It has been six months since Georgia opened  its embassy in Western Europe, in the European Union in  Belgium.    Sakinform's correspondent asked Zurab Abashidze, the  Georgian Republic's ambassador and diplomatic representative to  NATO, to answer some questions.    [Sakinform] Can you summarize the activity of your  mission--our first embassy in Western Europe--at year's end?    [Abashidze] Officially our activity in Brussels began last  June. The establishment of the embassy involved many technical  and orgaizational problems. We had to solve them quickly,  because Eduard Shevardnadze made an official visit to Brussels  on 21-22 June and met and talked with Belgian and NATO  officials. You can imagine the significance of preparing for  such a high-level visit in a time of complex political events.  Starting our activities on such a "high note" afforded many  opportunities. First, we saw to it that the problem of Georgia  (in particular, Abkhazia) was the topic of systematic discussion  in NATO. We managed to defend our position at meetings on  various levels and have it recorded in internationally important  documents, for example, the well-known Statement of the NATO and  North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the Europarliament's  November Resolution. Anyone who thinks these documents have no  force is wrong. Time will tell.    Our embassy has regularly supplied information and materials  on current events to the appropriate NATO bureaus, also the  Eurocommission, Europarliament, the European Council and  diplomatic corps. The press has published numerous reports based  on these materials.    [Sakinform] Could you say that these international bodies  now  have a more complete and objective understanding of Georgia?    [Abashidze] These organizations, especially NATO, have many  sources of information. Most important, Georgia's embassies in  Belgium and the U.S. enable us to get more activly involved in  day-to-day international events; this is an absolute necessity  for any modern state. Now it is up to us how seriously we are  represented in the international arena. If you are interested in  our foreign colleagues' opinion, it is a pretty good start.    Of the former Soviet republics, for your information,  Russia,  Ukraine, the Baltic countries, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Moldova  have opened diplomatic missions in Brussels.    [Sakinform] What can we expect in the future from our  relations with NATO?    [Abashidze] Our interest in NATO is understandable--and the  interest is mutual. The changes that have taken place in Central  and Eastern Europe in recent years have prompted serious changes  in NATO's military and political doctrine. During the Cold War  the main thesis was to ensure the West's collective security  against the Soviet threat; now the cornerstone is to get Eastern  and Western Europe, and especially Russia, involved in joint  political processes--with priority given to the West's strategic  interests, of course. At the same time, NATO is following events  in Russia closely and maintaining its own defense capabilities.  NATO's boldest move toward the East is thought to be the  creation of NACC, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council.  Besides NATO's 16 members it includes Eastern European and  former Soviet republics. At the initial stage, NACC was set up  as political consultative body that was designed to be more  "educational" than practical. Still, meetings on the foreign  ministerial level, ambassadors' and experts' conferences, and  numerous seminars and consultations were designed to reconcile  positions and foster cooperation in foreign policies and  defense. It has now become clear that the West, especially NATO,  sees much more promise in this council than it did a year ago.  Politicians and experts think that NACC could turn into a major  mechanism of Western-Eastern military and political integration.  There is already some talk of giving NACC the right to perform  certain operative functions, in particular peace-keeping  operations.    I don't think we have yet fully realized the importance of  Georgia's participation in NACC; it marks a first step toward  bringing us closer to Western defense structures. I think the  current year is very promising in this regard. A foreign  ministers' meeting approved the Council's working plan for 1994,  which, inter alia, calls for joint military exercises; this  would be especially valuable for our army, which is in the  formation stage. In May, our military specialists will begin to  train in NATO training centers. There is extensive discussion  now in the West (NATO in particular) concerning America's new  "Partnership for Peace" initiative, which calls for raising  NATO's relations with Central and Eastern Europe to a new level.  What that actually means will become known after the meeting of  officials of NATO's member states.    [Sakinform] Might NATO armed forces get involved in the  Caucasus, for example to restore stability in Georgia?    [Abashidze] Such a move could happen only under UN auspices  and would first require a joint decision of NATO's members.  Remember, that "aggressive bloc" has never been involved in  armed conflict. Even in the heart of Europe--former  Yugoslavia--UN forces are only involved in humanitarian aid.  NATO is especially cautious toward the former socialist  countries, believing that a hasty rapprochement could infuse  NATO's environment with the events and elements of conflict that  are characteristic of the East at this stage--spreading our  infections to NATO, so to speak. The opinion in the West is that  NATO's intervention in the affairs of the former socialist  countries would only strengthen anti-Western and revanchist  sentiments in Russia, which is still suspicious of that  organization. Consider, also, the experience of UN forces'  actions in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, which didn't exactly  produce positive results. So, judge for yourself.    [Sakinform] What practical steps were taken to broaden our  relations with the European Union in 1990 [as printed]?    [Abashidze] Let me start with the practical aid the Union  provided. In 1993 this association of Western Europe's 12  leading countries again allocated us 40 million ecus in  earmarked credit, which will soon be used to supply Georgia with  wheat, margarine, sugar, and medicine (our creditors aren't  going to hound us for this loan). We have been allocated  humanitarian aid (a gift) of six million ecus' worth of fuel oil  which will come to Georgia in January to relieve the energy  crisis. The Union has allocated an additional three million ecus  to help refugees from Abkhazia. An agreement on textile trade  has been signed to enable us to export our goods to the European  market without any restrictions whatever. An agreement of this  sort is viewed here as a bigger gift than the other millions  mentioned above.    A program called TAS has been completed that calls for the  European Union to give Georgia technical assistance in 1994. It  will involve the transfer of know-how and the drafting of  specific programs in priority spheres such as privatization,  agriculture, and specialist training. A high-level  Eurocommission delegation came to Tbilisi in mid-December to  coordinate the program.    Keep in mind that, however provisional it seems to us, the  West is going through its worst economic crisis since World War  II. Compared to the former Soviet republics, nevertheless,  Georgia has actually benefited from the European Union's special  concern in the past half year.    [Sakinform] You have talked mainly about Western aid. What  is  being done to turn it eventually into bilateral, mutually  beneficial cooperation?    [Abashidze] Trends in cooperation are taking shape. Work is  already underway on a vast project to create a modern  Europe-Caucasus-Asia transportation line. We are of course very  interested in having Georgia involved. At an international  conference in Brussels last May the first practical step was  taken to implement the project and protect our interests. Now  we're trying to have the next international meeting held in  Tbilisi. I don't want to get ahead of events, but if we achieve  our goal, our country will have new functions and importance in  the world.    Work will begin in May on a big agreement between Georgia  and  the European Union concerning partnership relations. This  political and economic agreement will be of historic importance  in terms of integrating and bringing our country closer to  European structures.    Western business circles are especially interested in  Georgia. I'm certain that after peace and political stability  are restored, which should happen in 1994, our country will  begin to rebuild.</p>

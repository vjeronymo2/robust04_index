			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (30): A new frontier is open for business / Review of publications that can help you through the maze - Eastern Europe IN THE past four years, more books have been written on doing business with Eastern Europe than there has been business. This may be about to change. Privatisation has given a jump-start to local capital markets, and increased the opportunities for foreign investment. Books on the region have begun to reflect this new atmosphere, although most still fall into the turgid tome or 'Let's Go To Moscow' variety. Here is a round-up of the new books on offer.                          *      *      * Despite the silly title, Richard Poe's How to Profit from the Coming Russian Boom (McGraw Hill, Dollars 24.95, 289 pages) is the perfect book for your next flight to Moscow. It captures the excitement of working in Russia these days (what Poe calls 'the honky-tonk air of a boomtown in the Klondike'), without minimising the danger and difficulty of embarking on a Russian commercial venture. The book is lively, fun to read, and a useful guide to doing business. The book is intended to help the would-be businessman manoeuvre around Russia. Poe, a journalist, proffers lots of practical, anecdotal advice on how westerners can make the most of the opportunities. The book provides information on key industries and regions of the CIS: location; production; imports and exports; true conditions (good and bad). Poe points out that Russians do not need 'everything', and he identifies the products and services that are in demand. The hyperbole can be irritating. 'Russia is putting on the auction block the largest store of undervalued stocks ever marketed in history.' 'Prices have hit rock bottom. They have nowhere to go but up.' Nonetheless, he explains the privatisation process in plain English. While his optimism may be premature, there is no doubt that the new commodity and stock exchanges trading in vouchers offer an unprecedented opportunity for western investors  -which this book is the first to mention. Europeans may find the book too American and a tad flippant, but it is worth Dollars 25 (Pounds 16). Published in July 1993, it should be up-to-date for another year, by which time, no doubt, the enterprising Mr Poe will have graced us with a second edition.                          *      *      * At the other end of the spectrum - dated and of limited practical value - the CBI Initiative Eastern Europe has published Doing Business in Russia (Kogan Page, Pounds 25, 284 pages). Written by a hodgepodge of contributors (ALM Consulting, Frere Cholmeley Bischoff, KPMG Peat Marwick, British Gas, et al) the book attempts to lay out the current legal and economic framework for British business entering the Russian market. Written from a theoretical rather than a practical perspective, the book covers topics such as foreign exchange, privatisation, property, and distributor networks. The best sections are the chapter on banking (written by Moscow Narodny Bank), which provides useful names and addresses of banks throughout the region, and the chapter on dispute resolution, which clarifies the procedures in this complex area. The main problem is that the book is based on laws and information prior to January 1993. A lot has changed since then, points out Mr Gilberto Sanchez, an economic adviser to the Russian Ministry of Privatisation. Most notably, 4000 medium and large enterprises have been privatised so far this year, versus none last year. Nor does the book explain the opaque system for getting hold of real estate, which is a critical hurdle for British retailers wishing to set up in Moscow. The sections on export licenses and exchange rates are completely out-of-date.                          *      *      * The Baltic States present a different challenge from Russia, and Richard Abbott's Doing Business in the Baltic States (Kogan Page, Pounds 30 254 pages) is a reasonable starting point for those considering an investment. Abbott is a consultant specialising in the Baltics; his book contains lots of bread-and-butter information buried in a style that is rather dull. Abbott makes a good case for investing in the Baltics - why, he wonders, is there so much enthusiasm for doing business in Hungary and the Czech Republic while the Baltics get lumped with Moldova and Kyrgyzstan? After all, the Baltics have an excellent geographical position, 8m westernised citizens, democracy, and a large trading and manufacturing base which needs foreign investment. The book is divided into three parts: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. For each state, Abbott reviews recent history, the economic base, infrastructure, foreign investment laws, and basic information on the local market. Although it is based on pre-February 1993 information, this is less of a drawback than it is for the Doing Business in Russia because there are so many fewer sources of information about the Baltics.                          *      *      * For more academic reading, the prolific Roman Frydman, Andrzej Rapaczynski, and John Earle have produced two more volumes in their 1993 series - The Privatisation Process in Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic States (Oxford University Press, Pounds 30/Pounds 10, 290 pages) and The Privatization Process in Central Europe (Oxford University Press, Pounds 30/Pounds 10, 276 pages) which explains privatisation in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The authors are distinguished professors, and these are serious books for serious students of the privatisation process. Rapaczynski is a close friend of Andre Schleifer, the Harvard University professor who is virtually directing privatisation in Russia. These books will find a place on the reading lists for courses on modern Russian political economy, not on airport bookshelves. The Central European volume is better, primarily because it was written after much of the privatisation effort was well under way, particularly in Poland and Hungary. This makes it possible for the authors to comment on the programmes more fully. The Russia book, just published, provides one of the first academic critiques of the privatisation scheme. Ukrainian privatisation is still in its infancy, however, so there is not much to say. While it is interesting to contrast the techniques used in Russia and the other countries, what we really need is another book - preferably in about two years - analysing the success of the different approaches to privatisation.                          *      *      * Finally, from Ljubljana, in Slovenia, an academic team have produced Foreign Investment in Central and Eastern Europe (edited by Patrick Artisien, Matija Rojec and Marjan Svetlicic, Macmillan, Pounds 40, 206 pages), a study of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region to date. The authors and contributors analyse the extent to which each country has attracted FDI and is likely to do so in future. Conclusion: large western companies have committed very little, in real terms, in spite of all the noise and signing of joint ventures. This brings us back to the first book in this review. Richard Poe sees the lack of western investment as a huge opportunity for the entrepreneur - a once-in-a-century chance to compete with the cautious multinationals and profit from the coming Russian boom.

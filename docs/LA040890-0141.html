			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ORANGEWOOD  </P> <P> We foster parents who take children into our homes directly from Orangewood  Children's Home want to take this opportunity to reply to the March 31 Times  article listing allegations against Orangewood.  </P> <P> In comparing Orangewood and foster care as it is run by our county's Social  Services, we feel that they rank with the very best programs and facilities  nationwide.  </P> <P> Orangewood Children's Home has served as a model for development of other  children's centers throughout the state and has been honored by the President.  </P> <P> We have seen Social Services' response to public concerns about the care of our  county's children and that they constantly try to make the changes to improve  conditions.  </P> <P> We also live in reality, however, and understand that in a large bureaucracy  such as Orange County Social Services, there are bound to be occasional  injustices. The measure of the problem is what response and corrective action  is taken.  </P> <P> We support the system and feel confident that Social Services is working hard  to meet the needs of individual children.  </P> <P> RUTH HANNING  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P> <P>  This letter was also signed by 16 other foster parents.  </P> <P> </P></p>

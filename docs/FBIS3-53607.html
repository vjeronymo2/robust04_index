Pointing to the main topic of the meeting which will be  Iran's foreign debts, the daily 'TEHRAN TIMES' said it can be  foreseen that Clinton's representatives will be using irrelevant  issues such as human rights violation, Iran's stance on  'Arafat-Rabin accord and Iran's so-called arms purchases to  distract the attention of the Europeans from America's real  economic objective.    "The truth of the matter is that in the present economic  conditions dominated by a general recession in the U.S. the most  urgent objective for the U.S. companies and trusts is to capture  the large Iranian market or to have access at least to certain  sections of that market", the daily noted.    Therefore, noted the daily, the real objective of the  American pressure on the European countries in the Paris meeting  is to make them exert pressure in turn on Iran for the purpose  of opening up opportunities for the American companies.    Referring to a recent telephon conversation of President  Rafsanjani and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the daily said the  chancellor had clearly promised that differences over the  repayment of loans between the Iranian and German companies  would soon be resolved.    "It is quite surprising to find out that the German central  government is acting contrary to the promises of its chancellor  and the interests of its companies", the paper concluded.</p>

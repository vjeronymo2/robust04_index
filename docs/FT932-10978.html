			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Government's school tests hit by second resignation GOVERNMENT plans for school tests for 14-year-olds suffered another setback yesterday when a second adviser resigned from the council drawing up the tests. Dr John Marenbon decided to leave the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council after a disagreement over assessing schoolchildren's understanding of English. His departure follows the resignation of Lord Skidelsky on Tuesday in protest at the government's handling of its review of the national curriculum. In his resignation letter, Dr Marenbon, who chaired the council's English committee, described the tests, which two teachers' unions are boycotting, as 'inadequate and unfair'. He said: 'I have made repeated requests that this paper be postponed and carefully rewritten.' Dr Marenbon is fellow of English at Trinity College, Cambridge, and a leading supporter of the national curriculum's proposed new emphasis on traditional 'classic' works. He described the timetable for the tests as 'impossible', and told Mr Patten that many of his advisers were 'too keen to tell you what they believe you want to hear'. Mr Patten said he was 'extremely surprised and sorry' to receive Dr Marenbon's resignation. However, he said the tests should go ahead as it would be the last chance for 14-year-olds to be assessed before sitting their GCSE examinations. The SEAC also reacted with anger, saying it had not disregarded Dr Marenbon's advice. It said the tests had been drawn up to Mr Patten's specification and that 'leading Shakespearean scholars' had been consulted. It said: 'Dr Marenbon's views on these tests, though valuable, have to be set against those of other experts.' Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, which is boycotting the tests, said: 'The whole exercise is in complete disarray.' Ms Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said: 'This second resignation in two days shows how isolated the secretary of state has become. Now we learn that he does not even listen to his own hand-picked advisers.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolaos Meletis] </F>   [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin expressed  pessimism for the future of Greek-Turkish relations with the new  Greek Government and referred to Greece's hostility toward  Turkey, which could lead Athens to irreparable mistakes since,  he said, the imaginary Turkish threat has become an obsession.  Cetin also said that during the meetings he will have on 20  January with the British and German foreign ministers, he will  ask for the release of European Union funds to Turkey, something  that Greece has blocked in the past few years. Referring to the  Cyprus issue, Cetin stressed that it is up to Greece to support  and encourage the timetable for the negotiations.    Replying to Cetin's remarks, Greek Government spokesman  Evangelos Venizelos stressed that the invasion of Cyprus by  Turkish forces and the continuing occupation of 40 percent of  the island's territory, the virtual disappearance of the Greek  minority from Istanbul and the promotion of Turkish demands  against Greece are neither imaginary nor a fantasy. They  constitute historical experience, he said. The government  spokesman concluded by saying that the Turkish leadership should  realize that contact with Europe depends on respect for  international law, human rights and the principles of the state  of justice, which are basic elements of European civilization.</p>

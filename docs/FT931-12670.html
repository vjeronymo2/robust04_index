			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Greenspan sees 'hopeful signs of solid growth' in US economy MR ALAN GREENSPAN, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday said the pace of US economic growth was becoming firmer, and signalled that he would co-operate with the Clinton administration in promoting a sustainable recovery. The Fed saw more hopeful signs of a solid recovery and would 'continue playing a constructive role' in supporting growth, he said under questioning from congressional Democrats. However, while appearing to rule out any tightening of monetary policy in the foreseeable future, he gave no indication that the Fed would cut interest rates further in response to a White House deficit reduction plan. President Bill Clinton said yesterday he was unsure whether he could meet his goal of cutting the deficit by Dollars 145bn (Pounds 95bn) within four years without having to raise taxes. He would lay out an economic plan in his State of the Union address on February 17. Mr Greenspan said activity had been increasing at a 'firmer pace of late'. The head winds that had retarded growth had slackened somewhat, but 'this is not to say that we have clear sailing ahead'. Households and businesses were still 'struggling to redress structural imbalances unparalleled in the postwar period' and slow growth abroad was acting as a drag on exports and output. Job growth had been abnormally slow because of structural changes in the US economy, including a 'dramatic improvement in productivity' since early 1991. Much of this reflected efficiency gains following heavy investment in new computer technology. While this augured well for long-run growth and international competitiveness, it implied 'continuing adjustments in the workforce'. Mr Greenspan was testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, his first appearance on Capitol Hill since Mr Clinton's election victory. Democrats on the committee criticised him for cutting interest rates too slowly and demanded that he support fully White House and congressional efforts to revive the economy. Mr Greenspan said co-operation was 'accelerating' between the Fed and the administration. The traditional weekly breakfast meeting between the Fed chairman and the Treasury secretary had been reinstated after a lapse during the Bush years. Mr George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, confirmed that the Fed and the White House were trying to co-operate more fully. He said Mr Clinton and Mr Greenspan 'share the same goals', which included a recognition of the need for more jobs. Mr Greenspan expressed support for tough and credible action to reduce the budget deficit. There was no risk of the economy being weakened by too ambitious a package of cuts. If long-term interest rates were to fall, specific actions affecting spending and revenue totals had to be agreed. However, Mr Greenspan refused to promise lower interest rates in response to a tightening of fiscal policy. He said low inflation was a 'precondition' for sustainable growth. The US had to avoid the 'stop-go' cycles of the past. Bonds Page 30 US stocks Page 41</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the above comments we are adding a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that State survey agencies consider all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints of resident neglect or abuse, or misappropriation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of resident property as a potential reflection on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's compliance with Medicaid and/or Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation requirements. This new requirement is at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.335(h). (The provisions in &sect;488.185 (g) and (h) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule are revised and combined in &sect;488.335(g)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are discussed later in this preamble.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that the words, ``by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an individual used by the facility'' be added to paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) of this section as it requires the State to review all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegations of neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident property. Commenters pointed out that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested text is found in the Act and the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are revising and expanding &sect;488.335(a),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and in doing so, incorporating the comment. This paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now specifies that the State reviews all allegations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident abuse and neglect and misappropriation of resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property. The State also follows the procedures of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.332. We are adding that, if there is reason to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe, either through oral or written evidence, that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual used by the facility to provide services to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents could have abused or neglected a resident or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misappropriated a resident's property, the State must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigate the allegation. We also now specify in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section that the State must have written procedures for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely review and investigation of these allegations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters mentioned that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules do not specify a timeframe for initiation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation nor a time limit on the length of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation of neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Our intent in writing this rule was to not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> too prescriptive of State investigation processes. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manual instructions to State survey agencies specify a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timeframe for situations of immediate jeopardy in which they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should initiate complaint investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We chose not to regulate the time in which a State must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete its investigation of these types of complaints. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thought a specific time limit could, in some instances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compromise the outcome of the investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify a timeframe in which the State must notify an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual when there is reason to believe that the abuse,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neglect, or misappropriation of resident property did occur. Also, some suggested that we notify the administrator or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner of the facility employing such person, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, some commenters suggested that we include in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice to the accused person the consequences of the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination or waiving the right to a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not accept the comment to send a notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the individual implicated in an allegation of resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neglect or abuse or misappropriation of resident property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the State has conducted an investigation. To do so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could possibly jeopardize the outcome of the investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and in some cases would be premature as the investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might find the allegation unsupported. However, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revising the final rule at &sect;488.335(c) to require that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State must notify the individual implicated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegation and the current administrator of the facility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the incident occurred, in writing within 10 working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days of its preliminary determination, which is based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oral or written evidence and its investigation, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident neglect or abuse, or misappropriation of resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property occurred. This timeframe was selected to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely notice to the individual involved and yet, give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States sufficient time to provide such notice. We are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revising the final rule to reflect that this notice to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual includes the consequences of a hearing finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and of waiving the right to a hearing. We are adding that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notice includes a statement to inform the accused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual of the right to be represented by an attorney at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the individual's own expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We received several comments suggesting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we establish, by regulation, a more extensive ``due process''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal mechanism for facility employees accused of neglect,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse, or misappropriation of a resident's property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

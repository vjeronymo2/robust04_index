			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Invesco in settlement talks with Mirror INVESCO MIM, the UK-based fund management company, said yesterday it was in talks aimed at reaching an out-of-court settlement with trustees of the Mirror Group Pension Scheme who are seeking more than Pounds 11m on behalf of pensioners, Norma Cohen writes. Mr Charles Brady, Invesco's chairman, told its annual meeting that talks were being held through Sir John Cuckney, appointed to head the government's voluntary trust fund to aid the Maxwell pensioners. The scheme has filed writs against Invesco MIM, Lehman Brothers International and Capel-Cure Myers. Mr Brady said he would seek to resolve the matter 'in the best interests of shareholders considering all factors', adding he was sympathetic to the plight of the pensioners.</p>

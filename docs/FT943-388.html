			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Adwest 21% Acquisitions and a sharp rise in profits from its automotive side enabled Adwest, which also has power systems and property divisions, to report a 21 per cent pre-tax advance for the year to June 30. Group profits rose to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 9.42m) on turnover up by Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 147.9m. However, without the input from the five companies acquired in the year - which contributed profits of Pounds 1.44m on turnover of Pounds 10.6m - group operating profits would have fallen to Pounds 9.73m (Pounds 10.5m). Operating profits on the automotive side grew 45 per cent to Pounds 5.04m on turnover up 10 per cent to Pounds 91.4m, while power systems fell 19 per cent to Pounds 3.14m on turnover up 5 per cent at Pounds 53.5m. Property profits slipped 6 per cent to Pounds 3m. On why automotive had swung from profits 11 per cent lower in the first half to 45 per cent ahead in the second, Mr Graham Menzies, chief executive, explained that France in the first six months had been 'grotty'; by the end of the year it became 'super'. Some Pounds 42m of turnover is in France. The automotive acquisitions chipped in Pounds 580,000 and in the first half the group had paid Pounds 350,000 due diligence costs for companies it did not buy. On the positive side, the success of the Land Rover Discovery helped lift sales and improve margins and the thermostats business performed well. The Rousseau jacks business had doubled turnover to Pounds 10m since acquisition. Slippage in defence demand lay behind the power systems fall. At the Pounds 22.2m rights issue in September 1993, defence accounted for more than 50 per cent of power systems turnover. The acquisitions had cut that to under 30 per cent. The property side would be retained, though not developed - it helped pay the dividends, Mr Menzies said. A final of 5.4p (5.2p) lifts the total to 7.5p (7.2p), payable from earnings of 10.4p (10.5p).</p>

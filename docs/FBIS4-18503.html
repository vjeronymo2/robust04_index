			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has expressed his  displeasure and disappointment at the contents of the UN  secretary general's report to the Security Council, adding that  the contents of the report have been substantially amended after  the intervention of third parties.    In a written statement, President Kliridhis also notes that  he appreciates the effort being made to avoid further failure in  the discussions of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] but  he strongly disagrees with ignoring the fact that the CBM's have  been discussed since last May and since then the negative  attitudes have come in every case from the Turkish side.    President Kliridhis adds: Instead of this leading to the  correct realization that the Turkish side does not have the  political will either to implement the CBM's or to allow  agreement to be reached on the substance of the Cyprus issue,  and instead of suggesting to the Security Council that alternate  ways to promote a solution be looked at, the resumption of talks  on the CBM's is being requested. The president stresses: It is  obvious that this is done in order to satisfy further demands by  the Turkish side.    The president continues in his statement: I have stated  repeatedly and categorically to both of the UN secretary  general's representatives, Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel, and to  Mr. Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator  on the Cyprus issue, that despite my objections to the second  non-paper, which was actually submitted to satisfy Mr. Rauf  Denktas, I avoided raising my objections in order to facilitate  progress on an agreement. Mr. Kliridhis further says: I  pointed out repeatedly that Mr. Denktas continues to raise  objections and demand amendments. I could feel obliged to raise  my own objections as well, but then the gap would widen. The  president further notes: My firm position is that I will not  accept discussion of any new document or discussion of any  further amendments to the latest UN document.    President Kliridhis concludes: However, I reiterate  emphatically that I accept the latest UN document as it stands.</p>

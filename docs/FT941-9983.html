			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / How GM steered clear of the abyss: The US group's success in limiting Europe's recessionary damage General Motors' European operations suffered a 54.6 per cent decline in net profits last year, but the US group is expected to remain Europe's most profitable volume carmaker. Apart from GM, only Renault of France among the big six European volume carmakers is expected to report a profit for 1993. Volkswagen, of Germany, and Fiat, of Italy, have both plunged into loss, while Ford, GM's US rival, disclosed this week that its European automotive operations had suffered a third successive loss in 1993. New car sales in west Europe fell by an estimated 15.2 per cent to 11.45m last year, the steepest annual decline in the post-war period, which has left much of the European motor industry awash with red ink. GM, now firmly established in second place in the west European new car market, has remained in the black throughout the recession, however, and believes the worst is over. Mr Paul Schmidt, GM Europe finance director, said yesterday: 'We are counting on 1994 being more profitable than 1993.' GM's net profits from its European operations declined to Dollars 604.7m (Pounds 414m), from Dollars 1.3bn in 1992. Its results were burdened by one-off exchange rate losses of about Dollars 450m and by some Dollars 400m in restructuring charges. The net profit of the core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations fell to about Dollars 600m from Dollars 1.4bn. Opel fell into loss in Germany, but GM made profits at Vauxhall in the UK and in Spain. In contrast to its fortunes in the US, where it is still a high-cost producer, GM's Opel/Vauxhall operations are among the most productive in Europe. It has gained a big advantage over Ford of Europe, for example, in the capital efficiency of its new model development programmes, and it was the first carmaker in Europe to discover the profits potential from driving down purchasing costs. The success of its model range has allowed it steadily to increase market share - to 13 per cent last year - while avoiding the worst excesses of heavy marketing costs. Its main marque - Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK (the cars are technically identical) - is the biggest selling make in the west European market, and GM has achieved a more even spread of market share than its rivals. While Fiat and Volkswagen are still heavily dependent on their home markets, GM has secured a share of at least 10 per cent in 12 countries in west Europe, and is among the top three in 12 out of 17 national markets. While it moved much earlier than Volkswagen and Fiat to increase productivity in Europe - unfortunately the lessons only penetrated belatedly into GM's North American bureaucracy - it was still forced to cut its European workforce last year, to keep pace with the steep decline in the overall market and to bring down stock levels. GM's overall European workforce declined to 131,000 at the end of 1993 from 141,000 a year earlier, but this includes all GM activities from EDS data processing to Hughes Electronics and vehicle components manufacture. The workforce of the Opel/Vauxhall operations fell by 8 per cent to 85,000 (including 16,000 salaried employees) at the end of 1993, from 92,000 (including 17,000 salaried employees) a year earlier. It also imposed widespread short-time working at its European assembly plants and was forced to cut a total of 450 shifts. GM car and light commercial vehicle production in Europe, including small volume assembly in Hungary and Turkey, fell last year by 16.9 per cent to 1,435,520. Having started later on painful slimming courses - and with less success in the marketplace to soften the blows - GM's rivals in Europe have been forced to make more swingeing cuts in their workforces, often at the cost of sinking morale. The German auto industry, including components, lost an estimated 70,000 jobs in 1993 following a 60,000 reduction in 1992.</p>

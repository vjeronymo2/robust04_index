			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULTURE ;  </P> <P> EVANGELISTS IN AN OLD PLAZA SELL HOPE FOUND IN LITERACY;  </P> <P> IN MEXICO CITY, PUBLIC SCRIBES WRITE LETTERS FOR THE LOVELORN AND THE  ILLITERATE. THEY ACT AS COUNSELORS AND LINGUISTIC GUIDES TO A WAITING PUBLIC.  </P> <P> Their tools have evolved over the last 150 years, but their mission is the  same. From the stone, arched portico of Santo Domingo Plaza, dozens of public  scribes offer their writing services to the lovelorn and illiterate, to  students, taxpayers and job-seekers.  </P> <P> The sharpened plumes and ink pots have been replaced by manual Remingtons and  Olympias; a few electric typewriters have made their way into the colonial  plaza. The scribes, however, still call themselves evangelists, the traditional  term for purveyors of the written word.  </P> <P> Although much of their work is routine -- filling out tax forms and job  applications -- men and women also come to them with requests for love letters,  university theses and appeals to Mexico's president.  </P> <P> "We are guides and servants of the Mexican people," said Hipolito Ortiz, 50,  who has been a scribe for half his life. "They come to us with sentimental  problems and moral problems. Sometimes they cry. We still write love letters,  although now they usually are to people who live far away. One writes these as  if they were your own, not for a client but as if it were your own personal  suffering."  </P> <P> The job of a scribe is demanding, said the bespectacled Ortiz, who considers  himself part psychologist and part priest. A scribe not only must master typing  and spelling but must be able to turn a phrase and offer good counsel.  </P> <P> "One acquires experience over the years and learns to give advice. For example,  not all love letters are pure joy. Some are about deception, but they are still  love letters. If a man wants to write something violent to his girlfriend, I  try to calm him down. 'Violence is ephemeral, love is enduring,' I tell him,"  Ortiz said.  </P> <P> About 10 years ago, he recalled, a couple came to him with their young daughter  asking for a letter to a civil judge.  </P> <P> "They wanted a divorce. I said, 'What about your little girl? There must be a  solution. I will write your letter, but in a week. Come back in a week.' They  came back three days later and told me they had decided not to get a divorce.  For me, that is a satisfaction that I will never forget," Ortiz said.  </P> <P> Just last month, Ortiz said, an elderly and illiterate woman came to him with  her 5-year-old grandson. They were survivors of the 1985 earthquake in which  the boy's parents died.  </P> <P> "She wanted to write a letter to the president's wife asking for help or a job.  She laid out her problems, and I wrote the text. I wrote the prettiest letter  imploring, very sincerely, for the senora's most valuable assistance, for  economic or material help," Ortiz said.  </P> <P> "I haven't heard what happened yet, but she'll come back and tell me. Tomorrow  or the day after tomorrow, she'll come," he said.  </P> <P> According to Ortiz, who is head of the public typists union, the first scribe  to install himself in Santo Domingo plaza was Manuel Rivera Cambas in 1854. He  wrote with a bird's feather that he kept razor sharp. Ortiz said Rivera Cambas  wrote love letters, but some people say he also copied down prayers for  worshipers at the baroque Santo Domingo church, built in 1736 on the northern  edge of the plaza.  </P> <P> Next to the church is the palace that housed the Inquisition, or the Tribunal  del Santo Oficio. About 50 people reportedly were burned at the stake in Mexico  during the Inquisition. The palace later became the government School of  Medicine and then a museum.  </P> <P> On the eastern rim of the plaza is the mansion of a Spanish conqueror, the  Marquis de Villamayor, which became the government Customs House. Today, the  mansion belongs to the Ministry of Education and is decorated with murals by  Diego Rivera depicting the lives and hardships of common people.  </P> <P> A fountain at the center of the plaza is overwhelmed by sunning pigeons, who  are surrounded by vendors, shoppers and children. Men sell coffee from giant  thermoses on their backs; women sell mangoes and other sliced fruits from their  colored carts. Business-suited bureaucrats stop to read the newspaper or get a  shoeshine.  </P> <P> Sharing the colonnade with the scribes are dozens of printers running their  manual presses out of wooden kiosks. Letter by letter, the printers in  ink-stained smocks set the type for wedding announcements, baptismal  invitations, business cards and pads of receipts. The arcade echoes with the  clatter of their iron press.  </P> <P> Electric typewriters, offset presses and computers have taken away some of  their clients, but still there is enough work to keep them in business, they  say. What hurts more than anything are newcomers who don't take pride in their  work.  </P> <P> "Some of the new printers are lazy and not so professional," said Carlos Lara,  38. "They make their clients come back two or three times before the work is  ready, and that hurts us all. Later, the clients say we're all alike."  </P> <P> Lara, whose 16-year-old son works with him at the press, said the bustling  plaza has been home to him since he was a teen-ager. "We live here. This is our  source of work."  </P> <P> Like Lara, 64-year-old scribe Jose Chavez has spent the better part of his life  in the plaza. He arrived in Mexico City from Durango at age 24 with dreams of  becoming a commercial artist. Chavez designs greeting cards for the printers  and does calligraphy on diplomas, as well as writing missives.  </P> <P> "I've liked to draw since I was a little boy," said the gray-haired scribe.  "That's why this is a good job. That, and because I have no boss. I'm my own  boss."  </P> <P> The pay, said Chavez and others, is modest. They charge just over a dollar for  a one-page letter or to fill out a government form. On a good day, they might  make $17 or $18 -- especially around the 15th and 30th of each month, when  taxes are due and workers get paid. But on many days, they don't make nearly  that much.  </P> <P> Chavez said he identifies with the young men from the provinces who come to him  for letters to family back home.  </P> <P> "They are unhappy with their jobs or bosses, they have problems with the  government. There are too many people in Mexico City, and they complain about  the crowds in the Metro or about how expensive everything is. They come to  better their lot. If they do, they stay. If they can't, they go back home," he  said.  </P> <P> The pleasure of a scribe, Chavez said, is in helping people such as these --  poor people, people lost in the government bureaucracy, people in love.  </P> <P> "We help them express themselves," Chavez said. "Many times, they know what  they want to say and they need to say it very badly, but they don't know how.  We try to make them understood."  </P></p>

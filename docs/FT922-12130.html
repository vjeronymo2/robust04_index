			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: A case of buyer beware in Czechoslovakia / Describing the environmental responsibilities which foreign investors could inherit When it comes to pollution in Czechoslovakia, government officials agree on only one thing - the task of cleaning it up will be difficult. Consensus fades when officials from the ministries of the environment, finance and privatisation discuss the means and methods needed to implement improvements. As the privatisation programme gathers steam in Czechoslovakia, questions have emerged on how newly privatised companies will assume environmental responsibilities and what demands will be placed upon foreign investors when they are involved. For the federal committee of the environment in Prague, environmental issues must be tackled as the privatisation programme unfolds. Jozef Vavrousek, the environment minister, has warned against what he calls the icing-on-the-cake attitude which consists of implementing reforms first and tackling environmental issues later. On his initiative, the federal parliament adopted in February an amendment to the privatisation law which forces local enterprises to evaluate environmental liabilities when presenting their privatisation projects to the government. Under the Czechoslovak privatisation programme, more than half of the country's enterprises have drafted privatisation projects which will place their equity in private hands. The efforts of the environment minister aim at ensuring that government officials, when choosing between competing projects, will take into consideration plans for environmentally-beneficial investments. 'We must make sure that environment issues, which have been neglected, are now factored into privatisation,' says Vavrousek. Strategies for the environmental clean-up have become urgent as private companies are created. These enterprises will be owned by a mass of scattered shareholders. More than 8.5m citizens in Czechoslovakia (population 15m) have registered to receive vouchers which will become shares in the county's enterprises. Such a diffuse ownership will provide little incentive for management to implement environmentally beneficial technologies and respect environmental laws. To complicate matters, environmental laws have been hampered by Czechoslovakia's federal political system. Federal laws have so far laid down general principles, but follow-ups defining concrete implementations are under the jurisdiction of the Czech and Slovak republics. So far, regional parliaments have been slow to pass legislation. Future legal proposals will tackle the possibility of creating a Superfund, based on the American model, with whole sites being cleaned-up with government funds and costs later recouped from the original polluters. An environmental tax on companies to cover clean-up projects is also under consideration. According to Miroslav Zamecnik, an adviser to President Vaclav Havel, these taxes should be used to provide soft loans for the environment. But both lack of resources and negligence under the communist rule make it hard to identify culprits today and implement polluter-pay strategies. 'It is often impossible to pinpoint who is responsible for past damages and, when you can identify a polluter, he has no money,' says Vavrousek. The problem of financial resources can be partly resolved when foreign investors are involved in the privatisation of local enterprises. Western companies are generally ready to include environmental investments in a joint-venture in order to meet EC environment standards. But difficulties arise on the question of environmental liabilities committed in the past. 'Foreign investors buying a company with potential environmental problems will want a clause in a contract whereby they will not be held responsible for damage caused before the joint-venture,' says William Harter from Proctor &amp; Gamble, which bought a Czech detergent company last year. 'The government is not terribly willing to agree on such clauses. They would rather see the buyer fix the problems.' To simplify negotiations, the government recently drafted a purchasing contract which clarifies environmental policies. Foreign investors are encouraged to commission environmental audits with a recommended list of about 20 companies. On this basis, the government may pay indemnifications for a clean-up. These indemnifications cannot be greater than the purchasing price paid by the foreign buyer, however. 'If foreign buyers don't do an environmental audit, then we won't take any responsibility for liabilities they find at a later stage,' says Edmond Franco, adviser to the Czech ministry of privatisation. With the bulk of the companies in the hands of shareholders who have never been to a shareholders' meeting, and with enterprises' budgets strained by the economic transition to a free market, funds will be hard to come by on the polluters' side. Yet, under the privatisation programme, the environment becomes the polluters' problem.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Concern at small business bank bills High street banks may have overcharged as many as 10 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses by up to Pounds 1.75bn, according to the Banking Liaison Group. The group of former bankers, which advises businesses on their relationships with banks, called yesterday for each bank to appoint a senior executive to work with the group and similar organisations to resolve complaints which could not be dealt with at branch level. Mr John Sillett, group chief executive, said banks often admitted their errors but were more unwilling to accept responsibility for consequential losses or damage to a company's reputation. 'With over 3.5m businesses in Britain, that means some 350,000 may have been overcharged,' Mr Sillett said. 'Banks do make mistakes and should be ready to admit them.' Complaints by businesses made up about 20 per cent of the total complaints to the banking ombudsman this year, according to the scheme's annual report. The British Bankers' Association, which represents the sector, rejected the group's figures.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BREA FIRM INVOLVED;  </P> <P> TESTING ASKED FOR SUSPECT SWITCHES USED IN MISSILES  </P> <P> The Navy -- ignoring Pentagon investigators' warnings -- has permitted a  missile manufacturer to continue using electronic switches whose faulty  production by a small Southland firm could render the missiles' warheads  useless, the head of a congressional oversight panel has charged.  </P> <P> Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich), in a letter released Wednesday, asked Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney to order independent testing of the inexpensive switches  made by Asher Engineering Corp. in Baldwin Park to determine the harm, if any,  done by alleged shoddy manufacturing practices.  </P> <P> In the worst case, Dingell warned, flaws in the switches could force the  "recall of seven years of missile production."  </P> <P> The Times reported in March that Asher's failure to properly test the tiny  switches, which cost less than $20 each, had Pentagon officials concerned about  the effectiveness of many of the tactical missiles in the U.S. arsenal. The  switches are a critical piece of the firing mechanisms in Phoenix, Harm,  Harpoon, AAMRAM, Standard, Sidewinder and Maverick missiles.  </P> <P> Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its  investigations subcommittee, said the Navy ignored critical audits of Asher by  its own investigators in issuing a waiver last month that allowed Texas  Instruments to install the switches in more than 350 Harm missiles.  </P> <P> Just last week, the Navy's top quality-control official added his own  objections, warning that test results to date did not justify using the  switches and that their use posed "potential serious hazard to personnel,  aircraft and missiles," according to an internal Navy memo released by the  subcommittee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sees No Problem  </P> <P> Defense Department and Navy spokesmen declined to comment Wednesday on  Dingell's letter. A Texas Instruments official, however, said the switches had  been thoroughly tested and that none had failed.  </P> <P> "The missile is warrantied, and we make sure the parts are good before we use  them," said G. Dean Clubb, senior vice president and missile systems manager  for Texas Instruments' defense systems and electronics group in Dallas. "There  is no doubt in my mind these (switches) will certainly meet the needs of the  missile system."  </P> <P> The Defense Criminal Investigative Service has recommended that federal  prosecutors in Los Angeles seek indictments of officials of Asher and Micronics  International, a Brea company that is the prime contractor for the missile  firing mechanisms of which Asher's switches are a part, according to William G.  Dupree, the Pentagon's deputy assistant inspector general for investigations.  </P> <P> Dingell's letter said the Defense Department investigators have found that the  switches did not meet military specifications, that they had not been tested  correctly and that Asher was using equipment that had not been checked against  Pentagon standards for as long as seven years.  </P> <P> Bud Asher, president of the firm, could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  He told The Times in March that Micronics officials, under pressure from the  military to deliver firing mechanisms on time, had ordered Asher employees to  falsely certify that the switches met government specifications.  </P> <P> Micronics since last fall has been the subject of a criminal investigation of  alleged short cuts in its manufacture of firing mechanisms for the Phoenix  missile. The Times reported in October that flaws in the devices had forced the  Navy to mothball 500 missiles worth $425 million until replacement parts could  be installed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Passed Both Tests  </P> <P> Micronics officials have denied any wrongdoing. G. Addison Appleby, chairman  and chief executive of Micronics' parent company, La Jolla-based Precision  Aerotech, said Wednesday that he knew of no grounds on which Micronics could be  indicted.  </P> <P> Like Clubb, Appleby said the Asher switches had passed tests conducted by both  the Navy and independent labs. The only certifications signed by Asher  officials, he added, were those requested by the Navy.  </P> <P> "It's my understanding the problem is all in paper work," Appleby said.  </P> <P> In his letter, however, Dingell said the testing of the switches was suspect.  </P> <P> "There has been some limited functional testing done to date that indicates the  switches work," he said. "However, these tests are tainted by allegations that  the switches were handpicked and not representative of Asher production. In  fact, it is alleged that the testers were directed to 'find some switches that  work.' "  </P> <P> Dingell said Cheney needed to be alert to bureaucratic tendencies in the  Pentagon to overlook flaws in the switches.  </P> <P> "The possible recall of seven years' worth of missile production will create  tremendous pressure within the system to use the substandard or defective  components," Dingell said in the letter. One admiral, he said, told the  subcommittee that fleet commanders "would rather have missiles that do not work  than no missiles at all."  </P></p>

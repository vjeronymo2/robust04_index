			<p>BFN     [Text] The security director in Lahij Governorate has  stressed that security and stability have been restored in that  governate's districts, and that daily activities are proceeding  normally in all workplaces and businesses. Colonel Husayn  Qahtan, the governorate's security director, said in a statement  for the Yemeni news agency, SABA', that workers in all public,  private, and mixed enterprises were proceeding normally with  their jobs in their various sectors. He said the supply  situation in all districts was stable, and that the citizens  were able to move about smoothly and safely.    He denied all the distorted reports being put out by the  secessionist al-Ahmar clan concerning the situation in Lahij  Governorate, in a desperate attempt to mislead local and foreign  public opinion and to obfuscate the defeats it has suffered at  the hands of the forces of unity and national alignment -- and  at the hands of the heroic sons of the governorate. He  discussed the stupid acts being perpetrated by the remnants of  gangs from the secessionist al-Ahmar clan, who are shelling the  villages in the governorate's districts, causing heavy losses in  life and property to the peaceful inhabitants. He praised the  sincere humanitarian efforts being made by doctors and health  workers at the Ibn Khaldun Hospital in treating wounded  children, women, and old men who had been directly targeted by  the vanquished gangs of the bloody al-Ahmar family.</p>

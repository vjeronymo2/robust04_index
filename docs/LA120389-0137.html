			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FLAWS IN TUCSON ARGUMENT  </P> <P> Peter Navarro, an assistant professor of economics, argued in his commentary  ("Tucson Merger Is the Logical One," Oct. 22) that San Diego Gas &amp;  Electric's now-defunct agreement to merge with Tucson Electric Power Co. is a  far better deal for San Diego-area customers than our proposed merger with  Southern California Edison.  </P> <P> But is it? Let's examine some of Navarro's arguments favoring the TEP merger:  </P> <P> First, he wrote, we San Diegans would enjoy lower rates by merging with Tucson  than we can expect under a merger with Edison. He notes that Edison's rates  are, on average, 9% higher than ours and that this "gap is projected to  continue for the next decade."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he says Tucson charges rates 20% lower than SDG&amp;E. This would  mean lower rates for San Diego-area customers.  </P> <P> There are several holes in this analysis. First, we project that, due to high  growth in our service territory, we are going to have to build new power plants  in the near future, or purchase increasingly expensive power from other  utilities, if we don't merge with Edison.  </P> <P> Under this "stand-alone scenario," we project our rates to go higher than  Edison's within the next couple of years. Furthermore, Edison's costs over time  are lower than ours due to its diversified fuel mix of cheaper coal and  hydropower together with oil, gas and nuclear. For example, Edison has access  to cheap hydropower, but Tucson does not, a fact ignored by Navarro.  </P> <P> Secondly, while it is true that Tucson's current rates are lower than both  Edison's and ours, Tucson's customers are facing large rate increases in the  next couple of years due to TEP's decade-long construction of new power plants.  Tucson customers have yet to pay for these plants. When they begin paying for  them, their rates will be comparable to those currently charged by SDG&amp;E  and Edison.  </P> <P> He also ignored Edison's pledge to reduce rates to our customers following the  merger. This reduction is going to pump between $80 million and $100 million  annually into the local economy in the merger's first three years alone.  </P> <P> Some other points ignored by Navarro are: Edison's transmission system reaches  the same power markets reached by Tucson, giving Edison access to cheap  coal-fired resources. Also, Edison's record of reliable service is among the  nation's best.  </P> <P> Navarro says he believes Tucson could be purchased at bargain-basement prices  because of its current difficulties with the Securities and Exchange Commission  and because its shareholders are angered at the reported activities of a former  chief executive officer who resigned under fire recently.  </P> <P> I maintain that these very same difficulties argue against a merger with  Tucson. Regardless of the accuracy of these complaints, it is safe to assume  that Tucson is going to be embroiled in legal proceedings for some time, and  its management is going to be severely distracted by these issues. SDG&amp;E  would not benefit from a partner preoccupied by legal distractions and thus  unable to pay full attention to the many problems and opportunities facing  today's utilities industry. Tucson's current troubled financial condition  simply makes it a less attractive merger partner.  </P> <P> Regardless of Edison's initial offers to merge, Tucson's financial and  regulatory problems should cause one to question whether the SDG&amp;E-Tucson  merger would have been terminated by the two companies.  </P> <P> Navarro also alleges that the SDG&amp;E-Edison merger would be  anti-competitive. However, he fails to note that the potential  anti-competitiveness of the merger will be a major subject of the federal and  the state regulatory hearings in months to come. While SDG&amp;E doesn't  believe there are any anti-competitive problems, should one be found to exist,  it will be corrected or the merger will not be approved.  </P> <P> TOM PAGE  </P> <P> Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer San Diego Gas &amp; Electric  </P></p>

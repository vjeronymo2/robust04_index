			<p>BFN     [Text] On 27 April, Congress unanimously approved prison  sentences of no less than 8 and no more than 15 years as  punishment for those who cultivate, promote, help with, or  finance poppy plantations, including those who transfer or  commercialize the seeds of this plant, which is the base product  for heroin.    The bill, which was based on a draft submitted 2 months ago  by the executive branch and debated by the Justice Committee,  establishes a prison sentence of no less that 2 and no more than  8 years for those who commercialize poppy seeds that would  produce less than 100 plants.    The bill also indicates that the poppy plantations that are  destroyed "by any means, as long as they do not affect the  preservation of the environment, must be done so under the  control and responsibility of the provincial prosecutor, who  must draft the appropriate document explaining the action."    The land used for cultivation, the equipment, and others  things used directly to commit the crime will be seized, and as  soon as the court hands down its sentence they will become the  property of the Agricultural Ministry.    Referring to the land, preferably this will be awarded to  peasants without land, according to a clause of the bill that  the president sent to Congress for approval.    Those who have committed this crime will not be eligible to  take advantage of penitentiary benefits such as sentence  reductions for work carried out or for helping in the  educational sector; pardons; or semi-conditional or conditional  release.    This bill is the first of its kind in scope as it is a  frontal attack against the proliferation of poppy plantations  within the national territory.    At the beginning of the week, EL COMERCIO revealed a report  on the magnitude of illegal poppy cultivation, which is  especially attractive for the drug traffickers because its  derivatives (opium and heroin) fetch a much higher price than  the illegal derivatives of the coca leaf.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Unigate buys Glass Glover for Pounds 54m UNIGATE, the food and distribution group, is buying Glass Glover, the logistics company, for Pounds 54m. Unigate will pay Pounds 43.8m in cash and Pounds 10.2m in loan notes. It is also considering floating its US restaurant business this summer. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate since October 1990, said that the group had been 'going through a lot of change' with acquisitions and disposals. He hoped people outside the company would now see the strategy more clearly. He said the main thrust was to strengthen the food and distribution activities in the UK which would then give a base for expansion into continental Europe. More deals are expected. The possible flotation of the US restaurant business, which operates under the Black-Eyed Pea and Taco Bueno names, could raise a significant sum. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 13.3m in the year to March 1992, and interim profits rose from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 8.4m. Glass Glover was the subject of a Pounds 47m management buy-out in 1988 and was planning a return to the stock market this month. However, Unigate's purchase price, which includes the Glass Glover debt, compares with a flotation valuation expected in the region of Pounds 40m to Pounds 45m. Glass Glover's main business is operating warehouses and distribution for large retail groups. It made an operating profit of Pounds 5.5m on sales of Pounds 84.8m in the year to October 3, 1992. On a pro-forma basis, allowing for the repayment of debt, after-tax profits would have been Pounds 3.4m giving an exit multiple of 16. Assets involved are worth Pounds 5.7m. Mr Buckland said there was little overlap between Unigate's distribution operations and Glass Glover's and that the latter's customers, such as Tesco, Littlewoods and Asda, had supported the change of ownership. Mr Buckland said that following the Glass Glover deal, and if two other deals -  the Pounds 50.4m agreed bid for Clifford Foods and the Pounds 17m purchase of some of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's milk businesses - go through, Unigate's gearing would top 60 per cent. However, he stressed the company was not planning a rights issue. Cash could be raised from disposals. Since he arrived at Unigate, a number of businesses have been sold, notably the JP Wood poultry operation for Pounds 36.7m and the US cheese companies for Dollars 75m (Pounds 49.6m).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "mus": "Through the Army Corps, Closer to NATO"] </F>   [Text] Olomouc--Beginning immediately, the 2d Army Corps  of the Army of the Czech Republic General Staff will operate in  the Havlickuv Brod, Chrudim, Usti nad Orlici, and Svitavy  districts instead of the Olomouc Military Command Center.    The former six-tier organization of the Army is merging into  three levels--General Staff, army corps, and brigades.  According to Army Chief of Staff Jiri Nekvasil, the democratic  states' representatives could not understand the former  multitier organization. The main reason for the ongoing  transformation of the Army is to make its structure transparent  and harmonize it with the system used in the armies of the  democratic states.    According to the commander of the 2d Army Corps, Frantisek  Podesva, the Olomouc corps will be responsible for the smooth,  properly developed general training of the troops and the  organization of their daily life. It will also take care of the  conscripts and the reserve soldiers in its territory. The  previous divisions will be replaced in the lower-level  arrangement by three motorized brigades--specifically, the Brno  6th motorized brigade, the Kromeriz 7th motorized brigade, and  the Valasske Mezirici 8th motorized brigade. The NCO training  centers and courses will start their operation on 1 October.  The soldiers of the combat units will begin to train in the  brigade structure on 1 January of next year.</p>

SADTU  President Shepherd Mdladlana said in an interview that his  organisation took the threat seriously because many white  teachers in the townships were SADTU members. He said that if  the Azanian Students Movement (Azasm) carried out it's threat  there would be confrontation, because SADTU members would feel  compelled to defend their colleagues.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOING PLACES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> WINERIES  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS hardly as well known for its wine-making as are the more  high-profile grape-producing portions of the state. But as Vance Corum,  formerly direct marketing specialist for the California Department of Food and  Agriculture, says, "Many people continue to think a wine is not good until the  media tells them so. What makes a wine good are your taste buds, and what is  good wine to you may well be made by a winery that isn't able to get visible.  There are wineries in Central and Southern California that are focused on  making wine, not on publicity campaigns."  </P> <P> Whether your quest is for wine in good taste, wine that tastes good, both if  possible or just a pleasant afternoon in the country, Southern California  wineries offer all of the above with a minimum of travel.  </P> <P> The scenic Temecula Valley is both a viticulturist's paradise and a mecca for  wine shoppers. Located between Los Angeles and San Diego, the 11 wineries of  Temecula offer tasting, touring, shopping and picnicking.  </P> <P> Suggested wineries to visit in the Temecula area include The Callaway Vineyard  and Winery, which has tours on the hour, 25-minute sit-down tastings and offers  dinner with its wine maker four times a year. Baily Vineyard and Winery invites  you to picnic in their hillside grape arbor after an informal tour of the  facility. Cilurzo Vineyard and Winery offers tours, tasting and the use of  their lakeside barbecue area. The Maurice Carrie Winery has a children's  playground as an extra-added attraction. At John Culbertson Winery, visitors  will find a bistro featuring California cuisine and a champagne bar.  </P> <P> Champagne lovers are also welcome at Maison Deutz, where the bubbly is their  only product. Located in Arroyo Grande on the way to San Luis Obispo, this  American offspring of the famous French parent company is worth a trip up the  central coast and offers champagne and hors d'oeuvres from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.  daily. Tours are given by appointment.  </P> <P> There are a number of wineries to visit elsewhere in Southern California  including Ferrara Winery, with self-guided tours, and Thomas Jaeger Winery,  both in Escondido. Bernardo Winery in San Diego also has several shops  including a goldsmith.  </P> <P> Ahern Winery in San Fernando is open for tours and tasting weekends by  appointment only. San Antonio Winery in Los Angeles offers tours, tasting, a  restaurant and entertainment. Hank Donatoni, the proprietor of Donatoni Winery  in Inglewood, is a commercial airline pilot-wine maker. He requests that  visitors phone ahead to make reservations.  </P> <P> Leeward Winery in Ventura is open daily for free sipping and informal guided  tours. Santa Barbara Winery in Santa Barbara offers guided tours, and crackers  are served at tastings.  </P></p>

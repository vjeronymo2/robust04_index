			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / SIB probes charge of 'stock lending' SECURITIES regulators are investigating allegations that a leading UK fund manager has been lending the stock certificates of a pension fund client without the client's knowledge or permission. Inquiries by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, began after Mr John Quarrell, a pensions lawyer and a partner at solicitors Nabarro Nathanson, wrote to his 30 largest pension fund clients on March 9, urging them to check on the security of their assets held by their custodian. He urged them to consider a surprise visit to the custodian's premises at 9am to request stock certificates relating to their six largest investments. In his letter, Mr Quarrell cites the case of a pension fund client of a colleague who did so and found that by 9.30am the custodian, who was also the fund manager, could produce only 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the relevant certificates. 'Upon inquiry it became clear that the institution had been using the others for 'stock lending',' Mr Quarrell wrote. The fund manager's actions not only raised questions about the breach of authority and the security of the assets, but suggested that it had been keeping profits that rightly belonged to the pension fund. Neither the fund manager nor the pension fund was identified in Mr Quarrell's letter. Mr Charles Nunnelly, a board member of Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, said he had notified Imro of the allegations and had asked for an investigation. Mr Quarrell is chairman of an industry subcommittee which is examining regulatory issues arising from the theft of assets from pension funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. The letter has raised what is becoming an increasingly contentious issue within the industry - whether stock certificates should be designated in the name of the actual owner or be in the name of the fund manager.</p>

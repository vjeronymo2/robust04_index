			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BUCCANEERS SIGN MCCANTS TO $7.4-MILLION DEAL  </P> <P> Keith McCants, the fourth player selected in this year's college football  draft, signed a five-year contract Wednesday with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  </P> <P> Terms were not disclosed, but the Mobile (Ala.)  </P> <P> Press-Register reported that the former Alabama star will receive $7.4 million,  including a $2.5-million signing bonus.  </P> <P> Lance Luchnick, McCants' attorney, described the deal as "fair and equitable  for both sides." He said talks with Buccaneer administrator Phil Krueger  escalated this week after McCants told him he wouldn't be satisfied to merely  sign before the Tampa Bay open training camp on July 20.  </P> <P> McCants, who left Alabama after his junior year, was considered the top  prospect in the draft before some teams raised questions about the soundness of  his right knee.  </P> <P> He underwent arthroscopic surgery two days after the draft and has been working  out in Tampa the past two months.  </P></p>

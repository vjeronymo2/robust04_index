			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROOKINS HID OWNERSHIP OF BUILDING, REPORT SAYS;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT: THE BISHOP RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL RENOVATION LOAN BY USING A  CHURCH CORPORATION, A CITY INVESTIGATOR CHARGES.  </P> <P> City investigators have found that on two separate occasions Bishop H. H.  Brookins disguised his ownership of a run-down office complex to obtain  controversial government renovation loans, according to a report that will be  considered today by the City Council.  </P> <P> The Times reported in February that Brookins received an initial $238,000 loan  of federal poverty funds in 1982 through a non-existent California church  corporation that was listed as the building's owner.  </P> <P> Brookins then qualified for an additional $91,000 in loans by leading city  officials to believe that the property was still owned by the church  corporation, said George C. Hughley, chief of the Community Development  Department's special investigations unit.  </P> <P> But records show that a private company established by Brookins acquired the  property in 1984 -- well before the new loans were issued in 1985 and 1986.  </P> <P> "It's another case of misrepresentation on the bishop's part," Hughley said in  an interview Tuesday. "He misrepresented the whole situation to get roughly  $90,000."  </P> <P> Neither the original loan amount nor the additional $91,000 would have been  approved if city officials had known that Brookins or a company he incorporated  -- California Southway Development Corp. -- owned the property, Hughley said.  </P> <P> Brookins, a longtime leader of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and  political mentor to Mayor Tom Bradley, could not be reached for comment Tuesday  at his Washington office.  </P> <P> The bishop's attorney, J. Stanley Sanders, told the City Council's Community  and Economic Development Committee last week that it is "far-fetched" to  suggest that Brookins misrepresented his interest in the complex. Sanders also  said there is no evidence that Brookins has personally benefited from his  ownership of the property.  </P> <P> The City Council and the economic development committee are scheduled this  morning to consider a proposal to recover about $48,000 that the city paid for  rent in the Southwest Los Angeles office complex. Community Development  Department reports have concluded that the money is owed to the city because  Brookins had a conflict of interest in his dual role as a landlord who  collected city rent for his Crenshaw property while serving as head of a  10-year-old poverty program located in the building.  </P> <P> Last week, Hughley told the council committee there was "irrefutable evidence"  that Brookins, not the church, had owned the building since 1977.  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. Frank Orozco said Tuesday that his office agrees that  Brookins owned the property for the past 13 years and had a conflict of  interest. The city attorney will recommend today that the council sue to  recover the back rent, Orozco said.  </P> <P> But Sanders insisted that the property was purchased by the African Methodist  Episcopal Church in 1977, transferred to Southway in 1984 and first acquired by  the bishop in 1988, according to a 29-page report submitted to the council last  week on behalf of Brookins. Thus, Sanders said, Brookins had no conflict and  does not owe the city a penny.  </P> <P> If that is the case, Brookins and Southway would owe thousands of dollars in  back property taxes because the property was not reassessed at a higher value  when it changed hands in 1984 and 1988 as Sanders now contends, city officials  said. Instead, the property value remains at the 1977 level because no change  of owners was reported.  </P> <P> "(Sanders) has either got to say that Brookins bought this property in 1977  (and improperly obtained the city loans) . . . or he's got to say this whole  thing was a (tax) scam," Hughley said in an interview. " . . . You cannot have  it both ways."  </P> <P> Sanders responded: "I disagree. I think we can have it both ways. We'll see."  </P> <P> The three-story building housed the South Los Angeles Development Corp., a  program headed by Brookins that offered job training and education for poor  residents. A few years after the city issued the renovation loan to Brookins,  the program moved from the renovated building to a dilapidated office next  door. Brookins then leased the renovated offices for $10,000 a month to a  private trade school. The program, meanwhile, has received more than $500,000  in federal funds through the city while suffering from a long history of  problems ranging from failure to pay taxes to theft of public funds, according  to state and city reports. In February, the city canceled its $87,142-a-year  contract with the poverty program.  </P> <P> Today, Brookins personally owns the building, which loan records indicate is  worth about $1 million.  </P> <P> There are conflicting accounts about how the building was acquired: Sanders  said that the AME Church purchased the building in 1977 for $250,000 from Clark  E. Parker, an insurance company executive and an acquaintance of the bishop.  Parker told the district attorney's office that he donated the building to the  church through Brookins, investigative reports show. And Brookins told  investigators that he spent the $250,000 on building improvements and  unspecified financial obligations.  </P> <P> The city investigation concluded that Brookins disguised his ownership of the  building by placing it in the name of a non-existent organization, Southern  California Conference AME Church Inc. The company was never registered with the  California secretary of state, records show.  </P> <P> By using the church organization, Brookins was able to receive the federally  funded loan, Hughley said.  </P> <P> The building was then acquired in 1984 by California Southway Development Corp.  as part of a plan by Brookins to put together a group of investors willing to  carry the building for tax benefits, Sanders said in his report.  </P> <P> The following year, Brookins went back to the city to apply for an additional  $91,000 to finish the renovation, Hughley said. But when he applied for the new  loan, Brookins submitted the owners as the AME church group, not Southway,  Hughley said.  </P> <P> Hughley suggested that the bishop did this for two reasons: The city would not  have approved the loan to a private corporation held in Brookins' name, and the  existing loan agreement required Brookins to repay the city if the church no  longer owned the property.  </P> <P> "This was a specific act," Hughley said. "It's obvious why he did it: To get  some more money."  </P></p>

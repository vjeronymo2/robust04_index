			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- Opposition leader Yi  Ki-taek said Monday he will negotiate with the government on  visiting North Korea after the National Assembly session ends  next month.    He told reporters at his home early in the morning that he  had been considering a North Korea visit "from quite long ago."    Aware of the criticism that he is acting on a whim, the  opposition leader said he had been discussing inter-Korean  relations with experts.    "I sought the opinions of others whom I met at last year-end  gatherings and they had rather progressive views about even the  nuclear problem," Yi said.    Asked whether arrangements for the visit are well in  advance,  he said they "have just begun."    "I expressed my intent to go to North Korea as an opposition  leader, and I am preparing and collecting necessary materials,"  Yi said.    He will begin consultations with the government about the  visit after the extraordinary assembly session in January and  February, and has specifically ordered his spokesman to announce  that he will not, under any circumstances, neglect domestic  issues such as water contamination and the Uruguay Round, Yi  said.    As he was doing it for improvement of inter-Korean ties,  there was "no reason" for the government to refuse him  permission to make the trip, Yi said.    The opposition leader embarks on a visit to China later this  month that was originally planned for last November or December.    Meetings with Chinese leaders were set then, but  rescheduling  is not going well, he said.</p>

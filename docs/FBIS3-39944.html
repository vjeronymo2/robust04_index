"The reactor will develop as rapidly as possible toward  subgeneration [sous-generation] so as to limit the quantities of  plutonium produced," added the press release issued by the  offices of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, which also set forth  several conditions relating to security.    The Superphenix, which will now become "a research  prototype"  and no longer function as "an industrial power station," will be  reactivated after the successful completion of the work aimed at  combating the fires caused by sodium leaks, after a phased  start-up procedure, and on condition that the production of  electricity is no longer a prime objective.    Moreover, the offices of the prime minister stressed that by  virtue of its being a prototype, the functioning of the  Superphenix could be suspended. In an effort to explain this  decision to reactivate the Superphenix, they stress its  importance for research into long-life radioactive waste  reduction. In its press release, the government also stressed  that the reactor would be integrated "into efforts to master  nuclear technologies," with the "two main objectives being  research on the utilization of plutonium (...) and the reduction  of long-life radioactive waste produced by reprocessing fuel  from nuclear reactors."</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Japan set to further boost its economy THE JAPANESE government is considering a fresh public spending package and cuts in income tax to help retrieve the economy from the brink of recession. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said tax reforms and extra spending were among the options being considered for the economic stimulus plans to be announced later this month. Proposed business regulation cuts, announced last week, would not be enough, he said. The package is likely to include loans for housebuilding and job creation, and spending on research institutes and telecommunications. If agreed, this will be the third pump-priming plan in the past year, after a total of nearly Y24,000bn (Pounds 150bn) - in August 1992 Y10,700bn was allocated and another Y13,200bn came in this April. Economic analysts believe their impact has so far been disappointing because government agencies have been slow to spend the cash on infrastructure. Resistance to another spending package can be expected from the finance ministry, which will try to reduce its size, as in the previous two packages, on the grounds that the tax revenues to finance such spending are declining. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is expected to unveil the deregulation, spending and tax plans some time before he visits the US on September 25 for his first meeting with President Bill Clinton. Washington's expectations are almost as high as those of the Japanese public, as it seeks evidence the government can live up to pledges to stimulate import demand so as to curb a record trade surplus. Sanyo Investment Research has predicted that profits at Japan's top industrial companies will fall by over 23 per cent in the year to next March.</p>

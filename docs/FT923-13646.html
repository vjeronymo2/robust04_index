			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Markets: All dressed up - but nowhere to go - Wall Street WINDOW dressing is wonderful art. In New York, the streets are suddenly cleaner, flowers and bunting more noticeable, the police more in evidence. The reason is simple: a Democrat convention is coming to town. On Wall Street, something similar seems to be going on. Last week, a panic-struck Federal Reserve cut the discount rate to its lowest level since the early 1960s. There was nothing too complicated behind this move, either. Unemployment is rising alarmingly, just as the politicians are saying that the economy is on the mend. But, for stock market traders and investors, the outlook immediately acquired a rosier tinge. After an edgy start to the week - in which the Dow Jones industrial average first rallied and was then hit badly by a wave of programme selling on Tuesday - dealers started to anticipate a mild summer rally. On Thursday, the Dow staged an extremely solid revival, gaining more than 30 points in heavy volume. The sheer breadth of the upturn, encompassing both small stocks and big blue chips, encouraged many market participants. On Friday morning, suitably low inflation data boosted the optimistic mood. A gain of just 0.2 per cent in the June producer price index - and a fall of 0.1 per cent in the 'core' rate, which excludes food and energy prices - suggested that inflationary steam is non-existent in the US economy at present. Share prices first took further heart, and then dithered briefly. But by mid-morning, they were still adding modestly to Thursday's gains. However, it remains a moot point whether this burst of summer confidence has much to support it. Clearly, lower interest rates reduce again the yield on competing investments, and the low real cost of money may encourage some marginal investment decisions. As pundits have pointed out, the second half of an election year tends to enjoy a stock market rally. But a more revealing picture of the 'real' economy may emerge when the corporate reporting season - covering earnings for the second quarter of 1992 - gets under way next week. So far, the auguries are mixed. On the plus side, profit warnings seem to have been less prevalent than in other 'pre-quarterlies' periods during recent years - although they have not been entirely absent, either. This week, for example, it was the turn of Georgia-Pacific, the US paper group, to tell analysts that it would only achieve 'slightly better than break-even'. After-tax profits, added the company, would be lower than in the same period of 1991. Georgia-Pacific's announcement duly knocked Dollars 4 3/8 of its own share price, at Dollars 55, and the rest of paper sector fell in sympathy. Some early earnings figures, meanwhile, have been anything but cheery. In the supermarket sector, for instance, Safeway reported a 6.5 per cent decline in second quarter profits, with same-store sales falling by over three per cent. This is a testament to the extent of price-competition in the retail sector - and the reluctance of consumers to spend more than is necessary. In the hotels sector, Marriott reported a marginal improvement overall only. Many leading US retailers reported only modest gains in sales during June - well below improvements seen in April and May. The Limited, long viewed as one of the more successful specialty retailers, disclosed a four per cent fall, causing its shares to fall Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 19 7/8 , close to their 52-week low. And Sears Roebuck, which is more heavily influenced by 'big ticket' items, reported a 2.6 per cent drop. Lay-offs continue to flow. In the aerospace sector, McDonnell Douglas announced up to 5,000 job losses while Northwest Airlines also trimmed staffing figures this week. In the oil industry two large programmes were revealed by Amoco and Unocal. Amoco is restructuring business operations at the cost of 8,500 jobs, or 16 per cent of its workforce, Unocal is eliminating 1,100 jobs. Finally, intense price competition in many major sectors shows little sign of abating. The airlines are a good example. Having just endured a fierce bout of domestic fare wars, the industry had hoped to raise its prices this week. Instead, promotional fares were announced by the bankrupt Continental Airlines. In short, just as cleaner pavements do not make New York's drug problem go way, so a cut in interest rates and election fever do not instantly answer the nation's economic ills.  ---------------------------------- Monday       3339.20  +   8.91 Tuesday      3295.17  -  44.03 Wednesday    3293.28  -   1.89 Thursday     3324.08  +  30.80 Friday       3330.56  +   6.48  ----------------------------------</p>

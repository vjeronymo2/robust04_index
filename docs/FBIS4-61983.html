			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow 12 May TASS -- A new cease-fire agreement  beginning on midnight from 11 to 12 May has been mediated among  the warring sides by Russia and the CSCE at talks in Moscow.    Russian envoy on Karabakh settlement Vladimir Kazimirov told  TASS on Thursday that in contrast to the last cease-fire, which  was unilaterally declared by Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan,  the latest one is a commitment of three parties, a compromise  brokered by mediators among Azerbaijan, Armenia and  Nagorno-Karabakh.    "Multiple violations of previous agreements put the trust to  political will of the leaders of the sides under a serious  test," Kazimirov admitted.    He said that the agreement was signed by defence ministers  of  Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The Russian Foreign  Ministry welcomes the cease-fire and insists on its  unconditional fulfilment by all parties, he added.    "It is necessary to ensure a radical breakthrough in the  situation, a firm turn towards peace, to consolidate armistice  by reliable and legally-binding agreements on the final end of  the armed conflict," the envoy stressed.    So far there have been no reports about violations of the  cease-fire.    Later in the day Kazimirov, Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group  for Karabakh Jan Elison and his deputy Mathias Mosberg are  leaving for the conflict area to meet leaders of Azerbaijan,  Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

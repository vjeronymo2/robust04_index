			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Swedish interest rate switch Sweden yesterday revised its system for steering short-term interest rates in an effort to achieve greater flexibility in monetary policy. The move, which brings Swedish practice in line with that of other European central banks, coincided with a marginal reduction in the country's main interest rate, which fell from 7 per cent to 6.95 per cent. Under the new system, the Riksbank, the central bank, will replace its key marginal rate with a repurchase (repo) rate as its main interest rate policy instrument. The repo will lie between a lending rate and a deposit rate following the German practice where the discount rate acts as a floor and the Lombard as a ceiling for interest rates. The Riksbank has fixed the lending rate at 7.5 per cent and the discount at 6 per cent, with effect from June 1. The repo rate will be 6.95 per cent. Markets reacted positively to the news, marking bond yields lower and the krona higher.</p>

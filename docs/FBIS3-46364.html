Speaking at the organization's annual meeting, its president  He Luli said that during the past two years the association has  helped conduct economic and trade activities in various forms  and through different channels, thus greatly promoting economic  and trade co-operation between Beijing and the rest of the world.    The association, currently composed of 20 members of the  city's industrial, commercial, trade and service companies, aims  to tighten economic and trade connections between the members  and their overseas counterparts.    It also has 12 overseas advisers in Hong Kong, the United  States, Britain, Thailand, the Netherlands, and other countries  and regions.    During the past two years the association has received over  2,300 overseas economic, scientific, technical and financial  personnel as well as 26 economic and trade inspection teams.  The visits have helped conclude agreements on joint-venture  projects involving hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars, the  president said.    At a 1992 exchange fair sponsored by the association more  than 130 overseas Chinese entrepreneurs from 15 countries and  regions, including the U.S., Japan, Britain, Indonesia and Hong  Kong and Macao, signed more than 130 contracts, agreements and  letters of intent with Beijing's large and medium state-owned  enterprises, involving direct overseas investment of over 35  million U.S dollars.    The association, exploiting its vast network of connections  overseas, has so far helped more than 80 enterprises in the city  build up ties with their counterparts abroad.    It also invites overseas experts and scholars to chair  seminars and give lectures on quality management and commercial  law for the city's economic and trade professionals.    He Luli held that such exchanges have helped push Chinese  companies and products onto the world market and improved their  competitiveness.    The president said that this year the association is going  to  invite more overseas advisers and renowned personages to Beijing  for business exchanges and trade talks. Meanwhile, it will  designate team members to carry out business activities in  Europe, Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.</p>

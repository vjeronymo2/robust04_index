			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 24 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] With the strong possibility of an agreement being  reached to resume the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  conditions are now ripe for the two countries to enter into  negotiations on specific sectors, including automobiles.  However, if the two sides fail to narrow the gap on such issues  as objective criteria in advance, the negotiations may end up  deadlocked similar to what happened during the Japan-U.S. summit  talks in February.    To ensure that an agreement will be reached, the two  countries will probably first go ahead with intensive  negotiations on government procurement and insurance out of the  three priority sectors and put off negotiations on the focal  issues of automobiles and continuing the income tax cut. It is  still uncertain whether an overall agreement can be reached  before the bilateral summit meeting in July.    At the framework talks, the United States has insisted on  incorporating objective criteria as targets for the future,  while Japan has resisted such targets. Such a disagreement  stalled the talks. The reason why the United States has  compromised recently is because its previous tough stand toward  Japan has contributed to a depreciation of the dollar and a  decline in bond prices. It has realized that it would not be  wise to have a prolonged deterioration of economic relations  with Japan.    Japan and the United States were nearing substantial  agreement on government procurement and insurance last February.  "Once a conclusion is reached on the issue of objective  criteria, an agreement will be forthcoming" (according to the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry). Through the  "step-by-step solution" of dealing with the two sectors first,  the two countries can also underscore their efforts toward  reaching an agreement to offset speculative moves in the  financial and foreign exchange markets.    Automobiles and auto parts, where the issue of expanding  imports by Japan is pending, remain the toughest sector. The  two sides still must resolve the question of the U.S. demand  that the Japanese Government guarantee automakers' voluntary  import plans.    In macroeconomic policy, Japan can hardly come up with a  clear-cut statement on continuing with income tax cuts after FY  1994 because of the prevailing political situation. Therefore,  it is not certain whether Japan can come up with a solution  acceptable to the United States. However, considering the  pressure of the U.S. Congress on the administration in  anticipation of the upcoming midterm elections, and market  trends which may aggravate tension between Japan and the United  States, both countries cannot afford to procrastinate.</p>

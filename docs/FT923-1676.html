			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Japan's economy at zero growth: Second-quarter figures point to possibility of worst recession in 20 years JAPAN may be on the verge of its worst recession for almost 20 years with the economy failing to grow in the second quarter of 1992, official figures to be published this afternoon suggest. Official statistics measuring gross national product will show zero growth for the second quarter, according to senior government officials. The figures, to be released by the Economic Planning Agency, will confirm that the economy has run into the sand after the rapid expansion of the late 1980s which fuelled growth of at least 4 per cent for 4 1/2 years. The situation is not yet as serious as during the first oil shock of 1974, when the economy contracted for three successive quarters. GNP, however, did not fall during the downturn of 1981-82 or during that of three years later. The economy is delicately poised; the next three months could determine whether it recovers or slips deeper into depression. Government economists insist the figures mark the bottom of the downturn which began more than a year ago. They believe the announcement last month of an emergency Y10,700bn (Pounds 50bn) public spending package  - aimed at boosting confidence in the financial system and stimulating public investment  - will ease the economy to a soft landing with growth of about 3 per cent next year. Many private sector economists, however, believe the economy faces such serious problems  - overcapacity in manufacturing, huge bad debts which could disable the banking system, and stagnant private consumption  - that it will fall further unless the government takes additional action. The fragility of Japan's economic miracle was underlined by figures showing that, this year, average land prices fell for the first time since 1975 when the National Land Agency started compiling statistics. The agency's report, based on a survey of 26,000 locations, found that residential land prices fell by 3.8 per cent and commercial prices by 4.9 per cent compared with a similar survey in July 1991. In the Tokyo area, residential and commercial prices fell by 12 per cent, while in Osaka prices fell by about 23 per cent. The fall in prices, which began in Tokyo and Osaka in 1991, has now started to spread to regional cities, which reported price rises of just 0.3 per cent against an increase of around 5.2 per cent last year. Sales at Tokyo department stores fell by 5.7 per cent in August compared with the same month in 1991, the sixth successive monthly fall. The Japan Department Stores Association reported that furniture sales were 14.4 per cent down on July, electric appliances 16.4 per cent down and clothing sales 6 per cent lower. Only spending on food and in coffee shops had increased. One factor behind the sluggish store sales is the recovery in Japanese savings, which rose by 8.1 per cent in the year to July according to results of a poll of 6,000 households published by the Bank of Japan.</p>

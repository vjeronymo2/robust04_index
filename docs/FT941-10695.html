			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Possible bid for IFM if SE quote is kept Workers at International Food Machinery, the second-hand catering equipment supplier, were told yesterday it would continue to trade despite being placed in receivership. Arthur Andersen, appointed as receiver last Friday, said the workforce would be kept on while it considered bids for the Grimsby-based business. The company, which was floated only 14 months ago, called in Andersen following a meeting with its bankers. 'We have had contact with two parties interested in the group,' the receivers said. One of those bidders said yesterday that it had put together an offer worth at least Pounds 1m, although that depended on IFM retaining its Stock Exchange listing. Mr David Lassen-Diesen, the property investment entrepreneur, said the receivers had contacted his group asking whether their offer, first proposed last December, was still on the table. 'We are keen to proceed but only if it keeps the quote, allowing us to get funding from institutions,' he said. The other interested group is thought to involve IFM board members and Mr Sandy Saunders, the former Sunleigh director.</p>

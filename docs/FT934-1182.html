			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Ministry to review defence purchasing Changes in the way the Ministry of Defence handles arms purchases and training are being considered in an effort to save hundreds of millions of pounds on the annual defence budget from 1996. The targets of the review range from financial management and computer systems to recruitment and promotional activities - including showpieces such as the RAF's Red Arrows and the army's parachute display team. The ministry aims to save money by scrapping some of the security precautions set up during the cold war and reducing the number of people subjected to 'positive vetting'. Officials have identified 15 areas for examination by specialised teams under the defence-cost study announced after the November Budget. The study is aimed at helping the ministry save about Pounds 1bn in its annual spending from the 1996-97 financial year without damaging effectiveness. The drastic nature of the cuts means that ideas previously regarded as 'out-of-bounds' are likely to be included in initial proposals put to ministers in three or four months. One official said the question now was: 'Which sacred cows will have to be shot?' The biggest savings are expected to come from procurement, where options are being considered for leasing, acquisition of second-hand vehicles and other equipment, increased competition in collaborative international projects and greater use of private-sector finance. Officials will seek to draw lessons from close scrutiny of several large projects, such as the proposed new Anglo-French-Italian frigate. Significant economies are expected in repairs, spares supply, storage and freight, possibly though private contractors. Manufacturers may be required to provide in-service support for the equipment they supply. Training is also seen as a source of big savings, particularly in RAF flying instruction - the initial stage of which is already privatised - and the army. A review of property management is likely to lead to the sale of some of the more commercially attractive pieces of ministry property. Also under investigation are the ministry's head office and procurement staff, together employing about 8,000, and the 5,000-strong ministry police.</p>

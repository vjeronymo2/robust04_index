			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Maker to sue over ban on Halcion UPJOHN, the US manufacturer of the controversial Halcion sleeping pill, said yesterday it would take the UK licensing authority to court over its decision to revoke Halcion's UK licence this month. Karen Zagor in New York writes. Mr Simon Pearl, solicitor at Davies Arnold Cooper in London, which is representing the company, said: 'Upjohn is challenging the validity of the licensing authority decision in accordance with Section 107 of the Medicines Act. The case will be heard by a High Court judge.' Sales of Halcion were suspended in the UK in 1991 amid safety concerns after a woman in Salt Lake City in the US blamed the drug for causing a rage during which she killed her mother. The woman sued Upjohn and the case was settled out of court. Sales of the drug are suspended in Brazil, Argentina and Norway. In the US, it remains on the market in small doses with strict labelling. Upjohn contends that the UK licensing authority ignored favourable comments from two government-appointed panels when it decided to revoke Halcion's licence.</p>

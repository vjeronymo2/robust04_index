These are the results of a survey conducted by CIRM  [Italian Center for Market Research] for the weekly PANORAMA. A  sample of 2,400 voters was tested in the four constituencies  cited on 21 and 22 February, with results allowing for a margin  of error of more or less 4 percent. More specifically,  progressive candidate Luigi Spaventa won 23 percent of the vote  in Rome, followed closely by [Forza Italia leader] Silvio  Berlusconi with 22 percent of the vote. Center candidate  Alberto Michelini got 11 percent. In Milan, the survey predicts  that Bossi can muster 32 percent of the vote, well ahead of the  progressive Bassani, whose share of the vote was 17 percent.  Center candidate Gianni Rivera got 11 percent, and MSI [Italian  Social movement] member La Russa 8 percent.    In Naples, support for Alessandra Mussolini was at 30  percent, whereas her direct progressive rival, Maria Fortuna,  won 19 percent of the vote. Finally, in Bologna the winner was  Achille Occhetto (27 percent), well ahead of right-wing  coalition candidate Pierferdinando Casini (15 percent). The  third place was taken by [Radical] Pannella-list candidate  Olivero Toscani, with 8 percent of the vote.    The CIRM survey confirmed the national percentage of the  "undecided," estimated at 28 percent. This percentage, however,  was much higher in the four constituencies in question: In  Naples, 45 percent of the voters had not yet made up their  minds, in Rome 43 percent, and in Bologna 37 percent. Only in  Milan was the percentage of the undecided equal to the national  average, namely, 28 percent.</p>

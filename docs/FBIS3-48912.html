"Society is tired of political strife and wants a calmer life  and more common sense," the prime minister said. "I will not  promise you a bright future, but as a nation and a state, we  have to break clear from our past," he went on to say.  According to Prof. Berov, the National Assembly bears inscribed  the secret for Bulgaria's headway: "Unity Is Strength."    Prime Minister Berov summed up the 1993 performance of the  government which he headed precisely an year ago.

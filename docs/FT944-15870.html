			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Ford to buy 7% stake in Indian carmaker Ford of the US, the world's second-largest vehicle maker, is taking a minority stake in Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, one of the top 10 private sector groups in India. It said it would pay about Dollars 50m (Pounds 31.6m) for a 7 per cent stake in the automotive and tractor manufacturer. The US company's move into India's fast-growing market follows recent, similar initiatives by several leading carmakers, including General Motors, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Daewoo. They are scrambling to establish a presence in emerging markets, especially Asia and Latin America. Ford and Mahindra are to launch a feasibility study into the manufacture of Ford vehicles in India, which should be concluded by mid-1995. It is expected to lead to a joint venture company with equal Ford and Mahindra shareholdings, which will set up a new plant - probably for the assembly of vehicles developed by Ford in Europe. Ford's acquisition of a minority stake must be approved by Mahindra shareholders at a meeting on November 10. Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said the company intended 'to be a significant participant in India's automotive industry in the near future'. Last year, Ford started production of aluminium radiators in a plant near New Delhi in a joint venture with Sumitomo and Maruti. Other moves this year in India include: GM of the US formed a joint venture with Hindustan Motors to invest about Dollars 100m to assemble the Opel Astra, with production planned to begin in the third quarter of 1995. Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany, formed a joint venture with Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive (Telco) of India, one of the world's leading makers of commercial vehicles, with an investment of about DM250m (Pounds 102.5m) for the assembly in India of Mercedes-Benz E-Class executive cars as well as petrol and diesel engines. Volkswagen of Germany, the leading European carmaker, signed a memorandum of understanding last month with Eicher Goodearth to study feasibility of joint vehicle production in India. The Eicher group produces Mitsubishi light commercial vehicles under licence in India. Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate and the country's third-largest carmaker, has bought a majority stake in DCM-Toyota, an Indian truck maker, which it plans to transform into a carmaker. Volkswagen said Asia offered the strongest prospects for growth in the world car market - annual sales in India are expected to double to up to 500,000 by 2000. India's car market is dominated by Maruti, a joint venture between the government and Suzuki of Japan. Ford and Mazda may link in Europe, Page 7</p>

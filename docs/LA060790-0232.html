			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DON'T BASH JAPAN, DELEGATE SAYS  </P> <P> A Japanese business leader said the United States should "stop whining" about  Japan's trade barriers and stop "bashing Japan as a scapegoat" for America's  own economic problems.  </P> <P> Tadashi Yamamoto, president and chairperson of the Japan Center for  International Exchange, made the remarks at the final day of Pacific  University's First Pacific Symposium.  </P> <P> Yamamoto said he was worried about negative feelings toward Japan in the United  States. A poll presented to delegates by Rep. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) showed his  constituents resent the Japanese.  </P> <P> "The negative feelings for Japan have slipped out of the beltway and into such  hospitable communities as Portland, which is reason for grave concerns by the  Japanese," Yamamoto said.  </P> <P> Yamamoto added, however, that he is leaving the symposium with a great optimism  about future ties between the two countries.  </P></p>

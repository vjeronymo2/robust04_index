			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> SIGMUND FREUD ART COLLECTION: A DREAM AT UCI;  </P> <P> LIKE ANY PASSIONATE ART COLLECTOR, THE FATHER OF PSYCHOANALYSIS WAS FUELED BY  MOTIVES SO DEEP HE COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED THEM HIMSELF.  </P> <P> In March, 1938, the Nazis marched into Vienna. By May they were rounding up  Jews to scrub sidewalks with toothbrushes or to be packed off to the camps. At  Berggasse 19, tension mounted as Sigmund Freud's family prepared to flee  Austria. His daughter, Anna, was exercising guile worthy of Metternich to  persuade the SS to give her father Unbedenklichkeitserklarung, the official  document that would allow him to immigrate to England.  </P> <P> The father of psychoanalysis was 82 and ailing. His rabid fondness for cigars  had finally given him cancer of the mouth. His palate had been surgically  removed and replaced with a prosthesis that caused him unremitting pain. With  his life at stake, the old man still found time to worry about a matter others  would have forgotten in such extremity: Would his art collection be saved?  </P> <P> Freud started collecting in 1896, the year his father died. By the time the  Nazis arrived, he had more than 2,000 small antique works -- Egyptian,  Etruscan, Greek, Roman, Near-Eastern and Asian. They crammed his comfortable  consulting room and office. For him they were powerful symbols of his work and  treasured old friends.  </P> <P> Touchingly, he kept rows of figures ever before him on his desk as a king might  keep a council of elders -- or a boy rows of favorite model soldiers.  </P> <P> Finally, on May 23, he could write to a friend that the collection had been  released for a minimal levy of about $100. He was free. The beloved compendium  was reassembled in the Freuds' new London digs at 20 Maresfield Gardens.  </P> <P> Freud would have a year to be consoled by it before he died.  </P> <P> Today, the stolid brick London house is the Freud Museum. The antiquities it  contains were not his only artistic legacy. His grandson Lucien Freud still  lives in London and is regarded among the world's leading figurative painters.  </P> <P> A traveling exhibition of 65 works from Freud's collection is currently showing  at UC Irvine (to Dec. 16).  </P> <P> Put together by Freud Museum director Richard Wells and art historian Lynn  Gamwell, it is a show that resonates well beyond its own modest proportions and  should attract anyone interested in either art or psychology.  </P> <P> Actually, it requires a considerable effort of ignorance to be interested in  one and not the other.  </P> <P> Many shrinks will admit their craft is more art than science. Most artists will  readily confess that the end result of their labors is not so much the physical  artwork as its emotional impact first on themselves, then on the viewer.  </P> <P> Does a work of art really exist if no one sees it? Why does it exist when  someone does see it?  </P> <P> Because, I suppose, our minds are unruly cellars cluttered with remembered  images -- images of things, feelings and events. When we see a work of art, the  mind matches it up with those matrix images and we respond. In a way, we all  have an art collection pre-existent in our heads. If we put together a real  collection of objects, it is predictably the projection of our mindscape and  our dreams.  </P> <P> It's really all rather Freudian.  </P> <P> Ironically, Freud's collection of archetypal objects tends to confirm the  theories of his one-time follower Carl Jung. At this distance, disagreements in  doctrine between members of the Freud circle do seem tiresomely petty.  </P> <P> Freud had a classical education. Significantly, he did not collect primitive  art, but art from civilizations he had studied. He had a pretty good eye,  although he bought several fakes, such as a forged Chinese camel in Tang style  and a bogus Egyptian New Kingdom wall relief on view here.  </P> <P> The art critic Roger Fry claimed that Freud didn't understand the formal  underpinnings of aesthetic pleasure. That probably proves that Fry didn't  understand the profound emotional foundations of aesthetic pleasure.  </P> <P> At his best, Freud found objects that carry emotional authenticity and -- aside  from their powerful symbolic value -- objects with nuanced delicacy.  </P> <P> There is a lovely freshness about a Greek Hellenistic Eros figure and great  sensitivity of carving in an Egyptian Ptolemaic donation stele. Two tiny Roman  Hellenistic heads concentrate ferocious emotion.  </P> <P> But that's not the point. Like any passionate collector, Freud was fueled by  motives so deep he could not have explained them himself. That's saying  something, considering his claim to have been the only man to ever successfully  psychoanalyze himself.  </P> <P> As a youth, Freud admired and envied Heinrich Schliemann, the discoverer and  excavator of ancient Troy. Schliemann gave reality to a city thought to exist  only in legend. Freud gave reality to a part of the human mind believed equally  fictional.  </P> <P> In his practice, Freud saw himself as an archeologist of the mind unearthing  lost fragments of memory and trying to fit them once again into a coherent  whole. The archeological metaphor was so persuasive that psychotherapists use  it to this day, furnishing their own offices with magical objects. Shamanism  lives.  </P> <P> Imagine how Freud must have regarded his little late-Egyptian bronze of Isis  suckling the infant Horus. He would have known the mythical story of how Isis'  husband Osiris was killed by a jealous brother, hacked into 14 pieces and  scattered across the land. Isis found the dismembered pieces, put them back  together, made Osiris the first mummy and coupled with it to produce the infant  Horus. The child was raised in secret until he was old enough to avenge the  father.  </P> <P> Very Freudian.  </P> <P> Freud adored his mother and envied his father. When he learned of the Greek  myth of Oedipus, who unwittingly killed his father and married his mother, he  decided his own impulse was universal and identified the most famous of his  complexes.  </P> <P> A Greek terra cotta Sphinx memorializes the moment when Oedipus outwits the  winged lion-woman by answering her riddle.  </P> <P> Many of his cherished objects bore directly on personal experiences, such as a  falcon-headed figure that reminded him of a childhood dream. Janus-faced heads  reflect his interest in human dualities, including his claim that we are  fundamentally bisexual. His interest in the duality of instinct and reason  reflect in one of the collection's most beautiful works, an Egyptian-Roman  "Baboon of Thoth" -- the animal god of intellectual purity.  </P> <P> Freud had mixed and sometimes conventional notions about women. The driving  narcissism he claimed to find in them is embodied in a Roman bronze Venus  admiring herself in a glass. The power he felt in them shows in figures of  goddesses of aggression such as Athena and Artemis.  </P> <P> Freud was certainly among the most influential half-dozen thinkers of the  century.  </P> <P> His ideas have been attacked, ridiculed, revised and revered until lesser  people have declared us in a "Post-Freudian" era.  </P> <P> Certainly, Freud did not get it all right. But his real achievement comes  across in the extraordinary reverberations of his collection.  </P> <P> Perhaps because we know these things were his, we are reminded they have  meaning beyond their formal properties. They do what art is supposed to do and  what Freud tried to revitalize in reality. They broadcast the unseen things  which -- once grasped -- give life a profound vitality.  </P></p>

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  Statutory Framework <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a) authorizes establishment of tolerances and exemptions from tolerances for the residues of pesticides in or on raw agricultural commodities (RAC's), and section 409 of the act authorizes promulgation of food additive regulations for pesticide residues in processed foods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 408 of the act, EPA establishes tolerances, or exemptions from tolerances when appropriate, for pesticide residues in raw agricultural commodities. Food additive regulations setting maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues in processed foods are established under section 409 of the act. Section 409 food additive regulations are required, however, only for certain pesticide residues in processed food. Under section 409(a)(2) of the FFDCA, no section 409 food additive regulation is required if any pesticide residues in a processed food resulting from use on a RAC has been removed to the extent possible by good manufacturing practices and is below the tolerance for that pesticide in or on that RAC. This exemption in section 402(a)(2) is commonly referred to as the ``flow-through'' provision because it allows the section 408 raw food tolerance to flow through to processed food. Thus, a section 409 food additive regulation is only necessary to prevent foods from being deemed adulterated when despite the use of good manufacturing practices the concentration of the pesticide residues in a processed food is greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity, or if the processed food itself is treated or comes in contact with a pesticide. Monitoring and enforcement are carried out by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment of a food additive regulation under section 409 requires a finding that use of the pesticide will be ``safe'' (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)). Section 409 also contains the ``Delaney Clause,'' which specifically provides that, with limited exceptions, no additive may be approved if it has been found to induce cancer in man or animals (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(5)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA reviews residue chemistry and toxicology data in setting both section 408 tolerances and section 409 food additive regulations. To be acceptable, tolerances must be both high enough to cover residues likely to be left when the pesticide is used in accordance with its labeling and low enough to protect the public health. With respect to section 408 tolerances, EPA determines the highest levels of residues that might be present in a raw agricultural commodity based on controlled field trials conducted under the conditions allowed by the product's labeling that are expected to yield maximum residues. Generally, EPA's policy concerning whether a section 409 food additive regulation is needed depends on whether there is a possibility that the processing of a raw agricultural commodity containing pesticide residues would result in residues in the processed food at a level greater than the raw food tolerance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Petitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Uniroyal Chemical Co. has submitted a petition requesting the revocation of the food and feed additive regulations established under section 409 of the FFDCA for propargite on raisins and dry grape pomace. In addition, the petitioner requests that EPA withdraw its petition to establish a section 409 food additive regulation for propargite in raisin waste. Propargite is the active ingredient in Omite miticides registered by Uniroyal. Uniroyal claims that Omite is a nonsystemic contact miticide that acts primarily by surface contact and that surface residues are susceptible to release through mechanical and/or washing processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To support these claims, the Petitioner submitted two studies: A propargite Market Basket study, which was submitted on September 15, 1992, and a processing study submitted with this petition. The petition involves raisins, dry grape pomace as animal feed, and raisin waste as animal feed. The following sets forth the basis for the petitioner's request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Petitioner asserts that the processing study shows that propargite residues do not concentrate in raisins. The Petitioner also asserts that the processing study supports the results of Uniroyal's Market Basket study showing residues of propargite in raisins to be in the range of 0.02 to 0.69 part per million (ppm). The section 408 tolerance for propargite in grapes is currently established at 10 ppm (40 CFR 180.259). Therefore, the Petitioner asserts that the section 409 food additive regulation is not needed at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to dry grape pomace, again the Petitioner claims that the section 409 food additive regulation for dry grape pomace is not needed because residues of propargite do not concentrate above the level of section 408 tolerance in grapes. Furthermore, Uniroyal contends that since dry grape pomace is not ``intended for use as a substantial source of nutrients in the diet of the animal,'' it does not meet the definition of ``animal feed'' in section 201(x) of the FFDCA. Finally, the Petitioner asserts that even if dry grape pomace is used, it would be diluted with other food matter and when ``ready to eat'' would not exceed the section 408 tolerance for grapes. For these reasons, Uniroyal believes that the section 409 food additive regulation for propargite on dry grape pomace is not needed. The section 409 food additive regulation for propargite on dry grape pomace is 40 ppm (40 CFR 186.5000).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to raisin waste, Uniroyal presents two reasons why EPA should not pursue a section 409 food additive regulation for propargite in raisin waste. First, Uniroyal maintains that residues of propargite in raisin waste would not be expected to exceed the section 408 tolerance in grapes. Second, since raisin waste has low nutritional value and is usually discarded, it does not meet the definition of an ``animal feed'' under FFDCA section 201(x). Therefore, the Petitioner requests that EPA not pursue a section 409 food additive regulation for propargite on raisin waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 1, 1994 (59 FR 33941), EPA issued a proposed rule to revoke the section 409 food additive regulation for propargite in raisins because the Agency has determined that propargite induces cancer in animals. Thus, the regulation violates the Delaney Clause in section 409 of the FFDCA. The Agency has not yet proposed similar actions for the feed additive regulations for propargite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 40 CFR 177.125 and 177.30, EPA may issue an order ruling on the petition or may issue a proposal in response to the petition and seek further comment. If EPA issues an order in response to the petition, any person adversely affected by the order may file written objections and a request for a hearing on those objections with EPA on or before the 30th day after the date of publication of the order (40 CFR 178.20).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : 21 U.S.C. 346a and 348.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Danile M.

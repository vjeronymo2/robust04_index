			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK / SAM FARMER;  </P> <P> MUMOLO CAN ONLY RELIVE MISS IN HIS MIND  </P> <P> It's probably best that the fans stood when they did. Otherwise, Dominic Mumulo  might still be in front of his television, remote control in hand, reviewing  the layup that wasn't.  </P> <P> Mumulo, a junior forward at St. Francis High, missed a left-handed layup  against La Canada with five seconds to play last Wednesday as the Golden  Knights lost their first-round Southern Section 3-A Division basketball playoff  game, 64-63. However, Mumulo says, the shot was no gimme.  </P> <P> "I was going to go up with my right hand but I thought I probably would have  gotten stuffed so I switched to my left," said Mumulo, who was hardly a goat in  the game after scoring 16 points. "I shot it and the ball seemed to get caught  in the corner of the rim and it didn't quite get over.  </P> <P> "It wasn't something that really depressed me but it was something I could have  made. Anybody on the team could have made it."  </P> <P> Mumulo's father videotaped the game but failed to capture much of the fourth  quarter because fans were on their feet. The fact that the painful moment  wasn't saved for posterity bothers Dominic.  </P> <P> "I really wanted to see it," he said. "I wanted to see how we unfolded."  </P> <P> Falcon flop: In its 96-66 loss to Rio Mesa in the second round of the Southern  Section 4-A Division playoffs Friday, the Crescenta Valley basketball team made  three of 14 free throws. Despite those miserable numbers, though, the Falcons  trailed by just two at intermission.  </P> <P> "We were feeling good, knowing that we weren't shooting free throws that well,"  Coach John Goffredo said. "We were thinking, 'Geez, we can win this thing.' "  </P> <P> That thinking didn't last long: Crescenta Valley was outscored, 26-10, in the  third quarter.  </P> <P> Goffredo, however, can take heart in the fact that next season, for the first  time in his 11 years as coach, Crescenta Valley will have three returning  starters: Forwards Bruce Jacobson and Paul Matijasevic and guard Lamar  Breeding.  </P></p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Broker boosts for Wellcome PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome finished 10 ahead at 988p after being up 17 earlier. A number of securities houses weighed in with enthusiastic heavyweight research ahead of the big share issue this summer by its parent, Wellcome Trust. BZW was the first to publish, with a 112-page document homing in on the growth of existing products, new drugs, productive research and development, management changes, financial strength and potential earnings growth. James Capel, SG Warburg Securities and Robert Fleming, lead broker for the share flotation, also published. The shares were further boosted by a weekend press report suggesting that clinical trials on its cancer treatment Campath were going well. But BZW said that, although Campath offered exciting prospects for the treatment of arthritis, it was still only in early stages of development. Details on the size and price of Wellcome Trust's planned issue of much of its 73.5 per cent stake in Wellcome are expected in late June. C and W favoured The surging Hang Seng index, combined with positive sentiment from some London market quarters, lifted Cable and Wireless by 9 to 583p. Turnover was an impressive 3.7m. C and W, which accrues around 60 per cent of its profits from its majority holding in Hong Kong Telecom, has underperformed in recent weeks as sector attention has focused on Vodafone and BT. A number of brokers were reported yesterday as being positive. Mr Jim Ross at Hoare Govett said: 'Telephone network stocks are again attracting investor attention and we feel that C and W has been left behind and now looks good value. We also expect good results from HK Telecom tomorrow.' After last week's strength, profit-taking and the return of regulatory worries knocked BT, the fully-paid shares tumbling 6 1/2 to 360p and the partly-paid 5 to 139 1/2 p. Turnover came to 2.9m and 12.7m respectively. Vodafone eased a penny to 388p. Opec news lifts oils Higher crude oil prices and improved recommendations on both sides of the Atlantic prompted heavy buying of the oil majors, and specifically BP. In the US, Salomon Brothers moved to a buy from a hold stance on BP. The house was responding to the decision by Opec to freeze oil production, rather than increase it as had been feared. In the UK, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, which has taken a strong dislike to the stock for some time, conceded that it would see 'a strong short-term rally'. However, Strauss oils analyst Mr John Toalster said he was making no fundamental change to his bearish attitude. The Opec decision prompted an immediate rise in the price of Brent crude, which topped Dollars 20 a barrel for the first time since the end of November and contributed to higher prices for oil company shares. BP jumped 10 to 272p with 22m shares traded. It was also very strong in the US, with 1.1m American Depositary Receipts changing hands, the equivalent of more than 13m shares, by the time London closed. Meanwhile, Shell, considered the quality stock of the sector, climbed 13 to 520p on turnover of 4.7m shares. Oil exploration company Lasmo was the strongest performer of the FT-SE 100 constituents, rising on higher crude oil prices and news that it expects to receive Dollars 30m (Pounds 16.9m) more than previously hoped from the public offering of Canadian and US assets acquired through its takeover bid for Ultramar. Lasmo shares moved ahead 8 to 207p. Also, Lasmo director Mr Norman Davidson Kelly announced that the company had decided to get rid of its downstream assets from the Ultramar acquisition by way of an initial public offering which was expected to be completed by the end of June. Weekend press reports that British Gas is carrying out a strategic review of its operations which might lead to the company being split up boosted its shares in pre-market trading. The stock opened 11 1/2 up and then drifted back with the market to close 6 1/2 ahead at 257p as analysts spoke to the company and decided that the story was based on City speculation. Strauss Turnbull said the story reminded people that the share price undervalued the company, but County NatWest advised clients to sell into strength, arguing that Gas contained no 'significant hidden value'. Exploration Company of Louisiana jumped 16 to 88p on further consideration of an announcement at the end of last week about prospects for the East Riceville field in South Louisiana. Mr Tony Alves of ExCo Louisiana's UK broker Henderson Crosthwaite said initial tests suggested that the field could add 100p a share to the company's present net asset value of 60p. Take profits advice from a number of securities houses and worries about increased oil/fuel prices saw British Airways fall 7 to 307p. One of the houses, Kleinwort Benson, said all BA's recent good news was now in the price and an 'uncertain economic background, increased competition and continuing weak premium traffic' in the coming year meant little upside in the price. There was more trouble for Eurotunnel as the chairman of French contractor Bouygues said talks to compensate the builders were deadlocked and added: 'We cannot rule out that Eurotunnel might go bankrupt.' The group's shares were steady at 370p. Mountleigh's demise failed to have a dramatic effect on the property sector, the receivership having been widely expected in the market. Only Speyhawk, a developer also in acute financial straits, retreated on reflection, dropping 4 to 9 1/2 p. However, selected banks suffered on worries over their exposure to Mountleigh. Barclays fell 9 to 383p, NatWest 7 to 354p and TSB 6 1/2 to 144p. The worst kept secret in the leisure sector, that Forte is close to selling its catering subsidiary Gardner Merchant, was still being denied by the hotel group at its agm yesterday. However, analysts said the uncertainty was affecting the shares, which declined 3 to 236p, with returning talk that Forte will need a rights issue if it fails to make a disposal. Dealers suspected a possible switch as leading supermarket chain Argyll Group gained 3 to 349p while Tesco lost 4 to 263p in an otherwise thin sector. Goldman Sachs was particularly keen on Argyll, in spite of market disappointment at recent results, noting that its Safeway subsidiary is the second most profitable food retailer in the UK.

The Israeli  prime minister is particularly counting on their aid to secure  the lifting of the Arab boycott. Addressing the Parliamentary  Assembly of the Council of Europe, he gave a positive account of  the Israeli-Arab negotiations and in particular welcomed the  "progress" achieved with the Syrians. He tempered this optimism  in an interview to LIBERATION.    [LIBERATION] You have said several times that 1994 will be  decisive for the Near East. Decisive for a lasting and  comprehensive peace?    [Rabin] I hope so. I am not saying that we will be able to  achieve peace with all the partners in the negotiations --  Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinians -- before the end  of the year. But if we succeed in implementing the agreement  which we have reached with the PLO, even if we only implement  its first phase, I think that we will have reached the point of  no return. The same remark is valid for the negotiations with  Syria. But, on this point, unless a basic agreement is reached  on the essential problems in 1994, we have reason to fear that  it will then be too late.    [LIBERATION] Are you optimistic?    [Rabin] It is not a question of being optimistic or  pessimistic. If we really make progress with the Palestinians  and Syria, then the other questions -- Lebanon and Jordan --  will be resolved without any major problem. We have no  territorial problem with those countries, and there is no  fundamental obstacle to reaching peace with them. But those two  countries cannot open the way.    [LIBERATION] Many obstacles have arisen in your negotiations  with the PLO which have delayed the implementation of the  agreement signed in Washington. Will they be overcome in the  near future?    [Rabin] The real problem stems from a difference in approach  between Yasir 'Arafat and us. I told him during our long  conversation in Cairo on 12 December that it was perhaps a  mistake not to have taken the time to discuss the significance  of the document which we signed. It all stems from that. He  thinks, and his viewpoint is understandable, that the first  phase of the interim Gaza-Jericho agreement is already a step  toward an independent Palestinian state. The declaration in  principle clearly specifies that the discussion on the final  status (of the occupied territories) will start at the latest in  the two years following the completion of the implementation of  the Gaza-Jericho agreement. These are not symbolic issues. I am  not talking about flags, I am talking about a Palestinian  currency, control of international borders, or other aspects  which form a practical part of the notion of an independent  state. They tell us that these are matters of dignity. We  respect their dignity. But we do not confuse dignity and  sovereignty and, at this stage, we cannot agree to introduce  elements which affect sovereignty.    [LIBERATION] Which elements, for instance?    [Rabin] There are three fundamental problems which may seem  minor but which, for us, are not minor. Yasir 'Arafat is  demanding the presence of Palestinian police on the bridge  (Allenby bridge, the crossing point between Jordan and the West  Bank). We agree, but we want to be able to interrogate, out of  their presence, any person, foreigner or Palestinian, who  crosses the bridge and who, we think, could present a threat to  our security. The two sides already have a right of veto. But  that is not enough to prevent anybody from crossing the border.  We want to be able to check whether our suspicions are founded  or not. Second, the question of the area of the autonomous  region of Jericho has not been resolved.    Third, they (the Palestinians) want to control a road  between  Jericho and the (Allenby) bridge. We agree that any Palestinian  who has crossed the border should be able to go to Jericho  without having his identity checked by an Israeli. But they  want a new road built, and we do not understand what the purpose  of that is. The safety of travel will remain our responsibility  outside the areas which will be under the Palestinians'  authority.    [LIBERATION] Would it be possible to envisage a Palestinian  border post without the visible presence of Israeli soldiers?    [Rabin] The declaration in principle clearly states that  Israel is responsible for external security. It makes reference  to the crossing points and talks clearly of coordination. We  accept the presence of Palestinians to deal with the  Palestinians. But we want to be sure that no terrorist crosses  the border and that a quarter of a million more Palestinians do  not come and settle on the West Bank.    [LIBERATION] Is it possible, despite everything, to think  that the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Gaza and Jericho  will be achieved on 13 April, as planned, or will there be  further delays?    [Rabin] It is preferable to devote more time to clarifying  everything which can be clarified to avoid conflicts and  misunderstandings later. Once an agreement has been reached --  an agreement which does not give rise to differences of  interpretation -- the implementation will be all the quicker.  There are no sacrosanct dates.    Each phase must be negotiated, as stipulated in the  Declaration of Principles. This is not the same thing as  negotiating with the three neighboring states and with the PLO.  In the first case, once a peace agreement has been achieved,  each will be within its borders. With the Palestinians, we must  achieve peaceful coexistence among two entities whose past  history has shown that they do not have much liking for each  other and which, moreover, are closely intertwined. The risks  of friction are so high that we must define everything in the  finest detail. Who will be responsible for what? What will be  the instruments of cooperation and coordination between us? If  we do not answer those questions, there will be general chaos.    [LIBERATION] Are you not afraid that the delays in the  implementation of the agreement might encourage the  oppositionists in the two camps?    [Rabin] I will not deny that these delays reduce the support  for the agreement both among the Palestinians and the Israelis.  The Hamas extremists are determined to step up terrorism,  hoping to strengthen the Israelis' reactions of rejection. The  same thing applies with regard to the PLO and the Palestinians  who approve of the agreement. But I think that as soon as we  put the agreement into practice, we will overcome the current  problems.    [LIBERATION] After the meeting in Geneva between Hafiz  al-Asad and Bill Clinton, can we expect rapid progress in your  negotiations with Syria?    [Rabin] I hope so. But it is important to understand the  problem. In a democracy like Israel, it is impossible to solve  a crucial problem without the assent of public opinion, at least  the majority of public opinion. Remember the peace agreement  with Egypt. It was possible because President al-Sadat,  visiting Jerusalem, convinced the Israelis of his peaceful  intentions by his speech to the Knesset. He thus wiped away the  hatred and suspicion built up over 28 years of conflict.  President al-Asad has not come 2 percent of the way traveled by  President al-Sadat to win over Israeli public opinion. When,  during the Geneva news conference, an American journalist  questioned President al-Asad about the meaning he gave to the  word "peace," he allowed Bill Clinton to answer for him.    [LIBERATION] Do you hope that Hafiz al-Asad will be able to  follow President al-Sadat's example?    [Rabin] I do not expect him to do so. But, at some stage,  the two countries' foreign ministers will have to meet. We have  asked for there to be discreet preliminary talks at a relatively  high level. Following his recent visit to Damascus, U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced to us that the  Syrian president had accepted our proposal. What has he in fact  done? He has appointed the head of the Syrian delegation --  Deputy Foreign Minister Ambassador al-'Allaf.    [LIBERATION] You have announced that you want to put any  agreement with Syria to a referendum. Can you tell us more  about that?    [Rabin] The question of whether or not to make peace with  Syria is a crucial problem, as is accepting a major withdrawal  from the Golan Heights. There must be no misunderstanding or  opposition on this subject. I think that the best thing is to  allow the people to decide. All stable democracies hold  referendums on major issues. Why should Israel not do so on a  subject which is even more vital, not only for its prosperity  but for its security?    [LIBERATION] Why not hold a referendum on the whole peace  process, as your opposition is demanding?    [Rabin] Peace with Syria and the loss of most of the Golan  Heights are much more important questions than peace with  Lebanon or Jordan, which does not involve any territorial  problem and does not affect the borders. With regard to  Palestinian autonomy, I think I have a mandate from the voters.    [LIBERATION] What will happen if the answer is no?    [Rabin] I do not want to answer hypothetical questions. I  think that the Israeli people want peace. Of course, I cannot  be absolutely certain of the result. But we first need clear  indications about what peace means for Syria, what the  territorial price is, what the security arrangements will be,  the timetable for withdrawal, the link between peace and this  withdrawal, and so forth. I will then be able to ask the  question: Are you in favor of this peace agreement? And the  answer can only be yes or no.    [LIBERATION] In your recent statements, you seem to give  real credence to President al-Asad. Why?    [Rabin] Hafiz al-Asad has two faces. On the one hand, he  encourages -- especially since the agreement with the PLO was  signed -- the terrorism of the 10 Palestinian organizations  opposed to the agreement which have their headquarters in  Damascus, and the terrorism of Hizballah in Lebanon. At least  he does nothing to end it. But we also know that Hafiz al-Asad  keeps his word. The respecting of the agreement on withdrawal  from the Golan Heights signed with Syria in May 1974 is evidence  of that.    [LIBERATION] In domestic political terms, do you nonetheless  think you can pursue the two negotiations with the PLO and Syria  at the same time?    [Rabin] In the parliamentary sphere, there is no doubt that  I only have a majority of one seat. But while I have the  majority, I am determined to go ahead. By announcing the use of  the referendum on the question of peace with Syria, I think I  have increased the chances of being able to advance on the two  fronts.    [LIBERATION] Are we to understand that your decision to hold  the referendum is definite?    [Rabin] Undoubtedly. We need a specific law, because the  use of the referendum is not a provision which exists in Israel.  When we have achieved the kind of agreement which the  government, or the majority of the cabinet, can propose for the  people's approval, we will refer this matter to the Knesset.</p>

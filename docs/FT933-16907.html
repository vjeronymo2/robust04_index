			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Ratners cuts losses and picks new name RATNERS, the jewellery retailer, which last November lost Mr Gerald Ratner, its one-time chairman and chief executive, yesterday reported reduced losses and a two-year refinancing agreement with its banks. It also announced it was changing the company name - but not the shops  - to Signet Group. However, Mr James McAdam, chairman, said that trials of new formats for some Ratners stores would include experiments with different names. The group blamed the weak economic environment for its failure to meet sales and profit targets in the year to January. In the US, better second half trading had caught Ratners short of stock and with some uncompetitive pricing. Mr McAdam said that another 54 shops would be closed in addition to the 330 already announced. Cost savings of Pounds 51m had been made during the year and stock cut by Pounds 84m. Gross margins had risen from 51.9 to 57.2 per cent, mainly because of lower levels of discounting in the UK. The figures were in line with forecasts made in January, after the all-important Christmas period. Group sales fell 17.7 per cent from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 928.6m. Thanks to cost cutting and higher margins, operating profits from continuing businesses rose from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 6.2m. UK losses fell from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 14.5m, while profits in the US advanced from Pounds 18m to Pounds 20.7m. Interest charges were Pounds 32.4m, up from Pounds 27.2m. Exceptional losses were cut from Pounds 98m to Pounds 18m, which included a Pounds 14m provision for additional shop closures. This left pre-tax losses at Pounds 40.1m, down from Pounds 122.3m. With much of group borrowings denominated in dollars, sterling's weakness helped push debt up from Pounds 223.2m to Pounds 287.9m. Operations generated cash of Pounds 83.6m. Mr McAdam said this 'very positive underlying cashflow' should allow Ratners to start paying down debt. Shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 302.6m to Pounds 256.6m. Arrears on preference shares went up from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 30.3m. Mr McAdam said that before the group could consider a capital restructuring, 'the first thing to do is get the trading line right'. Ratners shares rose 3p to 35 1/2 p and are up from a low of 11p this year. Observer, Page 23</p>

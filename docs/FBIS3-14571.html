			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry has  said that, according to the report prepared by the fact-finding  team, the reason why our country's C-130 aircraft crashed in the  Karabakh region was the forced alteration of its flight path,  the lack of air traffic assistance and guidance from the  region's control towers, and the impact of a missile fired by  the Armenian forces stationed in the Karabakh region.    The Foreign Ministry, while reserving the right for the  Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue the downing of the aircraft  through legal and judicial means and to seek compensation for  the victims, has called on the Armenian Government to identify  and punish the perpetrators of this painful incident.</p>

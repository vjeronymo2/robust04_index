			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 11 Jan (MENA)--Chinese State Council Premier  Li Peng has expressed his support for President Husni Mubarak's  call for declaring the Middle East a zone free of weapons, mass  destruction and especially nuclear weapons. He said China was  the lead country among the five nuclear powers to commit itself  to not being first to use nuclear weapons.    In a newspaper interview published in AL-AHRAM today, Li  Peng  welcomed the recent progress in the Arab-Israeli talks,  describing it as a good beginning to settle the Arab-Israeli  conflict. But the Chinese premier said a real settlement of the  conflict requires both sides to keep trying to overcome the  various obstacles until permanent peace is achieved.    Li Peng said he believed the end of the Cold War has not  brought people security and reassurance. He said the developing  countries' economic suffering has increased and regional  conflicts have continued. He noted that peace and  development--two basic issues in our age--have not seen the  light of solution.    Li Peng said China, itself a developing country, considers  good relations with the developing countries a mainstay of its  foreign policy. China expresses its great sympathy with the  plight of the developing countries.    On the march of development in China, Li Peng noted that his  country has recorded a high annual growth rate of 8.9 percent.  Gross national product increased 12.8 percent in 1992 on the  figure for 1991. Grain production reached 450 million tons.    Li Peng said his country encourages foreign investors as  part  of its socialist market economy. He explained that over 50,000  establishments with an investment of $50 billion dollars were  operating in China by the end of September 1993. Their  participation in industrial production amounts to 6 percent of  total production and 20 percent of China's total exports.</p>

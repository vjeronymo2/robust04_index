			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> SHRINERS HOSPITAL TO MOVE TO SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children, a San Francisco landmark for 67 years,  will close and move to a new, $65-million hospital in Sacramento in 1993.  There's been no discussions about the future of the 48-bed facility on 4.7  acres in the Sunset District or how many of the 200 staff members might move to  the state capital, a hospital spokesman said.  </P> <P> Shriners officials said they saw no indication that the annual East-West Shrine  college football game would be moved from Stanford University. The fraternal  and charitable organization, which operates 22 hospitals offering free medical  care, plans to build its new, 80-bed pediatric hospital on 4.8 acres at UC  Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. The new hospital would be the first in the  Shriners' system to treat under one roof children with spinal-cord injuries,  orthopedic problems and burns.  </P></p>

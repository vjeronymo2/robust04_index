			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank Sometimes Mr Brian Pitman of Lloyds Bank sounds more like a retailer than Britain's foremost clearing banker. At a Hoare Govett seminar last week, he was at pains to stress the scope for using the bank's distribution network to increase return. The bank does not need to confine itself to distributing its own financial products. There is nothing wrong in selling those manufactured by others. Nothing could be further from the old-fashioned idea that banks grow rich by expanding their loan book. Indeed, Mr Pitman believes high capital requirements are a useful way of preventing them falling into this trap. But he also believes in high targets for return on capital. The trouble is that these aims can become contradictory. The activities of the future are those, like private banking, which absorb little capital. But the more successful Lloyds becomes with this approach, the more retained earnings will swell its capital, putting the return targets out of reach. The natural response would be to expand by acquisition if a target could be found at the right price. If not, consistency will require Mr Pitman to give surplus capital back to shareholders.</p>

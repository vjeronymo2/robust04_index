			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Dolidze report: "Georgian Watergate"] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi -- The furor concerning accusations that  Shevardnadze has been using the state apparatus to form his own  party is coming to a head.    The parliamentary deputies who are members of Shevardnadze's  party, which is called the Union of Citizens of Georgia, have  come under sharp criticism from retired Prime Minister Tengiz  Sigua, who has accused Shevardnadze of abusing his official  position for political ends, stating that "it is immoral for  someone in the leadership to create his own political force."    Sigua said that he has documents which show that the head of  the Georgian state apparatus is taking part in the creation of  regional sections of the Union of Citizens. In response,  Shevardnadze called the former premier a liar, stating that if  "the protocols of the elders of the Union of Citizens confirm  the apparatus' involvement in setting up regional party  organizations, the head of the republic will have sufficient  conscience not to enter parliament again."    Meanwhile, Sigua's accusations have been borne out in part,  as it is not Shevardnadze's actual signature but a facsimile  which figures at the bottom of one of the December protocols of  proceedings where the creation of regional party branches is  indeed entrusted to the deputy head of Shevardnadze's apparatus.    The head of state should be given his due -- he raised the  question of setting up a parliamentary commission with extensive  opposition representation which will study all the circumstances  of the affair and then deliver its verdict. The decision on the  makeup of the commission will be made at an emergency session of  parliament.    A furor is thus shaping up. The setting up of a  parliamentary commission is, as Shevardnadze asserts, essential  if the participation of the apparatus of the state leader in  purely party affairs is not to set a precedent in Georgia for  the future. One parliamentary opposition leader who enjoys  great respect, the Republican Ivlian Khaindrava, has dubbed the  event the "Georgian Watergate."</p>

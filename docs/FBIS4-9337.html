			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with General Major Zdenek Zezula, chief of the </F> Civil Defense Authority, by Ladislav Lenk; place and date not  given: "Life Is a Series of Somersaults"]    [Text] Under the previous regime, civil defense was  an unbelievably complex and thoroughly organized institution  that, on the basis of its composition and principles of  functioning, was more reminiscent of a kind of territorial  defense army or home guard--which was not exactly in harmony  with the Geneva protocols. But, with the birth of the Czech  state, even civil defense is getting a totally new look. We  spoke of this with General Major Zdenek Zezula, engineer, who  was put in charge of the Czech Republic Civil Defense Authority  midway through last year.    [Lenk] Government Resolution No. 126 decided to radically  change the civil defense system. Can you comment on the changes?    [Zezula] Government Resolution No. 126 was adopted in March  of last year and, in the months that followed, some portions of  the resolution were fulfilled. However, that cannot be said of  the task that called for working out a new concept of civil  defense by 30 June. The concept was such that the minister  characterized it as casting the existing status in concrete for  an additional two to three years. That is why, when I took on  the job on 1 July, I first had to answer the question where  civil defense would belong at all. Was it to be part of the  Ministry of Defense or the Ministry of Interior, or would it be  a totally independent ministry? Following intensive  negotiations, the view finally arrived at indicated that it  would perhaps not be suitable for civil defense to currently  leave the Ministry of Defense. But it would have to be created  as a completely autonomous system so that, in the future, on the  basis of political decisions, it could be transferred elsewhere  at any time. That is what we based our subsequent work on when  we proposed to the minister that certain steps be taken and when  he accepted these proposals. One of the first and fundamental  steps was the requirement that the military aspect of civil  defense, which cast doubt upon the position of civil defense in  the eyes of foreign countries--that is to say, the fact that  military rescue regiments were subordinated to the General  Staff--had to be changed very rapidly.    [Lenk] It is precisely this that was probably in conflict  with the Geneva protocols....    [Zezula] You are right. It was a legacy of the previous  developments and the mission of civil defense at the time. It  was therefore decided that the transition would be accomplished  as of 31 December 1993. And this was successfully done. To take  over regiments is one thing, but to do it in such a manner that  the regiments would not recognize the fact that someone else was  in command, particularly from the standpoint of their material,  financial, and other support, was a matter that, at that time,  literally kept me awake every night. Suffice it to say that we  had to actually create an entire logistics system at the same  time that, in the final analysis, must be capable of taking care  of not only the regiments, but also the entire nonmilitary  portion of the civil defense system.    [Lenk] How did the mission of the regiments change on the  basis of their altered subordination?    [Zezula] Basically, the mission did not change. The  regiments  are perceived as central forces and resources of civil defense  that should be used if local regional nonmilitary portions of  the civil defense system prove unable to liquidate the  consequences of disasters, catastrophes, and other extraordinary  events in times of peace.    [Lenk] I am coming to the nonmilitary civil defense  components. What kind of fundamental changes will they undergo?    [Zezula] I would say that it involved, speaking  symbolically,  yet another somersault. And it was much worse. Initial work on  the project began sometime last year, in the spring, when the  civil defense leadership promised the heads of okres offices  that okres civil defense staffs would be done away with. I  learned of it while mapping out the situation sometime in  mid-August, and I was horrified to find out what was being done  in that regard and what the views were as to how the system  should function at all in the future. Moreover, there was a  decision that the steps would have to be accomplished by 31  December. But we managed it. In August, the appropriate  materials were dispatched to the government, and then in  September the materials were forwarded to the Defense Council of  the state. The council recommended that the material be  finalized, and, in November, Government Resolution No. 660 made  the change possible. It was a fairly stressful situation because  we had to eliminate the okres civil defense staff order of  battle as early as September so that we could let people go  within the time limits stipulated by law.    [Lenk] In place of the civil defense staffs, there are  sections for the protection of the population at okres offices  and municipal offices. What will they be doing?    [Zezula] Essentially the same as the okres civil defense  staffs were doing.    [Lenk] You have in mind the building of shelters, the  creation of stockpiles, training...    [Zezula] Yes, perhaps even that. But the whole problem lies  elsewhere. What is involved here is the fact that, although the  chief of an okres office has the responsibility for civil  defense, he had no one in his office to solve such problems. The  civil defense staffs stood outside, and relationships were  highly complex. So it was said that, if the chief of the okres  office is responsible, let him have someone subordinate to him  who can work on these matters.    [Lenk] But, in this case, there can be no military  personnel.    [Zezula] No, the sections for the protection of the  population will actually not have a single soldier.    [Lenk] And what will the relationship be between your office  and those sections?    [Zezula] We shall direct them methodologically. That is  because their mission will in fact be identical with that of the  civil defense staff, which functioned here until now. There is  an entire scale of functions--communication, warning, protecting  the population, training, maintenance, etc.    [Lenk] So you would like to say that those "popular" alerts  at factories and offices and in schools, where, as the saying  goes, there were monthly idiotic actions involving gas masks,  will continue?    [Zezula] You know, perhaps you will not believe what I am  about to say to you, but I have received material from the  United Nations having to do with requirements for the civil  defense of the population, and, if we were to conduct ourselves  in accordance with this material, we should have to expressly  intensify our activities.    [Lenk] What kind of threat is there anyway? Military,  civilian, some other kind?    [Zezula] Of course, also military threats. But civil defense  today, as can be seen from the supplemental protocols  accompanying the Geneva Agreements, is something altogether  different. Briefly stated, what is involved is that civil  defense be capable of making maximum use of its resources to  benefit the population in times of peace--that is to say, in the  case of disasters, catastrophes, etc. So that you should  understand what I am saying, this is precisely the kind of  activity that was perceived by the former civil defense system  as an odd job. And there is absolutely no reason why our  resources should not be utilized in peacetime.    [Lenk] What then is ahead for civil defense this year?    [Zezula] First of all, we are working on the Civil Defense  Law, the principles of which should be presented to the  government sometime in the fall of this year. At the same time,  work is going on regarding the concept of civil defense; at the  present time, interministerial estimating procedures are under  way. The concept is to be presented to the government for  discussion in the first quarter of this year.    [Lenk] Will the Civil Defense Authority be scheduled for  transfer out of the Ministry of Defense, after all?    [Zezula] For the next two to three years, the situation is  unequivocally given, which was also stated by the chairman of  the Defense and Security Committee in parliament: The system of  civil defense must be created within the framework of the  Ministry of Defense but as an autonomous system. That is, thus,  our principal task. We are even initiating the reorganization of  regiments into rescue formations; that is what they will now be  called. We are moving the regiment from Varnsdorf to Rakovnik  because it is supposed to be involved in protecting the  population of western and northwestern Bohemia and cannot get  there at all from Varnsdorf in the winter. We are also resolving  the problem of identifying the military portions of civil  defense so that it would be clear that this is not an army--we  will have different uniforms with our own emblem on them. So  much for the military component of the civil defense system. The  nonmilitary component is faced with a complicated task--the  activity involving the separation of the civil defense functions  from okres offices must be started, which means that, for  example, we shall have to train all those people who entered the  system at the okres level.</p>

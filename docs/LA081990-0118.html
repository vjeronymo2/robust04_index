			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOISE ON THE HOME FRONT  </P> <P> The building of a commercial airport on the Marine base at Pendleton or making  El Toro a joint commercial/military field does not make sense.  </P> <P> But a better alternative is available. Build a new military airfield at  Pendleton and move the El Toro jets to that location. Also included should be  the nearby Marine helicopter base. Most of the activities of these two groups  are involved with exercises at Pendleton. This would save the Marines time and  fuel costs.  </P> <P> J.D. TRYON  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

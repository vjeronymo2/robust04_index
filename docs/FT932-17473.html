			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Bundesbank makes further small cut in the repo rate THE Bundesbank yesterday eased monetary policy for the first time in the two weeks since it reduced the key discount rate by half a percentage point to 7.5 per cent. It made a modest cut in the rate at which it offers wholesale funds to the country's banking system ahead of today's meeting of the Bundesbank policy-making council. The German central bank cut the securities repurchase - or repo rate - to 8.17 per cent from 8.25 per cent, awakening some speculation that the Bundesbank could announce further cuts in its 'official' Lombard and discount rates after today's meeting. However, analysts were inclined to see the step as part of the Bundesbank's gradualist approach to easing rates rather than as a harbinger of further, substantial cuts in the official rates in the short term. This is the first time the repo rate has been reduced since March 6 when the repo rate was trimmed from 8.49 per cent. The Bundesbank has recently repeated its determination to maintain its battle against inflation - currently 4.3 per cent in western Germany - and to preserve the value of the D-Mark. But at the same time the economic situation in Germany is deteriorating rapidly, making further easing desirable for domestic reasons. Economists say the policy of gradual easing in the repo rate allows the Bundesbank to introduce cuts in rates while still maintaining its vigilant stance against inflation. Belgium yesterday cut key interest rates and financial markets rallied after the government agreed a package which will reduce the budget deficit and haul the country out of a week-old political crisis, Reuter reports from Brussels. The central bank's central rate was lowered to 8.2 per cent from 8.5 per cent and its end-of-day rate to 9.2 per cent from 10 per cent. Its emergency lending rate was lowered to 10 per cent from 12.5 per cent.</p>

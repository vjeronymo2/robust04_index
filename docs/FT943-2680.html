			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Flying solo in turbulent air - Simon Walsh meets a City escapee whose dream has taken some nightmarish twists 'I can remember arriving back at work on Monday morning after a weekend's parachuting, going back to jump that evening, jumping again on the Tuesday morning and still being back behind my desk by 9am.' Erstwhile foreign exchange dealer David Parker recalls how in 1976 he found that life on the Square Mile was good, but not good enough. 'I was getting by in the foreign exchange market and I was enjoying it, but I didn't feel I was going anywhere, and I didn't fancy spending the rest of my life as a passed over foreign exchange dealer rattling into Bank tube station five days a week. 'The obvious solution was to set up in sport parachuting. At that time most clubs were informal groups getting together and pooling re-sources. 'I thought there would be room for a seven-day-a-week sport parachuting centre, working as a fully commercial operation. 'I wrote to 30 such groups asking if they liked the idea of going full time on a commercial basis.' Among the groups to respond was one based on Headcorn Aerodrome in Kent. He liked the location: 'Probably one of the most densely populated areas in the UK, with Greater London and the South East for a catchment area; and at that time there was little competition.' The Headcorn Parachute Club began trading in 1979 on capital of Pounds 5,000. There was no shortage of weekend adventurers willing to hand over good money to let go of a Cessna 206 at 2,000ft. The problem was how to make a profit from the cost-intensive business of flying an aircraft, and hiring a space at the airfield while keeping prices within reach of the market. 'It's an equation which is really quite difficult to unravel. We would lose quite significantly on experienced jumpers going to altitude - 10,000ft or over, while we would make money on the loads of students jumping from 2,000ft, as they would be paying more money for less time in the aircraft. 'The mainstay of our revenue has always been the student jumps and it still is. However we do not now make the losses that we used to make, even on a percentage basis - because we have bigger aircraft, have become more efficient, and prices have caught up somewhat. 'The cost of running our Britain Islander Aircraft is Pounds 250 per hour at break even. We charge Pounds 14 a head for an altitude lift of nine people so that generates an income of Pounds 126. We can do two of those in an hour. 'If we put seven students in, each paying Pounds 20 we have an income of Pounds 175 and it only takes 15 minutes, so you have a potential to earn Pounds 700 per hour, which is a good profit. 'However, if you have winds under 10mph, you will be taking up students. Over 10mph and you can take only experienced jumpers. 'You cannot run an exclusively student-oriented operation because you would never have enough instructors, and if you did you would never progress into a fully-fledged parachute centre.' David formed two further companies, Slipstream Adventures to provide 'Accelerated Freefall', an advanced form of training that allows beginners to experience freefall on their first jump, and the Kit Store to market parachutes and related equipment. The Kit Store, says David, has a steady turnover of Pounds 120,000 a year. 'Most of the profit goes in management fees. But the income I do get is income I don't have to work for at all, and there's not a lot of capital tied up in it. It's just set up, and more or less runs itself.' In April of 1988 David invested in a turbo prop aircraft, expensive to buy, but cheaper to run, and with a much longer working life. In March of 1989 the aircraft was taxying when a parachutist, in the final stages of descent, collided with one of the propellers and was killed. The parachutist was Tania Pond, David's fiancee. 'It was the most devastating experience of my life. It took me a long time before I could come back here and fulfil any useful role. I would just come in, sign the cheques and go away again. 'I certainly started drinking a lot. But I am not aware of it having left any long term scars. 'Of course it's always there and always will be there, but time is a great healer, life must go on, and you cannot go on in grief for the rest of your life.' He lost the aircraft, and what was to follow would lend precious little comfort. 'I borrowed Pounds 190,000 from a finance company in 1988 to purchase the Turbine Islander. 'When we had the accident it left us with a repair bill in excess of Pounds 100,000. which we took out of cashflow. Then the Aircraft hull insurers refused to pay up, as did the parachutist's third party insurers. 'The net result of that was having put Pounds 100,000 into repairing the aircraft, I could no longer afford to maintain it. 'I asked the finance company to repossess the aircraft. They repossessed it, but have done nothing with it, it's just been left sitting here. 'They're now saying they've lent this money and want it back with interest. I'm saying the aircraft was worth at least Pounds 200,000 when they repossessed it, but is now a rusting hulk, and that they should have sold it when they took possession, used it constructively, or at least looked after it properly. 'Up till now we were just writing letters to each other, but I found out recently that now they are going to sue my companies and me personally. We will obviously fight it with everything we've got.' Last year, figures for two of the three companies dipped. Headcorn Parachute Club lost Pounds 31,000 on turnover of Pounds 286,000 against a 1992 profit of Pounds 65,000 on turnover of Pounds 337,000 in 1992. Slipstream made just Pounds 800 on turnover of Pounds 59,000, down from Pounds 15,000 profit on Pounds 88,000 turnover the year before. Parker expects Headcorn to move back into profit this year. He says he refuses to be beaten. 'Running a full-time parachute centre is not so much a business venture, more a vocation requiring business acumen. You are working without respite, no break whatsoever. What brings you through is your love of the sport. 'Yes, we are riding some extremely rough waters right now, but no, we are not on the rocks.'

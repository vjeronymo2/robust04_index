			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (2): Ten steps forward, 11 back - Economic Development AN ECONOMIC developer's nightmare is about to come true in West Cumbria. The recession, coupled with the next round of job losses at British Nuclear Fuels (BNF), will by next March have wiped out the same number of jobs as those created by various vigorous initiatives in the past 10 years. Jobs lost, or about to be, since the recession began in 1990 include 350 at Cumberland Clothing, 35 at Cumberland Leisure, 80 at Design Fabrique, 150 at Supamoor, 450 at Volvo Buses - which is moving to Scotland - 130 at Davy Distington and 500 at Miller's Footwear. Mr Tony Winterbottom, chief executive of the West Cumbria Development Agency (WCDA), says: 'We reckon on having helped generate about 4,000 new jobs in the last 10 years. Apart from the bigger recent closures caused by recession, about 1,000 more jobs have been lost in a range of smaller businesses. We still have a net gain of about 1,000 jobs, but Sellafield's redundancies will wipe those out.' BNF is shedding jobs, now that construction of its thermal oxide reprocessing plant is complete. It will be West Cumbria's third dose of large-scale structural unemployment since 1982, when steel industry closures caused the first shock, pushing up unemployment to 23 per cent. This was followed by the end of deep coalmining in Whitehaven in 1985. British Steel Industry (BSI), the job-creation agency and fund-provider set up by British Steel, was soon joined by British Coal Enterprise (BCE), its counterpart for mine-closure areas, in the struggle for economic reconstruction. The locally-named Moss Bay Enterprise Trust - set up in 1982 to help Workington - became the basis for Enterprise West Cumbria in 1985, expanding to include Whitehaven. In 1988, BNF joined in to try to ensure the whole area was ready for a succession of Sellafield doses of structural unemployment in the early 1990s. The WCDA succeeded Enterprise West Cumbria, while BNF also established a separate fund to back promising businesses and developments in a similar way to BSI and BCE. Each year the fund gets Pounds 1m a year from BNF and Pounds 50,000 each from Cumbria county and Allerdale and Copeland district councils. It sounds simple, but things have been more complex. The fund and agency have different boards and there has sometimes been disagreement between them on whether projects merit funding. There has also been a sometimes confusing array of parallel or complementary initiatives. There is a Whitehaven Development Company - comprising English Estates, the WCDA and Copeland Borough Council - the government's Cumbria Action Team, and the Rural Development Commission, which is very active in the county. In addition, Cumbria is a member of both the Newcastle-based Northern Development Company and Inward, the north-west's agency. Both are regional agencies for inward investment from abroad and, in the NDC's case, from elsewhere in the UK. They are funded partly by the government's Invest in Britain Bureau. Then there are various other activities of the local authorities. Copeland, for example, is a partner in the Tourist Strategic Development Initiative, not to mention the work of bodies like Voluntary Action Cumbria and the Prince's Trust. On top of this is a Euro-input, since Workington, Whitehaven and Barrow are all eligible for European Commission structural funds. And, of course, there are still BSI and BCE, plus the local training and enterprise council. Money from government since 1982 has totalled about Pounds 55m. This has gone into cleaning derelict sites in Workington, and around its harbour of Maryport, the building of advance factories by English Estates, and regional development grants to help inward investment and expansion. It has, however, helped lever about Pounds 260m from the private sector in inward investment and this has helped to create 4,000 jobs - but as recent events have shown, not all have been secure enough to withstand a deep recession. Mr Ken Dixon, the recently retired personnel director of Alcan's Cumbrian plant, now chairs the WCDA. 'Most of our large companies are foreign-owned and basically branch factories,' he says. 'In hard times, they are more likely to cut the branches and go back to the trunk.' He says a survey of 25 companies employing 6,200 people in the area showed 11 of them controlled from abroad, nine run from elsewhere in the UK and only five with stay-or-go decision making power in Cumbria. The overall position was that 5,000 of the 6,200 jobs were externally controlled, and therefore more vulnerable than locally run - and, usually, owned - businesses during a downturn. Moreover, some inward investors have not been able to make much use of Cumbria's depth of engineering and technological skills. And, part-time feminisation of the workforce in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors has not done much for long-term improvement of the local tax base or spending power. Indeed, Mr Winterbottom thinks the basic structural problem has been disguised by BNF mopping up much male unemployment during its expansion phase, now ending. Mr Laurie Haveron, BSI's chief for northern England, says much future investment needs to be targeted on existing locally-owned businesses to help them improve their management and marketing so they can grow soundly. This is no short-term panacea, however. BSI's own recent investments have put about Pounds 250,000 into 12 projects, but none are big and even those capable of large-scale, job- creating growth, will probably take years to achieve it. Meanwhile, there has been some disquiet among the main fund providers at the plethora of efforts and parochialism. Inward investment policies have been ad hoc and dependent on a sometimes tight availability of factory space. Under political pressure, some funds have gone into propping up ailing companies, postponing but not averting ultimate failure. West Cumbria Development Fund recently asked Professor John Fyfe of consultants WS Atkins to examine the effectiveness of the current structure of economic regeneration bodies. His review has been the subject of lively, but confidential discussions, and will result in modifications to both the fund and the WCDA. The fund and the agency will be merged into a new partnership which will be refocused on areas where it is felt the greatest results can be achieved. Meanwhile, Mr John Hancock, the WCDA's first chairman, is now chairing the Cumbria Marketing Initiative, launched two weeks ago. He is a successful private sector marketeer already, running Sealy beds - Silentnight's thriving upmarket subsidiary - in Aspatria. WCDA has seconded Ms Dawn Quigley as his full-time project director and they are determined to cut through any confusion by establishing a clear image for Cumbria. Mr Hancock avers: 'I think things were fragmented. The marketing initiative is not an organisation. We are a marketing campaign. We don't have a bureaucracy, we are not a quango, and we don't threaten anyone. We shall be trying to avoid looking backwards. If you spend too much time looking over your shoulder you are likely to bump into lampposts.'</p>

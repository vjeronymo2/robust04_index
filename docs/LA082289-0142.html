			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORD OF MOUTH WITH ERIC BURNS;  </P> <P> A DIFFERENT HOLLYWOOD TALK SHOW  </P> <P> They aren't exactly George Will, Sam Donaldson and David Brinkley, and their  show is probably seen by only several people each week, not several million.  But Eric Burns, Richard Schickel, Van Gordon Sauter and Merrill Markoe are out  to stir up the world of entertainment. Or at least make their several viewers  laugh once or twice.  </P> <P> "Word of Mouth With Eric Burns," a half-hour panel-discussion show in the  tradition of such political round-table programs as "This Week With David  Brinkley" and "The McLaughlin Group," airs each weekend on Movietime, the  basic-cable channel known primarily for its 'round-the-clock promos of  Hollywood's latest films and interviews with the stars.  </P> <P> Only this show, which purports to examine the social implications of news and  events from the wide, wide world of entertainment, leaves politics to the big  boys in Washington. Well, mostly.  </P> <P> On a recent episode, the panel ruminated about the infamous Rob Lowe videotape,  in which the actor allegedly had sex with a minor in Atlanta while attending  last year's Democratic National Convention. After airing a segment from the  tabloid magazine show "A Current Affair," which included excerpts from the  video, complete with strategically placed black squares, Burns, the creator and  moderator of the program, asked Schickel, Time magazine's film critic, to  review the movie.  </P> <P> "There's this huge black square covering most of the movie," Schickel said. "I  don't understand that. You wouldn't get more than an R rating for this."  </P> <P> If this is all Lowe has learned about making movies after all his years as an  actor, chimed in Markoe, formerly the producer of "Late Night With David  Letterman" and a columnist for New York Woman magazine, he'll never make the  transition from actor to director. "It's out of focus. He got no coverage, no  reverse shots, no close-ups."  </P> <P> "This is why the Democrats cannot elect a President," interrupted Sauter,  formerly the president of CBS News and a proud Republican. "At these national  conventions, the Republicans are so dreadfully stuffy, all they have to worry  about is getting votes. On the other hand, the Democrats have all these  marvelous convention diversions."  </P> <P> "To slightly revise my critical judgment," Schickel said, "this video is  marginally more interesting than a Republican convention. They might have put a  black box over most of that too."  </P> <P> "Word of Mouth" was born out of Burns' frustration that no one on television  ever talks honestly about popular culture. A former NBC network correspondent  and commentator at "Entertainment Tonight" and KTTV Channel 11, Burns has made  several stabs at critiquing the entertainment business, only to find himself  stymied by the conflicting realities of covering Hollywood seriously on TV.  </P> <P> "My commentaries for 'Entertainment Tonight' lasted about two months until I  did one that really annoyed them," Burns said. "It had to do with the coverage  of the Sean Penn and Madonna wedding, in which my employer was one of the  egregious participants. So I was suddenly switched to celebrity interviewer,  and that just made me more determined to find an outlet to be irreverent -- or  just to be honest."  </P> <P> Burns produced a pilot of "Word of Mouth" last year for KTTV, where his  commentaries on the station's nightly newscast were similarly phased out, but,  he said, the business people at the Fox-owned station decided such a program  would lose money. After leaving KTTV earlier this year, Burns shopped it around  and last April found a home on Movietime, where he could produce it cheaply and  control the content entirely.  </P> <P> Movietime likes the show so much that the company just renewed it for another  26 weeks. But now that HBO has taken over the management of Movietime and has  plans to thoroughly revamp its programming (see accompanying story), the future  of "Word of Mouth" is uncertain.  </P> <P> Until now, Movietime has relied mostly on trailers and celebrity interviews to  fill its 24-hour-a-day coverage of Hollywood. Launched two years ago, it claims  to be available in 14 million homes. But not all of those homes can get the  service all the time. Each installment of "Word of Mouth" airs five times each  weekend (Saturdays at 10:30 a.m., 4 and 7 p.m., Sundays at 8:30 a.m. and 4:30  p.m.), but Burns said that on his cable system he can only watch it once  because the space on the dial is shared with the Jewish Network, preacher Gene  Scott, Fred Sands Realty ads and Iranian programming.  </P> <P> Still, Markoe, Schickel and Sauter all said that in recent weeks people have  been stopping them at parties and on the street to say they caught a glimpse of  the show. And Markoe has adopted the mystical "if you build it, he will come"  sentiment from the film, "Field of Dreams," to explain who does and who doesn't  watch the program. "If you are meant to see this show, by some act of God or  fate or something, you will," she said.  </P> <P> The show is far from slick, and the cast makes jokes about the undisclosed,  picayune stipend they receive from Movietime for appearing each week. But they  put a million dollars worth of acumen, hot air and wit into every topic Burns  throws their way.  </P> <P> They pontificate seriously on the state of Hollywood journalism, concluding  that all reporting on entertainment is just a sorry excuse for celebrity  publicity. They complain about Ringo Starr's attempts to stop the release of an  album he recorded while he was drunk on tequila. They argue the merits of TV  newscasts being used in schools, tabloid television and Diane Sawyer.  </P> <P> And they offer some "brilliant" Hollywood ideas of their own. While decrying  the film industry's use of catchy movie titles to mask dubious story lines,  Markoe pitched this new movie: "Easter -- Who's Risen This Time?" And when  asked to comment on TV newswoman Linda Ellerbee's hawking of Maxwell House  coffee in commercials with Willard Scott, Markoe pulled out a bottle of juice  from behind her chair and said: "I've given this a lot of thought and whenever  I think seriously, I like to drink Mott's Clamato Juice, a deliciously seasoned  blend of clams and tomatoes. It's the one to be drinking when you want to be  thinking." The camera then cut to Schickel and Sauter holding their bellies as  they laughed uproariously.  </P> <P> "It's my Thursday night poker game," Sauter said later, explaining why he shows  up every week. "You come down here. There are people here that I really like.  And we sit around and we sort of belch and scratch and laugh for a couple of  hours and go home. You don't lose a lot of money. You don't make a lot of  money. And it's a good evening."  </P></p>

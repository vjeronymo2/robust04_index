			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Cleaning up 'the world's favourite airline': British Airways' directors meet today to decide on action IF British Airways thought it was back in clear skies after its humiliating High Court libel settlement with Virgin Atlantic, it was mistaken. Its Pounds 610,000 payment and public apology to Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's boss, has not brought the controversy to an end. Instead, its past efforts to discredit and undermine its tiny competitor have continued to attract public attention. So far, though BA's reputation has been harmed, its business has suffered little damage. But the airline knows that unless its board acts promptly, there is a risk the affair could spiral out of control. The airline's directors will gather today. Mr Charles Price, a former US ambassador to Britain and a BA non-executive board member, is flying in from the US. Lord White, a friend of Lord King and chairman of Hanson's US operations, cannot attend because he is ill. At the forefront of directors' minds will be the wave of criticism the airline has faced. Big institutional investors have been privately expressing their doubts about BA's handling of the crisis. More publicly, members of the airline's own staff have been using harsh language to criticise their bosses. In the airline's staff newspaper, some employees wrote last week of 'grave mistakes' in 'an obscene episode', and called for heads to roll. Virgin has skilfully kept up the pressure, claiming some BA passengers have switched to its aircraft as a result of the affair. Mr Branson has given BA a deadline that expires next week to show that it has learnt its lesson. He was dissatisfied with BA's first letter to him, and is still seeking an 'act of good faith' to demonstrate that BA had changed its attitude to competition. BA has since sent a second letter to Mr Branson asking him to outline his thoughts. Unless Mr Branson is satisfied with the outcome, he threatens to drag BA through an anti-trust case in the US. This might hinder BA's renewed efforts to clinch a partnership deal with USAir, the sixth largest US airline. Though the stakes at today's board meeting are high, it is unlikely to lead to sweeping management changes. Some personnel moves appear imminent, but the intention will be to achieve the greatest possible impact from the smallest possible changes among BA's top managers. The key players in BA's boardroom drama include Lord King. He is due to step down as chairman in the summer but still exerts considerable influence on his colleagues. 'He is angry and upset but he is not about to run away crying,' a BA insider said last night. Sir Michael Angus, non-executive deputy chairman, has now emerged as the pivotal figure on the board. Though he was reluctant to become involved when the 'dirty tricks' allegations first surfaced, he has since played a central role in attempts to repair the damage. As a former chairman of Unilever and current president of the Confederation of British Industry, Sir Michael is well-versed on issues of corporate governance. He has already ordered a second internal investigation to establish the full extent of BA's campaign against Virgin. (An earlier report is now thought to have left many issues unresolved.) The new report, prepared by Linklaters &amp; Paines, BA's solicitors, is highly critical of aspects of the 'dirty tricks' campaign. But the 80-page document is also thought to confirm that the campaign was carried out by a few individual employees and did not involve the highest levels of management. Sir Michael has been mooted by some BA insiders as a possible successor to Lord King, at least for an interim period. Under that proposal, Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and the other deputy chairman, would remain as chief executive during what is already being dubbed the 'Angus interregnum'. However, Sir Michael says he is not anxious to become chairman and he has not been asked to do so. He said last night: 'Everything is feasible in an emergency but I don't think it will occur.' The odds, therefore, remain that Sir Colin will become both chairman and chief executive as originally planned, rather than waiting for the expiry of an interim chairmanship held by Sir Michael. Mr Robert Ayling, head of the marketing and operations, is being tipped to assume a newly created position of managing director, bolstering the airline's top management. The most immediate casualties are likely to come in the legal and public relations departments, which handled BA's response to Virgin's complaints of 'dirty tricks'. Mr Brian Basham, an independent public relations consultant hired by BA, has already been dropped by the company. BA is now relying on Sir Tim Bell, former adviser to Lady Thatcher, for public relations advice. The position of Mr David Burnside, BA's head of public affairs, is expected to come under close scrutiny by the directors today. The airline's strategy includes the possible setting up of a compliance committee, formed of non-executives, to draw up and enforce a new code of conduct for the company. The intention of today's meeting is to try to end the 'dirty tricks' saga as quickly as possible - ideally this week. But BA's efforts may yet be frustrated. Though ministers are anxious to keep the government on the sidelines, they may not be able to do so if the issue continues to stay in the headlines. Plenty of other interested parties - ranging from Virgin to European airlines angered by BA's recent acquisitions in the UK and France - are happy to keep it there. British Airways is still some way from clear skies.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- As the board meets, directors ponder how to address ..  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lord King, 75-year-old chairman of BA and architect of the airline's success, will retire as chairman in July and become president  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sir Colin Marshall, deputy chairman and chief executive, is still expected eventually to take over as chairman.

Prudential Assurance and Standard Life are shown as having notifiable stakes of over 3 per cent. Since then at least one shareholder, Fidelity, has disposed of almost its entire position and the Prudential and Standard Life stakes have fallen below 3 per cent  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

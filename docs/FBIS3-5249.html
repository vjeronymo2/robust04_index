They  would turn themselves in as soon as all the felled timber in the  guerrilla-controlled areas had been dragged out by contractors.  "It is expected that all logs will be removed by the end of  March. Then in April they will turn themselves in," he told the  NATION. "This includes three Khmer Rouge leaders and hundreds of  their soldiers."    He declined to name these "leaders", saying only that Ta  Mok,  the one-legged hard-line leader of the guerrilla forces, would  not be among them. He has reportedly abandoned his bases in  Anlung Veng Province and moved to new headquarters at Trapeang  Kul. The source said the three had set conditions for their  surrender, but declined to give details. He said the U.S.  government has agreed to provide army uniforms for guerrillas  who defect to the government forces.    Khmer Rouge representatives in Phnom Penh were not available  for comment.    Defense Minister Tea Chamrat and another high-ranking member  of the government were understood to be due in Bangkok this  weekend to discuss the surrender.</p>

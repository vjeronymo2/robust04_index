In an  exclusive interview Lev Volkov, full member of the International  and Russian Engineering Academies and corresponding member of  the Russian Academy of Sciences, who was involved in drawing up  the program, told IZVESTIYA's military correspondent about its  contents.    Under the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive  Arms, Volkov said, the Strategic Missile Forces, which perform  the role of chief deterrent force, may comprise 1,300 launchers  with single-warhead ICBM's by the set deadline. But the  country's actual economic potential will allow us to possess  just 900 launchers. Which missile is to be chosen for this?    A number of Russian scientific collectives, independent ones  included, have researched possible scenarios for strategic  nuclear forces operations, modeled their dynamics, and come to  the conclusion that the prospective Strategic Missile Forces  grouping must comprise a standardized solid-fuel missile like  the modernized SS-25 ICBM with two basing options: stationary,  in launch silos; and mobile, on self-propelled launchers with a  wheeled chassis.    IZVESTIYA information: The SS-25 ICBM (in Russia it is  called the Topol RS-12M) is considered one of the most  successful off-road mobile missile systems. The missile is made  in Votkinsk. It weighs 45 tonnes and its throw-weight is  equivalent to one tonne. It has been on alert duty in the  Strategic Missile Forces since 1985. The general designer is  Boris Lagutin.    Why has the SS-25 been chosen from among the six existing  types of missiles? In Lev Volkov's opinion, there are several  reasons for this. First, it uses solid fuel, which is safe in  operation, and this in itself provides a substantial gain.  Second, it is very economical. Given our infrastructure of  existing and possible position areas, the road network in them,  special geological features, the cost of capital construction,  and the availability of housing for officers and their families,  such a missile will be most affordable.    At the same time the optimum ratio of stationary and mobile  missile systems has also been established: 60-70 to 40-30.    Specialists proceeded from an assessment of their combat  efficiency and cost. It transpired that the average expenditure  per warhead whose delivery to target can be guaranteed is for  mobile-based single-warhead missiles practically coincident with  the expenditure for stationary launchers with the now accepted  degree of protection. If the silos' degree of protection is  increased, their cost could end up almost twice that of mobile  systems.    Incidentally, Lev Volkov said, it is known that there have  been eight disasters involving the operation of nuclear-powered  submarines with nuclear missiles on board in the naval strategic  nuclear forces of our country and the United States. Nuclear  munitions have been lost and people have died. There have been  similar occurrences with aircraft, but God has spared the  Strategic Missile Forces. According to specialists'  calculations, the probability of an incident involving a mobile  launcher is estimated at one in 100,000 in the course of a year;  that is, if 500 SPU's [self-propelled launchers] are operated  for 10 years, there could be a 5-percent probability of an  incident involving one of them.    In industry such a probability is considered safe.    I asked Lev Ivanovich why the Americans abandoned the  Midgetman land-based mobile system if they are so efficient and  safe to operate. The reason is simple: By the year 2005 the  United States will have 18 nuclear-powered submarines with  powerful and highly accurate Trident-2 missiles (1,728 warheads  in all) capable of hitting both pinpoint and area targets. This  is more than enough for a deterrent. They have no need to spend  money on new development.    We will not do this either.</p>

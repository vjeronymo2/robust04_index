			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus (SANA) -- The Joint Syrian-Lebanese Water  Committee held a meeting at the Ministry of Irrigation yesterday  attended by Nasri Khuri, secretary general of the Higher  Syrian-Lebanese Council.    Later, Khuri made a statement to the Syrian Arab News Agency  correspondent on the topics which were studied by the committee.  He said: At its previous meeting in Beirut on 3 February 1994,  which was devoted to studying the subject of building a dam on  the Orontes River, the Joint Water Committee set up a joint  technical committee to explore the river course from the source  to Lake Qattinah in order to inspect the existing gauge station,  determine the new stations required, and study the flow of water  both at the surface and underground levels for the longest  period possible.    Khuri added: "The joint technical committee had carried out  its exploration of the Orontes River course, held several  meetings to review its findings, and submitted its report to the  main committee."    Khuri said: "Yesterday's meeting was devoted to studying the  facts contained in this report. It was agreed to adopt the  technical committee's recommendations on gauging the annual  average flow, revamping and operating the existing gauge station  on the Lebanese side, and studying the building of a hydraulic  station on the same side. This is in addition to the adoption  of several other recommendations."    The secretary general explained that the Joint Water  Committee decided to devote its next meeting, which is scheduled  to be held in Beirut on 20 June, to studying the question of  current and future water needs to be supplied by the Orontes  River course and to begin accumulating data on the needs to be  supplied by the southern al-Kabir River.    Khuri expressed the hope that all studies on the Orontes  River would be completed prior to proposing future solutions  concerning the exploitation of the river and consequently the  signing of a Syrian-Lebanese agreement on whatever is reached in  this regard.</p>

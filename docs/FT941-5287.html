			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Privatisation of Renault faces delay Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has quietly signalled his reluctance to privatise Renault, the state-owned car maker, this year, in contrast to his industry minister's continued enthusiasm for going ahead with the sale despite the break-up with Volvo. The prime minister's officials insisted yesterday that no definite decision had been made to delay the car company's privatisation. But they did not refute a statement over the weekend by one of their number that, with last month's sale of Elf-Aquitaine, the oil major, bringing in FFr33bn (Pounds 3.8bn) and the imminent flotation of the big UAP insurance group, prepared by decree last November, the government's goal of raising FFr55bn from privatisation in 1994 'will be met'. Nor did the officials damp speculation that Mr Balladur's reticence applies chiefly to Renault, though 16 other companies remain on the government's privatisation list. Only last week, in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, said he still hoped that Renault could be sold off this year - depending on the state of the stock market - as had been planned in the context of its merger with Volvo. An official at the prime minister's office insisted yesterday that any caution on Mr Balladur's part was 'not cyclical' and not related to the fear that recent volatility on the stock market might interrupt privatisation, as the 1987 crash did the last round of state assets sales. Some French press analysis of Mr Balladur's reservations about an early Renault sale have highlighted resistance by the communist-leaning CGT union inside Renault and the prime minister's desire not to add to the trade union opposition he is already meeting on wage legislation. Another possible factor mentioned by observers is the fact that Mr Louis Schweitzer's mandate as president of Renault comes up for renewal in May, and that delay could give Mr Balladur the chance to substitute for this Socialist appointee a political loyalist to take the company into the private sector. Renault itself refused to comment yesterday, except to say that delay would not complicate the financial divorce provisions it has already agreed with Volvo, unless it extended later than mid-1996. That is well after the May 1995 presidential election, which could give Mr Balladur or any other conservative incumbent of the Elysee, a freer hand on privatisation.</p>

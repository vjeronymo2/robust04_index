			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Welcome to Burma Burma's ruling military junta has launched a 'Visit Myanmar in 1996' campaign in a bid to counter bad publicity abroad, according to state television monitored in Thailand. Myanmar, as the country is called by the military junta, has set itself the ambitious target of attracting 600,000 tourists during 1996. Western diplomats say there were fewer than 30,000 tourist arrivals in 1993.</p>

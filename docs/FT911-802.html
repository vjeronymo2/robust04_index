			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (1): Vital factors for the future - Hong Kong thrives when business confidence is strong, but this resilience has been shaken recently by Peking's hardliners who are seeking more power, both before and after the UK hands over sovereignty of the colonial territory to China in 1997 THE SUCCESS of Hong Kong as one of the world's great economic growth stories depends on three primary factors: a deep-water harbour which is its only natural resource, a population of approaching 6m largely made up of Chinese refugees who are desperate to capitalise on their money-making skills, and a tolerant Chinese communist government to the north which allows this rampantly free-market British colony to do its own thing. Together, these three factors are needed to generate the confidence for expansion which produces the high annual rates of economic growth of 12-14 per cent achieved in the late 1980s. The result is an annual income per capita this year of about USDollars 13,400, second only to Japan among Asia's industrialised economies and roughly the same as Singapore. But remove any one of the factors and confidence crumbles. The domestic will to invest wanes, international companies look elsewhere to places like Singapore, and speculation begins about how long it will take for Hong Kong to decay from being the world's eleventh largest trading economy into a glitzy multi-storey version of Shanghai. That is what has been happening since June 1989 when China's tolerance was dramatically altered by hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people marching in support of the student demonstrations in Peking's Tiananmen Square. Hong Kong consequently appeared to China to be more of a subversive political threat than an economic asset and, as a spin-off, Peking's distrust of Britain increased. Peking's hardliners therefore decided to step up their control of the colony before and after the UK hands over sovereignty in 1997. This has humiliated the government which has been forced, step by step, to accept that Peking has a major say over a HKDollars 100bn international airport project. Before 1989, the government saw no need to provide more than the most cursory information on the airport to Peking. Now it has had to admit that it can neither sustain domestic support for the project, nor raise essential international finance, unless China gives its blessing. That has been a hard pill for a tightly-controlled colonial regime to swallow. Even harder is China's parallel demand for virtual agreement in advance on all major decisions - especially all debts and obligations that straddle the 1997 handover. Subjects such as large capital projects, education and housing policy, and appointments of judges and top civil servants are expected to be included. A long-running row over these issues has delayed the airport and undermined the authority of the government. On a broader perspective, it has also demonstrated that China will always interfere in the territory's affairs, and that it will do so more aggressively when Peking feels politically threatened (as with the Tiananmen Square crisis) or when it feels that its 1997 legacy is in some way at stake. Some Sinologists in the British foreign service cling to a dream that China will only demand control till the British leave in 1997 and that it will then allow the 'high degree of autonomy' it has pledged. This seems unrealistically optimistic. There is little support in Hong Kong for a series of confrontations - such as the airport row - during the next six years, because China cannot lose. The UK government is also assumed to want to avoid being constantly involved in tortuous battles with Peking. This leads to the conclusion that it is better to tackle the problem now by trying to allay China's fears and gain its trust by recognising its legitimate post-1997 concerns and by involving it in decisions. Hong Kong is, in any case, inextricably linked economically with China. This is best illustrated by concern over the future of China's 'most favoured nation' trading status with the US. Cancellation would hurt the colony far more than China and would, it is estimated, wipe up to 2 per cent off annual economic growth which is forecast to reach only 3.5 to 4.5 per cent this year. China and Hong Kong are each other's largest trading partners and China accounts for more than 80 per cent of the colony's entrepot re-export trade. At least 2m employees in the southern province of Guangdong carry out Hong Kong-related work, and estimates suggest that as many as 50,000 Hong Kong technical and managerial staff work regularly in China. But economic links develop more easily than political and administrative co-operation. There is a deep-seated resistance at the top of the colony's civil service against China being allowed a say in the local affairs - and this would have to be changed before any real co-operation could take place. Mr Douglas Hurd, British Foreign Secretary, signalled such a a change when he said recently that it was 'light-headed nonsense' to believe, as some people did in Britain and Hong Kong, that Peking should be kept 'as distant as possible'. Involving Peking will, however, need to be done in such as way that minimises the risk of China's bureaucratic approach slowing down economic developments. The creation of precedents for China to interfere widely after 1997 would also need to be kept to a minimum. Such involvement seems however to be the only solution for the future. Hong Kong thrives when confidence is strong. As a highly flexible trading city, it is adept at overcoming challenges and setbacks, but the confidence will not survive a series of airport-style confrontations running up to 1997.</p>

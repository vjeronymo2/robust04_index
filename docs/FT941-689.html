			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Moling' code needed to protect trees Sir, It is a shame Raymond Snoddy did not dwell on the environmental benefits which the mole method of cable and pipe laying would bring ('Mr Mole wants to bury TV diggers', March 19/20). My colleagues and I have become increasingly concerned with the large number of trenching operations in recent years, which can cause untold damage to the root plates of nearby trees. Unfortunately, the trees usually survive a few years before they succumb, by which time they are often condemned as dangerous and felled completely. This is a situation which has serious implications for urban street trees, which in themselves have a vital function in greening our towns and cities. There is an economic consequence, too, for the local council has to pick up the costs of dealing with the damaged trees and for their replacement. In the rural environment, with new water and gas mains squeezed between roads and hedgerow, mature country trees are also under threat. The mole appears to go some way to addressing this problem, as one presumes it passes safely beneath the root plate, thereby minimising damage to the tree. One is encouraged by the recent, timely launch of a campaign to raise awareness of the damage trenching does to trees, but we may need more than this. Many 'trenchers' have statutory powers which can bypass local authority tree protection control, and I feel that a robust code of practice must be agreed, but that if this fails, then statutory measures are required to protect the hidden and particularly vulnerable parts of the trees we so often take for granted.

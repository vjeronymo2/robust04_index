			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in  Burmese at 1300 GMT on 8 April carries a 39-minute report on the  8 April National Convention plenary session on the presentation  by the Panel of Chairmen on the review and analysis of  suggestions submitted by the delegate groups to prescribe the  fundamental principles related to the "State," "State  Structure," and "Head of State" chapters that will be included  in drawing up the constitution.    Alternate Chairman U Saw Philip, alias U Philip San, and  Panel of Chairmen members U San Tha Aung, U Sai Aung Htun, U Kan  Nyunt, U Mahn Ohn Maung, U Soe Maung, U Tin Maung, U Khin Maung  Htoo, and Dr. Than Nyunt present analysis on the "Head of State"  chapter.    The Panel of Chairmen's report clarifies and appraises the  reports presented by the various delegate groups concerning the  head of state and suggests the following as basic principles  concerning the appropriate terms of office for the president and  vice presidents for the "Head of State" chapter. "The term of  office of the president and the vice presidents shall be five  years; the president and vice presidents shall carry on in  office until the new president and vice presidents are duly  elected after the expiration of incumbent terms; incumbents  shall serve in the office of the president and vice presidents  for not more than two terms; and the term as acting president or  acting vice president shall not be considered as a term in  office." Moreover, the analysis report proposes that "if for  some reason the post of president or vice president becomes  vacant and someone is elected to fill the vacancy, the term of  office of that person shall be only until the end of the  original term of office."    Next, the Panel of Chairmen's analysis report clarifies the  political position of the president and proposes the basic  principles. "The president and vice presidents shall not be  representatives of parliament; if a parliament representative is  elected president or vice president, this person shall be deemed  to have resigned his seat in parliament, and if a public service  person is elected president or vice president, that person shall  be deemed to have retired from the date of such election; if a  person elected president or vice president happens to be a  member of a political party, that person shall not participate  in party activities of that party organization from the date of  such election during the term of office."    Continuing, the analysis report defines the oaths of office  for the president and vice presidents before they assume their  official responsibilities and cites suggestions by various  delegates, including: "A. To observe and safeguard the state  constitution; B. To protect the laws of the nation; C. To  strive for the nondisintegration of the union, the  nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of  national sovereignty; D. To execute the constitutional duties  and responsibilities with righteousness and without depravity;  E. To strive for the promotion of Lawkapala [universal]  principle of justice, liberty, and equality." The analysis  report proposes that the basic principle on the oath of office  include the following points: "To be loyal to the Union of  Myanmar [Burma] and its citizens; to perpetually bear in mind  and strive for the nondisintegration of the union, the  nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of  national sovereignty; to observe and safeguard the state  constitution and to protect and abide by the laws of the nation;  to execute duties and responsibilities with utmost integrity and  righteousness; to strive for the promotion of Lawkapala  principle of justice, liberty, and equality in the Republic of  the Union of Myanmar; and solemnly swear to offer one's body and  life to the nation for the benefit of the Republic of the Union  of Myanmar." Next, the Panel of Chairmen's analysis report  suggests another basic principle, stating that "the president  and vice presidents should not accept any other office or  position of emolument."    Further, the analysis report evaluates the assets of the  president and vice presidents and proposes that "the president  and vice presidents should furnish lists of assets -- such as  family-owned land, houses, buildings, businesses, savings, and  other valuables, stating their values, and belonging to the  respective families headed by them -- and send them to the  leader of the union parliament." The report then describes  remuneration, benefits, and lodging suggestions and proposes  that "the president and vice presidents should each be entitled  to enjoy legally appropriate remuneration, privileges, and  benefits; each should be provided with a suitable residence; and  when a president or vice presidents, apart from those being  impeached, retire after completing a term in office, they should  be granted pension and suitable benefits."    The Panel of Chairmen's analysis report determines the  duties  and responsibilities and proposes the basic principle that "the  president and vice presidents shall exercise responsibilities  and rights assigned and vested by the constitution and other  laws." The report next assesses the points for impeachment, the  procedures to be followed, and prescribes the basic principles  "1. The president or a vice president can be impeached for the  following reasons: A. treason; B. violation of the state  constitution; C. misconduct; D. deterioration in the specific  qualifications prescribed in the constitution for the president  and vice president; 2. If a president or a vice president faces  impeachment, a written proposal signed by not less than one  quarter of the total members of any of the two parliaments  included in the union parliament will be submitted to the leader  of that parliament; 3. The impeachment procedure can continue  only if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total  members of the parliament concerned; 4. When an impeachment  motion has been referred by one parliament, the other parliament  shall investigate the motion or cause the motion to be  investigated by a body; 5. The president, vice presidents, or  their representatives shall have the right to refute the motion;  6. If, as a result of the investigation, a resolution is passed  and is supported by not less than two-thirds of the members of  the parliament by which the charge was investigated or caused to  be investigated, declaring that the charge has been sustained  and that the offense -- the subject of the charge -- was such as  to render the president or vice president unfit to continue in  office, that parliament should submit it to the leader of the  union parliament to remove the president or vice president from  office; 7. Immediately upon receipt of the submission, the  leader of the union parliament shall proclaim the removal of the  president or vice president from office."    Next, the Panel of Chairmen's analysis report analyzes the  election of a president or a vice president if the positions  become vacant due to resignation, death, or inability, and  proposes the basic principles that "1. The president or vice  president should have the right to resign from office of their  own volition before the expiry of the term of office; 2. If the  post of president becomes vacant due to resignation, death,  inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office, or  any other cause, the vice president who has won the second  highest number of votes in the presidential election shall serve  as acting president; 3. If the vacancy in the presidency arises  while the union parliament is in session, the acting president  should promptly inform the leader of the union parliament to  fill the vacancy within seven days; 4. Upon receipt of the  announcement from the acting president, the leader of the union  parliament should take the necessary steps to elect a new vice  president by the electoral college; 5. After electing a new  vice president, union parliament members shall elect a president  of their choice from among the vice presidents; 6. If a vacancy  arises when the union parliament is not in session, the leader  of the union parliament shall summon a special parliamentary  session within 21 days of receiving the announcement from the  acting president and carry out the above-mentioned process for  choosing a new president; 7. If a vice presidential post  becomes vacant due to resignation, death, removal from office,  permanent disability, or any other cause while the union  parliament is in session, the electoral college which has  elected that vice president should promptly inform the leader of  the union parliament to fill the vacancy within seven days; 8.  If a vacancy arises when the union parliament is not in  session, the leader of the union parliament shall summon a  special parliamentary session within 21 days of receiving the  announcement from the president and carry out the required  process for choosing a new vice president."</p>

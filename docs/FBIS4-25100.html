			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The Control Yuan passed an impeachment motion  yesterday morning regarding S-2T antisubmarine helicopter  purchases. Eight high-ranking Air Force officers -- including  Generals Kuo Ju-lin and Chen Shing-ling, former Air Force  commanders-in-chief; three lieutenant generals who handled the  case; and three major generals -- will be impeached and [words  indistinct] for negligence of duty in violation of the law  because their poor planning has delayed an upgrading of combat  effectiveness and affected combat readiness.    The motion, which was filed by Control Yuan members (Li  Sheng-i) and (Chao Jung-yao), involves the highest military  officers in the history of Control Yuan impeachment proceedings  against the military. It also represents the first time that  the Control Yuan has impeached top-ranking generals who were  formerly chiefs of the general staff. The people being  impeached include Gen. Kuo Ju-lin and Gen. Chen Shing-ling, who  were former Air Force commanders-in- chief; Lt. Gen. (Hsia  Tian), former deputy chief of the Defense Ministry's planning  section; Lt. Gen. (Kuo Yun), former chief of the Defense  Ministry's purchasing mission in the United States; Lt. Gen.  (Lin Ke-cheng), former deputy chief of the Defense Ministry's  logistics section; Maj. Gen. (Yin Tao-chiang) and Maj. Gen. (Lin  Shifen), former chiefs of the Air Force General Headquarters  logistics office; and Maj. Gen. [name indistinct], deputy chief  of the Air Force General Headquarters logistics office.    The eight military officers being impeached were in charge  of  purchasing S-2T antisubmarine helicopters while in office. They  have since left their posts.</p>

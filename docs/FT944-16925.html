			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Manganese Bronze hails rise in black cab sales Manganese Bronze Holdings, the black taxi cab manufacturer, yesterday reported a 36 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2.04m for the year to July 31. Turnover remained flat at Pounds 74.6m (Pounds 75.4m) after an improved performance by the group's vehicles division was offset by a slide at the components side, which supplies bearings and precision castings. The company announced it was increasing taxi production to 44 per week, compared with a record low of 32 per week in June last year. Orders for the black cabs, which retail at about Pounds 20,000, are expected to reach 1,900 by the end of the year, compared with 1,600 last year. 'Business is picking up for taxi drivers, although I am not sure that many of them would admit to that,' said Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive. 'Quite a few are bringing back orders they had deferred during the recession.' The vehicles division trebled pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.23m on turnover of Pounds 43.4m. But the components division suffered a 70 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 551,000 after a 'disappointing' loss at the Redditch-based precision castings business. Last month the company disposed of LTI Homer, its lossmaking fuel tanks offshoot, with an associated loss of Pounds 1.44m. However, it retains the Fairway Nissan car dealership which continued to incur losses. The Deans Powered Doors division, which supplies rail and bus manufacturers, incurred a Pounds 315,000 loss (Pounds 2,000 profit). The company cut its rail door manufacture, involving exceptional costs of Pounds 300,000. Net interest charges fell from Pounds 320,000 to Pounds 52,000, and gearing was reduced from 20 to 5 per cent. A recommended final dividend of 2.5p makes a total of 4p (2.5p) for the year, payable from earnings per share ahead to 7.58p (5.89p). The shares dropped 2p to 147p.</p>

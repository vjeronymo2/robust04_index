			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Mirror/Scottish TV Mirror Group's protestation that it does not believe it necessary to control Scottish TV can probably be taken at face value. Not only is it unlikely that the Mirror would ever be allowed to control STV, because the two groups dominate the Scottish newspaper and TV markets, but the Mirror has anyway developed a fondness for exerting significant influence through minority stakes, as shown by its stake in Newspaper Publishing, the Independent's owner. The Mirror can be expected to press STV to provide programmes and expertise for its new cable TV channel. If it succeeds, its 14.9 per cent stake could look a cheap way of diversifying beyond the price-war ridden newspaper market.</p>

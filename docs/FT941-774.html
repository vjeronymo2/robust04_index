			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Coded warning to pirates - Plans to curb counterfeit CDs On a trip to Dubai earlier this year, Mr Mike Edwards went shopping for counterfeit compact discs. Mr Edwards, operations director of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, picked up pirate CDs by Elton John, Guns N' Roses and Bryan Adams. He believes the counterfeiter was based in Taiwan and that the CDs were made in China. The IFPI, along with Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has proposed that all legitimate CD factories mark their products with a code in an attempt to track down the pirates. The four-digit code would tell customs officers where the CD was manufactured. The IFPI, which represents music companies worldwide, has long complained about pirate recordings of cassettes. Counterfeit cassettes were, however, usually of low quality and easy to identify whereas pirate CDs are as good as the original. The counterfeiting of CDs has been made easier by the growth in the number of manufacturing facilities. The IFPI says there are 209 compact disc factories worldwide, with a combined annual production capacity of 2bn CDs. This is twice the number of legitimate CDs sold last year. In China, where the IFPI believes a sizeable proportion of counterfeit manufacturing occurs, there are 26 CD plants. Two years ago, there were three. The US has been pressing the Chinese authorities to crack down on all forms of commercial piracy and the IFPI says it has received assurances from China that it will act against CD piracy. An estimated 37.5m pirate CDs were sold worldwide in 1992, 50 per cent up on 1991 while the IFPI believes last year's increase was even bigger. Pirate CDs generally sell at the same price as legitimate discs and the industry estimates that it lost more than Dollars 400m in 1992 through CD piracy. Unlike cassette pirates, who often confine their activities to their own countries, CD counterfeiting crosses national borders. A CD pirate in one country can order from a factory in a second and have the products shipped to a third without ever taking physical possession of the CDs. Mr Edwards says companies in the film, computer and publishing industries are increasingly turning to CD technology as a vehicle for their products and they too will fall victim to piracy. He says: 'The CD counterfeiting problem is growing. We are sitting on a time bomb which could stop the multimedia revolution dead in its tracks. The record industry will not be the only casualty. Computer software, movies, video games, books - all of these are under threat.' The codes which the music industry hopes will limit piracy are allocated by Philips, which holds several of the patent rights for the CD manufacturing process. The IFPI says close to 40 factories worldwide have so far been allocated codes known as Source Identification Codes. The factories place the codes on the reflective inner ring on the underside of the CD. Ms Funkazi Koroye-Crooks, an IFPI legal adviser, says the code's position was chosen because it is difficult to place without interfering with the other data held on the CD and it requires expertise on the part of the manufacturer. Each production line in a CD factory has its own code engraved on the mould to identify the origin of the master recording and where the CD was manufactured. Ms Koroye-Crooks admits there is nothing to stop a factory engraving another plant's code on its mould and that the cost of doing so is only between Pounds 80 and Pounds 300 per mould, even though it takes some time to adapt the production equipment. Ms Koroye-Crooks believes it is more likely that counterfeit manufacturers will leave the code off CDs altogether. Even plants with legitimate codes could keep one unengraved mould for counterfeiting purposes. For this reason, the IFPI says that the code needs to be backed by legislative action. Ideally, this would take the form of an international treaty sponsored by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, a United Nations agency. Even in the absence of such a treaty, the IFPI says the US and the European Union could take effective action to limit CD piracy. If they were to make it illegal to manufacture imported discs which did not carry the code, this would close off 60 per cent of the world market to pirated CDs.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: A suspect revival It would probably be best to be wary of yesterday's 30.3-point rise in the UK equity market. The sudden revival of the dollar may be of real benefit to companies like Reuters and Glaxo with large markets in North America. It is premature to expect it to put an end to the troubles of the pound in the ERM, and hence to the interest rate alert. The market may have been deceiving itself if that was its reason for marking up the clearing banks by over 3 per cent - and getting on for 5 per cent in the case of Barclays. There are still formidable obstacles in the way of a sustainable recovery. The immediate problem is the French vote on Maastricht. No one can yet say exactly how that will turn out, although the market seems to have factored a weak 'yes' vote into its expectations. The assumption is that this, too, would calm the exchange markets. Perhaps so, but Italy's economic problems will not easily go away whatever France decides. So strains in the ERM may resurface, and sterling would again be vulnerable. However forthright the prime minister in his language, the government has displayed with its actions a deep reluctance to raise interest rates. Besides, it is not as if there were much to cheer about in the real economy. BTR's description of the landscape as a desert may linger in the memory, but this week has seen one dismal trading statement after another. At this point investors should be past applauding an extra fraction of a percentage point off the inflation rate. A spot of economic recovery would be much more reassuring.</p>

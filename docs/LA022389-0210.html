			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: GUN DEALER BACKS UP HIS BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES WITH ACTION  </P> <P> On the issue of gun control, at least, I wish Randy Garell were President of  the United States instead of George Bush. The National Rifle Assn. should wish  the same thing.  </P> <P> Garell, you will recall, is the Costa Mesa gun store owner who got national  attention by banning assault rifles from his stock after a crazed young man  used such a weapon to mow down a schoolyard full of children. Garell's action  caused such a furor that he called a news conference to explain his feelings,  and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates came down to lend him support. So did  Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden.  </P> <P> At the press conference, Garell said that because he was "greatly disturbed" by  the schoolyard killings, he decided to respond to the plea of police officials  at every level by selling off his current stock of military weapons to law  enforcement agencies and banning their future sale in his store.  </P> <P> That was 3 weeks ago, and the spotlight has since shifted from Garell to more  visible power centers. President Bush got into the act by refusing to support a  federal ban on assault weapons (his wife has taken the opposite position). And  legislators from Sacramento to Washington -- prodded by a surge of public anger  -- are struggling with the wording of laws to restrict these weapons.  </P> <P> So what has happened meanwhile to Randy Garell? Has he had any second thoughts  about his actions? Did he indeed get rid of his assault weapons? Is he  distressed at the intransigent position the NRA has taken on this issue?  </P> <P> I asked him these questions the other day and found him to be an amiable,  thoughtful man still willing to give of time from his work to try to explain  his feelings on an issue on which he believes the sides have become  increasingly -- and distressingly -- polarized.  </P> <P> He did, indeed, clear out the military weapons in his Grant Boys store. "Within  a week of making that decision," he said, "I got rid of the entire stock,  either by selling them to law enforcement people or returning them to the  vendor."  </P> <P> He admits to having second thoughts, but for economic rather than philosophical  reasons. "I suppose we have second thoughts about everything," he said. "I  could have made a tremendous amount of money the last few weeks selling these  weapons. You tell Americans they can't have something, and they want it. But  the more I think about it, the more certain I am that I did the right thing for  me and for my business. This was a personal decision. I make no judgments for  anyone else."  </P> <P> In the first week after his decision, Garell estimates that he received more  than a thousand phone calls. "I'd say 99% were favorable, and half of those  calls came from gun owners and NRA members like me who feel it is important for  the gun industry to do something to police itself. We still support the NRA,  but on this particular issue, they should be doing more. Life is compromise,  and the NRA is going to have to move toward the middle ground that protects the  rights of hunters and sportsmen and collectors and also protects the rights and  safety of the public."  </P> <P> Garell says he hasn't had any heat from the NRA and doesn't expect any  "because, as a whole, the gun industry allows people to make their own choices  and respects them for it."  </P> <P> But he is also fearful that "a lot of the legislators writing these laws don't  know anything about guns. They have to see the larger picture too." He would  like to see a body of specialists created -- "people who really know and  understand guns" -- who could evaluate new weapons that come into the state and  decide if they should be made publicly available.  </P> <P> "We believe in the existing rules," he said, "and follow them very tightly in  my store. We don't bend them for anybody. I strongly support a 15-day wait on  the purchase of all weapons in the state of California -- and most of the  people who have been in my store the last few weeks offering support feel the  same way."  </P> <P> He concluded rather wistfully: "I went into this business believing that I  should never risk making a customer mad. I broke that rule a few weeks ago by  taking a larger view. But if we can't all do that, we're going to be in trouble  -- not just in gun control but in housing and law enforcement and criminal  justice and other areas where new thinking is also badly needed."  </P> <P> In the familiar cacophony of NRA cliches, Garell sounds like a voice in the  wilderness. But instead of listening, the NRA continues its broken record of  "Gun control is one step toward turning America into a totalitarian state" and  "What you'll be doing is disarming the average man and woman, making them more  vulnerable to the bad guys, who will have no problem obtaining these weapons"  -- both arguments made repeatedly by NRA representatives in the current flap.  </P> <P> This kind of baloney has been keeping gun laws off the books for years. But  every once in a while in this country, a public issue comes up for grabs in  which the answer is so clear, so obvious, that debating it approaches the  theater of the absurd. Such an issue is the banning of assault rifles.  </P> <P> If the NRA had any sense -- and I've seen little evidence of that -- it would  listen to the moderates in its midst who could help hammer out the kind of  compromise suggested by Randy Garell. The alternative -- at long last -- may be  punitive laws urged by people who are finally fed up with the excesses of the  gun lobby.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIEWING PERILS OF A 'ME-FIRST' UPBRINGING  </P> <P> Re: " 'Me-first' kids" (by Barbara Bronson Gray, Oct. 31).  </P> <P> What did child psychologists expect? Their trendy behavioral theories and  social tinkerings created more problems than they ever solved. Permissiveness  was "in," discipline was "out," and family authority was cast aside after  serving for centuries as stabilizing, civilizing centers of society.  </P> <P> The "me generation" was encouraged to be defiant, to reject traditional values  and to identify themselves as "the center of the universe." Then they were  urged to "do their own thing." When they did -- the consequences lie shattered  around us.  </P> <P> Instead of standing on the sidelines criticizing kids' behavior today -- as  Stanford psychologist Carl Thoresen does, while he blames the situation on  television and spins even more theories about what it all means -- he and the  rest of his profession should admit responsibility for their part of the mess  and do their best to recapture common sense and restore respect for the family  structure.  </P> <P> M.

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UN chief says no to troop relief for Bosnia UNITED NATIONS troops should not provide protection for humanitarian aid efforts in Bosnia-Hercegovina, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general. The recommendation that the Security Council reject a European Community request for armed intervention came as diplomats put the finishing touches to a package of UN sanctions against Serbia to end the war. While acknowledging it was for the Security Council to make a final decision, Mr Boutros Ghali warned that it would require large numbers of UN troops to secure several hundred kilometres of roads and to establish a defensive perimeter around the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. The city has been cut off by Serb militia and Yugoslav army troops in a bid to starve it into submission. There was a lull in the fighting around Sarajevo yesterday after heavy overnight clashes. In a bid to distance itself from the mortar attack on Sarajevo on Wednesday which left 17 people dead and 80 wounded, the rump Yugoslav presidency yesterday called on the UN to investigate the 'massacre'. However, diplomatic moves to impose mandatory sanctions could reach fruition as early as today, according to Mr John Major, the prime minister. Speaking in Budapest after talks on the crisis with Mr Joszef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, Mr Major said that the sanctions were likely to include a trade embargo, a freeze on Serbia's overseas assets, severe restrictions on commercial flights, the suspension of all official sporting contacts and the break-off of scientific, technical and cultural co-operation. The terms of the resolution under discussion by UN ambassadors in New York also included provision for an oil embargo from the middle of next month if Serbia did not act to halt the fighting. Mr Major said that the precise terms of the resolution were still under discussion, 'But I hope it will be agreed by the United Nations by the end of this week . . . that it will be a binding and mandatory series of sanctions.' Mr Boutros Ghali urged the Security Council to bear in mind that authorising hostile action against 'certain factions' in Bosnia-Hercegovina could make it more difficult to secure the co-operation needed for the UN to fulfil its mandate in the protected areas in Croatia. A 'less ambitious possibility' would be to use UN troops to protect relief convoys between Sarajevo airport and distribution centres in the city, he said. A more promising course would be a determined effort to persuade the warring parties to conclude and honour agreements permitting unimpeded delivery of aid to 'all suffering civilians,' said the secretary-general. However, numerous efforts to secure ceasefires have failed after Serb militias and the Yugoslav army have prevented any supplies which have been sent from reaching Sarajevo. In Belgrade the Serbian Orthodox Church attacked the policies of President Slobodan Milosevic in an unprecedented open letter. The church, which had supported the nationalist politics of Mr Milosevic, yesterday appealed for his resignation and the formation of a government of national salvation. Greek exporters, Page 3</p>

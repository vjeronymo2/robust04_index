The Importance of Talks To Begin in Moscow Today  Has Been Enhanced by a Compromise Between Moscow, Washington,  and Kiev"]    [Text] The prolonged discussion of the possibility of a  Russian-American-Ukrainian rendezvous in Moscow has produced a  compromise option: the U.S. President makes a brief stopover in  Kiev's Borispol airport and later -- after the Russian-American  talks are over -- Leonid Kravchuk arrives in Moscow to join Bill  Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. Thus, each side can point to the  tractability of the other two. Anatoliy Adamishin, an  experienced diplomat, was probably the closest to the truth as  he described this in a brief interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  as a process of trilateral concessions. Let us try, however, to  see how the trilateral talks may influence the views and images  of each of the three participants.    The United States. After James Baker [as published], who was  called "the last Union president," Bill Clinton is reaffirming  America's stabilizing role as the main arbiter among the former  Soviet republics. Russia's ambitions as a sovereign master of  the post-Soviet geopolitical space have not been substantiated:  Moscow will have to share the space with Washington. In  addition, Clinton has once again demonstrated that it is he, not  Yeltsin, who is capable of pressuring Kravchuk into making  concessions -- although Kravchuk depends on Yeltsin much more  than he does on Clinton.    Ukraine. Kravchuk managed to arrange Clinton's arrival in  Kiev. In exchange, however, Ukraine will still have to give up  its nuclear arms. But in fact it never really planned to keep  them. Apparently, Clinton's arrival was the price the Ukrainian  chiefs may see as sufficient. Not the arrival itself, but its  consequences as well, that is, joint Russian-American guarantees  of Ukrainian security, something that will insure Kiev against  the ambitions of unpredictable Russian politicians, such as  Zhirinovskiy, should they continue to triumph in the future.  Ukraine obtains a status that is to a certain extent comparable  with that of the Baltic states.    Russia. Boris Yeltsin managed to demonstrate the role his  country is playing in the former Soviet Union: Leonid Kravchuk  and Bill Clinton will negotiate on his territory and he himself  will be involved in the talks. At the same time, Moscow had to  move over a little to let Washington into the post-Soviet  geopolitics. Moscow succeeded in forcing Kiev to give up  nuclear weapons, though, but it was known in Russia as well as  in Ukraine that the latter will be unable to keep the weapons  all the same.    Hence, the Russian-American-Ukrainian talks may in the end  bring about changes in the post-Soviet space that have not been  expected in Moscow, Washington, or Kiev. For the time being,  however, each of the three sides is celebrating its expedient  victory.</p>

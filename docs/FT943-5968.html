			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Allegations against Body Shop lack any real evidence Sir, As environmentalists with knowledge of both the Body Shop and the ethical sector, we wish to ask why it appears that the FT, along with the rest of the media, is singling out the company and its credentials for attack; and largely on the basis of what seem to us to be both unproven allegations and facts blown out of all proportion. There can surely be few people who really doubt that the Body Shop is one of the leading companies in the field of social, ethical and environmental policy. While there may be companies which will go to greater pains in one particular sector of business, you would be hard pushed indeed to find another company which goes as far in almost every aspect of its business. Which other company even thought of building a wind farm to cover its energy needs in the UK? Of course the Body Shop is not perfect. It has its share of disputes with franchisees, minor spills and business misadventures. It is, however, a good example of a successful yet caring company with priorities way beyond the usual profit motive, and in a world where business ethics are all too often sadly lacking. Yet your critical articles would suggest sizeable problems. So what purpose do these reports serve in a respectable paper like the FT? Are they an attempt to engender debate about some of the serious issues facing business today? Or do they merely perpetuate the cynicism so often aimed at anyone who tries to inject a real sense of purpose into almost any field, be it politics, business or the arts? If there are genuine grounds for complaint, let us hear real evidence. If not, try attacking companies which have yet even to consider a social, ethical or environmental policy, let alone implement it. We desperately need to encourage businesses, consumers and green investors to develop the kind of ideas that the Body Shop espouses, and to put them into practice. Articles like those in your pages over the last few days can only make them all wonder whether it is really worth the effort.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporters Chang Chiao (1728 </F> 3390), Yeh Hung-yen (2814 4767 3601): "Three Million People in  Guangdong Hit by Floods"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Jun (TA KUNG PAO) -- Large areas in  Guangdong have been hit by floods and the losses are heavy.  Because various localities have been busy with rescue and  relief work, they have had no time to prepare detailed  statistics on losses. The Guangdong Headquarters for Prevention  of Three Kinds of Natural Disasters has sent a "report on the  struggle against floods, efforts to deal with the emergency, and  the state of the disasters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang." This  reveals that according to incomplete statistics from the four  cities of Shaoguan, Qingyuan, Zhaoqing, and Zhongshan, 29  counties and cities have been hit by floods, and 3.177 million  people have been affected. Of these, 740,000 are surrounded by  floodwaters, 300,000 in Shaoguan City, 340,000 in Qingyuan City,  and 100,000 in Zhaoqing City. Some 280,000 houses have been  ruined, 37,000 houses have collapsed, 101 people have died, 49  people are missing, 147,000 hectares of farmland have been hit,  and a number of medium and small irrigation projects have been  seriously damaged.    The situation revealed by the flood disaster this time shows  that most of the embankments which defend small areas and which  have low fortification standards have collapsed. For example,  31 embankments in Qingyuan City have collapsed. Of these  embankments, four were protecting a 10,000 mu or larger area of  land; in Zhaoqing City, 99 embankments each protecting an area  of less than 10,000 mu of land, have collapsed, and five  embankments each protecting an area of 1,000-10,000 mu, have  water running over them, and gates have to be lifted to let  water pass through in order to protect them. The seats of  counties and towns along the rivers and coast have been  seriously inundated--a total of 13 county seats have been  inundated. For example, Yangshan County is four meters under  water, whereas in the counties of Fengkai, Yunan, Yingde, and  Lechang, water has risen to the second floor. More than 70,000  people in Yingde City are now relying on biscuits, mineral  water, and medicine dropped to them from helicopters.    According to information, during the floods this time,  torrents of water rushed down the mountains and landslides  occurred, blocking many roads. For example, State Expressway  107 was not through north of Yangshan and the main roads and  bridges in Liannan and Lianshan have been blocked by mud from  landslides. Meanwhile, houses have collapsed as a result of  landslide, for example, at Sanzhou Management Zone in Liannan  County's Damai Hill, 33 people died when their houses collapsed.  Power transmission lines and irrigation facilities have also  been damaged by landslides. In Yangshan County's Chakeng  Reservoir, a moderate landslide and the collapse of a wall along  the spillway have blocked the water tunnel with rocks and mud  but the situation has been promptly handled and the reservoir  has been rendered safe.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Wandsworth plans grammar schools PLANS to convert a compre-hensive school into a selective grammar school have been announced by the south London borough of Wandsworth, the Conservative 'flagship' authority. The boys-only Ernest Bevin School is asking to select 90 of its annual intake of 180 on academic criteria. For equal-opportunities reasons, Wandsworth is asking the neighbouring girls' school, Burnt-wood, which has opted out of local-authority control, to make a similar number of places selective. If Burntwood does not agree, Wandsworth plans to open a new girls' grammar school. Mr Tony Belton, leader of the Labour group, vowed to oppose the proposals.</p>

An instance of it is the report of the Japanese weekly  magazine SHUKAN BUNSHUN that Russian scientists helped the DPRK  in "the development of nuclear weapons".    Recalling that the chief of the general staff of the Russian  Armed Forces laid bare the falsity of the article carried in the  Japanese weekly, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today exposes the  purpose of the anti-DPRK smear campaign of the Japanese  reactionaries.    The analyst says:    The Japanese reactionaries are trying to hinder the  triumphant advance of our republic and the solution to the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    They have so far noisily vociferated about "nuclear  development" by the DPRK in an attempt to isolate it and used it  as a pretext to step up their own nuclear armament.    If the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is  fundamentally  solved, Japan will lose the pretext to accelerate its nuclear  armament. In setting abroad the fiction of "assistance of  Russian experts," it is motivated by a sinister design to  obstruct the solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula.    It is a foolish act for the Japanese reactionaries to  attempt  to disparage our socialism with fabrications. They should  clearly understand the anthropocentric socialism of Korean style  and stop running amuck.    Their anti-DPRK false propaganda will bring no favorable  result to Japan.</p>

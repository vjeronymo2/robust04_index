			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World Economy (35): Clean-up targets hard to hit - Environment / Bronwen Maddox assesses results after the Rio earth summit Governments have succeeded in solving few of the truly global environmental threats which face them, although some are getting better at solving national problems. But countries' records vary widely: the clean ones are tending to get cleaner, while the dirty ones get filthier. The Rio Earth Summit two years ago stands as the world's most ambitious attempt to identify and address global environmental problems. While governments and lobby groups wrestled with almost every environmental issue imaginable - with the notable exception of population growth, as the UK's Prince Charles pointed out - two concerns above all provoked enough alarm to push delegates to agreement. The Rio climate change convention addresses the effect of pollution on the world's atmosphere; the biodiversity convention tackles threats to the worldwide diversity of species. This year's annual report from the United Nations Environment Programme notes that the rate of increase of atmospheric concentrations of methane, a 'greenhouse' gas, has been slowing, although concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have continued to grow. But it also makes clear that emissions of carbon dioxide are rising less quickly than some once feared. The collapse of highly-polluting heavy industry in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, together with recession in western Europe and North America, has provided something of a 'breathing space'. It seems unlikely that eastern European industry will return to its former levels of pollution, given that new plant now being installed is many times more energy efficient than the old. However, as recession lifts in western Europe and North America, those regions' emissions will continue to rise. That will make the question of their compliance with the Rio targets pressing once again. It is too early to judge whether governments have changed their policies in response to the Rio agreements. But their responses to the climate change targets are in some disarray. The convention commits industrialised countries to drawing up plans for bringing emissions of 'greenhouse' gases such as carbon dioxide back to 1990 levels in 2000. However, higher taxes on energy, the tool first seized upon by the US and the European Union, have proved politically unpopular, and measures to introduce them have stalled. It is even harder to measure government's progress on biodiversity targets given that knowledge of the number and distribution of species of plants, animals, insects and fish is incomplete. Indeed, environmental campaigners use that ignorance as a justification for 'precautionary' action; the rain forests, they argue, may hold hitherto undiscovered sources of medicines. But environmental lobby groups such as Worldwide Fund for Nature have been sceptical that governments' measures to preserve biodiversity will be vigorous. That stance is given weight by the two dozen disputes in the past year over fishing rights in international waters, where countries are not convinced that conservation is in their interest. There are three reasons why the Rio conventions are proving hard to implement. First, the science is uncertain: it is hard to determine the extent of the environmental damage caused by atmospheric pollution or loss of species. Second, changing behaviour is proving expensive. Third, governments disagree over who should bear the financial burden of making those changes. Developing countries argue that they are not to blame for the threat of climate change. Although their emissions of greenhouse gases are now rising fast, they argue that present levels of harmful gases in the atmosphere should be blamed on Europe, North America and Japan. If progress on the Rio conventions were the only standard by which the world's ability to tackle environmental problems were judged, there would be cause for pessimism. However, other, more limited international pacts to curb pollution have had more success, where both scientific and distributional questions have proved easier to answer. The 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out substances which damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere, is one of the most successful attempts to address an environmental threat. The causes of the problem were more easily identified than those of global warming, and companies rapidly developed substitutes for most of the chemicals incriminated. Although thinning of the ozone layer, which shields people and crops from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, is continuing, scientists predict that if the phase-out is completed, the layer will begin to repair itself by the middle of next century. Where regional interest is clear, pacts have also been easier to draw up and implement than the Rio targets. European and North American countries have succeeded in drawing up progressively tighter curbs on emissions of sulphur dioxide, which are thought to cause acid rain. As a result of measures to re-equip power stations, or to derive a higher proportion of power from gas or nuclear energy, sulphur dioxide emissions in industrialised countries have been falling sharply. Between 1980 and 1990 they fell by 10 per cent in the US, 29 per cent in Japan, 69 per cent in western Germany, 60 per cent in Sweden and 23 per cent in the UK, according to UNEP. Such efforts have brought sharp improvements in many types of air pollution in industrialised countries, albeit with the important exception of traffic fumes. But European and North American countries are also spending considerable sums on tackling water pollution and the disposal of solid waste, particularly in its most hazardous forms. The same picture is not true of many developing countries, where environmental concerns remain way down governments' priorities - and capabilities. For example, China's emissions of sulphur dioxide rose by 50 per cent during the 1980s, and India's by 53 per cent. Those trends are unlikely to change unless governments of developing countries are persuaded that cleaning up the environment is in their own interest. That can occur through public pressure, international regulation (and the payments from developed countries which may accompany it), or simply by acknowledgement of the costs to the country of losing environmental resources such as trees or clean air. Until those changes occur, however, the gap in environmental standards between developed countries and developing ones which have embarked on industrialisation is likely to grow wider.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Councils criticised over housing benefit provision MOST LOCAL authorities responsible for paying housing benefit to low-income households are failing to provide a prompt, accurate and efficient service, says an Audit Commission report. The local authority watchdog says that while many councils manage payment of benefits efficiently, it is often at the cost of ignoring government regulations. Many others have large backlogs of unprocessed claims, unanswered queries and unopened mail. The commission lays much of the blame for poor administration of housing benefit on the government. The regulations for paying it are complex, change frequently and encourage bad management practices. Housing benefit costs Pounds 6bn a year and is paid to 3.5m low-income households - one in six households. It is administered by councils on behalf of central government, which repays 95 per cent of the benefit paid out and 30 per cent of the administration cost. The report finds large variations between the speed with which councils process claims. More than half claim to process over 80 per cent of claims within 14 days of receiving them (the statutory target). The subsidy arrangements also create 'perverse incentives' for councils to ignore regulations, the commission says. Councils that encourage claimants to backdate claims cannot recoup the additional benefit. The rules also discourage councils from paying higher benefits than recommended by rent officers where this is allowed. There are also incentives to ignore evidence of overpayment or fraud, according to the report. The commission says district auditors will be focusing on service standards to reduce delays and improve accuracy. Remote Control: The National Administration of Housing Benefit. Audit Commission.

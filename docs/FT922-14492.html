			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Pride may wreck any honourable intentions Considering what minority Labour governments have done to the Liberals on four previous occasions, Mr Paddy Ashdown is quite right to insist that a ring be placed on his finger before it is done again. There is just one small problem. He may not be asked. The leader of the Liberal Democrats may be ignored even if the result of Britain's general election turns out to be as the opinion polls predict. The prospect is of a parliament in which Labour holds just over 300 seats, with the Conservatives in the 290s. Half the remaining 50 seats would be in the Liberal Democrats' hands. In such circumstances a shameless Mr Neil Kinnock could form a minority Labour government. He could write a Queen's Speech that was a model of moderation. It could promise a devolved assembly for Scotland, plus hints of other constitutional reforms, short of PR for the Commons. Labour could then dare the other parties to vote it out. The chances are that they would not. Of course the electorate could yet surprise us all. The Tories might win the largest number of seats - say, 315-plus. That is a mere handful short of 326, an overall majority. The Conservatives could then try to govern with Ulster unionist support. They would stand a chance, for a while. We can contemplate such an historic event if and when it takes place. For the moment it is more pertinent to follow the polls. They say hung parliament, Labour ahead. There have been four hung parliaments during this century - in 1924, 1929-31, 1974 and 1976-79. In each case minority Labour administrations have made use of the Liberals in order to gain a temporary hold on power, then walked away. None of the governments thus shored up performed well. The most recent of them, the Lib-Lab pact administration under the then Mr James Callaghan, was probably the most disastrous we have ever had to endure. Mr Ashdown's current line, rehearsed again on television yesterday, is therefore understandable, if cheeky. He would not wish to sustain a Labour government under Mr Kinnock merely to be given the order of the boot once the liaison had served its purpose. That would be foolish. A mere Lib-Lab pact would leave the power of calling the subsequent election in Mr Kinnock's hands. He could wait for the opportunity, spring his trap, and return from a second campaign with a thumping majority and no need to offer the smaller party so much as a cup of tea. Part of the rest of Mr Ashdown's argument makes sense. Part of it is bunk. The credible part is that a genuine coalition, cemented by an undertaking to legislate for proportional representation, would signal to the markets and everyone else that the new government was here to stay. There would be stability of a sort. The bunkum is the assertion that such an arrangement would be the verdict of the ballot box. Mr Ashdown's fifth of the electorate would be the only segment that could be said consciously to have chosen such an outcome. That is not a verdict. It is an accident of arithmetic. Against that, a minority Conservative or Labour government based on 40 per cent or less of the votes cast (and probably 30 per cent if you count abstentions) would not represent the will of the people. It would not be able to claim democratic legitimacy. A coalition could more convincingly do that, provided that neither of the partners had betrayed the general principles that they had avowed during the coalition with the Conservatives would be a perversion. One side or the other would have to have lied to the voters. A Lib Dem deal with Labour need not trouble the consciences of either party. On most important areas of policy they are as close as makes no difference; where they are apart there is room for honourable compromise. Yet Mr Ashdown may have no need to make up his mind whether to enter a proper coalition with Mr Kinnock. The situation may not arise. For it is Mr Kinnock, the increasingly cocky Mr Kinnock, who would have to initiate discussions. Would he do so? Yes, if forced to. If not, I doubt it. It all depends upon how puffed up you think the Labour leader's vision of himself as prime minister will be. Let us give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he is aware that all previous quickies with the Liberals have ended in tears. He might then be susceptible to the argument that if Labour wants a decent period in power  -say 13 years - it can only do so as a result of a long-term and legitimate alliance with the Lib Dems. On the basis of that argument he eventually accepts electoral reform for the House of Commons even if he wins an overall majority on Thursday. If you buy this line, the stately progress of the debate inside Labour's ranks becomes another clever piece of Kinnock party management. The policy review, ending in a manifesto that is free from the word 'socialism', took three years. The Labour leader set the party up before declaring himself in favour of membership of the European Community. He prepared the party well in advance of his U-turn on unilateral nuclear disarmament. The Plant commission on voting systems could be serving a similar purpose now. It is certainly true that there is a groundswell of Labour opinion in favour of PR, even for the Commons. My guess is that the latter will fade away if there is a strong Labour showing on Thursday, giving a commanding majority of the seats in the house. For Mr Kinnock is near to bursting with pride at his achievement, even before it is proven. Once he becomes prime minister, he is unlikely to want to share power with another party, whatever the long-term logic of such an arrangement may be. More to the point, he seems to be telling himself that he can create a grand coalition of the left within the Labour movement. You could certainly deduce this from his many references over the past few days to consensus and government so wise that everyone will want to support it. Think about the numbers. Labour needs just a quarter of the Liberal Democrat vote added to its own to command the support of 45 per cent of British voters - enough, if it holds, to sustain smashing majorities in a series of first-past-the-post elections. There is a lesson for potential prime ministers who are inclined to think that way. It is contained in the history of the past 13 years. Two or three easy victories based on the ideology of a single party do not end happily. Inflated pride is followed by a great fall. The achievements of such an administration may be blown away in the wind. Mr Kinnock could seek to deceive the Liberals, representative of at least a fifth of the people, into submission, or he could ignore them. The latter is particularly tempting to those who cannot stomach what they regard as Mr Ashdown's sanctimonious posturing. But neither route will produce a centre-left alliance that could, in the 21st century, match the Conservatives' record of election victories in the 20th.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Focus on bank charges Does it make sense to shop around among banks for a good deal? A trial carried out by Business Money, a new monthly newsletter,* reveals significant differences between the charges quoted by a range of banks. The 17 banks approached provided quotes ranging from Pounds 17 to Pounds 1,400 to manage an account for a year. Business Money asked the banks to quote for a customer expecting to write more than Pounds 100,000 worth of cheques a year, paying in 300 cheques and Pounds 2,000 in cash a month, and maintaining an average credit balance of Pounds 3,000. The newsletter is based in Street, Somerset and stipulated the account must be maintained elsewhere, to prevent discrimination against banks without a local branch. Many businesses prefer a local contact point but others with accounts in credit often never visit their branch, says Robert Lefroy, editor and a former banker with 28 years experience. The Pounds 17 quote came from Allied Trust, a London-based bank with no branch network; the Pounds 1,400 proposal from National Westminster. Other low quotes came from the Coop Bank (Pounds 750, though this included six months free banking) and Clydesdale Bank (Pounds 911). Offers from the other main clearers were Pounds 1,161 from Lloyds and Pounds 1,258 from Barclays while Midland refused to quote, citing, according to Lefroy, its 'aggressive new policy.' Quotes of between Pounds 1,100 and Pounds 1,200 came from Allied Irish, Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank. One lesson to emerge was it might make sense for companies to split their banking, putting cash deposits through Girobank and other business through low-cost operations, suggests Lefroy. *Provides listings of loan costs across a range of business sectors and details of leasing and factoring charges.

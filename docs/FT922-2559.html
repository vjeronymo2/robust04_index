			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pounds 100m pledged for environment fund BRITAIN will earmark Pounds 100m for environmental spending over a number of years to help replenish the Global Environment Facility, Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons yesterday. He admitted, however, that the timescale over which the money would be made available was indefinite and depended on when the fund - used by the World Bank and the United Nations to help developing countries to finance 'environmentally friendly' projects - required it. Reporting back on his return from the Earth Summit in Rio, Mr Major said it was a 'milestone' while acknowledging that the results had not gone 'as far as some would wish'. He said that Britain itself could have 'gone further' on climate change than the convention provides. Without the intervention of his ministerial colleagues, however, 'there might not have been a climate convention to sign'. He said he had proposed an 'action plan' to other heads of government. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour deputy leader, asked Mr Major to use Britain's 'special relationship' with the US to urge President George Bush to sign the biodiversity agreement.</p>

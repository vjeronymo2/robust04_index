			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Economics: Markets looking for signs of move from recession THE FOCUS this week will be on the pointers from the US and UK on the paths likely to be taken by the two countries as they emerge from recession. A big worry for economic policy makers is the lack of synchronisation between trends in these two nations and in Germany. In the case of the latter, demand has been racing away due to the pressures of reunification, delivering a dose of unwelcome inflationary pressures. The US and Britain, meanwhile, are struggling with the consequences of low demand and sagging output. In recent weeks, indications of when an upturn in either economy might take place have been far from clear. Of a raft of indicators in the US, among the most important data are the non-farm employment numbers, due on Friday. These are expected to show a fall in employment in April of about 130,000, a smaller figure than the 206,000 in March and hence an encouraging sign for anyone looking for an upturn. Attention will also be directed towards other US figures such as the levels of consumer income and spending. Wednesday marks the publication in the US of the important National Association of Purchasing Managers Survey which indicates the level of demand in the economy. This is thought likely to show a small upward movement from the 40 per cent reading in March, indicating a slight change for the better in terms of the economic outlook. In Britain, all eyes will be on the publication on Tuesday of the Confederation of British Industry's latest quarterly survey of the level of confidence in manufacturing industry. The UK government, which in the past two weeks has suffered a deluge of bad economic news, will the hoping the latest survey contains a few glimmers of hope that a recovery of sorts will start up on schedule around the middle of this year. Other important economic figures and events due this week are as follows. Median market forecasts are in brackets and are provided by MMS International, the financial information group. Today: US, March personal consumer income and spending (up 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent) and new home sales (up 0.3 per cent). France, March final consumer price index (up 0.1 per cent).

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Personal View: Late payers should pay the price The government is to review how UK industry, and especially small business, is financed. There is one important and simple step that could be taken immediately. It needs to ensure that commercial debts are paid on time. Because late payment of debt is so entrenched in British culture, this can only be achieved by reform of the law to provide for a statutory right of interest on overdue business debts. Such reform would contribute to investment, expansion and job creation. The problem has existed throughout my working life. In my early days at the Bar, actions for the recovery of debt formed part of my livelihood. From the moment I joined National Westminster Bank, our business units in all parts of the country have consistently told me of the havoc which the virus of late payment has caused many medium-sized and small businesses throughout the recession. Research has confirmed these reports. One recent study told us that at any one time at least Pounds 15bn-worth of trade debts to small and medium-sized businesses were overdue. This translates into a daily additional interest charge of more than Pounds 4m. The problem seems a peculiarly British one. Many other countries already provide an automatic right to interest on overdue payments. A recent study revealed that payments in Germany are on average made two and a half times more promptly than in the UK. The present state of British law makes no sense. If a business chasing a debt commences legal proceedings, a right to interest then dates back to the date on which payment was due. But without legal proceedings, in the absence of a specific contractual term, there is no such right. It is now 100 years since the judges of the House of Lords suggested legislation could be enacted to remove this anomaly. Judges have rightly described the present law as unjust. The problem hits small businesses hardest. These businesses account for 17 per cent of gross domestic product. Perhaps even more significantly, they provide 35 per cent of private sector employment. They are, despite the effects of the recession, a dynamic sector of the economy which we must foster during the recovery. Small businesses are more heavily dependent than large ones on borrowing to finance working capital. They have a minimum of administration, and the burden of chasing late payment is a distraction for management. Sometimes they are part of a vicious circle, forced to pay late because they are not being paid by their customers. Government and industry acknowledge the problem. In the last Budget it was proposed that public companies should disclose their payment terms in their accounts. The Confederation of British Industry introduced its payment code more than a year ago, yet still many businesses and, indeed, sometimes central and local government, fail to comply properly with their contractual obligations. I believe the root cause of the problem is cultural. Too many businesses consider it acceptable, and some even consider it astute practice, not to pay their bills on time. Lack of sanction against conduct of this kind positively encourages such behaviour. I sense a wider recognition that legislation is now needed to change the culture. More business groups, such as the Forum for Private Business, are arguing for a right of interest, and an increasing number of banks supports the idea. A recent cross-party survey of MPs suggested that 83 per cent thought the time had come for a statutory right to interest on debts paid late. What are the objections? Some say there is no point in encouraging litigation or clogging up the courts. I do not see this as a likely effect of any change. What it would do, as has legislation in the equal opportunities and race relations fields, is give a strong impetus to a change in culture. An automatic right to interest would act as a practical disincentive to late payment. It is sometimes also said that dominant purchasers would respond by extending the credit period. Some might try to, but if large suppliers adopted this cynical tactic, adverse publicity would quickly flow. Neither would compliance impose an inappropriate burden on business. Only those that failed to honour their obligations would suffer a cost. Such a law could operate simply and clearly. There is a clear precedent in the Inland Revenue's right to interest on overdue tax. There is surely the same basic fairness in ensuring contractual debts due to businesses are paid on time or, if not, that compensation is made. The author is chairman of National Westminster Bank</p>

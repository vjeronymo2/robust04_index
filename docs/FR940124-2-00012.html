Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an applicant not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&amp;TA) rendered. Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue.

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / BMA gathers opponents of pay reforms Doctors will step up opposition to proposals for performance-related pay in the National Health Service at a special conference in London tomorrow. The British Medical Association has called representatives from every hospital in the country to the meeting. They are due to discuss an issue that is bringing the medical profession into renewed confrontation with the government. Ministers have declared that a shift from the NHS's centralised pay structure to locally determined, performance-based pay must start this year. Mr Alan Langlands, NHS chief executive, has written to local managers of hospitals and other services telling them to prepare plans for the change by October, and have local pay machinery in place by February. The BMA regards the timetable as 'impractically short' and the principle of performance pay as 'totally inappropriate to the work of the medical profession'. This week's conference will seek to set the BMA's opposition in the context of wider public-sector concerns about the weakening of centralised pay structures. Representatives of both the Police Federation and the First Division Association, the senior civil servants' union, will address the meeting. A BMA briefing paper, circulated to its local negotiating committees in advance of the conference, says that performance-related pay for hospital doctors would lead to increased emphasis on financial objectives, resulting in a greater focus on the number of patients treated rather than the quality of care. It says: 'Local performance pay could be used by hospital managers to pressurise consultants into compliance with the hospital's business needs - for example giving greater priority to the patients of GP fundholders, or doing a larger number of minor operations rather than more serious cases which might generate less money for the hospital.' Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has said that local pay arrangements would encourage and promote good clinical practice.</p>

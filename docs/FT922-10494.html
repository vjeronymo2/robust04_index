			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Policing problems ahead over quality of the distilled essence - The operating and financial review for company accounts should be popular THE WIDESPREAD welcome for the operating and financial review proposed yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board is likely to be matched only by the problems of effective enforcement. The review is designed to extract and boil down the details of accounts and present them in a way that is easy to understand. Indeed, for lay readers, it may well replace the accounts themselves as the main point of reference. It will appeal to many preparers of accounts for at least two reasons. First, while it places great emphasis on presenting a balanced, detailed commentary on a company, it is deliberately vague in specifying exactly what information will be required. Second, it is not legally enforceable. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, says the board would have preferred the review to be an accounting standard which could be policed by its financial reporting review panel. But because it is not part of the accounts and goes far beyond existing accounting practice, it has had to settle for a voluntary statement instead. Both points place the review in stark contrast to its equivalents in the US and Canada, where the so-called 'management discussion and analysis' is a mandatory part of the annual report, and has been criticised for being brief and uninformative as a result. Mr Nigel Stapleton, chairman of the technical committee of the Hundred Group of leading companies' finance directors, says: 'We are certainly more positive than negative about the review. We want something that is interesting, readable and relevant, not turbid, mechanistic and useless.' The board is relying on the power of moral suasion to put the review into practice. It hopes that bodies such as the Stock Exchange, the Confederation of British Industry and the Hundred Group will apply pressure on individual companies to embrace both the principle and the spirit of the guidelines. If it is widely adopted and consistently applied, it may, at some time in the future, fall within the realms of normal accounting practice, when it could be legally enforced. In the meantime, it could lobby for two possibilities. The Stock Exchange could insist on adoption of the review from quoted companies - in the same way that management discussion and analysis is required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Alternatively, auditors could be required to verify the review, to ensure that it is accurate. If it contained a sentence saying that the text had been produced in line with the guidelines, auditors might be obliged to comment publicly if they disagreed or felt that it did not fairly reflect their own understanding of the company. Failing that, the board must rely on a more gradual, voluntary adoption of the review, coupled with criticism from investors, analysts, journalists and other users of accounts to bring the laggards more in line with its principles. The board has been cautious to build early support for the review, by showing early drafts to outside organisations, including the Hundred Group, before issuing the discussion document for wider consultation yesterday. The stamp of these preliminary talks with industry may explain much of the thrust of the document: it places more emphasis on companies looking backwards to the last year, rather than forwards to its survival. It also leaves companies wide leeway to explain what they consider are the most important factors influencing their development, rather than any mandatory requirements of factors to be listed. The scope of the review is still ambitious, however. A handful of companies  -such as Cadbury Schweppes, BOC and Shell - already exhibit some of the points the review is trying to achieve. But even these statements have limitations, while the vast majority of reports fall far short of what will be required. Only later in the autumn, when the formally worded exposure draft appears, will users be able to judge how strict the final requirements of the statement are likely to be.</p>

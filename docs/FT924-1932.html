			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Vodafone At first glance the 2 per cent rise in Vodafone's shares looks an excessive reaction to its Australian licence. The service will cost Pounds 200m to develop and is unlikely to show a profit before 1996. Perhaps the market just likes to see the company diversifying. Doubtless it would be even more pleased if a German licence was granted too, though that will not follow automatically from the Australian award. Without diversification, Vodafone would have no long-term hope of maintaining the cracking growth it has established in the UK. In theory it should not falter in the short term. Price adjustments to attract low volume users have generated extra revenues, though not much extra profit, and Vodafone is geared to economic recovery. But competitive price cutting could revive after Christmas, and the regulator's eye may eventually be caught by Vodafone's extraordinary returns. Diversification provides some protection against these risks, but investors might remember the slow pay-off before marking the shares up much further.</p>

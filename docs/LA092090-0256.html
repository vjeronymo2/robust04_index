			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NFL NOTES;  </P> <P> LEAGUE BANS LIONS' TAYLOR FOR FAILING DRUG TEST  </P> <P> Cornerback Terry Taylor of the Detroit Lions became the fourth NFL player to be  banned from the league for life today when the league banished him after he  tested positive for illegal substances for a third time.  </P> <P> But Taylor, 29, who is in his seventh season, can apply for reinstatement in a  year. He was suspended for four games in 1988 while playing for Seattle.  </P> <P> A first-round draft pick in 1984, Taylor was starter for most of his seasons  with the Seahawks before being traded to the Lions in 1989 for running back  James Jones. He had 16 lifetime interceptions, including two he returned for  touchdowns.  </P> <P> The other players banned for life under the NFL's drug program -- which affects  players testing positive three times -- are running back Tony Collins, then  with Indianapolis, in 1988; defensive end Dexter Manley of Washington last  November and defensive end Frank Warren of New Orleans earlier this year.  </P> <P> Collins, who spent most of his career with New England, was reinstated this  season and signed with Miami. He made the team in training camp but was  released a week ago.  </P> <P> New York Giants running back Dave Meggett, apparently upset over his current  two-year contract, skipped a team practice, according to published reports.  </P> <P> Meggett, who set a team record with 1,807 all-purpose yards and made the Pro  Bowl as rookie last season, failed to report to Wednesday's practice, placing  his status for Sunday's game against the Miami Dolphins in question.  </P> <P> Tony Agnone, Meggett's Baltimore-based agent, told New York Newsday that his  client was ill. "I don't think he was feeling well," Agnone said. "I think it  was a touch of the virus."  </P> <P> Agnone told the New York Post that Meggett is expected to return to practice  today. He told the New York Times that before this season's training camp the  Giants had agreed to discuss a contract extension, but failed to do so.  </P> <P> The Giants placed cornerback Mark Collins on injured reserve Wednesday with a  sprained right ankle. He will be out for at least three games.  </P> <P> Collins won't be eligible to practice with the team for at least four weeks.  </P></p>

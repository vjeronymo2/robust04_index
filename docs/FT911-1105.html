			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Howard praises small business growth THE NUMBER of small companies is continuing to grow in spite of the recession, Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, told small-business leaders yesterday. Mr Howard sought to counter reports of a rising tide of business failures by disclosing provisional figures showing that the number of small businesses grew by an average of 800 a week last year. Although that is a steep fall from the growth rate of 1,700 a week in 1989, it is still higher than the average rate of business formation over the whole of the last decade. Mr Howard, launching the Department of Employment's 1991 report on the small companies' sector of the economy, said the recession was providing further proof of the flexibility and adaptability of small businesses. The report shows that there was 29 per cent growth in the number of small businesses between 1979 and 1989, from about 1.3m to more than 1.6m. Self-employment rose by more than 70 per cent from just under 2m to 3.25m. New registrations of businesses for value added tax are running at about 16 per cent of the total stock of businesses, while deregistrations are running at about 11 per cent. Even with the rise in business failures because of the recession, insolvencies account for about 1 per cent of the stock of businesses, Mr Howard said. Bank funding to businesses with a turnover of less than Pounds 1m doubled to about Pounds 40bn a year over the past five years. Mr Howard said the network of local Training and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales would play an increasingly central role in developing and delivering policies to promote the creation of small companies, to help owners manage the growth of their businesses and to encourage improved training within small companies. Mr Howard said the Tecs were creating local business leadership of a quality never before seen in the UK. They would work with the government to develop the sector. Small Firms in Britain 1991. HMSO.

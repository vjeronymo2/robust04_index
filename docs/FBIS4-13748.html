			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 23 Apr -- In an interview published here  today, Kuwaiti Defense Minister Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud denied  that there were any current inclinations to reshuffle and change  some commanders and officers in the Kuwaiti Army.    Al-Hamud told AL-ANBA newspaper that he was positively not  "thinking about that during the current stage when Kuwaiti  forces needed to concentrate on working and exerting efforts.    But he indicated that such measures could be taken in a very  limited form with the interest in the work in mind and according  to the needs of the next stage.    The defense minister clarified that he would settle the  issue  of summoning the ministry's commanders and officers by the  National Assembly's fact-finding committee when he meets its  members on Tuesday.    Al-Hamud said he would not allow commanders and officers  from  the ministry to be "dragged in" at any time without the presence  of justifications and reasons for such a move, and would not  allow them to be summoned just to be interrogated as witnesses  in trivial cases or on suspicion of committing something or  other.    On the other hand, the defense minister said that there had  been offers by countries and arms factories to provide the  Kuwaiti Armed Forces with weapons, some of which were advanced.  These weapons would enter the service of the Kuwaiti Army and  could be the first to be introduced in the region. He indicated  that relevant committees in the Kuwaiti Army were studying these  offers. He said that new arms would be acquired according to  the needs of the Kuwaiti forces and their various weapons.</p>

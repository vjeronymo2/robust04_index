			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Bringing the patient to market: The progress of US health care reform IT WAS meant to arrive in the first 100 days. Then it was delayed to the middle of this month. The latest word is that President Bill Clinton's health care reform plan will be sent to Capitol Hill in mid-June. But few Washington insiders would be surprised by further delay. The plan is supposedly being held back to avoid a legislative logjam. The White House is reluctant to unveil the biggest upheaval in domestic policy since President Lyndon Johnson's 'Great Society' of the 1960s while sceptical congressional committees are fully occupied analysing (and frequently amending) the fine print of the Clinton economic plan. But the delays also reflect the monumental complexity and political sensitivity of the challenge confronting Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr Ira Magaziner, the workaholic White House aide who has emerged as the true intellectual leader of her 500-strong task force. Tall and frizzy haired, Mr Magaziner looks and sounds like a madcap inventor. But for his personal friendship with the Clintons, he would still be an obscure Rhode Island management consultant. Instead he is playing the leading role in reshaping an industry that accounts for nearly 14 per cent of US gross domestic product and that touches the lives of every family and business in the nation. His historic task is not merely to produce an economically coherent reform but one that can survive an onslaught from dozens of powerful interest groups, including doctors and the private insurance industry. By all accounts the going is heavy. The goals are clear enough: to reduce the growth of healthcare costs, which threaten to bankrupt both state and federal government, and to guarantee a basic package of benefits for all Americans, which means extending cover to the 35m people (15 per cent of the population) who lack health insurance. But the means to these ends remain uncertain. Since the final stages of the election campaign last year, Mr Clinton has professed support for a reform known as 'managed competition'. The idea is to enroll people (including the currently uninsured population) in regional intermediaries known as health insurance purchasing co-operatives. These would buy care on behalf of individuals and companies from competing networks of private sector physicians, hospitals and insurance companies. The theory is that their market clout would enable them to exert much greater downward pressure on costs, while maintaining quality, than is possible in today's fragmented health care market. This still appears to be the general route favoured by the task force, although it is chary of the language of managed competition, which was invented by right-of-centre economists. Senior officials talk of 'health alliances' rather than purchasing co-operatives and emphasise guaranteed access to care via new 'health insurance' cards rather than market discipline. They also claim the reforms would not restrict individuals' choice of doctors even though most systems of managed care, such as pre-paid Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs), achieve cost savings partly by limiting patient choice. But the managed competition framework (whatever it may be called) leaves a host of questions unanswered. How much flexibility will be left to individual states, some of which favour different types of reform? How will the cost, which could exceed Dollars 100bn a year, be financed? What will be included in the guaranteed package of minimum benefits? Will it embrace expensive new items such as mental health benefits and long-term community and nursing home care? Mr Clinton will face a political storm if he includes abortion, yet if he excludes it many women's access to it could be restricted. How much of the health care market will be subsumed in the new system? It seems certain to absorb Medicaid, the existing publicly funded regime for the poor. But there is controversy about Medicare, the system that covers 35m elderly Americans. The administration says nobody will be forced out of Medicare, yet it clearly wants to encourage a switch into managed competition because the elderly account for a disproportionate fraction of health care spending. And what about big companies? If they too stay outside the proposed health alliances, the new system might end up little different from the status quo. Equally controversial is the way that cash will be channelled from companies and individuals to the purchasing co-operatives. The task force is considering replacing current premiums with what amounts to a payroll tax on employers and employees. This offers great administrative simplicity and a promising way of capping spending. With a payroll tax, the money available to purchasing co-operatives for buying the minimum package of benefits could not grow faster than corporate incomes unless the tax rate were raised. However, a payroll tax would be vigorously opposed by Republicans and many conservative Democrats as a job-destroying step towards Canadian 'socialised' medicine. Mr Clinton's dilemma is that root-and-branch reforms offering the greatest savings are the least likely to win broad congressional support. Thus while the chances of reform being enacted next year are good, the fundamental problems may not be adequately addressed during Mr Clinton's first term.</p>

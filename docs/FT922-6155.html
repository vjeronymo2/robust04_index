			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Frank words from French entrepreneur: Jean-Luc Lagardere of Hachette and Matra talks to William Dawkins Jean-Luc Lagardere's image as one of France's top self-made men has recently taken a knock, but he is as resilient as ever and swears his strategy remains valid. Mr Lagardere almost takes relish in countering the widespread criticism of his latest scheme, which he argues has been poorly understood since being unveiled earlier this month. Unkind spirits have condemned the merger of the two companies he controls - Matra, the transport, telecommunications and defence group, with Hachette, France's leading international publisher - as panic. Some see it as a way to use profitable Matra to pay for the FFr3.55bn (Pounds 359.7m) losses clocked up by La Cinq, the now defunct television station which Mr Lagardere bought for Hachette 18 months ago. The 64-year-old Mr Lagardere recognises this as the most serious setback in his career. Others see it as an eccentric attempt to find common interests between unrelated businesses or a cynical attempt to fend off possible bids. Mr Lagardere forcefully denies these claims. 'People take me for either an idiot or a hooligan. I believe I am neither one nor the other,' he says. 'You don't tie someone with a broken leg to a healthy person and expect them to go faster . . . I won't tell you that there is a synergy between magazines and missiles . . . but that's not the point.' So what is the point? The big advantage of the merger is that it will allow both sides to draw cashflow centrally for investments in each of the nine activities in which they are jointly present, he says. There will be big head office and administrative savings, but that is a secondary gain. The project is in line with his mostly successful business strategy, Mr Lagardere insists. He has always believed that any business that cannot guarantee very high sales volumes must diversify to survive. It must be ready to adapt, to take risks, close lossmakers when the risks get too great, seek partners where it can no longer compete alone  - as Matra is doing in telecommunications - and move into new areas. The merger will help both groups by making them financially stronger and more flexible, he argues. 'I have always been convinced that one cannot make a group live eternally on a single product. You need an enormous effect of mass to do that . . . Look at Dassault,' he says, referring to the aircraft group where he trained as a designer of prototypes in the 1950s. 'Nobody could have succeeded better at what they are doing, and yet they have not sold a single military aircraft outside France for the past four years.' Mr Lagardere's Dassault years marked him in all kinds of ways. His engineering roots are evident in the way he sketches graphs to illustrate his points. The experience also bought him into close contact with Matra, then a single product company supplying missiles to Dassault, now much more diversified with innovations including the Espace family and the VAL automatic metro. Matra's controlling shareholder invited him to take over as managing director at the age of 34, which Mr Lagardere did on condition that he got carte blanche. The same shareholder supported Mr Lagardere's takeover of Hachette in 1980. From the start, Mr Lagardere has been driven by two main impulses. First, the urge to create a great company, which he attributes to a passion to redress France's wartime humiliation; and second, the realisation that as an entrepreneur he must take investment risks, but cut his losses if the company's life is threatened. Clearly, he argues, multi-product companies can spread risks more easily. 'When we took over La Cinq, it was losing money, but I reckoned that these were not losses but investments. I have always said that once an investment becomes a loss, it is time to cut. If I had continued with La Cinq in 1992, the fatal risk for the group would have been real.' He points out that Hachette will be easily recapitalised before the merger with Matra, so there is no question of robbing the electronics group to bail out Hachette. Neither was there any question of hoping that the French state would bail out the television station. Mr Lagardere has always taken pride in belonging to none of the political or financial power networks that bind corporate France together. So he could expect no special favours. 'I have never stepped into that world, never. I have always known how to work with the establishment, but I keep my distance,' he says. In other countries, a La Cinq-type disaster might have provoked the resignation of the chairman. Yet Mr Lagardere has, if anything, strengthened his position by putting the new merged group under the control of a societe en commandite par actions, a share partnership in which the partners, headed by Mr Lagardere, have unlimited personal liability for losses but are almost unsackable. 'On the subject of resignation, even in England it's not so simple . . . I used to have a motor racing team with Jackie Stewart as driver. It happened that one day he lost a Grand Prix. But we didn't replace him at the next race because he had won 10 previously.' If chairmen were sacked every time they made a mistake, 'business would become a game of massacre, in which those who succeeded would be the ones who did nothing. My idea of business is that one must dare to take risks,' he says. Mr Lagardere dislikes pressure for short-term performance, something which he could produce by selling assets. 'Unlike some people who I will not name, that is not my idea of entrepreneurship,' he says. Suggestions that the commandite structure artificially protects management overlook the fact that the partners' personal liabilities are very real, he argues. 'For me, it is a profession of faith to make money and to stay independent . . . Institutional shareholders should say to themselves that Lagardere is obliged to make money, for all his personal fortune is in it. Unless he is mad or a masochist, he must make money.' Whether or not you believe his strategy of pooling his businesses to give them the strength to diversify, Mr Lagardere is and will remain a driven man.</p>

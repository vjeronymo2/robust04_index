			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Bank to resume Kenyan aid THE WORLD Bank said yesterday it had agreed to resume aid to Kenya which was suspended in November 1991 after the government failed to honour economic reform commitments, Reuter reports from Nairobi. The decision in effect ended a bitter row between Kenya and western donor institutions and followed a devaluation by the government on Tuesday of the shilling, the second in two months. Mr Edward Jaycox, the bank's vice-president for Africa, said a tranche of some Dollars 170m (Pounds 112.5m) in quick-disbursal aid was immediately available from a previous agreement and would clear the way for future financing. 'Kenya has met the conditions. The president and his economic team have reaffirmed their commitment to reforms in a very convincing way,' Mr Jaycox said. He added that the World Bank was now in a position to resume financial support and he expected an agreement within the next 10 days. The government had agreed to reverse a rapid increase in money supply and to bring inflation, now running at 40 per cent, under control. World Bank officials said the agreement should trigger more support from the International Monetary Fund and western donor nations, who also cut off aid in November 1991.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / 'Leftwing elitists' take flak from victorious Republicans The spirit of political co-operation so evident on the morning after the US mid-term elections was fast evaporating yesterday, mostly because victorious Republicans could not resist taking potshots at President Bill Clinton. Several Republicans also warned the president not to frustrate implementation of their legislative agenda on issues ranging from increased defence spending and deeper cuts in social programmes to cuts in foreign aid. The most provocative comments came from Congressman Newt Gingrich, virtually certain to become the next Speaker of the House and - mostly  - still trying to be magnanimous in victory. He promised, for example, no longer to call the president an enemy of 'normal' Americans, a favourite pre-election epithet. However, what he gave in 24 hours filled with media interviews he also took away. He described Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary as 'counter-culture McGovernicks', a derogatory reference to the leftwing Democratic presidential candidate of 1972. The current White House, he said, was dominated by 'leftwing elitists'. Warming to his familiar conservative theme, he said: 'There are profound things that went wrong, starting with the Great Society (President Lyndon Johnson's social legislation) and the counter-culture, and until we address them head-on we're going to have these problems.' Mr Clinton, he said, would be 'very, very dumb' to try to stand in the way of the conservative agenda he intended to get through Congress, including the reintroduction of voluntary prayer in schools by a constitutional amendment next year. Mr Bill Archer a congressman from Texas who is likely to be the next chairman of the House ways and means committee, also expanded on the Republican tactical approach: 'We can't really get much of anything done which the president does not want to sign, other than by constitutional amendment.' Senator Jesse Helms, the arch-conservative in line to take over the foreign relations committee, promised deep cuts in foreign aid, including US contributions to the United Nations and Nato. Mr Gingrich also warned, only half-jokingly, that the Republicans could now frustrate the president in other ways. Senator Robert Dole, as majority leader, could control every appointment Mr Clinton sent up for ratification, he said. The president drew his own line in the sand at his Wednesday election postmortem by promising to work with the new Republican majority in Congress, but not to permit a return to the economic policies of the 1980s. Mr Clinton yesterday humorously acknowledged the force of some Republican positions. Imposing limits on the number of terms members of Congress may serve, he said with a smile, 'looks better to me every day'.

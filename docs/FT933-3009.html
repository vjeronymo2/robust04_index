			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / IFC infrastructure investments increase by 65% THE INTERNATIONAL Finance Corporation is rapidly expanding its support of private sector infrastructure investment in developing nations to help meet an annual demand for finance of about Dollars 150bn (Pounds 97.4bn) in the sector in the current decade. Sir William Ryrie, vice president of the World Bank affiliate, said the IFC approved a 65 per cent increase to Dollars 379m in its own investments in private sector infrastructure in the financial year to June. The past year's investments in such projects as private power generation, telecommunications, transport and environmental services were concentrated in Latin America and Asia. They amounted to about half the corporation's total infrastructure investment since it was set up in 1956. Presenting the IFC's annual report, Sir William said it intended to put about a quarter of its investments into private infrastructure in the years ahead in the expectation that every dollar of investment approved on the IFC's own account would mobilise Dollars 9 from other investors. In the past business year it approved a record Dollars 2.1bn in finance for 185 private sector projects worth a total of Dollars 17bn in 54 developing nations. However, net income declined to Dollars 142m from Dollars 180m, partly because of reduced returns on its liquid assets as a result of lower short-term interest rates, and partly because of a drop in income on the loan portfolio due to war and economic uncertainty in the former Yugoslavia and parts of Africa. The corporation expects to approve investments of about Dollars 2.4bn in the current financial year, up from Dollars 400m in fiscal 1984. Sir William retires at the end of 1993. He will be succeeded by Mr Jannik Lindbaek, president and chief executive of the Nordic Investment Bank.</p>

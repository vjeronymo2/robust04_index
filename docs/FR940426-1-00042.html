			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) By acquiring any interest in real or personal property owned, occupied, or used by the retailer in the conduct of the business; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) By furnishing, giving, renting, lending, or selling to the retailer, any equipment, fixtures, signs, supplies, money, or other things of value, subject to the exceptions prescribed by regulations, having due regard to public health, the quantity and value of articles involved, established trade customs not contrary to the public interest and the purposes of the subsection; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) By paying or crediting the retailer for any advertising display or distribution service; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) By guaranteeing any loan or repayment of any financial obligation of the retailer; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) By extending to the retailer credit for a period in excess of the credit period usual and customary to the industry for the particular class of transactions as ascertained by the Secretary and prescribed by regulation; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) By requiring the retailer to take and dispose of a certain quota of any of such products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Retailer independence can be threatened in a tied-house arrangement between an industry member and a retailer when the arrangement involves a continuing business relationship which restricts the retailer's ability to make free economic choices on which brands of products to purchase. In effect,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition is restricted because the retailer who is dependent on or tied to an industry member cannot make free and rational business choices on whether to make a current purchase from another industry member based on current business considerations such as consumer demand or lower prices offered by the competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations identify threats to a retailer's independence which include: A wholesaler's use of partial ownership of a retailer to control the retailer's purchases of alcoholic beverages, sales where the wholesaler conditions the purchase of one distilled spirits product on the retailer purchasing another distilled spirits product at the same time, and wholesaler control over the retailer through controlling the resetting of the products on a retailer's premises. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Slotting fees are also included in this proposed category. These fees are paid to a retailer in order to obtain premium shelf space. Data and information on the effect of such fees is requested, rather than solely statements of preference by a particular industry member. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the material relating to consignment sales, the prohibition on other than a bona fide sale is defined to include sales in connection with which the industry member bears the cost of display by purchasing or renting a trade buyer's shelf space to be occupied by such products. Accordingly, slotting fees in these situations are within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consignment sale proscriptions. Comments are sought on whether the slotting fee should be addressed in both tied-house and consignment sale regulations or are more appropriately covered by only one of the provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the practices listed in proposed &sect;6.152, ATF will be required to determine whether the practice results in the retailer purchasing less than it otherwise would have of a competitor's product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations also identify certain practices that will not result in exclusion. These are the practices allowed under the regulatory exceptions to the tied-house provisions (safe harbors). For instance, the proposed regulations recognize that certain retail activities of a temporary nature, such as weekend events and community festivals, are also so minor in the retail marketplace so as not to justify Federal intervention. (Revisions to these regulatory exceptions are also proposed in this notice and discussed in detail below.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Commercial Bribery <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 105(c) of the FAA Act makes it unlawful for an industry member to induce through any of the following means, any trade buyer engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages, to purchase any such products from such person to the exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in whole or in part of alcoholic beverages sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, provided one of the three jurisdictional clauses is met: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) By commercial bribery; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) By offering or giving any bonus, premium, or compensation to any officer, or employee, or representative of the trade buyer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Commercial bribery situations involve the receipt of money or a premium by an officer, employee, or representative of the trade buyer. Payment made directly to business entities ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> the corporation, partnership, or individual owning the business) for the use of the business does not constitute a commercial bribe. The independence of the trade buyer is threatened in a commercial bribery situation because the officer, employee, or representative of the trade buyer is making a purchasing decision as a result of the money or premium received personally and not based on business or marketing factors which further the interests of the trade buyer itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

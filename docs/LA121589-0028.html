			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN JERUSALEM, THE LIGHT OF PEACE FLICKERS;  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST: THE HOLY CITY IS RELATIVELY TRANQUIL, BUT THE INTIFADA DEFIES  SETTLEMENT. AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN MORE HINDRANCE THAN HELP.  </P> <P> Whom the gods would destroy they first tempt to resolve the Arab-Israeli  conflict, Irving Kristol once observed.  </P> <P> George Bush and James Baker should be extremely wary of the political quicksand  into which they are attempting to lead Israelis, Egyptians and  still-unidentified Palestinians. The probability is that Bush and Baker will  fail in their attempt to promote an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue desired by  neither Israelis nor Palestinians.  </P> <P> The Administration has already strained Israeli trust and American good will.  The White House's recent very public delay in granting a presidential  appointment to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was an effort to pressure  and embarrass Israel. The refusal of the United States to provide Israel clear  and complete information about Egypt's responses to Baker's five points creates  more mistrust. The extraordinary request by the United States that leaders of  the Israeli opposition Labor Party be included in Israel's team preparing for  talks in Washington was widely regarded as insulting.  </P> <P> Why have Bush and Baker acted this way? Are they trying to demonstrate to a  disbelieving Arab world that the United States is neutral between Israelis and  the Palestinians? Do they want to intensify disagreement within Shamir's  government in the hope that it will be replaced by a more tractable Labor  government? Were they unable to get from Egypt a response to Baker's five  points that would be minimally acceptable to the government of Israel? Is it  possible that the Bush/Baker team, which is correctly sensitive to Mikhail  Gorbachev's pride and Deng Xiao-ping's pride, does not understand that Israelis  also are proud?  </P> <P> Always poor, prospects for settlement have become even bleaker in the last  year, complicated by the Palestine Liberation Organization's declaration of an  independent state, by the withdrawal of King Hussein from a role in the West  Bank, by the rise of Muslim fundamentalism and by the extension of Syria's  power.  </P> <P> The PLO declaration was intended to make an independent state the only  alternative to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. King Hussein's  "divorce" from the West Bank underscored this narrowed choice by removing "the  Jordanian option" for a Palestinian solution. But "the Jordanian option" was  precisely the "solution" preferred by Israeli as well as West Bank moderates.  Its removal weakened the case of Israelis ready to abandon "Judea and Samaria"  to the right kind of neighboring power.  </P> <P> The effort to present Yasser Arafat as the "moderate" solution was never very  persuasive, either in Israel or the United States. The case for dealing with  him declines further as his own power wanes. The spread of Muslim  fundamentalism on the West Bank and in Gaza and the growing power of Arafat's  principal rival, Syria's Hafez Assad, mean that Arafat is not in a position to  guarantee peace -- even if he were inclined to do so. Events in Lebanon and  Jordan have shown that in this area, tendencies to factionalism, extremism and  violence are more powerful than Arafat or the Arab League.  </P> <P> In Israel they're describing 1989 as the year the intifada turned on itself.  The big development was inter-Arab violence, with the number of Palestinian  "collaborators" hacked to death by other Palestinians variously estimated from  118 to 160. Obviously these "collaborators" also testify to the PLO's problem  in commanding the loyalty of all West Bankers.  </P> <P> But there is an oasis of relative tranquility where Arabs and Israelis meet in  peace if not in harmony. That is Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Life in Jerusalem is nearly normal. The intifada still calls the Arab merchants  of East Jerusalem out on strike each day. The merchants respond. They close  their shops at noon and do not reopen until the next morning. But the  disruption of life is minimal. Street vendors have multiplied. Local  inhabitants do their shopping in the morning. Schools are open. Public meetings  are held. The streets are safer than those of most American cities. There were  only 11 homicides in the first 11 months of this year, about half of them  related to politics.  </P> <P> The peace process that pacified Jerusalem is Mayor Teddy Kollek's endless  effort and boundless commitment to provide basic municipal services and  fairness to all of Jerusalem's inhabitants.  </P> <P> Even Kollek is concerned today about the future of this city he so passionately  loves. Jerusalem is not mentioned in Baker's five points, he notes, but Arafat  has said again and again that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a  Palestinian state.  </P> <P> It cannot be, Kollek vows. He is ready to give Arab citizens of Jerusalem their  own schools, public services of all kinds and their own vote in municipal  affairs. He respects their right to remain Jordanian citizens. He promises to  accord Arabs all the rights a democracy guarantees its citizens.  </P> <P> But even Teddy Kollek has his own non-negotiable demand. "We shan't give up any  part of Jerusalem, not under any circumstances."  </P> <P> Most Americans are not neutral between the non-negotiable demands of Teddy  Kollek and Yasser Arafat: The one is a paragon of democracy; the other is a man  who opposes elections and proclaims himself "the sole representative of the  Palestinian people."  </P> <P> Maybe before Bush and Baker take on the Arab-Israeli conflict, they should  practice on something easier, like settling the problem of Cyprus.  </P></p>

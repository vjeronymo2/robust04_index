			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Fall in average hours worked Average hours worked fell slightly in the year to autumn 1993. This underlines that in spite of the increase in part-time jobs, which has helped reduce unemployment, there was no net increase in work last year, says a Trades Union Congress analysis. UK unemployment will fall by about 15,000 a month this year to reach 2.6m by the end of the year, says a report by merchant bank Morgan Grenfell.</p>

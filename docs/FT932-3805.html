			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Bonn's 'king makers' struggle for a role THE would-be 'king makers' of the German political system, members of the little Free Democratic Party, were yesterday summoned to crown their own prince. Like all the best coronations, the outcome was never in serious doubt. But the atmosphere was a little subdued. Mr Klaus Kinkel, former civil servant, one-time head of Germany's secret service, and now the foreign minister, was the only name on the ballot paper for the party leadership. It was all too much for at least one angry delegate at the annual party conference in Munster: it reminded him of the bad old days in East Germany's Communist Party, he declared. But the celebrations had to go on. The party which made - and broke - the ruling coalitions of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, is struggling to keep its head above the German electoral water. In opting for Mr Kinkel, who has been a party member for barely two years, it is gambling on a fresh face and a man renowned for often undiplomatic plain speaking. The FDP still plays a key role in the ruling coalition in Bonn, way beyond its national support of barely 8 per cent. But electoral arithmetic suggest that a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats is a much more likely outcome at next year's elections. Both the big parties are languishing with support at around 35 per cent. If the FDP cannot break through the 10 per cent barrier, it cannot offer either the prospect of a parliamentary majority in a coalition. Mr Kinkel knows that all too well. Today he will set out his strategy to break the electoral deadlock. As for the man who might have been king, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister who was forced to resign in January over a silly scandal, he did his best to put a brave face on the occasion. He made one last bid to keep the role of 'king maker'. He called on Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, and still the real power behind the party throne, to accept a nomination as German state president next year. It was not to be. Perhaps it is all part of the inscrutable tactics of the man who remains Germany's most popular politician. But yesterday Mr Genscher was adamant. He is not available as a candidate for the presidency.</p>

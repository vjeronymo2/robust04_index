			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The UN peacekeepers in Bosnia are becoming the  scapegoats of the Serbs. In the suburbs of Sarajevo, French  soldiers were surrounded this afternoon by Serb troops backed up  by a tank. The peacekeepers were guarding an arsenal where  heavy weapons, handed over by the Bosnian Serbs a month ago to  avoid NATO air strikes, are stored. [passage omitted] France is  refusing to allow the UN forces in Bosnia to be accused of  partiality, but French Defense Minister Francois Leotard firmly  maintains his position, replying to Frederic Carbone:    [Begin recording] [Leotard] There is indisputably a new kind  of tension that has become apparent around Sarajevo following  the air strikes by the allied aircraft on Gorazde, indisputably.  This tension is bearing down on the French forces today,  because we have many soldiers in Sarajevo today, and it  manifests itself in many different ways. We are in the process  of holding talks with the Serbs to ensure that the provocative  attitudes, the refusals, the obstructions, disappear.    [Carbone] Are you not tempted to say to the Serbs: Enough is  enough?    [Leotard] Yes, of course, when the allied aircraft carried  out the air strikes on Gorazde this was indeed what we were  saying, and France is of course participating in these  operations, France is taking part in these observation flights,  and some day you will perhaps also see, alas, operations of this  kind that will be aimed at Serb targets if they continue with  this unacceptable practice of insanely continuing with ethnic  cleansing.

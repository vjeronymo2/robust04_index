			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Economy Peter Magvasi by Karol </F> Bohunicky; place and date not given: "Trade Must Have the  Decisive Word"]    [Text] In the state administration, there is probably no  other sector like the Ministry of the Economy, on which all  others are dependent. To put it differently, if we are  successful in the economic sphere, we will be successful in the  other spheres, too. Such is the "package" of responsibilities  of the new minister of economy, Peter Magvasi. At the beginning  of our interview, we were interested in his first impressions as  minister.    [Magvasi] This ministry has been administered by  industrialists. They are used to making rational decisions,  without unnecessary emotions. In the interests of this sector,  this continuity should be preserved even after the personnel  changes. This is what is really happening, thanks to the correct  course of action taken by my predecessor, Mr. Ducky. We have  projects and tasks that go beyond the time horizon of one  government. I will pass on to my successor many of the things I  inherited recently. This is the nature of the sector I have  taken over while searching for as much information as possible.    [Bohunicky] What are your priorities?    [Magvasi] From the viewpoint of the overall concept of the  activity of the ministry, I will focus, above all, on foreign  trade. Foreign trade as an "institution" did not exist in  Slovakia for well-known reasons. Of course, we have several  starting points here, but the process of gradually establishing  foreign trade must become much more intensive. This is what I  want to focus on as much as possible. In the past, this  ministry's main task was to administer industrial sectors. This  trend will be replaced with trading activity. In the final  effect, this will essentially influence the activity of said  sectors and make them more efficient, I believe.    [Bohunicky] What are your problems?    [Magvasi] One of our greatest problems is trade with the  Russian Federation. This is the cardinal problem of the Slovak  Republic's trade balance because the deficit we have is mainly  caused by trade with Russia. I consider a solution to this  problem to be a strategic condition for economic efficiency of  the Slovak Republic. At the same time, I am aware of our need  for permanent and advantageous raw-material resources from  Russia.    [Bohunicky] Are these problems as serious as the problem of  the Customs Union [with the Czech Republic]?    [Magvasi] Certainly. This is another sphere that is  exceptionally important for the Slovak economy. Personally, I  am extremely interested in its better functioning. I have to  say, however, that the Customs Union is (or should be) a two-way  street. We need Czech partners, and the Czechs need Slovak  partners. Unlike other European countries that can boast of a  high degree of mutual cooperation, we have a unique advantage:  Our technological standards are absolutely identical, which  represents a high degree of integration. A technical drawing is  as readable in Cheb [Czech Republic] as in Svidnik [Slovak  Republic]. This gives us very valuable technological links that  we should not fail to make use of.</p>

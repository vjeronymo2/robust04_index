			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Gloomy Frederick Cooper halves dividend FREDERICK COOPER, the West Midlands-based group with interests in architectural hardware, specialist coatings and electrical products, is halving its total dividend in acknowledgement that there would be no rapid end to the recession. 'We are taking the view that there will not be any improvement until spring 1994 - we're running the business on that basis,' said Mr Ed Kirk, chairman, as he unveiled pre-tax profits down from Pounds 3.91m to Pounds 3.4m for the year to July 31. The outcome was struck after an exceptional credit of Pounds 165,000 (charge of Pounds 268,000) as reorganisation costs were offset by a Pounds 600,000 surplus on the winding-up of pension schemes. In the previous year, the group paid an uncovered total of 4p, but this time the proposed final is cut to 0.5p, bringing the total distribution to 2p. 'We could have afforded to pay more,' Mr Kirk said, 'but we have to be certain we can pay next year and the year after.' Like most industrial groups, Frederick Cooper has been striving for productivity gains, exercising stringent cost controls - the increase in overheads was held to 2 per cent over the year - and rationalising. The workforce was cut by 10 per cent to 1,500 people. Against a background of growing pressure on margins, Mr Kirk warned that 'the ongoing effect of the 1992 productivity gains will undoubtedly help but there is little scope for further cost savings without harming the production capacity of the group.' Cooper was willing to accept margins pressure as a necessary price for seizing extra market share, especially in the architectural products division which accounts for 60 per cent of sales. Overall turnover was only fractionally lower at Pounds 82.8m (Pounds 82.8m). Within that total, export sales rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 15.9m. At the operating profit level - Pounds 4.33m against Pounds 5.37m - returns from metal finishing were higher, thanks partly to buoyant sales in Germany, but those from electrical products were lower. Operating profits from architectural products were maintained. Earnings per share were 2.3p (3.5p) basic and 5.1p (6p) fully diluted.</p>

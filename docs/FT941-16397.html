			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Japan signals China policy shift The Japanese government has signalled an important shift in China policy by indicating that it will be more frank in future discussions on issues such as human rights and China's growing military budget. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, told Chinese leaders that the two countries should be increasingly direct in discussing sensitive issues, a departure from the traditionally cautious Japanese approach to China. The Hata visit to Beijing confirmed Chinese officials' concerns that Japan's new coalition government would take a tougher line than past Liberal Democratic party governments, in part, because Mr Hata and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa have strong personal opinions on issues such as human rights. Mr Hata told his hosts that China has to provide a clearer explanation of the intentions behind a 15 per cent increase in defence spending in fiscal 1993. He also asked China to abide by international guidelines on the transfer of missile technology. Chinese officials are accustomed to hearing such advice from the US, but it is unusual coming from Japan. However, the Japanese government sees the more direct approach as a sign that ties between the two countries are 'maturing', meaning that both sides should be able to speak more freely. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, said his government will attempt to increase the confidence of neighbouring countries in China's peaceful intentions. China, he said, is 'actively involved in global efforts to ban nuclear bomb experiments'. The military issue was also raised in a meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin who said defence spending has 'not increased by much', and the expansion of the budget reflects the effects of inflation in China. But he also insisted that 'we need to modernise some weapons'. Meanwhile, Chinese leaders expressed concern at what they saw as an improvement in relations between Tokyo and Taiwan, which China regards as off-limits to official foreign delegations that give the impression the island is an independent nation. The Chinese comments were apparently inspired by a report that Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, was planning to visit Taiwan, a report which has been denied by the Japanese government. However, Mr Hata stood his ground by suggesting that 'for the development of China and the development of Asia, we cannot deny the development of Taiwan'. He also asked Chinese leaders to use their influence with North Korea to guide that country away from its suspected development of nuclear weapons. Mr Hata said Japan would assist China in its campaign for readmission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He discussed the possibility of a new package of low-interest loans to China after 1995, and Japanese officials indicated that the loan negotiations could be used to encourage China to be more open about its military development.</p>

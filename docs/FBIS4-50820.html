			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News and Press Review" program] </F>   [Text] The People's Liberation Army [PLA] Information  Engineering Institute [xin xi gong cheng xue yuan] has developed  a new, large-capacity, program-controlled digital telephone  exchange system [dian hua cheng kong shu zi jiao huan xi tong],  which is up to the highest standards in the world. It has been  put to use in the telecommunications network over the last year  or so, and has proven to be advanced in design and safe and  reliable in operation. It is the product of a new industry.  According to the appraisal by a relevant department, it is an  important milestone in the development of China's  telecommunications industry, marking the end of a long period of  our being subject to other's control in this regard. With State  Science and Technology Commission approval, a State Engineering  and Technology Research Center for Digital Exchange System has  been set up in the Information Engineering Institute. It will  become the leader of China's digital exchange industry, and is  expected to yield an output value of 1.2 billion yuan this year.    Shi Quan, deputy commandant of the PLA Information  Engineering Institute, is in charge of the development task. A  recorded talk made by him follows:    [Begin recording] The successful development of the product  has made China one of the few countries capable of independently  developing large and medium program-controlled digital  exchanges. It has ended the situation in which China's  telecommunications network is built exclusively with foreign  products, as well as the situation in which foreign products  dominate the whole world. The product's successful development  has won honor for both the PLA and the Chinese nation. No  doubt, our country has grasped the technology. For this reason,  we are certain that after the technology's application is  popularized, we will be able to provide better security to the  telecommunications network, and to keep the lifeline of  telecommunications in our own hands. Since the new product's  design is particularly suitable to China's conditions and  market, to popularize its use is of great significance to  opening up our huge domestic market. [end recording]</p>

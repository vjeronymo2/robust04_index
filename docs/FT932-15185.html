			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Russian and the G7: Libya shipment barred A RUSSIAN company's attempt to ship a banned chemical to Libya was blocked by Ukrainian customs officers at the southern port of Illichevsk last week, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. The seizure comes amid growing western concern that Russian defence officials are seeking to profit from their nation's economic chaos by selling dangerous substances to countries subjected to international embargoes. The action also suggests Ukraine is trying to tighten export controls in response to western allegations that it was breaching sanctions against Serbia by allowing oil to be shipped up the Danube from Ukrainian ports. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said 80 tonnes of ammonium perchlorate, being shipped to Libya by the Moscow firm 'Pavoks', was seized by customs officials. This can be used as a rocket fuel, although it also has medical and farm applications.</p>

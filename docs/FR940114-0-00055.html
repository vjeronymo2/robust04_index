			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will consider this suggestion for future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking on wind load requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Special standards should be required for asphalt shingle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance in high wind areas, because of the large number of failures that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred in Hurricane Andrew and ensuing structural and water damage caused by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these failures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The asphalt shingle industry research is not yet completed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this area. As an interim step, this final rule requires each shingle to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secured with two additional fasteners and underlayment to be cemented to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roof decking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Testing requirements should be specified for windows and doors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to avoid missile damage in high winds. Safety standards can be enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without affecting affordability, by requiring operating shutters and proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anchoring (88 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department encourages manufacturers to provide shutters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or protective devices for homes in Wind Zones II and III. Under this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers will be required, at a minimum, to provide instructions for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate method of shutter or cover installation to protect the home, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include shutter information on the data plate. The instructions must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a method for protecting the windows and doors that is capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withstanding design wind pressures without taking the home out of conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the standards. The application of shutters does not do away with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for testing the doors or windows they protect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A requirement should be added for the use of perforated metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> straps at the marriage line of the roof, between sections of doublewides, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer wind forces from the windward to the leeward side of the roof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of its continuing evaluation of wind design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, the Department will assess the merits of this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department needs to establish standards to regulate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of appurtenances to manufactured homes, such as porches, carports,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and canopies, which experienced a large number of failures in Hurricane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Andrew. The danger to occupants is further increased because the rule does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not address the effect of dangerous appurtenances (52, 65, 122).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 24 CFR 3282.8(j) the standards currently do not govern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> add-ons, as long as the add-on doesn't affect the ability of the home to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the standards. However, as noted in that section, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has authority to promulgate standards for some add-ons. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is examining its authority in this area and may establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in the future. In the interim, HUD encourages all States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish standards covering the construction and attachment of these kinds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appurtenances to manufactured homes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exposure D in ASCE 7&hyph;88 should be used for coastal shoreline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this rule manufacturers are required to include on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data plate a statement that units designed to meet the minimum standards in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule should not be located within 1500 feet of the coastline in Zones II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and III. By this statement, the consumer is alerted that only units designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and anchored according to the higher design standards specified for coastal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas in ASCE 7&hyph;88 should be placed along the coastline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Wind safety'' is a misnomer; the science of weather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forecasting allows ample notice of dangerous storms to permit evacuation (296&hyph;314). Homeowner safety is better served by evacuation in high winds than from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection afforded by the manufactured home structure. If a manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home is purported to be designed and constructed to withstand higher wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speeds, occupants may be less likely to evacuate the homes at the approach of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a dangerous storm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department agrees that if it is safe to do so,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homeowners should attempt to reach a shelter capable of resisting high winds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, without the imposition of these enhanced Wind Safety Standards, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers of deaths and injuries attributable to the inadequate performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured homes in high winds will continue unabated. In addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing deaths and injuries, the Department's statutory responsibilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the implementation of higher wind standards to reduce the insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost and amount of property damage resulting from manufactured home accidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and improvement of the quality and durability of manufactured homes. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that these higher wind standards will fulfill those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NIST study cited by the Department does not fault the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of trusses; increasing the uplift requirements would not improve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the quality of assembly. The problems associated with manufactured housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are related more to fasteners and tiedowns (13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> (2) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The field studies referenced in the NIST Report identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerous roof system failures that were generally due to failure of the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connections between the trusses and the sidewalls. However, even if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trusses had been properly connected to the manufactured home structure, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that trusses not designed to resist the uplift pressures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced in this rule still may have failed. Therefore, in this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department has retained the proposed increased design requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roof trusses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / SE acts on small company shares THE London Stock Exchange yesterday announced its latest attempt to encourage a more active market in smaller company shares, as a third big market-maker announced a partial withdrawal from the area. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew followed Warburg Securities and County NatWest as it announced it was to stop making markets in 200 securities and was making 15 people redundant. It will continue to quote prices in 800 shares, remaining one of the biggest market-makers in London. The UBS decision will add 40 companies to the list of 159 which do not have two market-makers in their shares, and so cannot be traded under normal Stock Exchange rules. The exchange yesterday, announced new trading rules for these companies which closely echo the specialist system on the New York Stock Exchange. That new market, to be known as the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading System (Seats), will involve the appointment of a single market-maker in each of the illiquid stocks. They will operate alongside an order-driven system known as the Bulletin Board, an electronic notice board on which investors can advertise shares they want to buy or sell. The combination of the two methods of trading, with a new rule forcing off-market business to be brought to the central market place, is intended to concentrate trading in these shares.

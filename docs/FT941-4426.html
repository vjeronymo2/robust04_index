			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Former IBA chief leads radio bid Mr John Whitney, former director-general of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, is leading a strong consortium to bid for the UK's third national commercial radio licence. The consortium has its funds in place and is backed by two publishing groups, a television production company and a private individual. Mr Whitney is chairman of Transworld, a large commercial radio group. However, Transworld is not believed to be an investor in the bid for the new licence. Mr Whitney was also founding managing director of Capital Radio, the London music channel. The new station is required to be predominantly speech-based and the consortium appears to be planning a magazine rather than hard news format. Bids for the licence are due on Tuesday. The highest bidder will win provided its business plans are credible and proposals fit the criteria. The Radio Authority plans to publish the names and bids of the applicants on Tuesday, although it could be up to three months before the licence is formally awarded. LBC, which loses its London licence and goes off air in October, will bid for the new licence. Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, is also expected to apply. Independent Television News has been in talks with independent production company Planet 24 about the possibility of a joint bid, but a decision has not yet been reached. GWR, the commercial radio group which has a stake in Classic FM, and Chilton Radio are also expected to bid. Separately, talks between LBC and London News Radio, winners of the two London speech-based station licences, have broken down. LNR had been interested in acquiring LBC's assets to ensure a 'seamless transition' to the new operators of the licence but agreement could not be reached in time.</p>

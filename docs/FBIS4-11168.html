			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 24 Apr (AFP) -- UNHCR representative  Juan Manuel Castro, a Peruvian national, has said talks with the  group of 102 Haitians who are occupying the offices of the UN  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the Dominican Republic  have been unsuccessful up to now.    The Haitians, 50 men, 20 women, and 32 children, occupied  the  UNHCR offices in downtown Santo Domingo on Friday to demand that  they be granted refugee status.    Castro told the media that the talks "have been  unsuccessful,  and we do not know what their intentions are. F. Castro visited  the Haitians who are occupying the UNHCR offices today and  ordered they be given more food and medicine.    The Dominican police have had the block where the UNHCR  offices are located surrounded since Friday, but there has been  no official statement from the government of President Joaquin  Balaguer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Over the past few years, the number of cases of  destroying, cutting, and stealing communication lines remained  high in various localities of the province. Thus, some  communication lines were seriously damaged, and serious economic  losses were brought to the state.    The relevant data showed: From 1991 to 1993, 209 cases of  these cases took place in the province, 2.959 million  communication lines were cut, 87,000-meter-long electric wires  and cables were stolen, and the direct economic losses reached  1.146 million yuan. Particularly since the beginning of 1993,  the number of cases of theft and clipping of urban telephone  cables increased by a big margin. In the first quarter of 1993,  18 cases of theft and clipping of urban telephone cables took  place in Jiamusi city. A total of 2,157-meter-long electric  cables of various kinds were stolen and more than 2,200  telephone subscribers were forced to stop using telephones.  This directly brought about 157,000 yuan of economic losses.  In March 1993, 11 cases of stealing urban telephone cables and  trunk lines successively occurred in Wuchang city. Thus, 21,700  communications lines were cut and over 100,00 yuan in economic  losses were generated. In addition to the many cases in  Jiamusi, Shuangyashan, and Qiqihar, criminal offender Yang Zian  committed a series of five such cases from 3 January to 4  February this year at Yichun city airport, Wumahe, and goods  yards; stole 880-meter-long urban telephone cables, cut  12.2-meter-long communication lines, and caused over 30,000 yuan  in economic losses.    Since last Autumn, the province has built optical fiber  communication lines on a large scale. Simultaneously, some law  offenders fixed their eyes on the optical fiber communication  lines. They ran away after failing to sell the stolen optical  fiber communication lines totaling several hundreds meters in  length. All this has brought about gigantic losses to the state.    A few days ago, the provincial postal and telecommunications  department conscientiously studied the situation in which  increasingly more cases of stealing communication lines took  place, particularly of theft of the state first- and  second-grade trunk lines; worked out methods to solve these  problems; and implemented measures to keep a lookout for key  projects, such as optical fiber communication lines.  Simultaneously, the department urged that all local postal and  telecommunications departments should positively work in  coordination with the security organs to deal strict blows to  the criminal activities of damaging communications lines so as  to ensure constant availability of communication lines.</p>

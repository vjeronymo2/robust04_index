			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hollinger may spin off stakes in subsidiaries HOLLINGER, the Canadian holding company for Mr Conrad Black's international publishing interests, is considering offering shares to the public in its US newspaper chain, as well as one of its Canadian subsidiaries. Mr Black also told Hollinger's annual meeting yesterday that the 68 per cent-owned Telegraph group is hoping that the Australian government will lift its limit on its ownership of John Fairfax Holdings beyond the present 25 per cent ceiling. The Telegraph recently boosted its stake in Fairfax from the previous limit of 15 per cent to 24 per cent. Mr Black said that Hollinger may spin off up to a third of its stakes in American Publishing Company and UniMedia. He said the 'real value' of these companies had not been reflected in Hollinger's share price, and that 'the best way of doing this is through a share offering.' Although Mr Black said that his faith in newspapers remains undiminished, he raised the possibility of Hollinger broadening its base to include more technologically advanced types of media.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn -- Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer  (Christian Democratic Union) has announced an overall solution  for the approximately 380 tonnes of pesticide toxic waste from  the former German Democratic Republic [GDR] that has been stored  in Albania for nearly two years. As he stated at a news  conference today, he will present a concluding report next week.  At the Bundestag on Thursday [10 March], he indicated that the  pesticides transported to Albania are to be returned to Germany  "in a more or less legal way" and disposed of here.    However, the financial aspect of the operation has  apparently  not yet been settled. The Finance Ministry has not yet released  the 1.4 million German marks [DM] needed to handle the toxic  waste, which is mainly stored in a train of the GDR Railroads.  The costs for the return and disposal are expected to be much  higher. A similar operation during which waste from Romania was  transported back to Germany involved about DM10 million.

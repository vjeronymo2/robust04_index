			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Re-rating disappoints Westpac WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the Australian bank, yesterday said the downgrading of its credit rating by a European ratings agency was disappointing, but not unexpected following its net loss of ADollars 1.6bn (USDollars 1.2bn) for 1991-1992. International Banking Credit Analysis (IBCA) said earlier that it had downgraded Westpac's long-term credit rating to A-plus from AA-minus, and its short-term rating to A1 from A1 plus. The agency said the action reflected a decline in the bank's asset quality. Westpac wrote off ADollars 2.65bn against bad and doubtful debts, of which more than ADollars 2.1bn reflected a revaluation of property values. IBCA said Westpac had written down its property-related assets to values that could readily be realised under current market conditions. It also noted that the bank's risk-weighted capital ratio was above 8 per cent, the level required by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The balance sheet will be further boosted by a planned ADollars 1.2bn rights issue. 'We had been concerned that Westpac was under-reserved against doubtful assets, and the decisive action taken by management to address this problem is clearly a positive development,' IBCA said.</p>

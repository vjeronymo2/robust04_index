			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Podzharskiy report: "Chernomyrdin Wants To Be </F> Economically Secure. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS Has Sparked a  Witch-Hunt in Government"]    [Text] An extremely intriguing government document marked  "Not for the Press" has found its way into the hands of  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. The directive issued by Chernomyrdin as  early as last March sets forth fairly ambiguous things that  could not but elicit our curiosity.    What is hidden behind the trite words about "The  Fundamentals  of a Strategy To Ensure the Economic Security of the Russian  Federation?" And why did Viktor Chernomyrdin task the Economy  Ministry and the Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission  on Economic Security with drawing up within two weeks (!) the  requisite organizational-methodological documents? As I  understand it, the organizational-methodological documents are  just as needed for drawing up a state's general strategy as an  umbrella is for a fish. What is the meaning of a provision  instructing the Finance Ministry to finance scientific  developments? Scientific developments are one thing, money is  quite another.    According to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS information, apart from  this ambiguous paper Chernomyrdin has signed another two  documents marked "Top Secret" and "Of Special Importance" that  are written in much more specific language. Bearing in mind  Mirzayanov's sad fate, we only know that they deal with the  creation of an Economic Security Service at the Economy Ministry  (that it will be part of the Economy Ministry is clear even from  our paper, which obliges federal agencies to submit their  proposals to it by 1 May). Do you see the difference --  fundamentals there and a security service here?    Then everything comes into focus. Including provisions  stipulating that a democratic order be maintained in any  conditions (although this is at odds with the Constitution -- a  state order is to be chosen by the people, not by Mr.  Chernomyrdin) and that the production capacities of the defense  sector be preserved in those same any conditions. The Economic  Security Service, carefully hidden behind a veil of secrecy for  some time to come (otherwise why make its creation such a  mystery?) will defend the interests of the government to the  last man. A downright economic surveillance. And this despite  the fact that we already have economic counterintelligence as  part of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], although  we have learned that the Chekists have also been directly been  involved in the effort. But the security of the state is one  thing, that of the government quite another. Down with  conversion and democracy! Long live democracy under V.S.  Chernomyrdin!    P.S. Valentin Sergeyev, chief of the government's press  service, having failed to answer any of our questions, was  completely bewildered and long tried to find out where  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS obtained the secret document. The next  day he said that the staffer who had given us the directive (?!)  was identified and would be severely reprimanded. There you are  -- the first case for the fledgling service.</p>

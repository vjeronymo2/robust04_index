			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Letter: Incentive removed Sir, Oftel was set up to ensure competition in the telecommunications market after the privatisation of BT. However, the result of its ruling against the dominant company's special Sunday offer ('BT 'special offer' calls ruled unfair', August 3) is a reduced incentive for rival operators to expand their network, and for BT to maximise the benefit of its existing infrastructure. Meanwhile, the consumer is denied the opportunity of BT's competitive gestures. Colin G Trotman, 53 Wallisden Avenue, Fareham, Hampshire PO14 1HS</p>

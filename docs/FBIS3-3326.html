			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter from Beijing: "Wang Dan Calls for </F> Extension of Most Favored Nation Status for a Year"]    [Text] The mainland's most famous pro-democracy activist,  Wang Dan, yesterday issued a statement calling on the United  States to renew the mainland's most favored nation [MFN] status,  adding that the United States should also exercise close  attention to the mainland's human rights record.    The following is the full text of Wang Dan's "statement on  MFN:"    Foreign press circles gave wide publicity to a joint  statement issued in the names of "Zhou Tuo, Wang Dan, and Min  Qi" on 11 March 1994. Their reports referred to a sentence on  "strongly calling on the United States to renew China's MFN  status." Here I would like to solemnly clarify that this remark  on MFN, particularly the word "strongly," does not represent my  personal stand or attitude. Thus a correction is necessary.    To clear up this misunderstanding, I am willing to make an  open statement on my basic stand and attitude concerning the MFN  status. My opinion follows:    1. This year the United States should renew China's MFN  status, because if the United States abolishes China's MFN  status, first, this could damage the economic interests of the  Chinese people; second, this could be unfavorable to speeding up  the introduction of market economy, whereas the vigorous  introduction of market economy will fundamentally promote  China's social progress; third, this could stop U.S.-Chinese  economic relations, while facts have shown that these relations  are effective ways to promote social progress in China;  separation could cut off the channel for the United States to  urge China for human rights improvement; fourth, this could  discourage the enlightened leaders in the CPC from pursuing a  firm reform policy and could provide a pretext for those with  ulterior motives to hamper reform and opening up; fifth, this  could ruin China's pro-democracy movement and aggravate the  situation in which pro-democracy activists find themselves.  This year is an important and crucial year in China's reform  process. Any decision beneficial to promoting reform is wise  and worthy of support. The international community should also  notice that the Chinese Government has switched from refusal to  acceptance on the human rights issue and has made some sensible  moves on some aspects of human rights. This should also be  encouraged.    2. In the meantime, it is also my opinion that MFN status  should, naturally, be linked to the human rights issue. Not  only is this the U.S. Government's moral responsibility in  carrying forward global democratization process, but it is also  a real issue of whether or not economic interests can be  guaranteed. But there has not been a major change in China's  human rights record--it is still quite far from the  international community's standards. Therefore, when renewing  China's MFN status for another year, the United States should  also continue to maintain a close watch on China's human rights  record and take relevant measures so that this effort will yield  effective results.    In conclusion, my appeal for renewal of China's MFN status  does not mean that there has been marked improvement in China's  human rights record, but I am making this appeal out of  consideration for actual needs. This is my personal analysis  and opinion, which are not affected by my emotions. Therefore  the word "strongly" does not represent my stand or attitude.    [Signed] Wang Dan,    [Dated] 17 March 1994.</p>

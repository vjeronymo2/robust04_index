			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Some 6,000 Palestinian prisoners serving  sentences in Israeli prisons and IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  lock-up facilities have declared a hunger strike starting  tomorrow and until further notice to protest the fact that they  are not being released from jail. The leaders of the prisoners  called on the inhabitants of the territories to boycott the  celebrations for Yasir 'Arafat's arrival and to hoist black  flags on the day of his visit in solidarity with the prisoners.  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports:    [Begin Amir recording] The Palestinian prisoners decided to  overtly fight the Israeli decision not to release them from jail  and to protest the way Palestinian leaders have been dealing  with their case. The leaders of the prisoners announced through  the Palestinian Prisoner Club in Bethlehem that all the  prisoners will go on a hunger strike tomorrow and called on the  inhabitants of the territories to help them in their struggle.  'Isa Karaki, head of the club, said the relatives of the  prisoners will stage a demonstration outside the gates of the  al-Aqsa camp in Jericho this coming Friday in solidarity with  the prisoners. He added that the prisoners, including Fatah  members, called on the inhabitants of the territories not to  take part in the celebrations the day of 'Arafat's visit to  Jericho, which may take place on 2 July. [passage omitted]    It should be noted that at least 1,300 Palestinian prisoners  were given the choice to get out of prison by virtue of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, but they refused to sign a declaration  that they recognize the agreement and undertake not to use  violence against the peace process.

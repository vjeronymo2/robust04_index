			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISTER FRISKY GETS A CHANCE TO PROVE SELF;  </P> <P> PREAKNESS: HE WILL TRY TO BOUNCE BACK FROM FLOP IN DERBY.  </P> <P> His jockey, Gary Stevens, calls him "the old Mister Frisky." His trainer, Laz  Barrera, refers to him as "the real Mister Frisky."  </P> <P> By any name, he is the horse who had won all 16 of his races, taking the  longest winning streak ever into the Kentucky Derby, and then finished eighth,  beaten by 19 1/4 lengths, as the favorite at Churchill Downs two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky became Mister Flunky. But in today's 115th Preakness at Pimlico,  Mister Frisky will not have as much to beat as he did in Louisville, but  Unbridled and Summer Squall, the first two finishers in the Derby, are part of  the nine-horse field. Unbridled is 7-5, Summer Squall 2-1 and Mister Frisky 3-1  on the morning line.  </P> <P> Summer Squall bled slightly from the nostrils for about four or five minutes  after galloping Friday, causing concern about whether he can bounce back from  his effort in the Derby.  </P> <P> Summer Squall has had a bleeding problem since late February, when he bled  freely during a workout at Gulfstream Park in Florida. He is treated with  Lasix, a diuretic given to bleeders and a medication approved in all major  racing states except New York.  </P> <P> Neil Howard, Summer Squall's trainer, said the colt also had bled slightly  before the Blue Grass Stakes, a Keeneland race that he won on a muddy track  April 14, when Land Rush and Unbridled ran second and third, respectively.  </P> <P> "This should be no problem," Howard said. "He's bled the day before a big race  before, and he's still run good. This is just one of the things that I've been  dealing with."  </P> <P> Some labeled the Kentucky Derby a two-horse race, which turned into an  oversimplification when the first three horses under the wire -- Unbridled,  Summer Squall and Pleasant Tap -- were 10-1, 2-1 and 40-1. The Preakness is  being called a three-horse race, a label that should stick. With the losses of  Pleasant Tap and Champagneforashley because of injuries Thursday, the rest of  the field is a mishmash that includes:  </P> <P>  -- A horse who hasn't won a race in more than four months, Land Rush.  </P> <P>  -- Another that has never won a stake, Kentucky Jazz.  </P> <P>  -- The sixth-place finisher in the Santa Anita Derby, Music Prospector.  </P> <P>  -- Three local entries that wouldn't be running if a long van ride had been  required -- Baron de Vaux, Fighting Notion and J.R.'s Horizon.  </P> <P> While Stevens and Barrera have regained their confidence after watching Mister  Frisky train on the Pimlico track, Carl Nafzger, the trainer of Unbridled, is  not walking around like the man who has the only shot at the Triple Crown.  </P> <P> "We might even be the third betting choice by the time they run the race,"  Nafzger said. "One race doesn't make a horse."  </P> <P> Barrera, who won the Preakness with Affirmed in 1978 en route to the Triple  Crown, sees today's race setting up differently than the Derby.  </P> <P> "There won't be as much speed as there was in Kentucky," Barrera said. "I think  my horse can lay second or third. He's going to show that he's the real Mister  Frisky. You know they say that there are horses for courses, and I think this  horse will like this track, not like it was in Kentucky."  </P> <P> In the Derby, Mister Frisky was a factor for three-quarters of a mile but  abruptly dropped out of contention on the far turn. Stevens thought that Mister  Frisky wasn't getting hold of the Churchill Downs surface.  </P> <P> "He had shown the same problem in a workout there," Stevens said. "They cut up  the track two races before the Derby, and that made it the same as it had been  for the work. Down the backstretch, the track was getting away from him, and he  was using all of his energy before he had to."  </P> <P> Stevens worked Mister Frisky five furlongs in a sharp :59 2/5 last Sunday. "He  seemed like the old Mister Frisky," he said.  </P> <P> Unbridled was 14 lengths off the pace, ahead of only three horses, in the early  part of the Derby. Horses that come from that far out of it seldom win the  Preakness, because Pimlico has such sharp turns, and the 1 3/16-mile distance  is 110 yards shorter than the Derby. Eddie Gregson, who trained Gato Del Sol,  winner of the 1982 Derby, didn't even run his colt in the Preakness, because he  was certain the horse stood little chance.  </P> <P> Thinking about the way the race sets up, Nafzger is not encouraged. "If either  Summer Squall (with Pat Day riding) or Mister Frisky loops up there on the  front end by themselves, we don't catch them," Nafzger said. "If we do, he's a  super horse, because they are good horses. This is a nightmare, it's not a  worry."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> If Mister Frisky wins the Preakness, his victory will be compared to Snow  Chief's in 1986. Snow Chief also won the Santa Anita Derby, ran 11th in the  Kentucky Derby and rebounded to take the Preakness. . . . Nancy Heil, who will  saddle Fighting Notion, is only the third woman to train a horse in the  Preakness. The others were Judith Zouck, whose Samoyed finished sixth in 1980,  and Judy Johnson, whose Sir Beau was seventh in 1968.  </P> <P> The last second-place finisher in the Kentucky Derby to win the Preakness was  Forward Pass in 1968. Forward Pass eventually became the Derby winner after  Dancer's Image, first across the line, was disqualified for testing positive  for an illegal medication. . . . The weather at Pimlico today is expected to be  clear, with temperatures in the 80s. . . . Summer Squall is the only  Kentucky-bred in the race.  </P> <P> Pimlico will hold a $350,000 race for sprinters, the six-furlong Frank J. De  Francis Memorial Dash, on Aug. 18, the first anniversary of the death of De  Francis, 62, who is credited with reviving Maryland racing. Joe De Francis,  Frank's son, now runs the Pimlico and Laurel tracks. . . . The race might  attract Housebuster and Safely Kept. Housebuster will start in either the  Metropolitan Mile -- against Easy Goer -- at Belmont Park May 8, or in the Riva  Ridge on Belmont Stakes day June 9.  </P> <P> THE PREAKNESS FIELD  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.34IN:2.88IN:2.77IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PP  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Horse  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Jockey  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Music Prospector  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Frank Olivares  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Land Rush  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Angel Cordero  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Baron de Vaux  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Joe Rocco  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kentucky Jazz  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kent Desormeaux  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fighting Notion  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Alberto Delgado  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Unbridled  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Craig Perret  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Summer Squall  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pat Day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> J.R.'s Horizon  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mark Johnston  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mister Frisky  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Gary Stevens  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> TRAINERS (by post position): 1.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Eastern Transvaal Premier Mathews Phosa by </F> SABC announcers Eon de Vos and Dorienne Berry on the "Good  Morning South Africa" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] This morning is the first of a  series in which "Good Morning South Africa" will introduce you  to the new members of the government. In the studio with us  today is Mr. Mathews Phosa, the premier of the Eastern Transvaal  Province. Welcome to you. But before we start, let's look at a  background sketch on Mr. Phosa and the Eastern Transvaal.  [passage omitted]    [Berry] Nice to have you with us in the studio. You have two  obvious problems that one wonders how you're going to address.  The one is that one of your biggest potential earners, the  Kruger Park, is divided between two provinces, yours and  Northern Transvaal, and you have the story of the two capitals.  Which one should we take first, the Kruger Park?    [Phosa] Let's start with the Kruger Park. The Kruger Park  stretches from around Messina right into the Eastern Transvaal.  The administrative structures are in the Eastern Transvaal and  I think they are going to remain there.    [Berry] Can you ensure that, because it doesn't make sense  not to do that.    [Phosa] Well, we have dealt with that already. What we need  to do, we need to be fair to the Northern Transvaal. We need to  share some aspect of the income, because some of the tourists  will be going through the Northern Transvaal and of course the  national government will also want to take the Kruger National  Park, which is quite reasonable. So that's an area which we  need to contest and see what we get out of it.    With regard to the capital, at the moment we have allowed a  debate to continue because we've always said that we should have  people-driven decisions taken, and this is a good example.  We've allowed a very good debate to go on. It has narrowed to  Witbank and Nelspruit, and we interviewed Witbank and Nelspruit  last week. They both made substantial presentations, and we've  now asked them to come together and say to us how much will it  cost. It's going to depend on the cost now. We cannot ignore  the cost. It would be stupid to do so. If it's going to be  cheap to have a capital in Nelspruit, we'll have it in  Nelspruit. If it's going to be cheap to have it in Witbank,  we'll have it in Witbank. So we're going to look at the cost  and the cost only.    [Berry] I must say to the viewers in the Eastern Transvaal  who have just joined us, you specifically. We were talking  earlier, and he actually doesn't have any preconceptions, so  it's going to be a fair choice.    [Phosa] It must be a fair choice, and I'm happy that it will  have been a choice proceeded by expansive consultations and  input from business and the community as a whole, and that gives  me a very good feeling about the matter -- the way it's been  handled.    [De Vos] A lot of problems can be solved through  negotiations  and talking to people, and finding out what budgets are and what  moneys are available. But some of the other problems that also  came out in this profile we saw on the province, I think one of  the major problems that you do face is the pollution problem  through the heavy industry which the province has and also  through forestry. You know, trees being planted on the upper  slopes, retaining the water, etcetera, etcetera. Those two  problems coupled to Kangwane, which has a growth rate at the  moment of about 7 percent, which is one of the highest in the  country. Now put those together and you have a major headache  on its way. Have you considered those issues?    [Phosa] Well, the question of pollution is not peculiar only  to the Eastern Transvaal. It's a problem peculiar to  industrialization and a lot of things are being done to try and  reduce the level of pollution, especially in areas of Witbank.  I was mentioning to you earlier this funny concept about  healthy pollution. It's very expensive to get involved in [word  indistinct] pollution. But something is being done. I am  satisfied there. We discussed it with members of the Witbank  town council because it is a matter of concern. The ozone layer  is quite low there, and we need to deal with it on a continuous  basis. The same thing with forestry. One other thing that we  have to look at is how to conserve nature; and we are going to  be very strict with some of the companies which are not careful  about how to deal with nature like water and everything. The  aspect of the 7 percent, it's related to the entire region; it's  in fact 9 percent of the national GDP [Gross Domestic Product].  We are the second smallest region, but we are the fourth  strongest economically in the country.    [Berry] When we talk about Kangwane, it has a high  unemployment rate, the people are poor, they're close to game  reserves. How are you going to enforce the preservation of our  natural resources as in wild life and trees and bushes, and that  sort of thing, as well as managing to help these people?    [Phosa] You see, we've got two rural settlements in the  Eastern Transvaal; it's Kangwane and Kwandebele. There is  enough room for everybody. The tourism development which we  want to embark on is not going to affect in any way the  residential areas of the people in Kwandebele or Kangwane. The  beauty of the Eastern Transvaal is there, it's given. It's how  we are going to develop it.    Now, we obviously are talking about decentralizing power in  Eastern Transvaal. In a particular way the issue of the capital  is part of the discussion. We want to create the one stop  service: Witbank, Nelspruit, Secunda, where you will have  officials who will give service to the people and resolve  problems of people on the spot. But the third element is  departmental decentralization which is guided by the needs and  the resource base. Here again we are having debates. We think  it is a very good idea to bring government close to the people,  where decisions can be taken at the lowest local level. You  don't disrupt people, you don't shuttle people around, you say  tourism is best suited in Nelspruit, Hazyview, Sabie. You put  your head office there for tourism. Trade and industry is in  Secunda, you put it there. Most economic activities are in  Witbank, you put it there. Policing is more in Middelburg. You  put it there. You don't shuttle people around in this whole  transformation.    [De Vos] I wonder if Middelburg will agree with the policing  [laughter].    [Berry] And are you looking for the policy of educating the  people into not bleeding land, not stripping the trees, and  deforesting the area? Half of Northern Transvaal has been  completely wiped out. Look at Lesotho and the terrible erosion  there.    [Phosa] We don't have such a problem in Eastern Transvaal.  On the contrary, we have too many forests, and we are happy to  have those forests. We would like them to grow. That's an  industry on its own. We don't have that problem really. We  would want to focus on empowering our people. We do have a  number of problems. You heard what was mentioned there. A lot  of these big companies make money in the Eastern Transvaal and  it flows out to some headquarters somewhere. We do have a  problem with that and we are going to engage commerce and  industry into serious discussion which will lead to them having  to invest substantial parts of their profit from where they get  the wealth. We have a problem with that. Per capita income is  180 rands per month. It's very low, taking into account the  wealth of the province. Now we need to reinvest in there.  Questions like beneficiations [as heard] of raw material in  Eastern Transvaal can only lead to more job creation for our  people there and absorb this labor force in Kangwane and  Kwandebele in other areas, in urban areas. Now those type of  things will require a lot of discussions.    [Berry] From a personal point of view, you personally, what  do you see as your greatest challenge?    [Phosa] Well, the greatest challenge at the moment is to  improve the living and working conditions of our people, if I  may put it in that (?crisp) manner. You look at the health  aspect of our situation. It's deplorable. We need to adjust  that. We have been offered a number of clinics by a company  which for ethical reasons I will not mention -- more than 20  clinics. Now we are going to identify spots where they are most  needed and put those clinics there, and these are modern  clinics. And education, technical educational and other types  of education; we have been offered a university, the funds are  there, we don't take one cent from the government. We want to  proceed with that project. We want to twin that university with  one of the top international universities in the world, because  we want it to have that status of a proper university which will  produce people who will be immediately useful to the economic  activity of the Eastern Transvaal. We want to produce planners  and researchers which we don't have at the moment. We want to  produce good managers and good administrators, which we don't  have at the moment. [passage omitted]</p>

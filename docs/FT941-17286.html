			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Observer: Learning curve Shock, horror. Management Today, the flagship of Michael Heseltine's publishing empire, has appointed a new editor and he is not a journalist. Charles Skinner, 33, has been plucked out of 3i's corporate finance department to edit a magazine which was once worshipped by the great and the good of British industry. To make matters worse, the current editor, Dennis Hackett, a veteran magazine man credited with spotting Tina Brown's editorial talents when he was relaunching Tatler, doesn't seem to have been in on the decision-making. MT's publishing director, William Pecover, who was up at Oxford at the same time as Skinner, says he picked a non-hack because the UK does not have a big pool of experienced business magazine journalists, unlike the US. Moreover, Skinner 'understands our natural readers'. Those journalists used to lecturing managers on how to run their business will be monitoring progress closely.</p>

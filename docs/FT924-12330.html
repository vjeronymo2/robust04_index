			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Foreign Affairs: Blind eye to the Balkans - Unless the west finds the will for stronger action, Serbian gains are likely to be legitimised Back in August, the horror of Yugoslavia seemed to overshadow the whole European scene. The European Community's inability to stop it was widely adduced as one of the reasons for the general disillusionment with European union, reflected in the rise of the No camp in the French referendum campaign. In Britain, the situation in Bosnia was given as the official reason why Mr John Major interrupted his holiday in Spain, returning to London for a special cabinet meeting. People in the Foreign Office actually worried that public opinion might force their political masters into military intervention against their better judgment. (Well, against their judgment, anyway.) Those days seem far away. How Mr Major must wish that pressure to intervene in Bosnia was the only public opinion he had to worry about. The EC in general, and its British president in particular, have given such ample proof of their inability to control events much nearer home that their impotence in Yugoslavia is no longer noticed. The inattentive newspaper reader might almost imagine that the fighting had at last died down, or even that the London conference, with its Geneva follow-up, had succeeded. But the attentive radio listener will have picked up increasingly desperate complaints from UN officials about the slowness of the relief operation and the probability, rapidly hardening into certainty, that thousands of children will die of cold and hunger in Sarajevo this winter. The inhabitants of Sarajevo are mostly still without power, water or telephone links. Power was restored to hospitals and the bakery on Sunday, but the shelling of the flour mill on the same day meant that by Monday night the bakery had nothing left to bake. The news is confusing. Early on Monday morning there was something like a dress rehearsal for a coup in Belgrade against Yugoslav president Dobrica Cosic, who on Friday had called for the resignation of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. Serbian police loyal to Mr Milosevic seized control of the federal Interior Ministry. Senior army commanders are said to be loyal to Mr Cosic. A showdown between him and Mr Milosevic, his one-time ally, may well be imminent. On Monday night in Geneva Mr Cosic reached agreement with the Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, on a thoroughly sensible solution to the Bosnian conflict: the siege of Sarajevo would be lifted; the city demilitarised; the paramilitary units disbanded; and Bosnia and Yugoslavia would recognise each other, the former adopting a decentralised constitution but not being divided into ethnically pure cantons. On the contrary, 'ethnic cleansing' would be reversed and refugees allowed to return to their homes. The trouble is that the two men are contested leaders of highly problematic states. Mr Izetbegovic's Bosnia-Hercegovina is recognised by the international community but his real authority extends at best to Sarajevo itself and the remaining Moslem-held enclaves. His Serb adversaries, of course, ignore his authority but so in practice do his nominal Croat allies, who take their orders from Zagreb. Mr Cosic's Yugoslavia, composed of Serbia and Montenegro, was invented in the spring in an attempt by Serbia to claim continuity with the old Yugoslav federation and so win international legitimacy. In this it has so far failed. Mr Cosic officially disclaims any role for his country in the Bosnian fighting, promising only to press the Bosnian Serbs to comply with earlier agreements. Whether this new agreement turns out to mean anything more than previous ones depends first on the power struggle within Serbia and secondly on the degree of leverage the winner of that struggle can exert over the Bosnian Serbs. Meanwhile, there have been ominous stirrings in Kosovo, long identified as the probable next theatre of war. This struggle would pit the Serbian government against the local Albanian majority, now set on separatism and likely to be supported by its kith and kin both in Albania proper and in neighbouring Macedonia. In the most alarming scenario this would lead to a full internationalisation of the conflict, with Bulgaria and even Greece being drawn in. Faced with such complexities, and preoccupied with its own problems, western Europe is inclined to leave Yugoslavia to Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance to sort out. But however great the political and diplomatic skills of those two gentlemen, they can do little other than negotiate a gradual acceptance of what force has achieved, unless the international community provides countervailing force on the other side. It is splendid that Mr Cosic has agreed to the reversal of ethnic cleansing and the return of refugees to their homes, but does anyone seriously imagine the local Serb militia will permit this unless forced to do so? What we shall see in practice is the consolidation of the Serb fait accompli, unless external powers have the will to impose a Serb retreat. The right way to deal with Mr Cosic is surely to take him at his word. He and his prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, say Yugoslavia is not a party to the war in Bosnia, and that it is willing to observe human and minority rights in Kosovo as defined by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Mr Panic has repeatedly asked for international observers on the Yugoslav side of the borders with Bosnia and Albania, and at Yugoslav air bases; and for monitors to verify the treatment of Albanians in Kosovo. Why does the UN not respond to this request, if only to test the reality of Mr Panic's authority? If Serbia co-operates with such missions, the sanctions could be lifted - which would greatly increase Mr Panic's prestige and strengthen his position vis-a-vis Mr Milosevic. If not, the sanctions would have to be maintained, and more seriously enforced. Within Bosnia, the UN must take swifter and more forceful action to ensure that supplies reach the beleaguered population, not only in Sarajevo but in Bihac and the other enclaves. That does mean a larger UN force, not confined by an artificial neutrality but explicitly mandated to fight its way through if it encounters resistance. No more time should be wasted securing undertakings from Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, which experience has shown are invariably ignored by his forces on the ground. The no-fly zone should be enforced, and UN troops should be provided with air cover from Nato countries if they come under artillery fire. Above all, the Bosnians should be allowed weapons to defend themselves and their homes. Otherwise, if it is demonstrated that such problems can be 'solved' by imposed transfers of population, two consequences will follow. First, other states in central and eastern Europe will resort to the same methods. Romania and Slovakia will be tempted to expel their Hungarians, Estonia and Latvia their Russians and so on, until the states receiving the flows of refugees resort in their turn to force and send troops across the frontier. Second, the Bosnian Moslems will become the Palestinians of Europe, probably resorting to terrorism and in any case acting as the focus of anti-European feeling throughout the Moslem world, where it is already believed that Europe has acquiesced in their fate because it does not wish to have a Moslem state on European soil.</p>

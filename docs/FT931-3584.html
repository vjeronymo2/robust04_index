			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Russian compromise fades away IT IS now clear that Mr Boris Yeltsin means to fight for supremacy. The president, say his advisers, has concluded that no further compromises are possible with his hardline opponents in the Congress of People's Deputies, and that he will strive, within constitutional limits, to beat them. As Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former premier and now a key presidential aide, said yesterday: 'The result of the Congress was to show that the policy of compromise has more or less reached its limit.' Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister who was singled out for personal attack in the Congress session that ended on Saturday, agreed. Speaking in London yesterday during an official visit, he said the Congress had 'destroyed the balance of power' in Russia, and that the president's response would be 'strong and active, within the framework of existing laws'. The tactic now being considered by the president is to proceed to a plebiscite which, his advisers believe, he can do within the law on referendums. They say this law allows a poll of the population through the initiative of the citizens themselves, through the collection of 1m signatures. This plebiscite, likely to ask whether the people wish to see the president or the parliament in control of policy and perhaps also if they wish to see private ownership of land, may be supervised by international observers to ensure fair play. At the same time, according to Mr Gaidar, the president may wish to secure support from the centre by appointing to the cabinet figures from the centre of politics - in particular from the Civic Union bloc, which includes the Russian Union of Industrialists, Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi's Free Russia party and other forces. That support from this quarter is still possible for Mr Yeltsin was underscored by Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, the young deputy who is secretary of the constitutional commission of parliament and leader of the Social Democratic Centre party. Noting that 'one main feature of the last Congress was that the centre did not make their views known', he said that 'the solution to the deepening political crisis can only be found with the involvement of the centre forces'. In contrast to the veiled threats by Mr Yeltsin to take special measures to enforce his rule, most aides are anxious to avoid an authoritarian solution. Mr Chubais said: 'A lot of deputies thought last week that they would be arrested in the Kremlin. That is not the president's decision; he will take the legal course.' The parliamentary leadership, for its part, is certain that a referendum cannot be undertaken constitutionally. Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the first deputy chairman of parliament who in a speech on the second day of Congress last week unequivocally demoted Mr Yeltsin to second place after the parliament, said flatly at the weekend that 'any move to a referendum which involves spending state funds must be regulated by law and needs to get parliamentary consent'. However, the constitutionality of the parliament's behaviour will now be challenged in the Constitutional Court. A group of 57 deputies from the pro-presidential Democratic Russia bloc yesterday published a statement disputing whether the decisions taken last week, and at the Seventh Congress in December, were constitutional. The terrain of the struggle is the constitution but the prize is raw power, and the right to conduct reform. Mr Chubais said a positive result in the proposed referendum would be the start of a process leading to new elections and the adoption of a new constitution. On the other hand, he warned, if Mr Yeltsin's parliamentary opponents retain the upper hand, 'at the next Congress (scheduled for June), we will lose the presidency or the president himself'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Henri Mamarbachi] </F>   [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 19 (AFP) -- Foreigners desperate to  escape Aden crowded the docks in the baking sun Thursday [19  May], as the rival Yemeni armies battled their way into a third  week of civil war.    The struggle between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's  northern troops and those of his southern rival Vice President  'Ali Salim al-Bid was concentrated for the fourth day running on  al-'Anad, a giant air base 60 kilometres (36 miles) north of  here.    An AFP correspondent reported that al-Bid's troops were  defending the base from its southern perimetre against  onslaughts from northern rivals on the other side in a battle  which has become the focal point of the war.    There were heavy artillery exchanges around the base and in  nearby mountains and automatic weapons fire could be heard from  inside.    Aid workers also reported heavy fighting further east at  Abyan, where around 100 wounded were admitted to hospitals on  Thursday alone.    Foreigners still stranded in al-Bid's stronghold Aden  flocked  to the docks desperate for a boat passage out, with all roads to  the north blocked and the airport closed. About 300 arrived  early to complete lengthy customs regulations.    One group was trying to get aboard a Russian ship ready to  set off, and the others had been impatiently waiting since the  beginning of the week for an Indian boat to unload its cargo of  corn.    "Each morning we come here, we wait and in the evening we  return to our hotel," one of them said.    The Russian consul and his Chinese counterpart, the only two  diplomats still remaining in the city, were trying to process  their nationals as the temperature climbed to 40 degrees Celsius  (104 degrees Fahrenheit).    A Belgian businessman, known to everyone just as Patrick,  was  trying to deal with all the other foreign nationals, mainly  Indians, Americans, Iranians and Belgians as well as a few  Yemenis.    The fighting around Aden was jeopardising plans to send a UN  relief convoy to Somali refugees trapped in crossfire at the  al-Kawd camp on a beach near Zinjibar, 50 kilometers (32 miles)  northeast of the city.    Rolf Guldberg, UN High Commissioner for Refugees  representative in Sanaa, said the camp was in a "war zone" and  supplies would only be sent once fighting eased. He hoped it  would set off from Sanaa in the next few days.    The United Nations had no precise figure on the total number  of Somali refugees or casualties but would be trying to provide  food for 4,000, the estimated number there before the Yemeni  civil began on May 5.    The refugees say hundreds have died in the crossfire.    The Somalis fled to Yemen to escape the civil war which  erupted in their Horn of Africa country three years ago, but  have now found themselves caught up in a new conflict.    Hundreds of refugees meanwhile flooded into Aden fleeing  fighting in the surrounding mountains and countryside.    The United Nations said there were at least 1,500 in Aden,  and it was providing them with food.    Meanwhile, a senior official from the International  Committee  of the Red Cross (ICRC) said they had already started to visit  prisoner of war camps, and hoped to complete the inspections  next week.    Arnold Luethold, regional ICRC director for the Arabian  peninsula, gave no precise figure for war casualties or  internees but said they had counted hundreds of POWs.</p>

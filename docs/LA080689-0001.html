			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING HER HEAD ABOVE WATER;  </P> <P> THE BODY'S MEMORY BY JEAN STEWART (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $16.95; 272 PP.)  </P> <P> "I remember the moment I discovered, at age 10 in 1957, that not everyone in  America had freedom of choice when it came to such commonplace acts as riding  buses and trains. (My parents had just bought their first television set and I,  awed, sat glued to the screen for weeks.) I knew that such things were  possible, that freedom could be taken away, having pored through Anne Frank's  diary. But that was Germany, and history. It seemed unimaginable that some  Americans were made to ride separate buses, attend separate schools and  churches, sit in separate sections way in the back of the movie theaters, and  enter through separate doors. A special kind of anger, a receptivity, was born  in me then."  </P> <P> The speaker is Kate, a teacher in her 30s who lives on Long Island, the  protagonist of Jean Stewart's "A Body's Memory." She is a bright, independent  woman who now -- 20 years after first learning of the civil rights movement --  has herself become the target of discrimination. Race, however, is not the  issue; she is discriminated against for a different reason, because she is  recently disabled, dependent on a wheelchair for mobility.  </P> <P> Confronted with insurmountable steps and curbs, narrow doorways, broken  elevators, inquisitive stares and pitying looks that establish her as separate,  Kate understands what it means to be denied access to the world, to be set  apart, to be deemed unemployable and lose a much-needed job, to have to accept  public welfare, to be different and experience a particular kind of isolating  loneliness because of that difference. Each day that one lives with any kind of  discrimination, she comes to see, is a day turned into a battle against anger  and despair and numbing self-doubt.  </P> <P> Page after page of this book chronicles that battle in its various forms and  stages. In a preface, Stewart stresses that this book is a work of fiction  related "only obliquely" to events in her own life. Clearly that oblique slice  of the story is a big one. The novel rings terribly true and is all the more  affecting for it.  </P> <P> Many of the characters in "The Body's Memory" are disabled, and it does become  a very specific topic, presenting a character with a singular -- albeit  terribly important -- crisis, and though the emphasis occasionally threatens to  maroon the story on a single track, the author ultimately succeeds in writing  about many things endemic to that crisis -- friendships, for instance, and  courage, and self-discovery, in very strong and confident prose. It is a first  novel, and like many first novels, the story of a rite of passage.  </P> <P> The novel unfolds through journal entries and letters and opens with Kate in  the hospital, facing surgery for the second time. A cancerous tumor has  reappeared on her hip:  </P> <P> "Cancer . . . I say it often . . . though my friends tiptoe around the word. .  . . I say it and listen to its reverberations. I roll it around my mouth like a  grape, to taste it, let it burst upon my senses."  </P> <P> The surgery destroys muscle and bone, leaving her unable to walk unassisted.  Initially Kate refuses to consider a wheelchair. A wheelchair seems the final  humiliation. Forearm crutches, however, aren't much better. The metal bands  encircling her arms pinch her flesh, and the attempt to walk with them leaves  her exhausted and in constant pain until the wheelchair begins to look like a  more endurable alternative.  </P> <P> Determined to live alone, Kate refuses offers to move in with friends and  begins the long, arduous process of adapting to her disability. "Nighttime is  particularly confusing," she writes to a friend. "When sunlight scatters from  the rooms, and my leg is dizzy with pain from trying to pretend it can do  anything, and I crawl between the sheets and the vastly empty bed unfurls  around me, I feel that other darkness encroaching on the sturdy, safe daytime  world. It's hard not to panic, then. . . . I do seem to be proving what I set  out to prove: that I can live alone. The question begins to reshape itself: At  what price?"  </P> <P> The price, as it turns out, is high. Disability takes its toll in many eroding  ways. Kate loses her job, her lover, her sense of herself as attractive and  capable. "Men seem particularly bemused by the sight of me," she writes, "as if  they expect disabled women to be asexual."  </P> <P> Sometimes her very sanity seems endangered as Kate goes through the cycle of  illness, anger, acceptance, adaptation. She endures radiation treatments, a  word that recalls the bomb shelters and air raid drills of the '50s. In fact,  her world has gone slightly mad. Panic, grief, despair cannot be dismissed by  Kate or her friends Ellen, Peter, Jeremy and Beth, much as they try to help  her. In a climactic and horrifying scene, Kate's new lover, Carl, informs her  that he's tired of carrying her upstairs to his bedroom and having to act the  part of a nurse. Her reaction is to throw her wheelchair down a flight of  stairs, and then herself, only to be brutally sexually assaulted even as she is  lying face down with broken bones from the fall. What can happen to this woman?  a reader might ask. What can she find for herself, and how will she find it?  </P> <P> The answer is that she can get angry enough to dissolve the self-pity blocking  her path. She can seek the company of other disabled people, people who will  understand her emotional status, and she can assert herself in many ordinary  situations, just as her civil rights predecessors did. Kate undergoes a  transformation from victim to activist, from an angry, suffering woman to a  crusader working on behalf of all people's understanding. It's a thoroughly  credible development, and it gives the novel a fine resolved ending, even if  the reader does get the telegraphed and slightly sentimentalized sense that it  was the only possible ending.  </P> <P> The novel concludes on a particularly strong note with a description of Kate  confronting the sea, at the same beach where she once attempted suicide with  pills. She now crawls into the brine like some prehistoric sea beast making its  return journey, in order to take one of her now-frequent and long solo swims,  and recalls an earlier incident.  </P> <P> "She was swimming out toward open sea one day when she came upon a small  fishing boat. In it sat a lone Greek who stared down, open-mouthed. He turned  and peered in all directions, looking for her boat, but his was the only one in  sight. At last recovering speech, careful not to offend, he ventured, polite,  his voice thickly Greek: 'Are you . . . drowning?'  </P> <P> "Kate smiled up at him. 'No. I'm swimming,' she said." Here is the evidence of  the triumph so notable in this work.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> BACKPACKS AND ARM PARALYSIS  </P> <P> Hikers who carry around heavy, poorly adjusted backpacks that put pressure on  their shoulders risk developing a temporary but "frightening," paralysis of  their arms, a doctor warned last week.  </P> <P> Dr. Patrick Rosario said he first noticed a syndrome he called "trekker's  shoulder" when he was hiking through the Himalayas in Nepal and came across a  young man who could not move his right arm after a day spent walking down steep  trails.  </P> <P> "The weakness started soon after he began a moderately steep descent, wearing a  heavily laden, loosely slung backpack, and it became progressively worse by  evening," Rosario and Dr. Sylvia Fernandes said in a letter to the New England  Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Rosario and Fernandes, staff members at Bronx Lebanon Hospital in New York,  said the man had developed a condition known as "Erb's palsy" in which nerves  that travel from the neck through the shoulders and into the arms become  stretched, often resulting in muscle weakness and numbness.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the condition is temporary and clears up without treatment if the  pressure on the nerves is removed, he said. Rosario said the Himalayan hiker  got better after a few days of rest and not carrying the backpack.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Sedat Sertoglu: "Denktas and Cyprus"] </F>   [Text] Leaning forward in his armchair, Rauf Denktas says:  "There was no alternative in Cyprus. That was the biggest  mistake...."    He linked the long period the National Unity Party remained  in power in the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] with  that factor. He also explained the drawbacks created by the  failure of the opposition parties in the TRNC to form an  alternative.    Denktas visited SABAH yesterday. After so many years, he has  begun to see things the way we do, although not entirely. His  views on the package of confidence-building measures were  realistic.... 1. He seemed prepared to hold talks on the  package. 2. But he seemed reluctant to take a backward step on  it....    The UN secretary general's report has not been drawn up. It  was to have been submitted at the end of April. I believe the  Western countries are gradually becoming aware of the holes in  the second package. This has delayed the report. Turkey has  categorically stated the following: "All the holes in the  second package of confidence-building measures must be repaired.  There can be no accepting that three of the holes will be  repaired and the Turkish side should agree to make concessions  in the other areas."    Britain is the most influential country in the Cyprus  problem. It long appeared disinterested. But recently it seems  to have agreed that a balance must be established in the  package.... That is good news....  <H5>  Full Membership </H5>   Developments are expected to take place in Cyprus during the  current week.... New proposals will be made to establish a  balance in the package.... The package, which has been ruptured  in favor of the Greek Cypriot side, will be placed on the  negotiating table to be repaired....    Meanwhile, the Greek Cypriot side's plans seem unending.  They have raised the question of Cyprus becoming a full member  of the European Union. That is what they have been working on  for some time.... What the British and French ambassadors in  Turkey must realize and explain to their governments is: "The  TRNC must integrate with Turkey if the Greek Cypriot side joins  the European Union. The Turkish Cypriots will have no  alternative. The decision the European Union will adopt in  favor of the Greek Cypriots will pave the way for the division  of Cyprus...."    Turkey has been trying to explain the danger to Europe but  "What is Europe's approach to the issue?" That question can be  answered as follows: "Some of them are indifferent. Many  others are aware of the danger. Several pray that the calendar  that has been established for a Cyprus settlement will be  heeded, that is, they expect the problem to be solved by 1  January 1995...."    Denktas explained the drawbacks in that. Henceforth he will  move often and on every platform to explain the drawbacks of the  Greek Cypriot side's joining the European Union. He will be  justified in doing so.  <H5>  Missed Opportunities </H5>   We will soon meet in Cyprus again to discuss the Cyprus  problem in detail behind closed doors.... We have decided to do  that. We will exchange views on the issue....    It seems that discussing the Cyprus problem with Rauf  Denktas, who is one of the most experienced political  negotiators, will be interesting.... We will inform you of the  views we exchange apart from those that are outlined on the  condition that they are not published.    Denktas mentioned one expectation that has not been  realized.  No capital investments have been made by Turkish businessmen in  the TRNC since 1974. Turkish industrialists have not  established factories to operate in north Cyprus.... Denktas  described the period from 1974 to 1978 as an era of "missed  opportunities." He also criticized Turkey for allowing  Archbishop Makarios to return to Cyprus after the Greek coup in  1974. He was justified in doing so....    Denktas was worried by Turkey's revelation that it agreed to  the first package of confidence-building measures. He was  worried because Ankara failed to consult him on the issue. We  disagreed with Denktas on that point.    Another aspect of the problem is that we may have to try to  explain the situation to the White House, which is expected to  influence the effort to solve the Cyprus problem. But the White  House maintains an approach that conflicts with the  recommendations of the U.S. State Department. Obviously, the  U.S. State Department than the White House advisers of the  realities in Cyprus. But it seems that it cannot surmount the  obstacles created by the presidential advisers, who are  influenced by the Greeks and Greek Cypriots. In view of that, I  believe that the friends of Turkey at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara  should make an effort to help the White House adopt the right  approach....    The next few days may be very important for north Cyprus and  Turkey. We must avoid making unnecessary statements to maintain  our justified position. This applies particularly to Motherland  Party leader Mesut Yilmaz. Yilmaz, do you understand what I  mean?</p>

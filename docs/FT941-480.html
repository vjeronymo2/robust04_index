			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Gallup in switch on Top 40 chart Gallup, the polling organisation which is fighting for the right to compile an alternative to the Top 40 pop chart, argued nearly four years ago that having more than one chart would damage the music industry. Now, having earlier this year lost the contract to compile the music charts to Millward Brown, a rival research company, Gallup is seeking to obtain continued access to record dealers' data. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said last week the way the Top 40 was compiled was 'significantly anti-competitive' and that he was referring it to the Restrictive Practices Court. The contract is awarded by the Chart Information Network, which is owned by the British Phonographic Industry and the trade publication Music Week. The British Association of Record Dealers has agreed to supply sales information only to the network and its contracted research organisation. In May 1990, Gallup expressed concern over the possibility that separate charts could be compiled by Music Week and the BPI. In the 1990 letter to Music Week's publishers, Gallup said: 'This is a recipe for total chaos and will have an adverse effect on the whole industry. Gallup . . . abhor this total waste of the industry's energies.' Mr John Pinder, Gallup's charts director, said yesterday that Gallup's concern in 1990 arose from the possibility of a split between the record companies and the music retailers, who were supporting the proposed Music Week chart. The co-operation of both sides of the industry was necessary to produce the music charts. But Gallup felt the information should not only be available to one research company, he said.</p>

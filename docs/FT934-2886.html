			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / OFT presses insurers on life policies Life companies should be made to publish how many of those who buy their products cancel them in the early years, Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said yesterday. The proportion of life insurance policies lapsing after just a few years has been a driving force behind demands for the industry to provide better information to customers. Surveys have suggested that on average 30 per cent of policies were terminated in two years with a loss to the consumer, implying that many products had been sold to people for whom they were not suitable. Sir Bryan's call ended a week in which the life insurance industry was fiercely criticised over how personal pensions were sold to people transferring out of employers' schemes. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has launched an inquiry. 'Over-selling or mis-selling of pension policies and endowments is now referred to as a 'national scandal',' Sir Bryan told the British Insurance Law Association. 'Disclosure would put public pressure on companies to review their selling practices and it would signal to regulators which ones were over-selling,' he said. His renewed attack on current practice in the industry came as SIB finalised its plans detailing how life sales agents must tell prospective customers about the products they sell and their commission rates. It has dropped the idea of using a graph to show policy charges. Instead, it has combined the two approaches put forward during the consultation process. SIB's board will meet on Thursday to approve the new rules, which will go to the Treasury before Christmas. On the basis of market research, SIB now proposes that sales agents should give prospective life insurance customers a four-page document, starting with a statement of the policy's aims and the customers commitments and risks. It would then go into a question and answer format on the 'key features' of the product. The document will include two short tables, one giving information such as surrender value and charges in each of the first five years, and the other giving similar information at five-yearly intervals over the length of the policy. SIB's board must also decide whether to support their officials in recommending that the requirement to disclose commissions should apply not only to life insurance but to term assurance policies as well.</p>

Yegorov assured that the Baltic Fleet is fully  able to protect Russia's interests in the Baltic Sea.    The admiral noted that the fleet comprises 100 warships,  including submarine destroyers and landing ships, rocket  launches, and some submarines, as well as two flight regiments  equipped with SU-24 attack aircraft, two squadrons of  antisubmarine helicopters and coast guard forces.    Yegorov said that, in the course of fleet reform over the  last two years, submarines carrying strategic nuclear weapons  and long-distance aircraft were eliminated.    The number of warships in the Baltic has decreased more than  twice since 1984, principally due to scrapping of old vessels.  The number of men has also been reduced twice.    Shumeyko, Yegorov and Deputy Defense Minister General  Konstantin Kobets visited a naval base in Baltiisk and observed  tactical maneuvers at sea.</p>

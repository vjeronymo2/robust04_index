			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mixed results for Anglovaal gold mines Lower gold revenue and a push to increase tonnage by the gold mines owned by the Anglovaal group brought mixed results in the quarter ended in December, writes Matthew Curtin. Aggregate after-tax income eased to R67.1m from R67.5m in the previous three months. Heavyweight producer Hartebeestfontein turned in a solid quarter to increase tonnage without sacrificing underground grades. Gold output climbed to 7,342kg from 7,118kg but the combination of lower gold revenue and higher working costs cut working profit to R102.3m from R107.8m. After-tax profit rose slightly to R57.5m from R56.3m because of a smaller tax bill and improved non-mining income. Loraine, Anglovaal's marginal gold mine, saw working profit crumble to R2.07m from R4.75m despite an increase in the average gold price received. Eastern Transvaal Consolidated Mines reported after-tax profit of R6.1m compared with R4.8m.</p>

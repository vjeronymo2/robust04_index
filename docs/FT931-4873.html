			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cramphorn helps Wyevale rise to Pounds 3.5m Wyevale Garden Centres yesterday announced a 24 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.54m for 1992, reflecting the previous year's acquisition of Cramphorn which made it the UK's largest garden centre company. Turnover rose from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 34.6m, reflecting the Pounds 16.5m purchase of Cramphorn in October 1991. Its 15 centres contributed about 44 per cent to the group's 1992 profits and turnover. The group has 41 centres in total. The latest profits included Pounds 153,000 from the sale of property during the year. Year earlier profits were Pounds 2.86m. Operating margins decreased to 7.2 per cent (7.5 per cent). The board recommended a final dividend of 1.52p (1.24p), bringing the year's total to 4p (3.72p). Earnings per share - excluding surplus on sale of properties - were 7.5p (8.8p). The group said gross margins were up 0.5 of a percentage point to 46 per cent. Turnover had improved in the final quarter by 16.5 per cent, after a 4.6 per cent decrease in the third quarter. Interest payments increased sharply from Pounds 146,000 to Pounds 1.42m because of the assumption of Cramphorn debt. Gearing, however, fell to 36 per cent from about 37 per cent.</p>

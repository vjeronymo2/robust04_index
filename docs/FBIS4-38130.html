			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-Basrah, 26 Jun (INA)--The Greek ship Archimedes  docked at the commercial jetty of the grain silo of Umm Qasr  Port this evening, loaded with large quantities of Australian  wheat imported by the Ministry of Trade.    A correspondent of the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY in al-Basrah said  that workers of the state enterprise for grain trading began the  mechanical unloading of the ship as soon as it docked at the  port, while scores of trucks owned by the State Enterprise for  Land Transportation lined up at the jetty to transport the wheat  to the silos of the governorates.</p>

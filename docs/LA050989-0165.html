			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WAR BETWEEN STATES;  </P> <P> N.H. WON'T TAX 'VICE' STAR, UNLIKE VERMONT  </P> <P> Seeking to capitalize on actor Don Johnson's dispute with Vermont over $50,000  in income taxes, Gov. Judd Gregg has written to the "Miami Vice" star, asking  him to make tax-free movies in New Hampshire.  </P> <P> Johnson is fighting Vermont's demand that he pay the tax, which is on income  earned from the movie "Sweetheart's Dance," made in the Green Mountain State in  1987.  </P> <P> In a letter sent Monday to Johnson, Gregg invited the actor to consider New  Hampshire as a location for future film projects.  </P> <P> "We regret the impasse you have reached with our sister state," Gregg wrote.  "Still, a good Yankee never passes up an opportunity, so I want to point out to  you that New Hampshire has no state income tax and no sales tax."  </P> <P> He said Johnson would be able to keep any money he made on movies made in the  state.  </P> <P> "In New Hampshire we don't penalize success, we encourage it," Gregg wrote.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the agency that represents Johnson said he was not aware of any  productions by the actor scheduled for New England.  </P> <P> Gregg also offered to provide Johnson with more information on New Hampshire if  he needed it, inviting him to call collect.  </P> <P> A collect call may be the only help the state could provide if Johnson decided  to make a movie in New Hampshire.  </P> <P> The state has a film bureau in its Office of Vacation Travel, but its budget is  $1 a year. The appropriation maintains the office's legal existence but nothing  more.  </P> <P> The last major movie made in New Hampshire was "On Golden Pond," starring  Katharine Hepburn, Jane Fonda and the late Henry Fonda. It was filmed in 1980  on Squam Lake.  </P></p>

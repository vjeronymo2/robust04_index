			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report: "The Committee Head Opposes </F> `Airfield Diplomacy'"]    [Text] Vladimir Lukin, newly elected chairman of the State  Duma's international affairs committee, completed the transfer  of his duties in the Russian Embassy in the United States and on  Monday got down to the business of being a deputy. The extent  to which the committee head is critical of the Russian Foreign  Affairs Ministry can be seen from his interview given to  KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent in which Mr. Lukin has  apparently skipped none of the topical foreign policy issues.    Assessing the performance by the Foreign Affairs Ministry  over the recent period, Vladimir Lukin stressed that compared to  1992, the foreign policy department has begun to work better.  Diplomats have begun gradually to find their own identity, and  talk with their partners more actively, professionally, and  independently. Yet many weaknesses have remained. The main one  among them is that so far there is more showing-off and  pretentiousness than real activity. At the same time Mr. Lukin  noted that there are enough professionals in the Foreign Affairs  Ministry who are doing real business. Their efforts so far,  however, are not sufficiently coordinated, while the  ostentatious "airfield" ["aerodromnaya"] diplomacy remains the  ministry's prevailing style.    The committee chairman intends to change this style by  accessible and legitimate methods: hearings, consultations, and  parliamentary debates on Russia's international treaties. Mr.  Lukin also plans to transfer to Russian soil the experience of  the United States, where candidates for responsible posts have  to pass congressional hearings while the president is obligated  to take the lawmakers' decision into account.    Touching on the issue of protection of Russia's economic  interests as part of its foreign policy, the committee chairman  expressed his certainty that the main thing here is not to  engage in ideology, but to count money. For instance, in  concluding the "Indian" deal, it was necessary to count how much  would be gained and how much lost, also considering that the  space agreement with the United States in that event would be  impossible. The opinion that Russia is in no position now to  maintain its space complex took the upper hand. But the  agreement with India was not canceled either. According to Mr.  Lukin, thereby Moscow killed two birds with one stone.    Russia's support of sanctions against Libya, Iraq, and  Yugoslavia was quite warranted. But Russia has had to pay a  higher price for that than anybody else. The committee chairman  is determined, with Duma assistance, to change the situation  where "some people dance, while others get paid." Incidentally,  he thinks that Iraq is essentially observing the UN resolutions,  and the question about alleviating the sanctions against it has  now grown urgent. As for the situation in Yugoslavia, it is  vital to avoid a double standard approach here: As soon as it  comes to the Serbs, sanctions are used against them; but when  the Croats are involved, the FRG and other countries oppose it:  "Yet both are guilty to approximately the same extent."    The most acute problem today, according to Mr. Lukin, is the  situation of Russian-speakers in the former USSR. Here, the  head of the Duma committee intends to do everything "to make  sure that these people can either live normally outside Russia  or come here, with dignity." The Foreign Affairs Ministry has  been reacting too slowly to this problem: "Its leadership  resisted even when the problem was literally pushed under the  ministry's nose." Now the Foreign Ministry is paying lip  service to it. The problem with Russophones in the Baltics can,  in his opinion, be resolved in a very simple way: "Speak softly  but carry what has to be carried in your hands. There is no need  to keep saying that we shall not withdraw the troops, but this  can actually be done while smiling nicely and gently."    As for integration within the CIS framework, some form of  unification, according to Mr. Lukin, is historically inevitable.  He favors a gradual and soft form of association, economic  interdependence, and a single cultural space. Russia should  find such a formula for integration whereby it would pay less  (although it will have to pay in any event). "As to who will be  the little king in what area, I could not care less," Mr. Lukin  said. Touching on the territorial problems that can arise in  the former USSR owing to the aspirations by, for instance,  Crimea, South Ossetia, or the Dniestr Republic to join Russia,  Mr. Lukin recalled the story of Shura Balaganov [a character in  the novel "The Golden Calf" by Ilf and Petrov] who, having  received a thousand rubles, picked someone's pocket for a  three-ruble bill. He was caught and everything he had was taken  away from him. Russia must not follow these rules. On the  issue of the Kuril islands, the committee head advised to  remember the wise Deng Xiaoping, who once said about a  territorial dispute with Japan: A compromise needs to be  sought, but if this proves impossible, our children will be  wiser than us.  <H5>  Commentary by the international department </H5>   The news about Vladimir Lukin's appointment as head of the  Duma committee has been received negatively on Smolenskaya  Square [Foreign Ministry], to put it mildly. People there would  have preferred to see Anatoliy Adamishin in this capacity. Now  Andrey Kozyrev has an active and influential opponent in the  Duma: Lukin is known not only as a critic of Foreign Ministry  policy as a whole, but also as a person who has a "difficult"  personal relationship with this department's head. Lukin has  never made any secret of this and while ambassador to the United  States, he approached the president directly, bypassing the  Foreign Ministry hierarchy. Signs are that Lukin's relations  with the Foreign Ministry on a number of issues will be even  more acute than under Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, who headed a  corresponding committee in the Russian Supreme Soviet. The  situation in the Duma is objectively conducive to this: The  mood in the chamber is often marked by a sharpened feeling of  patriotism understood in its own peculiar way. In this light  the conflict in the former Yugoslavia could become a subject of  foreign policy debates. The point about "gentle smiling" on the  issue of troop withdrawal from the Baltics apparently contains a  serious problem.    Now Vladimir Lukin is trying to put himself across as a man  of business. It can be supposed that even with the outward  similarity of his conceptual positions with those of the Foreign  Ministry (the interview gives reason for that), Lukin will try  to use his present position as a springboard for the ministerial  post.</p>

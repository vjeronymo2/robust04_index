			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: PETE ROSE DEDICATION TO GAME OF BASEBALL WAS NEARLY BEAUTIFUL  </P> <P> When Wade Boggs, celebrated batsman for the Boston Red Sox, experienced his  greatest embarrassment last year, he got a visit from his longtime hero, Pete  Rose.  </P> <P> Boggs had been the subject of a series written in Penthouse magazine by a  woman, revealing intimate details of her relationship with Wade.  </P> <P> Wade wasn't eager for such details to be revealed, considering that he had a  wife and children.  </P> <P> Devastated, he now sat with Rose.  </P> <P> "I told him, " Pete disclosed, "that the best way to handle the problem is to  keep hitting .350. If you do that, the story will be forgotten faster than if  you hit .250. There is something about .350 that makes the world forget  everything else."  </P> <P> Rose never hit .350, but this offers an insight on the outlook on life he  embraced. He saw earthly problems vanish on the wind of base hits, times at  bat, years of service.  </P> <P> It was the childlike orbit in which he moved, impervious to marital crises,  divorce, paternity suits and a gambling habit that would later bury him.  </P> <P> Walking into Shea Stadium one night, Pete was nailed by a process server.  </P> <P> "I learned my wife was divorcing me," he recounted. "I was so shaken I got only  three hits that night. In my next 26 at bats, I got 17 hits. I got 52 for the  month, most of my career."  </P> <P> This was Pete Rose up until the time that life at last got serious. He was  removed from baseball for betting and, the other day, got five months in prison  for failing to pay income tax.  </P> <P> Watching Pete in court, you got the feeling something else counted to him  besides baseball records, although he still seemed to ask, as he has for a  year, whether a flicker of hope remained for a shot at the Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> That thought will occur to him daily at the slammer at Marion, Ill., where he  will do his time. It will occur to him daily when he gets out, as it occurred  to him daily since his arrival in baseball in 1963.  </P> <P> It doesn't seem possible that one could be consumed by anything as Pete has  been by baseball, but it was doubtless this abnormality that drove him to  achievements unmatched in the sport.  </P> <P> He stunned you with figures, called up at will from his cerebral computer.  Managing at Cincinnati three years ago, for instance, he dipped into the past.  </P> <P> "I came to bat a record 14,053 times," he recalled, "But most people forget my  1,566 walks, which don't show in the at-bats. I also figure I was hit by at  least 100 pitches. That doesn't show in the at-bats, either. And what about  sacrifices? I wasn't asked to sacrifice often, but we're talking at least 100,  which don't show in the at bats."  </P> <P> Named Player of the Decade for the 1970s, Pete was distressed when Henry Aaron  lodged a complaint, contending that the vote should have gone to him.  </P> <P> "I don't have to apologize to Henry," said Rose. "When was the last time a  38-year-old played 163 games, as I did last season? (The 163rd was a makeup of  a suspended game.) And when was the last time a 38-year-old got 51 hits in  September and batted .421 for the month? I walked 95 times last year. I still  got 208 hits, the 10th time I got 200 or more. I also stole 20 bases, including  home."  </P> <P> It always has been, and remains, Pete's contention that players today miss too  many games.  </P> <P> "It's a state of mind," he told us. "Everyone gets aches and pains and everyone  gets mentally fatigued. But some are more willing to play than others."  </P> <P> "What's the solution?" he was asked.  </P> <P> "If I owned a club, I would hang up a sign in the locker room that read, 'Note  to regulars: If you play tonight, you get paid. If you don't play, no pay.' You  would see how few games guys would miss."  </P> <P> Managing the Reds, Pete admitted candidly that the thought processes of young  players baffled him.  </P> <P> "I have a guy who arrived at 8:10 for a 7:30 game," he said. "I fined him a  game's pay -- $1,780. He offered no beef. He wrote a check calmly. I tore it  up.  </P> <P> "I told him: " I don't want your lousy money. I'm just trying to figure out how  a guy can arrive at 8:10 for a 7:30 game. I played 24 years without missing a  single batting practice. The closest I ever came to missing was when I arrived  one time at 4:45 for batting practice that began at 5."  </P> <P> These are the things on which one reflects who has known Pete a long, long  time. His dedication, as deranged as it seemed, was almost a thing of beauty.  </P> <P> You aren't going to whitewash one who cheats the government out of taxes. Nor  are you going to excuse it because others cheat the government out of taxes.  </P> <P> What you are trying to do is weigh -- specifically, his sins, as they pertain  to baseball, against his virtues, pertaining to fanatical work and to  achievement.  </P> <P> When Hall of Fame is mentioned, few entering the argument are on the fence.  There is the hanging faction, and there is the faction able to forgive.  </P> <P> Historians also enter the discussion, identifying rogues admitted to the Hall,  including drunks, assault-and-battery guys and bum pay artists.  </P> <P> A lot of sermonizing is heard from the anti-Rose element, but never having  played the cornet in a missionary band and taking into consideration the unique  nature of the case, we are able to tender a vote for Pete.  </P></p>

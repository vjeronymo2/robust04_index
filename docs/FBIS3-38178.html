Addressing a party meeting in Ankara, Erbakan said the PP is  the only party that is active in southeastern Anatolia, and that  the parties imitating the West have been wiped out of this area.  He stressed that the problem of terrorism can only be resolved  through Muslim brotherhood.    [Begin Erbakan recording] It is impossible to end terrorism  through the government's violent methods. The real solution to  terrorism is the healing power of Muslim brotherhood, and this  can be done only by the PP. After terrorism is healed, 60  million people will get real human rights, real freedoms, and  real justice. That is when happiness will be restored to our  country. [end recording]    Erbakan charged that his party will come to power on its own  at the end of the first general elections, and that at the end  of the coming local elections it will get 1,000 mayoral  positions in Turkey, including most of the positions in the  greater Istanbul area.    Erbakan said: No one believes any more that this government  will control the economy or defeat terrorism.</p>

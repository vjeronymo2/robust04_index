			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Accountancy: 'Cookbook' may be put on the back burner - The debate about the future role of auditors in the wake of the 'expectation gap' It looks like 1995 is going to be the year of the auditor - and about time too. The role of auditors, the scope of their duties and responsibilities, are issues too long left to the almost glacial pace of change in the accountancy profession. Auditors and audits captured the headlines during the corporate scandals of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The public expected them to spot fraud and were disappointed when they failed. The so-called 'expectation gap' began to widen. The auditors were slow to take up a public defence of their part in these cases. By default they let the public think that they were the only culprits. They failed to educate society about the constraints they faced in unearthing fraud and fraudsters. In recent days, several developments in the field of auditing point to a new vitality in the debate. A common thread appears to run through all of them: the auditor is being encouraged to move away from the 'cookbook' approach, based on extensive rules and programmed procedures, towards a reliance on individual judgment. Last week the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales announced the foundation of a new Auditing Faculty - to be run alongside its existing faculties in tax, information technology, and finance and management. Its first chairman will be Gerry Acher, head of audit at KPMG Peat Marwick. Mr Acher marked his arrival on the scene by announcing a conference in the new year on The Future of Accounting: Principles or Rules? Mr Acher made it clear that while the conference might debate the matter, as far as he was concerned the profession was over-burdened with rules and regulations and this was its 'last chance' to avoid being swamped by the 'cookbook' approach. He accepted that the profession had retreated behind the rules, using them as a defence, following the bruising failures of the past. Litigation, and the threat of it, had made auditors wary of using their judgment. Reliance on the rules had led to further failure as dishonest directors used loopholes in them to defraud shareholders. Mr Acher acknowledges that one of the reasons the regulations are so long and appear so tortuous is that auditors often pester the Accounting Standards Board to make them specific. Many auditors feel safer with detailed rules rather than vague principles. There is little doubt that many auditors find the weight of accounting standards oppressive. A senior partner in one of the Big Six firms has a pile of current publications on the corner of his desk merely as a visual reminder of the body of work involved. There were distinct echoes of Mr Acher's argument in the publication of draft proposals by the Auditing Practices Board on the audit of related party transactions. The Accounting Standards Board is preparing to toughen up on the requirements on directors to disclose links between various related parties - for example between the immediate family of directors and a related pension fund. David Lindsell, the chairman of the working group which produced the draft proposal, thinks that if auditors had to trail through all the possible related party transactions in a large company, the resulting audit fee increase would be huge. He saw no point in a 'make work' system based on ticking boxes. The result was a recommendation that audit procedures in this area should be based on risk assessment. 'The APB is proposing a risk based audit approach in preference to a procedural one.' No cookbook here, and no rules to hide behind. The statement from the APB continued: 'This requires auditors to use their judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures rather than prescribing a list of mandatory procedures.' The movement towards judgment found a further echo in the publication last week of The Audit Agenda, the APB's comprehensive proposals for the future of the auditing. Prof Ian Percy, the chairman of the working party which produced it, talks enthusiastically about the 'psychology of auditing' and the need to train auditors in the behavioural sciences. While the report rejects extending the responsibilities of auditors in detecting fraud, it calls for 'greater realism both within and outside the profession about the possibilities of finding fraud, whether material or not'. The report called for regular seminars on fraud and for training for auditors in detection and the 'behavioural aspects of individuals under pressure'. Beyond the annual audit, the report also called on boards to consider periodic 'forensic audits'. These would be undertaken by special teams trained to find fraud and complimented in some cases by ex-police officers. The forensic audit would be to the annual audit what de-bugging the boardroom is to corporate security. Prof Percy wants a more open debate on fraud in the profession. He is tired of the argument that talking about fraud only gives fraudsters fresh impetus to offend. He wants an auditing profession alive to developments in fraud and willing to use this skill and judgment in spotting fraud and - more often - spotting areas of potential fraud. The publication this week of Fraud Watch, by Ian Huntington and David Davies at KPMG Peat Marwick, is therefore a happy coincidence. The authors start their work with a quote: 'Fraud and deceit abound in these days more than in former times.' That was the view of Sir Edward Coke, lawyer and politician, writing in 1602. Luckily the rest of the book is much more up to date. It records scores of detailed examples of real frauds and then lists the warning signs which go with each one. As an aid to Prof Percy's enquiring auditor it would be difficult to think of a better text book. On example should suffice. A chief executive of a bank approved a loan to a company for the development of a golf course and country club. He entered into a secret joint venture agreement to be paid 30 per cent of the profit from this project. The profit was paid into a private company in which he was a shareholder. All the files on the joint venture were kept in the chief executive's office. Warning signs in this case could have included:- 'Thin' loan files. Sketchy information, but management claim 'creditworthiness of the borrower is undoubted'. Borrowers with common or like-sounding names. Photocopied documentation and missing detail. Funds paid before necessary formalities completed. Significant numbers of borrowers introduced by the same source. File handled exclusively by senior official. Inconsistent jottings on file. Repayments made by persons other than the borrower. Of course, there is one big drawback to the auditing profession talking so much about fraud. The 'expectation gap' which has spurred it into action may well widen if auditors continue to 'fail' to catch fraudsters. Many auditors are sceptical about ever seriously restricting fraud. Not so Ian Huntington, one of the authors of Fraud Watch. He once uncovered a fraud by noticing that a series of depositors at a bank all used the same coloured masthead on their stationery. In fact the bank was laundering its own money and the depositors were fictitious. Fraud Watch, by Ian Huntington and David Davies, Pounds 45, published by Accountancy Books.</p>

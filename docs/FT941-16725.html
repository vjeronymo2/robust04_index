			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Life industry wins respite on disclosure rules Life assurance customers are unlikely to get better information from all sales agents until the start of next year, the Securities and Investments Board said yesterday. SIB, the City's chief regulator, has published proposals which will become effective from July 1 this year. Agents will have to disclose sales commission on life products and tell customers more about the disadvantages they would suffer if they surrendered a long-term investment early. While a few companies are expected to implement the changes from the start of the new regime, the life industry has been given six months, until the beginning of 1995, to make the transition. Legal &amp; General, one of the largest life offices, said it did not expect to be able to begin the regime until the start of next year, and there is a strong feeling in the industry that many life products will not be sold under the new rules until the last possible date. One estimate puts the cost to the industry of changing computer systems to meet the new requirements at up to Pounds 100m. SIB was told by the Treasury last July to produce regulations requiring disclosure a year after the Office of Fair Trading had said that SIB rules were anti-competitive. Under SIB's new proposals - an earlier version of which was published last November for consultation - sales agents and advisers must automatically give customers written information about commissions in terms of cash before the customer signs a proposal form for any life product. Regulators are to discuss further with the industry how to calculate the cash figures that should be disclosed as commission. The aim is to give the potential investor a clear and fair picture of the arrangements through a range of different distribution channels. There is great sensitivity about how the amount disclosed to the prospective buyer reflects the full commercial cost of assistance and services provided to company representatives which independent advisers would have to pay for themselves. They include the costs of administrative support, computer systems and accommodation. Further work is being done on the paper which tells the customer more about the product and which is to be handed over by the sales agent at the outset of a sale. The industry has consistently and vigorously opposed commission disclosure, and even among some regulators there is a feeling that the issue has grown out of proportion. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, emphasised that the new disclosure regime was only one element in bringing about improvements in selling financial services. He highlighted the setting up of the Personal Investment Authority and new training and competence provisions.</p>

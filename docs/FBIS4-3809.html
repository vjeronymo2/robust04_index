			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 21 (XINHUA) -- French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur said here today that his recent visit to China  was a "complete success" despite some "distorting" reports by  certain French journalists.    Speaking on the Television France 1 this evening, Balladur  stressed that China is a country with which "good relations  should be maintained."    However, he added that before his visit to China earlier  this  month, relations between France and China "had not been very  good."    But political dialogues with the Chinese leaders were  resumed  during his visit, he said, adding that his visit was thus "a  success from this point of view."    He expressed indignation at certain French journalists who  gave a distorting picture of his visit.    The French prime minister visited China from April 7 to 11.</p>

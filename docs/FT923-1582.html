			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (6): Political bridge - Foreign relations VISITORS arriving at the international airport see an immediate and graphic illustration of Belize's relations with its neighbours. On either side of the runway and around the airport are camouflage netting, anti-aircraft guns, helicopters and fighter aircraft ready for action. The trappings of the British military garrison in Belize, they represent a passing phase in the country's foreign policy. The garrison's purpose had been to deter aggression by Guatemala which had threatened to invade in pursuit of a 130-year-old territorial claim. Now, however, Belize and Guatemala are heading towards a diplomatic solution of their differences. Belize is also hoping to make friends of other Central American countries which had backed Guatemala's claim. The role of the British troops will then change: they are likely to stay for training purposes. Belize is both Caribbean and Central American. It sits between two regions which have been economically, politically and culturally poles apart. Once the dispute with Guatemala is settled, Belize should be able to act as an economic and political bridge between its immediate neighbours and the archipelago to the east. It is a member of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) which is struggling to create a customs union, a monetary union and a common market. It shares with its antillean neighbours many of the economic difficulties and uncertainties of small economies. Belize might even become involved in other efforts at economic integration, such as the emerging common market in Central America. Mr George Price, Belize's prime minister, and his predecessor in office, Mr Manuel Esquivel, have attended summits of the Caribbean Community. Recently, Mr Price was invited to observe summits of Belize's Latin neighbours. 'Belize is now is a position to do more in Central America because we have now established diplomatic relations with Guatemala,' says the prime minister. 'There have been two meetings of Caribbean and Central American ministers to discuss bananas. Belize has also attended two Central American summits.' The West Indian Commission, which has been studying ways of increasing the level of integration of Caribbean economies, also concluded that Belize can play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between the Caribbean and Central America. 'A further objective of Caricom policy must be the exploration of possible levels of economic relationships with the Central American countries,' the Commission concludes. 'Here, in fact, are the makings of a system of competition between the two sub-groupings of the Caribbean Basin  .. in industrial and agricultural exports.' It says that thanks to its location and its political inclinations Belize is naturally at the forefront of co-operation between the two regions. But Mr Esquivel feels that too much is being made of the role which Belize can play in bringing the Caribbean and Central America closer together. Belize, he says, cannot be an effective bridge between the two regions because it has no influence in Central America. 'Because of the Guatemalan claim we have been ostracised by Central America and we have kept out of Central American affairs, so we cannot claim any influence in Central America,' he concludes. 'Our political and economic influence in the Caribbean is minimal as well because of our geography. Rather than being a bridge, we are desperately trying to straddle two regions to keep our balance.' There is one very real and seemingly intractable problem which divides the Caribbean islands and Central America, and which could determine the value of a friendship with Belize. The creation of a single European market in January has put a question mark over the preferential market for bananas which Belize, the Caribbean islands and other developing countries have in Europe. The EC is struggling with a formula which satisfies the desires of the traditional suppliers, such as Belize, to maintain preferential access, while meeting the demands of the tendency towards freer international trade, as being demanded by Latin American producers, including Belize's immediate neighbours. The disagreement threatens to abort any hopes of meaningful co-operation between the Caribbean and Central America. Mr Price has attempted to close the gap on bananas through meetings of government officials and ministers from the two regions. Inevitably, there has been effective technical co-operation between Belize and its Central American neighbours. Matters such as dealing with Latin America's cholera epidemic, a common approach to the problems of refugees in the region, and restoration and preservation of Amercan Indian artefacts, have provided ground for Belize's integration into the region in the wake of better relations with Guatemala. Mr Ismael Garcia, Belize's ambassador to Central America, has concluded that there is now an opportunity for meaningful co-operation in trade and agriculture. Belize once gained substantially from transhipment of exports and imports for southern Mexico. 'Belize could prosper from the fact that it is English-speaking and could be an entrepot such as Panama was,' says Mr Geoffrey Hart, the manager of Barclays Bank in Belize. 'This country could, for example, warehouse material for distribution to Central America. There are opportunities for Belize to be Europe's gateway to North American Free Trade Area.' The next stage in Belize's efforts at being a good neighbour, however, will be determined by others. The Guatemalan government's proposals for resolving the territorial dispute are being contested in a constitutional court. Much hangs on the court's decision. Belize's relations with its Central American neighbours still hinge on its ties with Guatemala.</p>

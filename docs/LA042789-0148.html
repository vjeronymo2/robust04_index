			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> COUNCIL DROPS PLAN FOR PARK ACTIVITY BUILDING  </P> <P> The Whittier City Council rejected plans to build a $500,000 activity center at  Michigan Park after about 150 residents attended a council meeting to protest  the project.  </P> <P> The Parks and Recreation Department had proposed building the 3,500-square-foot  center in the middle of the park to serve as a site for adult education classes  and youth activities. Combined with 30 parking spaces, the activity center  would occupy about one-fourth of the park's space.  </P> <P> Residents submitted a petition with about 280 signatures of people who opposed  the activity center. The residents feared the building would increase traffic  in the area, attract vagrants and spoil the park's open play area.  </P> <P> After hearing more than an hour of testimony from residents who opposed the  project, the council voted unanimously to shelve the activity center.  Councilman Robert F. Woehrmann suggested the $500,000 be used for anti-gang or  anti-drug youth activities.  </P></p>

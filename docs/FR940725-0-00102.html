			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Provision of Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are revising 441.303(g) to read as follows: ``The agency, at it option, may provide for an independent assessment of its waiver that evaluates the quality of care provided, access to care, and the cost-neutrality. The results of the assessment should be submitted to HCFA at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the waiver and cover the first 24 or 48 months of the waiver. If a State chooses to provide for an independent assessment, FFP is available for the costs attributable to the independent assessment.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Respiratory Care Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Until the enactment of OBRA '86, the Medicaid statute did not permit payment for respiratory therapy services in a patient's home as a separate and distinct State plan service. Previously, such services could only be provided as a component of other State plan services or as a home and community-based service under a section 1915(c) waiver. For example, certain types of respiratory therapy services in the home were available when provided as a medically necessary component of covered home health nursing services. States also had the option of providing respiratory therapy services as an element of three other optional Medicaid benefits: medical or remedial care provided by a licensed practitioner, private duty nursing, and rehabilitative services. Thus, when respiratory care was available previously under the Medicaid State plan, it was provided as a part of a broader coverage authority. Because these authorities did not allow respiratory care services to be directed only to a specific population but required that such services be available to all recipients, very few States provided coverage for respiratory care services. Moreover, while respiratory care services could be provided to a specific population under a home and community-based services waiver, States' use of this waiver process to provide coverage was limited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9408(a) of OBRA '86 amended section 1902(e) of the Act to provide, under paragraph (9), that, at the option of the State, a State Medicaid plan may be amended to include respiratory care services as medical assistance for an individual who:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is medically dependent on a ventilator for life support at least 6 hours per day;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Has been so dependent on ventilator support for at least 30 consecutive days as an inpatient (or the maximum number of days of inpatient care authorized under the State plan, if less than 30 days) as demonstrated by a continuous stay in one or more hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;But for the availability of respiratory care services, would require respiratory care as an inpatient in a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR and would be eligible to have payment made for inpatient care under the State plan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Has adequate social support services to be cared for at home; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wishes to be cared for at home.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this provision, respiratory care services are services provided on a part-time basis in the home of the individual by a respiratory therapist or other health care professional who is trained in respiratory therapy (as determined by the State). The services under this benefit may not be included within other items and services furnished to these individuals as medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9408(b) of OBRA '86 amended section 1902(a)(10) of the Act by adding item (IX) in the matter following section 1902(a)(10)(E), to provide that a State is not required to make respiratory care services (as defined in section 1902(e)(9)(C) of the Act) available, or available in the same amount, duration, and scope, to individuals who do not meet the criteria in section 1902(e)(9)(A) of the Act. However, if the State provides this benefit, it is required to make respiratory care services available in the same amount, duration, and scope to all Medicaid recipients who do meet the criteria in section 1902(e)(9)(A) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9408(c) of OBRA '86 includes respiratory care services under the definition of medical assistance in section 1905(a)(20) of the Act and makes technical conforming amendments to sections 1902(a)(10)(C)(iv) and 1902(j) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In our proposed rule, we added_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A new &sect;440.185 to allow a State the option to amend State Medicaid plan coverage of respiratory therapy services for ventilator-dependent individuals under the specific conditions of coverage that were enumerated by section 9408(a) of OBRA '86;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A new &sect;440.250(o) to the list of exceptions to the comparability of service requirement. In following the statutory language in section 9408(a) of OBRA '86, we also indicated that respiratory care services for ventilator-dependent individuals are exempt from the general comparability requirement that services be provided in equal amount, duration, and scope to any eligible group under the State plan. We have, however, required comparability of services among those Medicaid-eligible persons under the State plan satisfying the explicit conditions of coverage for these services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six entities submitted comments concerning respiratory care services as a new optional Medicaid benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter asked whether respiratory care equipment, particularly ventilators, would be covered as equipment under the new benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

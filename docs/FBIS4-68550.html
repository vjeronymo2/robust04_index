			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Matyash: "Full Face and Profile of St. </F> Petersburg TV. When Delivering Sermons, One Should Honor the  Commandments"]    [Text] If you want people to keep quiet about  something, you should keep quiet first. That, in my view, is the  answer to the question of why the scandal surrounding the  activity of the leaders of GTRK [State Television and Radio  Company] St. Petersburg-Channel 5 was not brought to public  attention for a long time. The press, like the entire society,  is still faced with a choice: Either to speak openly and  promptly about the danger of uncontrolled concentration of power  in a few people or sacrifice this circumstance to the political  marketplace. One must think that this is why the scandal  surrounding the GTRK will never really develop--Bella  Alekseyevna will either cease to be a victim of circumstances  beyond her control or she will encounter the entire weight of  the law--the law on pensions.    But, after all, for the time being in principle there is no  need for immediate measures concerning the leadership of the  GTRK. For now it would be desirable to listen to the brief  sermon of Viktor Pravdyuk (because before delivering sermons one  should honor the commandments!) on television and radio, and  concrete and possibly honest explanations of what is happening.  Unfortunately, the leaders of Channel 5 prefer not to justify  their actions, which would be the natural thing to do in their  situation, but to construct a riddle about why all the press has  suddenly been included "in the open season on Kurkova."    There are three versions of this in circulation.    The first was suggested by the shrewd mind of Anatoliy  Sobchak. In an interview with Pravdyuk, the city's mayor dropped  an absolutely inscrutable sentence to the effect that the  newspaper campaign was clearly ordered because all the press had  been bought up by the banks. This version, to put it mildly, is  speculation, and it is not easy even for Anatoliy Sobchak to  bring it to a logical conclusion. Allow me to ask, Anatoliy  Aleksandrovich, which publications have given up their  independence to the hands of bankers and how long ago did this  happen? The fact is that not a single one of the leading  newspapers that participated "in the persecution" has been  transformed into a joint-stock company yet. And this is only one  part of the question; the second requires explanations of  generally what Bella Kurkova did that displeased our banks so  much. There is the fear that the explanations are not  forthcoming: The fantasy was clearly not thought through to the  end and, most likely, absolutely no thought was given to the  fact that someone might check it out.    The author of the next "riddle" is Bella Alekseyevna  herself,  who, of course, thinks that the entire story about the abuses  was completely trumped up--the abolished GB [security service]  is "socking it to her." We promise that if the chairman of the  GTRK comes up with any kind of proof, NEVSKOYE VREMYA will  simply demand that the monument to Iron Feliks be dusted off and  immediately installed in its place.    The last version belongs to an expert-observer of St.  Petersburg television, Tatyana Moskvina (her letter was  published in last Saturday's issue of our newspaper). I quote:  "...it is clear as day--since so many provocations, frame-ups,  and scandals have befallen Kurkova, it can only mean one thing.  It means that somebody wants to be in charge of the television  company St. Petersburg-Channel 5 instead of Bella Kurkova. That  is all, my reader friends, that is all."    No, that is not all, our critic friend, no, that is not all.  From a false premise you draw a false conclusion and from the  standpoint of logic it is a mistake. You will agree that first  it is necessary to prove that this entire story is nothing but  "frame-ups and provocation," and then you can move on to your  conclusions.    Of course NEVSKOYE VREMYA has its own explanation for what  happened and, of course, it does not suit the television leaders  because the situation, from our viewpoint, is infinitely remote  from politics. In this case one should speak, in the first  place, about the absolute lack of control and abuses on the part  of the leaders of GTRK, second, about the willful  "improvisation" in commercial transactions and, finally, third,  simply about arbitrary behavior. How serious these violations  and negligence are, whether they are from inexperience or  intentional--this will have to be judged by the corresponding  commissions according to the results of the corresponding  inspections. We shall point out only the direct or indirect  evidence that our television and radio company is not threatened  with either a creative or a commercial renaissance. If one wants  to see in this the "gobbledy-gook" of very bigtime politics,  then our arguments will simply not apply. Although, unlike T.  Moskvina, we think that it is better not only to list the  arguments but also to weigh them.    Generally speaking, one gets the impression that with the  exception of people close to the leaders in the studio,  regardless of which editorial office a person works for,  regardless of how involved he is in politics, or what he thinks  about the president or Nevzorov--complaints against the GTRK  leadership are all of the same kind. First of all, not just  anybody but precisely Bella Kurkova is reproached for destroying  the studio and making sure that many talented workers left  Channel 5. She was the one, when she became Poptsov's deputy and  opened the branch of Russian television in Karpovka, who took a  certain amount of television equipment, and creative and  technical cadres there, leaving Channel 5 plucked in a certain  sense. Again without coordinating with the collective, Kurkova  reorganized the structure of the entire studio and, as a result,  as workers assert, lost the creative potential of the leading  editors on television (the once elite editorial team of Telefilm  and the artistic broadcasting editors suffered especially from  the radical breakup). The reorganization affected the cadres as  well: She changed the positions of many workers and thus the  salaries they received changed as well.    But it is one thing if she was simply demonstrating her  indifference to the grumblings of the crowd. But that is not the  case--she becomes aggressive whenever anyone in the collective  tries to make a claim to participation in the affairs of the  television and radio company. Even convening a general meeting  of the collective causes difficulty--they have not managed to do  this for about a year and a half: The administration demands a  written notification for a "plebiscite" with an indication of  the names of those thirsting for democracy. Taking into account  the discussions to the effect that out of the 2,000 workers  Kurkova intends to keep only 400, the meeting should be delayed.    Nor is it to Bella Alekseyevna's credit that she has  restored  a kind of censorship: While previously (including under Yugin)  in order to put a program on the air it was sufficient to have  the signature of the editor in chief of the corresponding  editorial staff, by order No. 1 Bella Alekseyevna appropriated  this right for herself and her deputy, Pravdyuk, alone. There is  no assurance that the GTRK leadership will not thus violate the  Law on the Mass Media, but there is suspicion that it makes no  difference to the television leaders whether they do or not. In  these circles, apparently, it is acceptable to think that the  bureaucrat himself can become an eternal source of whatever kind  of legislation may be needed.    It is curious, incidentally, how Kurkova herself interprets  the concept of freedom and independence. The former chairman of  the commission on mass media of the city soviet, Yuriy Vdovin,  told what appeared to be an anecdote: At a meeting with the  leader of the Board of Guardians of the BBC Bella Alekseyevna  uttered the following sentence: "We are a completely independent  television company and therefore we have not allowed anybody to  say anything bad about our president." One wonders what we are  to do, we taxpayers who think that we may say bad things about  the president and that, most likely, it is even necessary.    True, those who encounter the leaders of GTRK assert that it  is difficult to call the censorship here political because a  great deal is explained by simple petty tyranny. The fact that  Bella Alekseyevna, to put it mildly, is not the country's top  democrat has been known since the times of "Monitor." About 10  years ago we students in the journalism department for  television and radio broadcasting were given some very strange  directives coming directly from Bella Alekseyevna. In  particular, none of us was allowed to appear fully facing the  camera during a television interview. This honor was granted  mainly to herself and several workers of "Monitor" were  permitted to show a profile.    One of the latest examples is telling: Kurkova ordered to  have "cut" from the program "St. Petersburg Engagement" Yelena  Drapeko, who is a member of the jury there, apparently because  Bella Alekseyevna is not favorably disposed toward her  husband--a former commercial director of GTRK under Yugin. Is  this not why the "impudent rumors" are growing stronger that  Kurkova not only is in charge of all television and radio air  time in St. Petersburg, but has been trading with them for a  long time? And, unfortunately, not only in the figurative sense.    A certain amount of this is confirmed by the story about the  head of the commercial center of Channel 5, Syroyezhin: Directly  or indirectly, participants in these events tell it, of course,  differently from the way the GTRK leadership does. Viktor  Pravdyuk, it turns out, has forgotten a great deal! Let us  recall that it was he and B. Kurkova who thrust the scandalized  "young man" Mr. Syroyezhin on television. It was Pravdyuk who in  the autumn of last year presented him to the necessary group of  people as a genius of commercial operations and the future  savior of the financial situation of GTRK. And one wonders what  kept Viktor Pravdyuk from looking then at the labor book of the  "American businessman" so that later he would not have to feign  surprise at his acquaintance with Mr. Mikhailov?    Apparently there is a need (and pressure from the banks and  KGB make it incumbent on him) to give his own interpretation of  this story. And so, immediately after Sergey Syroyezhin gave his  consent to head up the commercial activity on Channel 5, events  began to develop extremely rapidly. They simply began to throw  the belongings of the people who worked at the commercial center  out of the premises and the workers themselves were transferred,  without their preliminary consent, of course, to different  positions or were fired. After successful completion of the  "operation" in the combined commercial center (OKTs), another  personage appeared--Mr. Arkhipov, leader of the advertising  agency Praym (the loud scandal over "radio-rock" has not died  down yet).    The first thing the "newcomers" did was to centralize all  advertising activity at GTRK, promising to take punitive  measures against violators. It is quite possible that from a  business standpoint this was healthy, but the whole question is  how the funds that are received will be distributed. The editors  were given promises (and the leaders actively backed them up)  that they would receive their percentage and that this would  stir up competition because there were always more people  wishing to buy advertising time with good programs, and in  general this would contribute to general prosperity. But  television workers assert that as a result the editors were left  without a percentage of the payment for advertising time.  Moreover, even the provision concerning bonuses which was signed  by Kurkova began to be violated--they began to pay them  irregularly, while workers of the OKTs received bonuses in an  amount of five times their salary. At the same time Syroyezhin  and Arkhipov--an unprecedented case--were given the right to  sign checks as well.    The events developed even more curiously after that: The  advertising agency Praym, in which, recall, Mr. Arkhipov  supposedly did not work, received a colossal markdown from  television in the amount of 35 percent (true, some people assert  that the rebate was as much as 45 percent) and, according to the  agreement, the flow of advertising would not go through the GTRK  advertising service, which would be the natural thing, but  through Praym. The advertisers assert that the television  company did everything possible to make sure that the  advertising clip bypassed the TV advertising service. The  explanations were very simple: Conventionally speaking, a clip  costs us $1,000, and in the Praym agency it only costs $800.    One wonders why the television and radio company would lose  these amounts. Everything is fairly simple if you keep in mind  that the discount can be exclusive, only for Praym. Although Mr.  Nikolskiy at a news conference asserted that this was an  absolutely standard contract and that GTRK had concluded several  similar ones with various advertising agencies, but so far  nobody has confirmed this. And it is fairly simple to calculate  the sums obtained with this "exclusive": In essence Praym is an  ordinary intermediary office and it does not have to do anything  except count the money. If you just take 10 percent of the  billion rubles brought in by advertising each month, that  amounts to 100 million rubles a month. I do not know whether  this idea is brilliant from a business standpoint or primitive,  but in principle it is not difficult to prove that the  "commercial genius" Syroyezhin was in on this. There are many  witnesses and a great deal of evidence that Arkhipov and  Syroyezhin quite openly defended the interests of the Praym  agency in various negotiations. And it is absolutely  understandable that without support and certain guarantees from  the leadership of GTRK, it would never have agreed to do  business on state television.    After this, discussions to the effect that there was the  idea  of driving all the creative forces out of Channel 5 and creating  a joint-stock company with the participation of private  individuals and a company structure like that of the Moscow  commercial channel "2 X 2" do not seem extravagant. In pure form  this is a "rental office," which requires almost no expenditures  because the air is filled either with American films or news  from foreign television companies and a large quantity of  advertising. "Evil tongues say that a plan for this type of  joint-stock company in principle was approved by the leaders of  GTRK, and Bella Kurkova intended to sign it with Poltoranan.    In conclusion I would like to return to the  aforementioned piece by T. Moskvina "Do Not Shoot at Bella  Kurkova!--She Is Leading As Well As She Can." The author refers  to a conversation with Tatyana Bogdanova--the television  editor--which took place about 20 years ago. At that time  Bogdanova characterized TV as Goebbels' department. And Moskvina  draws the conclusion: "The fact that our television is no longer  Goebbels' department is largely to the credit of Bella Kurkova."  One could agree with this conclusion in principle. But the whole  problem is that if Tatyana Moskvina had conducted the interview  with her namesake today she would have seen "sadder eyes" and  would have heard even sharper expressions. But she seems to  think that such gloomy times as began with the arrival of Bella  Kurkova, such terrible censorship and clear lack of rights for  the television collective never occurred, even under CPSU  leadership.</p>

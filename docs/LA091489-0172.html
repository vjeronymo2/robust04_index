			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALR SAYS ITS PC IS FIRST TO USE NEW DESIGN  </P> <P> Advanced Logic Research Inc. of Irvine has announced a new personal computer  that it says is the first to use a new computer design standard.  </P> <P> The ALR machine uses a new design for controlling how the various parts of a  computer communicate with each other. The design was established a year ago as  a collaborative effort by a group of leading PC manufacturers seeking to  challenge International Business Machines' dominance of industry standards.  </P> <P> Although ALR is the first PC maker to trot out a product using the alternative  design, a company spokesperson said the machines won't be ready to ship to  customers until November.  </P> <P> Other companies, including Compaq Computer Corp., Tandy Corp. and AST Research  Inc., have said they also plan to offer products using the new design.  </P> <P> Compaq plans to bring out a machine with the new design by the end of 1989. But  the company "doesn't announce products before we're ready to ship them," said  spokesman John Sweney.  </P> <P> Jim Ashbrook, an AST senior vice president, said the Irvine-based company is  developing a machine that will use the new standard. However, computer chips  that will enable PC manufacturers to build the machines are not expected to be  available in large volumes until later this year from Intel Corp., a Silicon  Valley semiconductor company.  </P> <P> AST and Compaq were members of the so-called "Gang of Nine" group of PC makers  that announced last year a joint development project to come up with a new  computer "bus," or data pathway, for the industry. The design was proposed as  an alternative to IBM's Micro Channel bus, which is used inside that company's  Personal System/2 line.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irakli Aladashvili article: "Caucasus -- the Wars </F> Continue"]    [Text] Russia has completed the latest stage of its policy  in the Transcaucasus. Russia's peacekeeping forces are ready to  take up positions on the Inguri River [Abkhazia] and along the  front line of confrontation between Armenian and Azeri military  units.    Two to three years ago, Russia transferred quite a large  amount of weapons to those countries involved in the current  wars in the Transcaucasus. The reason for this was simple: The  opposing sides would cause great damage to one another with the  transferred weapons and then the Russian Army would directly  intervene in events.    The plan has, for all intents and purposes, succeeded. A new  stage of subjugation is beginning in the Transcaucasus although  certain facts could change the scenario somewhat.    In spite of six years of bloody battles, both Azerbaijan and  Armenia still possess a large amount of military equipment and  armaments.  <H5>  The Armenian Armed Forces: </H5>   Army -- 32,682 men, including:    Main Staff -- 773;    Ground Forces -- 31,909;    Tanks:    T-72 -- 129;    IFV's:    IFV-1 -- 192; IFV-2 -- nine; IFV-1K (Command) -- seven;  BRM-1 (Reconnaissance) -- 22;    BMD's:    BMD-1 -- 12;    APC's:    APC-60PB -- 27; APC-70 -- 67; APC-80 -- four; APC-152 --  six;    Artillery:    122 mm howitzer D-30 -- 63; 122 mm self-propelled  artillery system 2S-1 "Gvozdika" -- 10; 152 mm self-propelled  artillery system 2S-3 "Akatsiya" -- 32; 152 mm howitzer D-20 --  31; 152 mm gun 2A-36B "Giatsint" -- 20; 152 mm howitzer D-1 --  two; 120 mm mortar -- 19; 122 mm multiple rocket launcher LV-21  "Grad" -- 48;    Aviation:    MiG-25 fighter aircraft -- one;    Su-25 assault aircraft -- five;    Mi-24 assault helicopter -- 13.  Azeri Armed Forces:  Army -- 56,000 men, including:    Ground forces -- 48,920; air forces -- 2,050; naval  forces -- 1,500; air defense -- 3,530;    Tanks:    T-72 -- 163; T-55 -- 116;    IFV's:    IFV-1 -- 104; IFV-2 -- 191; IFV-3 -- three; BRM-1  (Reconnaissance) -- 34;    BMD's:    BMD-1 -- 90; BMD-2 -- one;    APC's:    APC-60PB -- eight; APC-70 -- 76; APC-80 -- nine; APC-A  (amphibious) -- 22;    Multi-purpose tracked vehicle MT-LB -- 198;    Artillery:    122 mm howitzer D-30 -- 153; 122 mm self-propelled  artillery system 2S-1 "Gvozdika" -- 14; 152 mm self-propelled  artillery system 2S-3 "Akatsiya" -- 36; 152 mm D-20 -- 36; 152  mm gun 2A-36B "Giatsint" -- 24; 122 mm multiple rocket launcher  LV-21 "Grad" -- 66;    Aviation:    MiG-21 fighter aircraft -- six;    MiG-25 fighter-reconnaissance aircraft -- 35;    Su-24 tactical bomber and reconnaissance aircraft --  seven;    Su-25 assault aircraft -- three;    Su-17 fighter-bomber aircraft -- two;    Mi-24 assault helicopter -- six.    This data is based upon that of independent foreign military  experts (although it is not excluded that, as a result of  wide-scale hostilities during the last few weeks, certain  changes have occurred).    One assumes that Azerbaijan will not reconcile itself to the  occupation of a large part of its territory by Armenia's Armed  Forces, whereas Armenia will try in every way possible to  maintain a buffer zone along the border with Nagorno-Karabakh.    A cessation of hostilities in the war in southern Azerbaijan  is unlikely in the near future; the large amount of combat  equipment gives one grounds to assume that a big war is yet to  come.</p>

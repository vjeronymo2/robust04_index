			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Maxwell US sales set for July THE SALE of the M&amp;O Group, which holds the US assets of Maxwell Communication Corporation including Macmillan and Official Airlines Guide, could be completed by July this year, the administrators said yesterday. Initial indicative and non-binding offers for the group in whole and in parts were received last week and were described by Mr Mark Homan, the senior joint administrator to MCC, as 'encouraging'. He refused to give any details of the bidders, but previous estimates of the value of the US assets have put them in the Dollars 700m to Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 464m to Pounds 720m) range. A number of bidders have been invited to conduct due diligence on the businesses and will be expected to submit formal offers for a second round of bidding in July. The format has yet to be determined. Final sales may depend on anti-trust clearance if any other large publishers make bids, but could still leave time for the payment of a dividend by the end of November. Mr Homan said the bids came in a 'Chinese menu approach', with some for the whole group and others for bits of the businesses. The move towards private sales confirms the decision hinted at earlier this year by Price Waterhouse that it would move away from any flotation for Macmillan. Any pay-outs will be conditional on approval of the scheme of arrangement for MCC by the US and UK courts. The next stage is ratification by the US bankruptcy court in New York next Monday. Mr Homan said realisations so far from MCC have totalled about Pounds 80m, but much of this money is tied up in escrow or is committed to pay for past or future costs of the administration. Meanwhile, Mr John Talbot, head of insolvency at Arthur Andersen and administrator to the private Maxwell companies, confirmed that he planned to place about 30 businesses into company voluntary arrangements from next month. He expected to realise dividends of 15p to 20p in the pound on the businesses. He said, however, that there were no immediate plans for the sale of the companies' controlling shareholding in Mirror Group Newspapers. 'We are not actively seeking to sell,' he said. 'We have not agreed a timetable.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were 998 comments received on this provision of the proposed policy. Many respondents were concerned that use of the Forest plan to determine whether the recreation residence use should continue was inappropriate because the plan could never focus on the specific and different issues that a proper analysis of the use demands. Others felt that in reality the decision on recreation residences would be made in the plan and that the project analysis would only serve to verify that decision. They felt that the phrase in the provision ``implement the new direction'' implied that a decision had already been made. They recommended this provision be eliminated since it assumes an inconsistency prior to a finding. Instead, they recommended that new management direction be ``reviewed'' to emphasize that the project analysis was not a sham. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nearly all of the respondents commenting on this provision of the proposed policy stated that the proper sequence of planning should have the project analysis prepared before the Forest plan is amended or revised and be the basis for the amendment or revision. This concern is the basis for respondents' recommendation that a determination of inconsistency be made only on the basis of a self-contained, site specific project analysis that follows all environmental analysis requirements. Respondents also expressed misgivings that the process called for in the provision conveyed a bias against the use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These concerns can be summarized by the comment of one respondent: ``The 1988 policy required a specific environmental analysis for any decisions pertaining to `inconsistency' with the Forest plan. In the draft policy inconsistency is now decided within the Forest plan WITHOUT ANY EFFECTIVE RULES. This is just not reasonable and is unfair.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several respondents expressed concern that recreation residence permit holders would not be involved in the actions leading to adoption of Forest plan amendments, or that their participation would not be sought until the basic decisions on land use had been made. They asked that permit holders be a part of the entire process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments on the procedural guidance in FSH 41.23b for completing project analyses focused on the addition of or emphasis on the factors and considerations to be included in the analysis. Several suggested recognition of environmental, economic and social costs of removing the recreation residences. Others recommended that cost/benefit analysis of removal be included in the analysis. Several respondents suggested that the standards and guidelines for the project analysis were substantially weaker in the proposed policy than those in the 1988 policy and recommended that the earlier language be restored so that there was consistency between all National Forests. Many suggestions were received that could be used to edit and clarify the proposed guidance in FSH 41.23b. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The respondents to this section of the proposed policy did so under a distinct disadvantage. The proposed policy describing Forest planning, NEPA analysis, and public involvement processes affecting the recreation residence use was based on more complete, overall guidance set forth elsewhere in the Manual and Handbooks. The proposed direction for this specific use, therefore, was supplemental to that overall guidance. Respondents were not aware of or did not have access to this overall guidance. They sought to resolve their concerns or objections by recommending more complete descriptions of the processes or clarification of procedures relating to recreation residence continuance. Thus, many of the comments summarized above could be responded to by simply stating that the concern is thoroughly treated elsewhere in FSM or FSH. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is sympathetic to the respondents' dilemma. However, it disputes the contention that actions affecting recreation residences during forest planning occur without any effective rules to guide them. The rules (direction) are clear and thorough. The agency's dilemma is that its directives policy prohibits repetition and redundancy in manual and handbook material for the sake of emphasis or clarity. Direction guiding the forest planning process is found in FSM 1920. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To resolve this dilemma, the agency has placed references at appropriate places in the final policy so that local agency officials and holders are aware of overall direction that influences the specific direction on recreation residence use. And, the agency believes that respondents' concerns about forest planning, consistency determinations, and applicability of NEPA, will be resolved as holders become more knowledgeable about the forest planning and environmental analysis processes. Most respondents acknowledged that the recreation residence use should be recognized in the Forest plan. Likewise, holders should recognize that it is in their interest to be involved in the forest planning process, not only to protect their interests in their recreation residences, but to demonstrate that they are part of the National Forest community and interested in its overall management. The Forest Service believes this final policy will encourage holder participation in the forest planning process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

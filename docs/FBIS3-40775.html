			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 13--The Joint Parliamentary  Committee (JPC), which is scheduled to submit its unanimous  report to Parliament on December 21, has called for suspension  of licences of foreign banks as part of the "stringent  penalties" for their role in the securities scam.    The third draft report had only called for the imposition of  stringent penalties in general.    The phrase "including suspension of their licences" was  added  as part of the Chairman, Mr. Ram Niwas Mirdha's amendments.    "It is necessary that stringent penalties are imposed on  these banks keeping in view the extent of irregularities  indulged in by each of them. Legal action should be pursued both  in India and the foreign country concerned," the unanimous draft  said.    "The Committee desire that special scrutiny may be carried  out by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) in all the foreign banks  involved in the recent irregularities and the question of  disallowing repatriation of profits through irregular securities  transactions and other malpractices be considered," the report  said.    Managements blamed: The JPC is quite severe on the  managements of the foreign banks as far as the question of  accountability is concerned. "A common refrain of the top  management of these banks has been their unawareness of what was  happening in their banks. Evidence before the Committee points  to the fact that the top managements of the foreign banks  examined by the Committee were aware of the goings on in their  banks."    Referring to the steps taken by individual banks to fix  responsibility, the JPC found these "bordered on two extremes."  "While BOA (Bank of America) and ANZ Grindlays Bank accepted  some of the irregularities committed by them and also expressed  regrets, in the case of Citibank it started with outright  denials of existence of any irregularity and gradually veered  around to acceptance of most of them," the draft report said.    "During the first evidence, the witness of the bank  categorically stated, `there is no evidence of employees fraud'.  Even during the subsequent hearing the witness initially stuck  to the same viewpoint and stated, 'there is also no reason to  suspect employee fraud'."    "However, in the same breath he added, `swift action has  been  initiated. The three seniormost officers and the seniormost  dealer in the securities and PMS [Portfolio Management Scheme]  areas are no longer in the employ of Citicorp/Citibank. The RBI  has been kept informed," the draft said.    Giving details of the operations of foreign banks, the draft  said that with an insignificant numerical presence (45 banks  with 140 branches) they had made record profits. Indian banks,  on the other hand, had about 65,000 branches.    "The net profit of these banks has grown by more than six  times during less than five years from a mere Rs.[rupees] 66.59  crores in December, 1987 to a hefty Rs. 433.09 crores in March  1992."    "The profits in March 1992 are to be viewed in the context  of  the fact that their total presence in the banking system is  hardly 0.4 per cent and the profits made by the entire banking  industry during the period were Rs. 1,299 crores."    Simultaneously, the Committee came down heavily on the  foreign banks for not being able to meet priority sector lending  targets. "Their lending to the priority sector...has during the  last four years been 7.67, 9.84, 9.45 and 7.86 percent against  the targets of 10, 12, 12 and 15 percent."    Though governed by the laws of the land, foreign banks,  following the foreign exchange crunch, came to "enjoy more  indulgence of the regulatory/monetary authorities, even though  theoretically they continued to be governed by the same control  measures as applicable to their Indian counterparts."    "The examination by the Committee of securities transactions  in banks has revealed that the foreign banks particularly have  been deeply involved in the irregularities in securities  transactions, they have acted in an unbecoming manner, indulged  in large-scale security deals, highly disproportionate to their  normal requirements and in the process not only violated RBI  guidelines but also their own set procedures and prime facie the  laws of the countries of their origin," the JPC said.    Judicial probe demanded: Thirteen members of three  major opposition parties in the 30-member JPC investigating the  securities scam submitted a combined note to the JPC seeking a  judicial inquiry into stockbroker Mr. Harshad Mehta's allegation  of a Rs. 1-crore pay-off to Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha  Rao, JPC sources said.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Polluted land THE GOVERNMENT has shelved its original proposals for a register of contaminated land, as Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, is likely to confirm soon. The motives behind the proposals were sound - the recognition that contamination by metals and industrial chemicals can damage health, and that more information about the risks should be available. However, the scheme threatened to be overambitious and unworkable, so a new approach is in order. The original plans, framed in the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, have come under fierce attack during two stormy public consultations. As most recently proposed, the register would have included all land known to have been used by one of several types of heavy industry, regardless of whether it was actually contaminated. Suggestions for a survey of actual contamination were rejected because of the financial burden such an exercise would have placed on many local authorities. The register's critics - mainly builders and lenders - complained that it threatened to blight property values across much of the country, including perhaps a third of the Midlands. Leading banks also warned that the register could inhibit commercial development. They were wary of taking potentially contaminated land as security for loans, because of the risk of a fall in value or huge clean-up costs. The question is what should now replace the proposals. The alternative which Mr Howard is most likely to announce is for a register built up gradually by recording contamination when land changes hands. Under this proposal, which is backed by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, the seller of the property would be responsible for demonstrating that the land under offer was clean. That solution is workable, but it does not address the problem of assessing the risk to people working or living on contaminated land that is not changing hands. One answer would be to press councils to survey at least the land that is most likely to be contaminated, in order to bring the worst risks to light. This approach would be less ambitious than the original proposals, but would represent a clear move in the right direction.</p>

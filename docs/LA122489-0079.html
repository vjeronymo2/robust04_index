			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COSBY'S COMMENTS  </P> <P> Many kudos to Cosby for saying: "Even if we have to put in our schools more  courses in religion and human behavior we have to find ways to convey  self-strength. We gotta get that to our children."  </P> <P> He is so right. Unless we get back to the old-fashioned family values, our  country will continue to become a wasteland of crime, corruption and unbridled  morals.  </P> <P> FREDERICK D.

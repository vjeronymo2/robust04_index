			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Turks attack Kurdish bases THE Turkish military was yesterday engaged in large-scale air and ground attacks on bases of the Kurdish Workers' party (PKK) that have lasted at least four days. It is the first government offensive since the beginning of winter and a move clearly aimed at disrupting rebel attempts to exploit upcoming Kurdish New Year celebrations on March 21. The latest military operation, in which government forces claim to have killed at least 50 PKK guerrillas near Mount Ararat on the Armenian border, coincides with this week's vote in parliament to extend the emergency administration for the 10 Kurdish-speaking provinces. Both the prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, and the military have recommended that martial law, in place since July 1987, should remain for a further four months. The prime minister seems keen to distance himself from recent hardline statements from the interior minister, Mr Ismet Sezgin, who warned that 'if we wanted to, we could all bring them together and kill them and say they had committed suicide'. Nonetheless, with just two weeks to the New Year celebrations, there is growing anxiety to avoid last year's violence in which more than 90 civilians were killed when the government used tanks and armoured vehicles to reassert control in a string of towns along the border with Iraq and Syria. The PKK was accused then of trying to turn the celebrations into a separatist demonstration. The prime minister has held meetings with Mr Ahmet Turk, chairman of the People's Labour party, the nearest thing to an explicitly pro-Kurdish political party. A year on, the root causes of Kurdish discontent have still to be addressed. Repressive policing methods, lack of confidence in the legal process, together with the powerlessness of locals Kurds elected to parliament, have sharpened local disillusion with the government in Ankara. After the bloodiest year in the eight-year insurgency, with more than 2,000 people killed in 1992, the winter months have provided both sides with a respite. However, western diplomats believe the government has missed the opportunity to use the breathing space to push on with its earlier promise of reform.</p>

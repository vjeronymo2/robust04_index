			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pavol Vitko: "Political Parties Are Allegedly </F> Spying Within the Army"]    [Text] "Some political parties have gone beyond the  acceptable limits in wanting to establish collective rights for  the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. If they want to continue to  escalate the tension, then they have to be prepared to face the  state power. No provinces will be established. You and we are  the guaranties that it will not happen.... This state does not  intend to give up an inch of its territory. This would provoke  a conflict in Europe," Prime Minister Meciar said at a meeting  with Defense Ministry officials in Bratislava yesterday.    In this connection, the prime minister explained his opinion  on the signs in communities with an ethnically mixed population.  He said that the government demands that the names of  communities be given in the ethnic minority's language as a  translation from Slovak. He did not agree with the Castle's  [the president's] opinion, according to which the ethnic  minorities can chose their own names. He said that the  minorities enjoyed rights that are higher than standard, and  even President Clinton expressed, during a meeting with him, his  rejective stance on collective rights. Because of that, Prime  Minister Meciar expressed his hope that the Slovak-Hungarian  treaty that is being drafted will also contain a passage on the  inviolability of the borders.    "Slovakia accepts the opinion that Europe should be safe for  all of us. We want to build a unified Europe and we must not  allow Europe to be partitioned according to the spheres of  interest," the prime minister continued. He expressed  satisfaction over our participation in the Partnership For Peace  project, despite the fact that "some people forgot to mention  the Slovak Republic in connection with this initiative or  assumed that Slovakia would not join the initiative." The prime  minister added that should Zhirinovskiy come to power in Russia,  a new fascist regime would be installed there representing a  threat to the whole of Europe. In this connection he stressed  the need of additional intensive military ties with NATO.    Vladimir Meciar said that one of the demands is for the Army  to introduce tougher discipline, radically intensify training,  introduce an army structure different from that based on the  divisions, and establish civilian control over the Army. He  said that the Slovak Republic Army has a budget of 10 billion  Slovak korunas [Sk] this year, which is more than last year.  Next year, the Army will receive even more. He said that as  repayment of the Soviet debt, the Army should receive technology  worth $180 million. (Slovak Republic Defense Minister Imrich  Andrejcak said after the meeting that, in this case, spare  parts, and not new weapon systems, would be delivered--Editorial  note.)    From the viewpoint of the military development, the prime  minister described 1994 as a year of government efforts to  stabilize its position and that of its political partners, so as  to be able to face political forces that hold different  opinions. He said that the government expects the economy to  rebound this year, but the social system will be one or two  years behind, if for no other reason than because the state will  have to repay a debt of Sk31.3 billion by 1995, which represents  Sk24.4 this year, while it was only Sk7 billion last year.    In 1990, the Army was depoliticized. This means that  soldiers and officers must not be members of any political  party, and they must not perform any activity for any party,  Vladimir Meciar said. "Some political parties have data on the  Army, and this is unacceptable. The state is above the Army and  is not interested in political disputes within the Army. This  would pose an enormous risk," the prime minister stressed.    At the news conference that was supposed to take place after  the prime minister's speech we wanted to ask which political  parties have planted their spies within the Army. Prime  Minister Meciar, however, got rid of the journalists roughly.  His aide, an officer, was given this task and ordered the  journalist out of the hall. He said that they had 10 minutes to  take photos, and then they were to wait in a nearby lobby. Most  of the journalists did so. When the prime minister came, the  journalists did not react to his call for questions for about  three minutes, as some of them were still looking for their  places. Suddenly, a voice said: "Since there are no questions,  the news conference is over." Then, Vladimir Meciar and his  escort left the hall. However, we believe that he will return  to the problem of spies within the Army....</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EARNINGS: BAT INDUSTRIES PROFITS FALL 11%  </P> <P> Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries PLC said today that its  profits fell 11% in the first half of the year due largely to huge insurance  claims for storm damage last winter in Britain.  </P> <P> The company, Britain's fourth largest, announced pretax profits of $1.1 billion  for the year to June 30 against $1.3 billion for the first half of 1989.  </P> <P> Operating profits from BAT's financial services, including its insurance units,  Farmers Group in California and Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar in Britain,  plummeted to $486 million from $782 million in the first six months of last  year.  </P> <P> But BAT, whose initials refer to its roots as British American Tobacco, managed  a big gain in its tobacco units, whose operating profit jumped to $896 million  from $754 million.  </P></p>

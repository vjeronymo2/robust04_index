			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich preoccupied with Swiss Re and UBS Senior bourses came cautiously, and in some cases uncomfortably, to the end of a doubt-ridden week, writes Our Market Staff. ZURICH was lower in heavy volume, with attention dominated by developments at Swiss Re and at UBS, which is heading for a showdown over control with Mr Martin Ebner and BZ Bank. The SMI index fell 23.6 to 2,534.4 taking the week's fall to 2.9 per cent. UBS bearers finished SFr5 lower at SFr1,200 and the registered stock lost SFr21 to SFr303 after the bank's announcement late on Thursday that it planned to create a single bearer share to curb the power of predators. BK Vision, the investment company controlled by BZ Bank, fell SFr50 to SFr1,400. Some analysts suggested that falls in Roche certificates, SFr95 lower at SFr5,785, Zurich Insurance, SFr51 at SFr1,170, and Ems-Chemie, SFr100 at SFr4,060, could be attributed to expectations that Mr Ebner might soon reduce his stakes in these companies to raise cash for the UBS battle. However, others noted switching from Zurich Insurance into Swiss Re on the sale of its direct insurance holdings to Allianz of Germany and Winterthur, and plans to concentrate on reinsurance. Swiss Re, rewarded by analysts with earnings upgrades, rose SFr49 to SFr626 but Winterthur dipped SFr5 to SFr655. FRANKFURT, closed for the Unity day holiday on Monday, incorporated Thursday's post-bourse losses during the session. But it ran into more trouble in the afternoon when the Ibis-indicated Dax index hit 1,984.65 before recovering to close 13.78 lower over 24 hours at 2,002.30, down by 4.3 per cent on the week. Turnover rose again, from DM6.7bn to DM7.6bn, and brokers were beginning to put some credence behind the stories of US selling. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, said that there were strong indications of US selling on worries that the FDP, or German liberal party, may lose its place in this month's polls, and that a red/green coalition could take over from the current combination of conservatives and liberals. At corporate level, Allianz dropped DM70 to DM2,240 following its direct insurance acquisitions from Swiss Re. BMW recovered DM18.50 to DM752.50 after Thursday's 5.2 per cent drop following the recall of 57,000 325i models in the US At Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, Mr Eckhard Frahm's check on monthly performance of the Dax constituent put a clutch of defensive stocks at the top of the defensive charts: Schering (recovering from worries about its product lines), Karstadt, RWE, Dresdner Bank and Viag. Over nine months, the outperformers were cyclicals: BMW, Lufthansa, Hoechst, Thyssen and Preussag, most of which came in for selling over the past two days. PARIS threatened its 1994 low, the CAC-40 index bottoming at 1,856.52 before recovering to close 3.07 higher at 1,879.25, off 2.5 per cent on the week, in turnover of FFr5.08bn. Alcatel stabilised after Thursday's horrors, closing a token 60 centimes higher at FFr489.30. The market liked the results from Paribas, Saint Louis, and Peugeot, which rose by FFr6.80 to FFr324, FFr57 to FFr1,457, and FFr11 to FFr784 respectively. MILAN finished lower as some disappointing interim results added to worries that the budget could face a bumpy passage through parliament. The Comit index fell 11.20 or 1.6 per cent to 679.77 but was still 1.6 per cent higher over the week. Benetton was marked L1,150 or 5.2 per cent lower at L21,000 in response to disappointing results. Ras fell L2,200 or 8.6 per cent to L23,500 when it was readmitted after a trading suspension on worries that the SFr1.5bn price that it is to pay for Elvia, the Swiss insurer, was too high. Fiat gave up L60 to L6,680 in spite of the better than expected first half figures after the market closed on Thursday. Among the telecoms stocks, Stet fell L119 to L4,835 and Stet gave up L75 to L4,400 on profit taking. AMSTERDAM was easier but off lows after reports of the US-Japanese trade agreement as it tried out its new dealing system for the first time. The AEX index gave up 1.64 to 402.27 for a 0.3 per cent fall on the week. Aegon was up 20 cents at Fl 100.20 after announcing the sale of part of a UK insurance unit to Independent Insurance Group. Wolters Kluwer rose Fl 4.50 to Fl 123.50 and VNU lost Fl 2.50 to Fl 188.20 which, broker said, suggested switching in the stocks. Chemicals were weak, with Akzo Nobel down Fl 3.80 at Fl 204.10 and DSM, after two days of briefing analysts, losing Fl 4.80 at Fl 147.50.

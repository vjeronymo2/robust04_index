			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS IGNORE SLOWDOWN, SOAR TO NEAR RECORD  </P> <P> In a graphic illustration of the perverse nature of Wall Street, the stock  market soared Friday in response to signs that the economy is slowing. The Dow  Jones industrial average, a key indicator of market activity, rose 63.07 to  close at 2,801.58 -- just 9 points shy of its all-time high.  </P> <P> "There seems to be something of a celebration going on," said Hugh A. Johnson,  chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "The response of the markets has  bordered on euphoria."  </P> <P> The financial markets were reacting to economic figures released early in the  day that indicated the economy has slowed dramatically.  </P> <P> Retail sales fell 0.6% in April, the sharpest decline in six months, the  Commerce Department reported. And producer prices, which were expected to rise  slightly, fell 0.3% following their 0.2% drop in March, according to the Labor  Department. Both figures are key indicators of the future direction of  inflation, which had been rising stubbornly since late last year.  </P> <P> The rising inflation rates had caused the Federal Reserve to tighten credit,  which pushed interest rates higher and depressed the stock market early in the  year. Higher interest rates make it more expensive for both consumers and  companies to borrow, which slows spending and ultimately hurts corporate  profits.  </P> <P> Friday's reaction on Wall Street was made all the more dramatic because the  recessionary figures were a surprise. Economists previously had expected both  producer prices and retail sales to rise slightly during the month of April.  </P> <P> "This was World Series surprise time," said Johnson. "The inflation numbers  were much less than expected, the retail sales numbers were much less than  expected, and the reaction of the markets was much greater than expected. This  was a day of surprises."  </P> <P> The bad economic news was taken as a clear signal that the Fed would not raise  interest rates further. And additional signs of slowing might cause the agency  to lower rates.  </P> <P> "This means the Fed is definitely not going to raise interest rates," said Jack  Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. "They are  going to be content to let (rates) stay where they are, and then slowly drop  over time."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates set off a rally in the bond  market, with the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond jumping by about  $17.50 per $1,000 in face value.  </P> <P> There are also signs that figures on consumer prices, industrial production and  housing starts, which are all expected out next week, will continue to show a  weakening economy, said Mark M. Green, economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Still, some investment experts were already saying Friday that the market  reacted too much. The striking increases in stock and bond prices are probably  not sustainable over time, said Richard Bernstein, manager of quantitative  analysis at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> "You saw a knee-jerk reaction today to the interest rate speculation,"  Bernstein said. "The question is: Will it go on? Is it the begining of a major  rally? We don't think so."  </P> <P> Although interest rates always play a key role in the health of the stock  market, so do corporate profits. And the news on corporate profits continues to  be negative. Merrill Lynch analysts have been lowering their earnings forecasts  for the past several months and continue to do so, Bernstein said.  </P> <P> Overseas stock markets also posted strong results. Prices closed sharply higher  Friday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with late buying encouraged by the strength  of the bond market and the Japanese yen. The key Nikkei average of 225 issues,  which gained 34.65 points Thursday, surged 531.88 points to close at 31,512.14.  </P> <P> In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished up 18.9  points at 2,175.9 following the release of better-than-expected British  inflation figures.  </P> <P> Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 234.04 million shares, compared to  158.46 million on Thursday. Friday's trading was the heaviest of the year,  pushing up prices for a wide range of companies. Advancing issues outnumbered  decliners by a 4-1 margin.  </P> <P> Prospects for lower interest rates particularly fueled financial stocks, with  shares of the Federal National Mortgage Corp. rising $2 to $38.75; Citicorp  climbed $1.125 to close at $23.875 and Great Western Financial Corp. closed up  87.5 cents at $18.125.  </P> <P> IBM rose $1.625, closing at $114. General Electric climbed 87.5 cents to close  at $44.25 and Eastman Kodak jumped $1.50, closing at $40.625.  </P> <P> The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 8.18 points to 352.00. The  NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks rose 4.10 to 192.24. The  American Stock Exchange index rose 3.58 to 352.50, while the NASDAQ over the  counter index climbed 4.90 to 438.10.  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICES FALL -- Large declines in food and energy costs push prices  down 0.3% in April.

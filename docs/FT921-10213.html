			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: US stores turn in better sales SHARES in retail stocks moved broadly higher yesterday after a number of leading US companies reported relatively healthy same-store sales growth during January. At K mart, for example, January's same-store sales growth reached 6.2 per cent, compared with 2.9 per cent for the past three-month period. Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman of the general merchandise stores group, said that sales had been 'quite strong in January', and that low pricing had bolstered sales of fashion lines. J. C. Penney, the Dallas-based department stores group, saw sales on the comparable store basis rise by 7.3 per cent. Mr William Howell, chairman, commented that performance had been good across the board, but with the men's and women's divisions leading the way. Wal-Mart Stores, the fast-expanding discount retailer, saw same-store sales rose by 13 per cent, while its Sams Wholesale Clubs division saw 8 per cent growth. The Gap, the highly successful fashion retailer, reported a 14 per cent advance in same-store sales for the month, compared with a 6 per cent gain in the same month a year ago. At Woolworth, domestic same-store sales growth reached 6 per cent. However, Mr Harold Sells, Woolworth's chairman, sounded a note of caution: 'January sales increases reflected higher-than-anticipated promotional activity and clearance mark downs in North American general merchandise operations, which were necessary to bring inventories into line. 'We remain cautious in our appraisal of world economic conditions going forward,' he said. Nevertheless, the New York stock market marked up the share prices in most of the US retail companies in yesterday's early trading. Woolworth rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 30, Wal-Mart gained Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 55 5/8 and J. C. Penney rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 59 1/2 . The Gap gained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 55 1/8 and K mart was Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 52.</p>

The current National People's Congress  (NPC) is the most rudderless since the messy sessions of the  Cultural Revolution, when the Great Helmsman went berserk.  Instead of sketching a bold tableau for the Asia-Pacific  Century cadres addressing the rubber stamp parliament have  displayed a talent for obfuscation, doublespeak and  trompe-l'oeil.    President Jiang Zemin and Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji  made much of the fact that reform had reached "the critical  stage of breaching the fortresses". However, reports delivered  to the Congress by leaders including Premier Li Peng had more to  do with the high-wire act of "striking a balance between reform,  development and stability". This is a tattered euphemism for  soft-pedalling market reform to keep the workers and farmers  from hitting the streets.    A central plank of Mr Li's strategy for re-imposing central  -- particularly fiscal --- discipline on the nation is to fix a  growth rate of nine per cent for 1994. Both the premier and Mr  Jiang, however, have qualified themselves by pointing out there  is some leeway in this, particularly for regions whose speedy  growth is anchored upon rising productivity. As State Planning  Minister Chen Jinhua put it: "The national economy must at the  same time maintain the trend of fast-paced growth and pay  attention to the possibility of the blind pursuit of an  excessively high speed."    Mr Li's opinion on price reform -- deemed the sine qua non  for liberalisation -- is a study in calculated ambiguity.  "Defreezing prices does not mean doing away with macro-level  adjustments and controls," said the premier, who last week  slapped price controls back on 20 "essential commodities".    Provincial leaders attending the Congress have been speaking  with forked tongues. Former party chief of Jiangsu Shen Daren,  who lost his job last autumn for sabotaging Mr Zhu's austerity  programme, surprised observers by the fervency of his  protestation of loyalty. "Jiangsu will resolutely safeguard the  authority of the Party Centre everything (in the province) will  be done from the point of view of the overall situation of the  country," Mr Shen said.    Apparently invoking the "whateverism" of former party  chairman Hua Guofeng ("whatever Chairman Mao said was correct"),  Shanghai party boss Wu Bangguo had this to say about toeing the  central line: "Whatever the Party Centre has made clear,  Shanghai will carry out resolutely." Mr Shen's subtle irony is  that his "obedience" is predicated upon there being a central  authority worth defending. Mr Wu's diabolical cunning consists  in the fact that since the central Government has so far failed  to clarify itself on a host of major policies, Shanghai need  carry out none of them.    Beijing's tragedy is that mired in New Helmsman Deng  Xiaoping's dictum of "crossing the river while feeling out for  the boulders", the central authorities have been hedging and  waffling all the way.    Take the "dual tax system," the centrepiece of Beijing's bid  to boost its share of national revenue to 60 per cent. The game  plan -- whereby Beijing arrogates the most lucrative of the tax  bases and leaves the less profitable ones to the localities --  is supposed to have started on January. However, in the past  week, top officials have sounded wishy-washy on the  controversial fiscal regime. Vice Premier Zhu was  uncharacteristically duplicitous about when the new system would  begin. When pressed by delegates for a timetable, Mr Zhu said:  "We'll spend the first year familiarising ourselves with the  main points (of the levy). The mechanism should be rendered  stable the following year. Mature implementation should be  reached the third year."    Deputy tax chief Jin Xin was no less murky on the dual-tax  syndrome. Last Sunday, he mumbled something about synthesising  the goal of "no direct interference in the vested interests of  localities" on the one hand, and "localities taking care of the  national interest" on the other. Mr Jin proved himself a past  master of newspeak when he tackled the issue of the capital  gains tax for real estate. "China implements a unified tax  system and it will not do (for localities) to go their own  ways," he said with reference to the levy. "Yet there will be a  rational division of power between the centre and the regions,  so that the latter will have considerable jurisdiction over  parts of their taxes."    The leadership's policy towards large- and medium-sized  enterprises is a case of mind-boggling prevarication. No  clear-cut indication has been given on whether Beijing is ready  to sunder its umbilical cord to the dinosaurs. Premier Li asked  local governments to continue "creating a favourable external  environment" for public sector units.    Vice-Premier Zhu, an advocate of radical surgery, said on  Monday that Beijing would still "take concrete measures to solve  the historical baggage of government-owned concerns". These  cryptic remarks give no clue as to for how long Beijing will  continue underwriting the losses of state firms.    Vice-Governor Zhou Zhengqing of the People's Bank of China,  which is supposed to keep a tight rein on spending, played fast  and loose with the fiscal conservatism that is supposed to be a  leitmotif of this NPC. When asked to explain why he had  released new loans on Monday for the three depressed sectors of  coal, metallurgy and electricity, Mr Zhou said: "Controlling  the total volume of credit does not mean a tight-money policy.  We must provide support for major parts (of the economy)". He  did not explain what was so "major" about these sunset  industries.    The artful representation of the truth reached an acme  Tuesday night when two of Mr Deng's daughters, Deng Nan and Deng  Rong, volunteered information about their father's "excellent"  health. "My dad walks at least three kilometres every day," said  Ms Deng Nan. "He likes to swim in the open seas."    Premier Li, then, must be saluted for his singular devotion  to nothing but the truth when he told NPC delegates last  Thursday that "the responsibility for the breakdown of the  (Sino-British) talks lies with the Chinese side ... the British  side."    As former Vice-Minister Ying Ruocheng surmised, Mr Li had  not  taken up the dramatic arts. So long as the New Helmsman's  survival seems dependent on his 30-odd medical team, the major  players in Chinese politics are too consumed with the deathwatch  as to do anything more meaningful than acting and dissembling.</p>

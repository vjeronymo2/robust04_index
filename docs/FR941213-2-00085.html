Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants should receive advanced training in EFL: course and curriculum design, teacher training and management skills, evalution and testing, with an intensive American Studies component. Special emphasis should be placed on incorporating American Studies materials into an intercultural curriculum. Since this will be the first U.S. experience for many of the participants, the program should introduce the participants to U.S. life, institutions, values, and culture through classes, field trips, contacts with Americans, and community activities. The program should maintain a relative balance among discussion sessions, workshops, and practical experience and promote interaction among the participants. The project should also include an individual research project for each participant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 30 Brazilian nationals who are full time employees at a Binational Center in Brazil will participate in this program. Each participant is nominated by his/her institution for final selection by United States Information Service (USIS). Participants either teach English as a Foreign Language, administer English or American Studies programs, or provide teacher training in either English or American Studies. Participants will come on ``B1&hyph;B2'' visas issued by U.S. Consular Officers at American Embassy or Consulates in Brazil. USIS Brasilia will provide the university with biographical and professional data on each candidate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal should specifically address the following technical requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Pre-Program Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After receiving the final participant list, the university is expected to do the following: send USIS a pre-departure information packet containing welcome and general information with practical suggestions for preparing the participants for their stay at the university. The participants will arrive directly at the program site from their home cities. The university program staff will be expected to make arrangements to have participants met upon arrival at the airport nearest the university campus. A substantive orientation should be provided shortly after all the participants' arrival at the university. The purpose of the orientation is to provide detailed information concerning the program, university, community, etc. It should also acquaint participants with one another, the university program, and the administrative staff. During this orientation a brief needs assessment is to be conducted to determine individual learning needs and to identify the topic of the individual research project. The Institute Director should be prepared to adjust program content, emphasis, and schedule as necessary to respond to participants' concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

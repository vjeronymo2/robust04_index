			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Tajikistan plans to introduce rationing Tajikistan plans to introduce rationing in its capital, Dushanbe, to alleviate acute commodity shortages, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dushanbe. City council officials said ration tickets had been printed and would be distributed soon for meat, flour, noodles, butter, vegetable oil, vodka, soap, rice and tea. Bread is not to be rationed. The move is part of a general attempt to improve the basic standard of living in Tajikistan, which remains one of the poorest of the former Soviet republics, having never recovered from civil war in 1992. It follows the Central Asian state's adoption of Russia's rouble as its currency last Saturday, when it dumped the old Soviet-era roubles used for decades.</p>

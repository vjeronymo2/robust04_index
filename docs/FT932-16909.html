			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Clinton joins Thorp nuclear plant row PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has stepped into the controversy over the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in a move which could further delay the start of its operations. Mr Clinton has told seven congressmen he will raise the issue with the British government after his administration has looked into ways of combating nuclear proliferation. In a letter to the president on February 23, just days before his first meeting with Mr John Major, the congressmen warned Mr Clinton that plutonium produced at Thorp would add to the world's stockpile and increase the risk of the spread of nuclear weapons. The congressmen, led by Mr Pete Stark of California, also wrote to Mr Major before his visit, but have not yet had a reply. Their letter urged that 'a decision by the UK against commissioning the Thorp plant would be a significant contribution to efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons'. The questions about the reprocessing plant took Mr Major by surprise on his US visit and he called for hurried briefings from London. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said four days ago that preventing the spread of nuclear weapons was one of the administration's top concerns when considering foreign aid requests. Mr Christopher's comments followed news that North Korea had flouted a United Nations deadline for inspection of its nuclear facilities. However, US administration officials cautioned that the Thorp plant was not high on their list of priorities, and doubted that it would become a significant bilateral issue between the US and the UK. The UK government is embroiled in three separate inquiries into whether the plant should begin operating. President Clinton's interest in the destination of plutonium produced by Thorp will complicate the British government's task and could worry Thorp's foreign customers. In a reply to the congressmen, President Clinton said that once the US had concluded its review, 'we will surely wish to consult with the British on appropriate steps we could take together to combat nuclear proliferation'. Downing Street declined to comment last night on the possibility of US intervention in British nuclear policy. British Nuclear Fuels, which has built Thorp, said 'plutonium which Thorp will reclaim cannot be converted into weapons grade material without substantial expertise and equipment'.</p>

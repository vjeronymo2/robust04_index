			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: Orix, Nippon Shinpan advance Orix and Nippon Shinpan, two leading Japanese financial services companies, reported slightly higher profits for the six months to September in spite of falls in operating revenues. Both said their improved profitability was a result of efforts to reduce funding costs. Orix, the country's largest leasing company, saw recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - rise 6.2 per cent to Y17.9bn (Dollars 102.4m) from the same period a year earlier. In spite of the continued weakness of capital expenditure at home, the company recorded an increase of 2.6 per cent in outstanding operating assets, to Y4.0trn. Total turnover fell 6.2 per cent to Y157.0bn as interest rates were lower during the period than a year earlier. Expenses fell 7.6 per cent to Y139.0bn, because of lower borrowing costs and a greater emphasis on diversifying sources of funding. After-tax profits fell 1.4 per cent to Y9.3bn. The company forecast an increase in recurring profits of 5.2 per cent to Y36bn for the full year to next March on turnover ahead 1.7 per cent at Y331bn. Nippon Shinpan, one of the leading credit card operators, reported recurring profits of Y5.02bn for the half-year, 0.7 per cent higher than a year earlier. Operating revenues fell 0.3 per cent to Y186.6bn while after-tax profits rose 7.2 per cent to Y2.2bn. The company said the improved profits were attributable to reductions in costs in order to develop new loan services. Nippon Shinpan is diversifying its activities from shopping credit to housing and consumer loans. For the full year to March it forecast a rise of 4 per cent in recurring profits to Y13bn.</p>

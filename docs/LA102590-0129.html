			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> PROSPECT OF 2ND TV DEBATE ALL BUT DEAD  </P> <P> Last-ditch efforts to arrange a second and final televised gubernatorial debate  between Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein failed on  Wednesday.  </P> <P> As a result, the candidates apparently will have to rely on their own  television commercials and any news coverage they can attract between now and  Election Day on Nov. 6 to get their final campaign messages across to a  critical bloc of undecided voters.  </P> <P> Wilson early Wednesday accepted the offer of KNSD Channel 39 in San Diego to  hold a debate tonight, with Wilson participating by satellite television feed  from Washington, where he has been for more than a week for U.S. Senate  sessions. Feinstein rejected the offer as not in keeping with the original  agreement to have two face-to-face debates, one in Southern California and one  in Northern California.  </P> <P> Feinstein then accepted the offer of KPIX to air such a debate from its San  Francisco studios next Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday evenings. Wilson, through  his campaign manager, George Gorton, declared the proposal unacceptable because  of other campaign commitments.  </P> <P> By Wednesday evening, both sides acknowledged that the prospect of a second  debate was dead unless one campaign or the other reconsidered its stance. That  did not seem likely.  </P> <P> In a letter faxed to Wilson in Washington, Feinstein said: "A hastily planned  exchange in San Diego is no substitute for a second debate in Northern  California.  </P> <P> "With the election just around the corner, a face-to-face discussion between  the two candidates for governor would give Californians one last opportunity to  compare our views and goals for the state," she said.  </P> <P> KPIX had offered broadcast times on Saturday and Sunday afternoons and Tuesday,  Wednesday and Thursday evenings. Acknowledging that Wilson would have  difficulty returning from Washington for a weekend meeting, Feinstein opted for  any of the weekday openings. But Gorton said that no longer was possible.  </P> <P> "Nope," he said, "we're not going to. We've had to compress two weeks' events  into one last week."  </P> <P> Wilson was forced to return to Washington for overtime sessions of Congress on  the budget and other matters, in part because of campaign pressure from  Feinstein, who criticized him for missing Senate votes.  </P> <P> Gorton added: "We can't give up three of the last seven days of the campaign.  Dianne Feinstein knows that."  </P> <P> He rejected Feinstein's argument that the San Diego station could not have  assembled a statewide network for a debate tonight on such short notice. He  said KNSD could have taken over the linkup of other California stations that  had already agreed to broadcast the KPIX debate.  </P> <P> The first hourlong debate originated in Burbank on Oct. 7. The second was to  have been in San Francisco last Thursday.  </P></p>

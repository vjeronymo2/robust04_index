			<p>BFN     [Text] At the provincial foreign affairs work conference  which ended on 26 March, Governor Shao Qihui pointed: It is  necessary to combine foreign affairs work with the overall  situation of reform and opening up, and enable foreign affairs  work to become an important force for promoting reform, opening  up, development, and stability.    Governor Shao said: At present, the international situation  and the situation of neighboring countries are very advantageous  to our province. Border trade has rapidly expanded; the number  of open ports have increased to 21; and the transaction volume  made at the four successive Harbin trade fairs has increased  every year. We have established friendly relations with 29  cities of nine countries, such as Japan and the United States,  and economic contacts and friendly exchange relations with more  than 120 countries and regions in the world. This has provided  an important opportunity and laid an important foundation for  further creating a new situation in foreign affairs work. In  China, many fake and inferior products have flowed to the  markets in Russia and other CIS countries through various  illegal channels. Problems on some evildoers and unlawful  elements who sneaked to other countries through various  relations to form criminal cliques to engage in fighting,  killing, and robbery must be resolutely checked.    Governor Shao stressed: It is not realistic to rely only on  the efforts of foreign affairs departments in strengthening  management over foreign affairs work and rectifying the chaotic  phenomenon. Party committees and governments at all levels must  give unified instruction, coordinate with various sectors, and  concentrate time and energy on comprehensively improving this  situation. The discipline inspection and supervision  departments should strictly investigate and handle cases on  discipline and law breaches in examination and approval of  procedures for leaving the country and in management. Public  security and armed police departments should strengthen  management over the border areas and deal strict blows to  criminal activities outside the territory.    Governor Shao pointed out: Governments at all levels should  attach prime importance to foreign affairs work; leaders at all  levels should take the lead in observing the state's relevant  stipulations on foreign affairs work, and must not disturb  foreign affairs departments to implement policies through human  relationship. They should also do a good job in maintaining  coordination and cooperation among departments. As the foreign  affairs functional departments of local governments, foreign  affairs offices should conscientiously supervise, inspect, and  coordinate this work. No phenomena of shifting responsibility  onto other people and disputing over trifles should emerge.    The three-day provincial foreign affairs work conference  relayed the guidelines of foreign affairs office meetings of  directors of various provinces, prefectures, and cities across  the province. Responsible comrades in charge of foreign affairs  work from various prefectures, cities, and counties across the  province studied and discussed this work.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dream seeks bankruptcy protection DREAM, a Japanese civil engineering company turned pinball parlour operator and stock speculator, has filed for bankruptcy protection with the Nagoya District Court. The failure of Dream, which has about Y50bn (Dollars 462m) in outstanding debts, also raises doubts about the future of Gajeon Kanko, a stock market-listed hotel operator, which admits that Dream pays its employees' salaries. Trading in Gajeon Kanko stock was suspended yesterday. Dream's filing highlights the extreme pressure on companies which thrived in the easy money days of the late 1980s, but which are now facing huge losses on stock and property investments. They are also finding funds difficult to raise, as once-friendly banks are refusing to provide fresh loans. Both companies are linked to the already collapsed Cosmopolitan speculators' group, which bought stakes in dozens of companies during the 1980s, including a range of regional banks, which were expected to fund its investment activities. Former Cosmopolitan executives boasted of gangster links, although the claims could have been an attempt to lubricate the company's many attempts at 'greenmail', forcing companies to buy off spurious takeover attempts. Dream is still the largest shareholder in Gifu Bank, a conservative regional bank based in central Japan. While Dream, which operates pachinko (Japanese-style pinball) parlours, holds 5.5 per cent of the bank, it is understood that most of the company's funds have come from independent finance companies. For the year ended March, 1993, Dream reported a pre-tax loss of Y2.3bn and shortly after acquired 10m shares in Gajeon Kanko for Y2bn, which the company now says was never paid. With the allocation of the shares, Dream had acquired 21 per cent of Gajeon, making it the biggest shareholder. The complex links among the many speculator groups in Japan have led to Gajeon being caught up in the scandals surrounding Itoman, the large textile trader taken over by the Sumitomo group this year following a string of investments in stocks, property and French impressionist paintings. Mr Tsutomu Kudo, Gajeon's president, yesterday said his company had no collateral for the Y2bn in stocks given to Dream, nor is there a formal loan contract between the two companies. Apart from highlighting the influence of speculator groups, the Dream and Gajeon sagas have also drawn attention to auditors in Japan. Two years ago, an auditor approved, then rejected, and then approved Gajeon's accounts, though little new information was provided.</p>

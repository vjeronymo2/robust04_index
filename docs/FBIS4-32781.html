			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive article" by Fausto Triana: "Vietnam-United </F> States: Life After the Embargo"]    [Text] Hanoi -- It was like the touch of a magic wand. On  3 February, President Bill Clinton put an end to two decades of  political and trade embargoes against Vietnam. From that moment  on, the Indochinese country faced a new truth: Washington's  pressure had been, in effect, devastating.    It seemed like a dream, while others saw it as a mere  formality. Since the beginning of a profound process of economic  reforms in 1986, the Hanoi government had showed prowess and an  uncanny ability to maintain the breathing room necessary for its  survival.    Three months after the lifting of Washington's restrictions,  a spectacular flood of political and trade delegations has been  arriving weekly to court the so-called "virgin of Southeast  Asia."    It is the end of the international isolation to which  Vietnam  was subjected because it dared defeat the United States  militarily. The Indochinese nation is the best example of this.    Suddenly, the business sector is stampeding to conquer a new  market of 71 million inhabitants with oil, gas, and a wide range  of natural resources. Businessmen from places such as Taiwan,  Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and France have made  advance reservations in anticipation of this moment.    It cannot be denied the Vietnamese economic boom went a long  way by itself without any international help, although it was  prevented from acquiring high-technology while brushing aside  the ashes of war.    Hanoi's authorities, faithful to the Asian tradition of  patience, are not acting hastily, and they are not particularly  anxious. Therefore, some find their cautious reaction to the  lifting of the blockade to be surprising.    Concerning this issue, Le Mai, deputy foreign minister in  charge of negotiations with Washington in recent years, says the  Vietnamese people suffered enough during the war against the  United States.    This is, of course, a step forward, which should be followed  up with the full normalization of relations, but it also serves  to display the serious damage caused by the United States with  its economic and trade blockade policy during 20 years, Le Mai  said.    Putting resentment aside, the North American invasion -- now  employing the weapons of trade -- has encountered a predictable  reality: Those who were here in defiance of the embargo have  better knowledge of the market and, now with the White House's  consent, have quickly strengthened their positions.    There is enough room for everyone, however. Vietnam -- the  third-ranked rice exporter in the world, the fourth-ranked oil  producer in Asia, and a nation with a single digit inflation  rate and 7 percent average growth over the past three years --  urgently needs to improve its infrastructure.    Dr. Nguyen Mai, vice president of the State Committee for  Cooperation and Inmvestments (CECI), told PRENSA LATINA there  will be no preferential treatment for any nation. He said:  Logically, an atmosphere of mutual trust is created as a result  of the work experience, but our goal is to license projects to  real specialists. We want to introduce specialists who possess a  high level of training and technology into our country based on  mutual benefit.    Advisers of the U.S. Business and Assistance Council in  Asia recently visited Hanoi and estimated that during the next  two years, U.S. investments in Vietnam could reach $2.6 billion.    The trend is moving toward reaching agreements and obtaining  licenses in fields such as oil, gas, telecommunications,  industrial generators, transportation, road building, computers,  and consumer goods, says Maureen Flanagan, honorary chairman of  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Asia. In her opinion, her  country's investments will jump to $8 billion within five years,  at which time she expects fluid trade.    Noted local economist Le Dang Doang, however, warned that as  long as Vietnam does not receive most favored nation (MFN)  status in trade with the United States, the possibilities of  purchasing U.S. goods are limited.    A reduction of tariffs is imperative to position our  products  in the United States and to have the cash to compete with China  or Thailand, two countries awarded MFN status, Doang pointed out.    Right now we would like to purchase Boeing airplanes, but if  we sell textiles to the United States, it would be at a very low  price. At any rate, we will have to wait for the normalization  of relations, he added.    The first important agreement between Hanoi and the United  States, following the end of the embargo, was reached two months  ago. Vietnam will export 100,000 tons of rice to the United  States.    Influential media such as NEWSWEEK, THE NEW YORK TIMES, and  the CNN television network have predicted that liaison offices  will soon open in Hanoi and Washington, and it is almost certain  that embassies will be opened in mid-1995.    Diplomats residing in the Vietnamese capital generally agree  with this assessment, although they foresee certain obstacles on  the road to reestablishing bilateral ties.    The resolution of the MIA-POW issue has advanced notably in  the wake of close cooperation between Pentagon experts and  Vietnam's Defense Ministry. Even though there are more than  2,000 MIA-POW's and 300,000 Vietnamese files, the search for the  remains of the missing is becoming increasingly successful.    The avalanche of U.S. tourists has become noticeable since  the beginning of 1994. The majority of these tourists will help  to definitely heal the wounds of the conflict, but certain other  people have tried to spoil this atmosphere, a Foreign Ministry  official who asked to remain anonymous stressed. The human  rights issue is going to play the main role in this effort, and,  in terms of this issue, Vietnam has answered the United States  the same way some of her Asian neighbors have replied.  "Discussions on the issue must be based on mutual respect,  independence, sovereignty, and in keeping with the cultural  traditions of each country."    Today, life in Vietnam, if not completely untroubled, is  entering a stage of accelerated growth in what was once the  Cinderella of Southeast Asia. If conclusions can be reached,  here are two: The U.S. embargo was devastating, but the  persistence and valor of the Vietnamese people have won the  other war -- the economic war.</p>

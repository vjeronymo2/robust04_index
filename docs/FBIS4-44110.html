			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kamenz (DDP/ADN) -- Hoyerswerda has become the  first German town to elect a PDS [Party of Democratic  Socialists] mayor. In the second round of voting in yesterday's  local elections in Saxony, Horst-Dieter Braehmig gained 51.6  percent of the vote, clearly beating his SPD [Social Democratic  Party] opponent and thus providing the most sensational result  of the runoff elections.

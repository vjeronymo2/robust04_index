			<p>CSO     [Text] Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (KHI, President,  Hiroshi Oba) has developed a functionally gradient material  (FGM) which endures temperatures of up to 1,600 C which  they intend to apply to components of gas turbine engines. This  new zirconia/titanium aluminum-based FGM was made to resist  extremely high temperature by creating a very special  composition of zirconia on the surface which gets exposed to  high temperatures. Traditionally, 1,400 C has been  considered the maximum temperature materials such as nickel  alloy can resist. KHI succeeded in improving the heat resistance  by 200 C by making the joining boundary of thermal  insulation and cooling structural materials into a gradient  structure. KHI will present a paper on this subject at a June  meeting of the Japan Institute of Metals.    The increases in performance required in gas turbine engines  and the engines intended for use in hyper/super-sonic aircraft  have spurred the search for new heat resistant materials that  can consistently endure higher temperatures. Engine  manufacturers around the world have been striving to  commercialize gas turbine engines now that gradient structural  materials are being applied to thermal insulation/forced cooling  structures that maintain stable temperatures with little load on  the cooling system.    KHI intends to use their newly developed FGM able to endure  temperatures of 1,600 C for components of gas turbine  engines. They expect to market it within the next two to three  years.    KHI has established the long awaited thermal insulation  design method which has been demonstrated under actual  environmental conditions. KHI also has developed expertise on  destruction mechanisms for relaxation of thermal stress/material  design. KHI's latest commercialization plan is based on  accumulation of these basic technological accomplishments.  Successful marketing requires that engineering requirements are  met precisely, an objective KHI has achieved.    KHI, together with the Japan Atomic Energy Research  Institute, also has for some time been promoting development of  an electric insulation FGM for components for nuclear fusion  reactors. They have produced a pipe-shaped  stainless/zirconia/stainless prototype 30mm in diameter. Ceramic  is sandwiched between metals which can be welded with other  metal materials outside. The compositional transition between  the ceramic and the metals is gradual, thus achieving a new  gradient functions of electric property and weldability. This is  the first material created whose composition changes gradually  on both sides of the material. This joint research group now is  developing larger aperture pipes of 150mm diameter.    KHI is confident that they now are at the stage at which FGM  is ready for practical application, and therefore plan to  vigorously pursue its commercial potential.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CONSIDERS PAPER RECYCLING  </P> <P> The Santa Paula City Council is considering adopting a recycling program for  wastepaper generated by its city government offices.  </P> <P> According to Public Works Director Norm Wilkinson, most office waste is  high-quality paper, including that used in copying machines, computer printers,  memo pads and fax machines.  </P> <P> Wilkinson said a good market exists for recycled quality paper.  </P> <P> The Recycle All Paper Program has already been adopted by Ventura County. If  the Santa Paula council approves the program, each workstation in Santa Paula's  City Hall would be supplied with a box to hold paper waste, which would be  collected separately from other refuse. A private recycling company, Golden  State Fiber, would empty a dumpster reserved for the paper on a monthly basis.  </P> <P> Wilkinson said compliance with new state laws instructing cities to reduce  waste was the primary motivation for recommending the program for adoption by  the council. The city would receive about $25 per ton of recycled high-quality  paper. JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

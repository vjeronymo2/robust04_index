			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Group to investigate Italian bond problem A GROUP of banks, brokers and clearing houses are to form an action group to resolve the difficulties faced by international investors trying to reclaim withholding tax paid on Italian government bonds from the Italian authorities. The group, headed by Euroclear and Cedel, and involving a number of international banks and brokers, will meet in London in August to discuss a fresh approach to the Italian Ministry of Finance. A year ago, the Italian authorities issued rules on withholding tax refunds, known as Circular 12. Although the rules were widely billed as allowing foreign investors qualifying under double taxation treaties to reclaim withholding tax paid on Italian bonds, the procedure excluded market participants which have their tax residence in a different country from their clearing system or global custodian. Such participants, who account for a large portion of the market, have been unable to submit refund claims, in spite of treaty entitlements according to Euroclear and Cedel. The prospect of withholding tax refunds helped lift international interest in Italian government bonds last year. Currently, beset by economic problems and concerns about the future of European union, the Italian government bond market is at a low ebb. Traders said such technical difficulties did not encourage international participation in the market. According to the International Swap Dealers Association's survey reported yesterday, losses in the swaps market account for 0.0115 per cent of the notional principal amount of swaps outstanding, not 0.115 per cent, as stated.</p>

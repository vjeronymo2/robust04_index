			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AWARDED TO GORBACHEV  </P> <P> In response to "Gorbachev Clearly Deserved It" (editorial, Oct. 16):  </P> <P> Giving Gorbachev a Nobel Prize for his contribution to world peace is rather  like rewarding a eunuch for exercising sexual restraint.  </P> <P> One wonders what Gorbachev's contribution to the cause of peace would have been  had he not been busy dealing with military defeat in Afghanistan, economic ruin  at home, nationalism and ethnic unrest in the Soviet republics and the serious  political challenges of Boris Yeltsin.  </P> <P> The mere absence of the usual amount of mischief in a Soviet leader ought not  to be mistaken for the good works of a peacemaker.  </P> <P> ROBERT B. MOONEY, Covina  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Auckland, April 22 (XINHUA) -- There are broad  prospects for the cooperation between China and New Zealand [NZ]  in the economic and technological fields and trade.    This was stated by Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the Standing  Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress when  addressing the New Zealand-China Trade Association here this  afternoon.    He listed the major achievements made by the two countries  in  their economic cooperation in recent years and expressed the  hope that more NZ business people and government officials will  visit China to deepen mutual understanding.    After briefing the New Zealand businessmen on the reforms in  China, Tian pledged that "China will open wider to the world."    He said that "to maintain and expand the influx of foreign  investment, we should further improve the environment for such  investment and the laws and regulations applying to it."    "We should protect the legitimate rights and interests of  enterprises with exclusively foreign investment and use the  government's industrial policies to channel such investment into  basic industries and infrastructure," he concluded.</p>

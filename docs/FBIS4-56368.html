			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Angel Iraheta on news conference by President </F> Alfredo Cristiani with domestic reporters on 1 May; place not  given -- recorded]    [Text] Following the inauguration ceremony for new Mayor of  San Salvador Mario Valiente, of the Nationalist Republican  Alliance, President Cristiani held a news conference to state  how positive he finds the constitutional reforms approved on 29  April by the outgoing Legislative Assembly. This is what  President Cristiani had to say:    [Begin recording] [Cristiani] I have not had a chance to  examine each of the reforms as they were approved on 29 April.  I understand, however, they acted on basically the same issues  they had been discussing. I believe they address the audits  carried out by the Court of Accounts [Corte de Cuentas], certain  privileges, state monopolies, and, of course, several issues  concerning the judicial branch. Generally speaking, and again  without knowing what exactly was changed, I believe the changes  are positive.    Concerning the workers' request, it concerns only state  workers, whom the Constitution withholds the right to declare  strikes. This situation is not unique to El Salvador alone. I  believe many countries withhold this prerogative, which is  common to employees of the private sector, due to the nature of  the tasks assigned to public employees, whose job is to serve  the nation. Should public employees declare a strike, it would  deprive people of the service to which they are entitled. We  already saw what happened when public employees went on strike:  The Rosales Hospital was shut down and caused much distress  among the people.    In another turn of events, treasury funds are not for the  benefit of one individual in particular; they belong to the  people, and they must return to the people. Many of the things  common to the private sector [four-second break in reception]  such a decision attempts against the resources of a specific  enterprise. It is not Salvadorans' money. There must be a  balance. In short, I believe this constitutional article must  be left untouched for now.    Concerning the Fuertes Caminos exercise, arrangements are  under way. U.S. engineers, along with our engineers, will  continue to do the same type of works they did during the first  phase. This second phase is larger, however, because more works  will be done. We hope many of the communities that were chosen  to have health centers, schools, and other infrastructure works,  such as wells, built there will benefit from these works.    [Reporter Mario Jovel] Good morning, Mr. President. The U.S.  observers who came here during the elections on 29 April asked  the U.S. Congress to unfreeze economic aid to ensure that peace  agreements will be complied with. My question is how much aid  does the country need to comply with the remaining peace  agreements?    [Cristiani] In general terms, AID has supported such  programs  to rejoin public life, such as the land distribution plan and  other plans to train mini- and small-scale businessmen. The  land distribution program lacks financing, however, that is, it  lacks the necessary resources in order to be carried out.    On the other hand, perhaps most of the aid to the PNC,  especially the National Public Security Academy, is not in cash  but, rather, in the form of advisers, trainers, vehicles yet to  be delivered, and others. We need to continue this program, but  I cannot estimate the exact amount we need, but the land  distribution program requires large sums of money. The lack of  funds for this program pertains to the 100 million colones. It  is obvious that if the resources needed do not come from abroad,  we will have to find a way to provide them domestically.    [Reporter Ruben Dominguez] Mr. President, today we mark May  Day. Could you please send a message to all Salvadoran workers?    [Cristiani] The Salvadoran people are known as hardworking  people, and we observe International Labor Day today. We send  our most cordial salute to all Salvadoran workers who are  enjoying, along with their families, some type of recreation,  perhaps in the countryside, because today is Sunday. We hope  this is the right time to regain strength to continue to work  for El Salvador. [end recording]</p>

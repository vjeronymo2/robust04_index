The  latest crisis over enlargement of the EU this week is a case in  point.    The admission of Austria, England, Norway and Sweden  contributes a key building block in the future European Union.  According to sublime theory the Union could, by the end of the  decade, stretch from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from  the Atlantic to the borders of Russia.    But, thanks to a ridiculous Norwegian/Spanish dispute over  approximately 7,000 tons of cod and arcane objections by the  British to proposed changes in voting powers in the Council of  Ministers, the entire enlargement project could yet collapse.  The British government, which has consistently championed the  expansion of the Union, now risks being seen as the main  architect of its downfall.    In striking contrast to recent speeches emphasising "Britain  at the heart of Europe," the British government has decided to  turn the debate about the precise level at which countries  should be able to block majority decisions into a great issue of  principle. In so doing, ministers have provided Euro-sceptic  MPs with a new cause to boost their flagging crusade against EU  and revive internecine warfare in the Tory party.    John Major could find he has just handed a loaded revolver  to  his Euro-sceptic enemies which will be used against him in the  run-up to the crucial European Parliament elections. Against  the strong advice of Foreign Office professionals who concluded  weeks ago that the UK could not get its way over the votes  issue, cabinet ministers insisted on pursuing their cackhanded  tactics.    Douglas Hurd and his colleagues may now have to choose  between a humiliating climbdown or standing firm. This might  not only endanger enlargement but would certainly alienate both  EU partners and potential allies among the candidate countries.    The row with Norway over Spanish fishing rights may be  sorted  out soon. But if the 32 cannot agree -- primarily with the  British -- on just how the new voting rules will work in the  Council of Ministers when the Union grows to 16 members,  enlargement may be postponed to 1996 or even abandoned.    Restive members of the European Parliament have already  warned they will not ratify the accession treaties if thc voting  issue is not resolved or if a solution is found which makes  majority voting more difficult. If the British get their way  this is precisely what will happen. The wider implications of  the collapse of EU enlargement could be enormous. The  governments of the four applicant countries already have a major  fight on their hands convincing their voters to support EU  membership in referendums to be held later this year. If their  membership bids have to be shelved, public opinion in the Nordic  countries could turn very hostile to any future European  entanglement.    If the EU cannot agree terms for admitting countries as  similar as Austria amd the three Nordic states, what chance of  their absorbing the Hungarians, the Poles and others in East  Europe who already seek EU membership? If they too are  rejected, some in Central Europe will turn their back on the  West and make peace with the growing forces of Slav nationalism  in Russia as is already being canvassed in Slovakia and Bulgaria.    The repercussions in Germany could also be alarming.  Chancellor Kohl -- and the Social Democrat opposition -- have  defended the goal of a more federal EU against their critics  precisely so that it is best placed to respond to the needs of  Central and East Europe. If enlargement is pushed off the  agenda, those already urging Germany to turn its back on  European integration and to take a stronger "national" line  towards the East will become more strident.    So why should the British (and to a lesser extent the  Spanish) put all this at risk? UK ministers can fairly point to  a bias in the present voting system in the Council of Ministers  which over-represents smaller countries. The sensible reform  would be to allocate votes in the Council more strictly in  proportion to population. Reformers have also advocated that  majority decisions in the Council should not only require a  majority of votes but enough countries which, between them  represent an overall majority of the EU population.    Logical as it may sound, this approach conflicts with  ideological British Conservative hostility to a more democratic  federal EU. Instead, the UK has focused obsessively, not on  making majority decisions more representative but on  strengthening its own power to block decisions on workers'  rights, social standards and the environment.    The threatened disaster over enlargement will make the  reformers more determined that the 1996 review of the Maastricht  Treaty should entrench a democratic majority vote system. This  can be underpinned with a formal EU constitution which would  prevent one country vetoing the right of others to move to a  deeper political Union.    Major could hardly object since he negotiated the British  "opt-out" from the European social chapter and the single  currency at Maastricht. It is a precedent which the British may  regret since others in the EU are now determined to build on it.</p>

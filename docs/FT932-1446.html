			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (4): North-west aims for compact Games - The venue strategy puts most sports within an hour of the city, with easy access to the others / Venues and facilities FROM THE air, Eastlands, the site of the proposed showpiece athletics stadium and Olympic village, near the city centre, looks like a cricket field, a huge patch of green with a gasometer in the corner. At ground level, the site is a scene of urban dereliction, 110 acres scarred by old mineworkings and half-abandoned railways, poisoned by industrial gases and heavy metals. To the north is Phillips Park, which is showing its age as Britain's oldest municipal park; to the south is the semi-derelict Rochdale Canal. It is a measure of the scale of the dereliction that the plan to build an Olympic village to house 15,000 athletes, officials and support staff will not displace a single local resident: there are no local residents. The model of the stadium, designed by a team including Sir Norman Foster and Partners, Ove Arup and Arup Associates, and on display at the Royal Academy in London, shows an arena seating 82,000 spectators. The team is part of design-build-operate-maintain consortium, headed by Amec, that also includes HOK INternational, a Chicago stadium management specialist. The design uses a structure based on discrete wedges, so that requirements such as the segregation of athletes and officials can be met. Athletes will be able to move through all stages up to and including their events in a logical manner, with everything from warm-up track to dope testing unit included in the proper sequence. Split horizontally as well as vertically for maximum flexibility, it is designed to be cleared in eight minutes. The wedge structure will allow much of it to be pre-built offsite. The stadium is part of what Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, which will build the stadium, describes as a total solution for the Eastlands site. 'This proposal is a catalyst for change. The absolute certainty is that a lot is going to be done, win lose or draw.' Mr Peter Knowles, sports liaison director, says bid officials insisted that the worst case in assessing a venue should be that the environmental impact would be neutral. Emphasis has been placed on building facilities which will be used after the Games are over. Amec insists that it can become a national stadium after the Games. The stadium will be served by a mainline railway station and by a new line of the city's Metrolink light rail system, which will also have a station beside the new 5,000-seat velodrome, already under construction on the Eastlands site. A renovated canal running through the Olympic village will provide transport for some athletes, and 10 venues are in comfortable walking distance of the village. The road layout around the stadium is planned as a spiral, rather than radii running straight up to the stadium wall, a system which the Amec team believes will avoid bottlenecks. The company says much has been learned from the Americans on design. It will, for example, be built in such a way that people will want to visit it as part of a whole day out. In the US, spectators arrive on average two hours before the start of sporting fixtures. A total of Pounds 30m has been or is being spent to assemble and clean the site, and another Pounds 115m is needed, according to Bob Scott, to build the stadium. Mr Bill Enevoldson, finance director, is more cautious about the Pounds 115m figure, insisting that a lot of negotiation remains to be done but bid officials say the stadium may still be built even if Manchester's bid failed. The stadium hopes to attract large-scale sports events after the Games are over, and it has even been suggested that one day one or both of the Manchester football clubs might want to play there. It also hopes to attract exhibitions and rock concerts. Sir Alan Cockshaw, Amec chairman, insists: 'We are going to have life around this complex the whole time. The stadium won't be in use at all times, but people will be attracted to it all year round.' The area will have restaurants, hotels and shops, The Olympic village, which during the Games will hold 15,000 athletes, officials and support staff, will also come in for further use later. Manchester University, Umist, the Manchester Business School and the Metropolitan University of Manchester together comprise what is claimed to be the biggest university campus in Europe, and will need 40,000 student beds by the turn of the century. The Olympic village would be used for student accommodation, and could as a result be built well before the Games. Apart from the stadium, other facilities planned for the Games are: Cycling. The Pounds 6m 5,000-seat velodrome - which will be owned and operated by the sports council as a national facility - is the first in the UK in modern times. Gymnastics. A 6,000-seat arena is planned for the Eastlands site, next to the athletics stadium. it Already under construction in the city centre is the Victoria Arena, using part of the railway station, which will hold up to 16,400 people, in what will be Britain's biggest indoor arena. both arena will be used for Olympic gymnastic events Badminton. Badminton will also be held in the Eastlands arena Basketball. Accommodation for 19,330 will be provided in the Victoria Arena, and in the GMex conference and exhibition centre, which will be extended for the games to give it a total capacity of 15,000 for basketball. Also at GMex, up to 11,000 people would be able to watch handball, a sport which would also be played in a 6,000-capacity hall at Salford University. Wrestling. The GMex centre will a capacity of 6,000 for wrestling. Fencing. Will be held in the Air and Space Museum, accommodating 3,000. Baseball. Old Trafford Cricket ground in Manchester will be modified to provide a 20,000-seater baseball stadium, a sport which will also be played at the city's Wythenshawe Park, which has a capacity of 10,000. Football. Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, would be the main football venue, with other matches being played in Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Nottingham, Sunderland and Newcastle. Hockey. Oldham Athletic's 20,000-capacity football stadium would stage the hockey tournament. Judo. An 8,000-seater judo hall will be created next to Old Trafford, the only purely temporary facility for the Games. Swimming. Swimming events would be held in a new facility at the Olympic country park, west of the city, which would accommodate 21,500 spectators and have six pools for swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo as well as training and warm-up. Rowing. Alongside the swimming centre is Pennington Flash, a lake which would be modified for rowing and which can accommodate 30,000 spectators. Canoeing. North of the Olympic Country Park is Rivington, where the canoeing events would be held, in front of up to 25,000 spectators. Equestrian events. The equestrian events are intended for Haydock Park, an established racecourse where 30,000 could watch, and at Tatton Park, in Cheshire, where the organisers estimate up to 100,000 could see the events. Shooting. Also in Cheshire, shooting would be at the 2,500-capacity Carden Park. Tennis. The Matchpoint centre holding up to 16,000 spectators, in the southern suburbs of Manchester would be extended for the tennis competitions Table tennis. Table tennis would be in a new hall at Manchester University, holding 8,000. Weightlifting. Stretford Leisure centre in Manchester would be extended to allow 5,000 to watch the weightlifting. Archery. Archery would be held in the city at Hough End, a parkland venue accommodating 4,000. Boxing. Liverpool's boxing tradition is recognised by the proposal to hold contests there in a new, 10,000-seat boxing hall at King's Dock. Volleyball. The King's Dock arena would also stage the volleyball matches, which would also include a new 6,000-seat exhibition hall. Yachting. At Pwllheli, in north Wales, a new yachting village will be developed beside the marina. Spectator capacity is estimated at 30,000. Mr Knowles says that 16 of the Olympic venues exist or are under construction, and two have development contracts awarded - only five depend on the awarding of the games. A crucial element of the venue strategy, however, is to have most sports well within an hour of the centre of Manchester, which the north-west's compactness and infrastructure allows. Bid officials refuse to discuss the projected public sector/private sector split of the investment in the various projects, but Mr Trevor Adamson, regional executive director of NatWest, said the plans for the Manchester Olympics appeared to be sensible, and he did not envisage that there would be any difficulty in raising the finance. The plans would be looked at on a project-by-project basis and the British banks had a good record in project finance and risk management.</p>

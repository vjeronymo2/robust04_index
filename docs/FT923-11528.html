			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Letter: Pay scheme will stay Sir, Your article on performance-related pay schemes (Management, July 20) points out their robustness and widespread use in the public and private sectors. At Kent County Council we understand this durability. Pay of all 11,500 managerial and white-collar staff is linked to individual performance appraisal. In common with your article's definition of 'best schemes', we introduced PRP in conjunction with other human resource management techniques and in the context of a performance management system. It was coupled with a properly thought-out system for training, rewarding and encouraging staff. The key question is whether PRP enables performance management to become part of normal management practice, linking performance measurement and staff development in a sharply focused way. Our experience is that PRP focuses attention on action plans and targets; it brings home to line managers their accountability for people; and it sends a clear message on the importance of performance standards in providing good quality services. Unlike Coventry City Council we shall not be joining the 'tiny minority' which have abandoned PRP. A H Hart, Leader of Kent County Council, County Hall, Maidstone, Kent ME14 1XQ</p>

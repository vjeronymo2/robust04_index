			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Keen buying of Boots High street retailing group Boots jumped 11 to 469 1/2 p, making it one of the day's best performing FT-SE 100 stocks. Volume reached a healthy 4.6m shares. Part of the day's rise was attributed to buying from a number of institutions that sold stock to the company last month as part of Boots' Pounds 500m share buy-back scheme. Some gross funds feared that active dealing in the shares would compromise prospects for receiving the related Advanced Corporation Tax rebate from the Inland Revenue. One market specialist said: 'Those payments have been received by some institutions and they now feel able to move into the market and buy Boots shares.' A feeling that recent worries about Christmas trading had been overdone also played a part in boosting sentiment.</p>

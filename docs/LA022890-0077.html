			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOONER OR LATER, THE MIGHTY FALL IN OKLAHOMA  </P> <P> The message from Oklahoma has come through loud and clear: The Big Eight has  three of the best basketball teams in the country.  </P> <P> Oklahoma defeated No. 1 Kansas, 100-78, Tuesday, two days after a convincing  victory over then-No. 1 Missouri on Sunday. It was the 45th consecutive victory  for the Sooners, 22-4 overall and 10-3 Big Eight, at the Lloyd Noble Center.  </P> <P> The victory also provided evidence for a national television audience that  while Kansas and Missouri have drawn much of the attention this season,  Oklahoma might have been equally deserving.  </P> <P> "I've said that all along," Kansas coach Roy Williams said. "(Oklahoma) lost  some tough games earlier, but they were on the road. It's a different story  when you're playing at home."  </P> <P> The Jayhawks (27-3, 10-3) found out in a painful manner. Oklahoma harassed the  usually composed Jayhawks into 26 turnovers resulting in 37 points. The Sooners  used a mix of full-court pressure and half-court zone traps that virtually  paralyzed Kansas in the first half.  </P> <P> "We were totally clueless against their press," Jayhawk Jeff Gueldner said.  </P> <P> Leading, 22-15, in the first half, the Sooners used their defensive pressure to  trigger a 13-0 run.  </P> <P> Skeeter Henry, who led the Sooners with 23 points, scored eight points during  the spurt, including two dunks. Rick Calloway finally silenced the crowd with a  10-foot jumper for Kansas, but the Sooners responded with a 6-0 run and led,  41-17, with 5:13 to play in the half.  </P> <P> In all, it was a stretch Williams seemed eager to forget.  </P> <P> "We stunk handling the ball, we stunk passing the ball, we stunk catching the  ball," Williams said. "We have to take better care of the basketball.  </P> <P> "It looked at times like a track meet to see how many times they could dunk the  basketball. They just made us look silly at times."  </P> <P> When the Jayhawks weren't turning the ball over, they were frustrated by poor  shooting. Kansas made only 29 of 64 shots overall.  </P> <P> The Sooners, meanwhile, successfully worked the ball inside to William Davis,  who had 22 points, and shot from the perimeter, making 10 of 18 three-point  shots.  </P> <P> "We tried every defense we had," Williams said. "Needless to say, none of them  worked."  </P> <P> Davis, a 6-foot-6 senior, did not play in the first meeting between the teams  for undisclosed reasons. But he responded this time by making eight of 13 shots  and grabbing six rebounds.  </P> <P> "You bet we're a better team with Davis," Oklahoma Coach Billy Tubbs said.  </P> <P> The Sooners also got a boost off the bench from freshman Terry Evans, who  scored 22 points and had five assists and five steals.  </P> <P> "He's beginning to get the confidence back he had earlier in the year," Tubbs  said of Evans. "He did a great job of penetrating and dishing it off."  </P> <P> Kevin Pritchard led Kansas with 16 points.  </P></p>

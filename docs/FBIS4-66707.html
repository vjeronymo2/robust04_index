			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Diplomatic Victory for India"; all quotation </F> marks as published]    [Text] The diplomatic misadventure of Pakistan in Geneva is  paralleled only by its military misadventure in 1965. The issue  at stake on both occasions was Kashmir. The diplomatic sparring  that has been going on for the last few months between the two  countries, beginning in Davos at the World Economic Forum and  the Geneva events of the past one month will, in the long run,  prove to be momentous for both countries. The jubilation in  Indian diplomatic circles at the last minute withdrawal by  Pakistan of a resolution on human rights violations in Kashmir  is understandable. At no-time in the recent past has India  managed to put it across to its opponent as far as diplomatic  coups were concerned. In the last one month, it was heartening  to see that India shed its low key diplomatic postures and  launch a propaganda offensive against Pakistan as an exporter of  terrorism. Having tasted success, the Indian think tank's  proclivity to relax after wresting the initiative is unlikely to  be seen this time around. Five years of low-cost, low-intensity  conflict from across the border and the tension, uncertainty and  the cult of violence that has come to grip the people of Kashmir  is unlikely to be forgotten easily. Nor is it going to be easy  for the Indian foreign policy-makers to forget the nerve  wracking tension imposed on them till the very last minute  before Islamabad bowed to the majority viewpoint of the members  of the United Nations Human Rights Commission [UNHRC].    The diplomatic disaster will not go down easily with the  powers that be in Pakistan. Ms. Benazir Bhutto, who so fully  identified herself with the resolution will now have to face the  wrath of Muslim League leader, Mr. Nawaz Sharif. Embittered  Pakistanis will only see defeat in the move to table the  resolution and later its withdrawal as counter-productive. They  will fail to see that Pakistan has successfully managed to  project the Kashmir issue to an international audience. But, for  the time being, there is certain to be massive opposition  criticism and a backlash effect on Ms. Benazir Bhutto's  government for the loss of face at an international forum, that  too, in what is seen as a victory to India. Mr. Nawaz Sharif can  be expected to take full advantage of the situation and harp on  the fact that the Prime Minister has let down both Kashmiris and  Pakistan and had bungled the whole issue.    The final result was made possible by the realistic stand  taken by the member nations, particularly, China and Iran.  Though the latter two countries have much to hide from UNHRC,  that warrant their support to India, much the same can be said  about most other nations of the world, including North America.  The tactical withdrawal took place after it was agreed that a  mission of ambassadors would visit Kashmir to assess the human  rights situation there. It is now up to India to hammer home the  advantage and press for meaningful bilateral dialogues. The  foreign secretaries level meeting between the two countries held  in January were a disaster. Dialogue needs to be renewed afresh  with respect to `no-first-use' of nuclear weapons, `line of  peace and tranquillity' along the Line of Control,  demilitarisation of the Siachen Glacier, demarcation of the  maritime boundary in the Sir Creek area, resolving the  controversy over the Tulbul navigation project, and reviving the  Joint Working Commission. The parleys between the two countries  have been stifled by unreasonable postures by both countries, at  different points of time, and no bilateral progress looks likely  unless Pakistan drops the plebiscite, and now, the human rights  violations proposals. Given the latest misadventure and the  adverse fall out at home, one can only expect a hardened stand  from the Pakistani side. It is thus left to India to put forth  fresh proposals and wrest the initiative. Along with such  confidence building exercises, the Government of India must  ensure that the borders are tightly sealed and that drug  trafficking and export of arms into the country are completely  stopped. As far as the extremists and the militants are  concerned, the failure of the resolution at UNHRC sends an  unmistakable message that internationalisation of the Kashmiri  issue does not work.</p>

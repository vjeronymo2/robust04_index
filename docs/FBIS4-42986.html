			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [David Marsh report: "Voters Divided on EU's Important </F> Issues"]    [Text] Europeans generally favour enlarging the EU  [European Union] northwards and eastwards, but are deeply split  over the desirability of deepening integration as laid down by  the Maastricht treaty, according to an opinion poll commissioned  by the FINANCIAL TIMES.    The poll, carried out for the FT and seven European  newspapers, reveals great diversity among the 12 EU member  states on attitudes towards the European parliament and the  future of European cooperation.    The detailed findings are as follows:    Only 31 per cent of British people surveyed said they wanted  a more integrated Europe, compared with 61 per cent favouring a  looser form of European cooperation. Similar votes were seen in  eastern Germany, Denmark and western Germany, where scores were  33 per cent to 62 cent, 26 per cent to 61 per cent and 37 per  cent to 58 per cent against Maastricht-style integration  respectively. By contrast, between 64 and 72 per cent of  respondents in Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Belgium favoured  more integration.    Residents of Ireland and the UK appear to believe most  strongly that a single currency in at least three EU states will  be established by the end of the century, with 63 per cent and  64 per cent respectively saying they believed this was either  "very likely" or "fairly likely." Greatest scepticism in this  field came from the "hard currency" countries, with 61 per cent  of east and west Germans and 52 per cent of Dutch respondents  holding the view that this was unlikely.    Asked about responses to the conflict in former Yugoslavia,  38 per cent of respondents throughout the EU, spread fairly  evenly among the 12, argued in favour of continued diplomatic  efforts to end the fighting. Only 16 per cent and 17 per cent  respectively called for combat troops or air strikes to bring  peace.    Regarding the European elections, 72 per cent of all  respondents said they were "absolutely certain" to vote, while 7  per cent described their turnout as "very likely," 8 per cent as  "fairly likely" and 6 per cent as "not very likely."    Only 49 per cent of British said they were "absolutely  certain" to vote, compared with 93 per cent in Greece, 89 per  cent in Belgium and 83 per cent in Luxembourg (in all three  countries, voting is compulsory). By contrast, 76 per cent of  respondents in western Germany and 67 per cent of those in  eastern Germany said they were certain to vote.    Of those "absolutely certain" to vote, 56 per cent of the  Irish, 55 per cent of Portuguese and 53 per cent of east Germans  said they would do so to support their countries' governments.  Only 35 per cent of Britons and Danes and 15 per cent of  Belgians gave this as a reason.    A protest vote seems particularly likely in the UK and  Spain,  where 25 per cent and 23 per cent of respondents respectively  said they would vote to voice opposition to their governments.    Denmark recorded the highest score -- 35 per cent -- of  respondents saying they were not certain to vote because they  "do not understand the (European) issues." Others who admitted  failure to understand European affairs were the British (32 per  cent) and Italians (29 per cent).    On enlargement, the proposed extension of the EU on January  1  1995 to Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria is given particular  support by west Germans (87 per cent), east Germans (88 per  cent), and Italians (86 per cent). Even those most lukewarm on  enlargement to the EFTA [European Free Trade Association]  countries -- the Spanish and Portuguese -- are 70 per cent and  72 per cent in favour.    There is more divergence over enlarging the EU to former  Communist countries. The largest scores in favour of bringing  in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia came from  Italy (69 per cent) eastern Germany (60 per cent) Belgium, The  Netherlands and Spain (56 per cent each). The lowest scores  were seen in western Germany and Portugal (47 per cent),  Luxembourg and Britain (45 per cent) and Denmark (33 per cent).    British and Danish respondents stood out as thinking the  European Parliament has too much power, with 38 per cent and 37  per cent of respondents respectively holding this view. By  contrast, 60 per cent of east Germans, 55 per cent of west  Germans and Italians, and 54 per cent of Greek and French  respondents said parliament has too little power -- a view held  by 46 per cent of respondents throughout the EU.    Britons and Danes also believe the European Commission is  too  powerful, with 58 per cent and 51 per cent of respondents taking  this line.    The main defenders of the European Commission seem to be the  east Germans, Spanish, Italians and Belgians -- between 40 per  cent and 43 per cent of these respondents say the Commission has  too little power.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F> reporter]    [Text] Britain is ready to use airpower to end the  bombardment of Sarajevo, Foreign Office Minister Alastair  Goodlad signalled in the Commons today.    Answering an emergency question, Mr Goodlad said the  Government awaited the assessment of military commanders on the  spot.    But he said ministers were "fully prepared to see air power  used if it will improve the situation."    Mr Goodlad spoke out after the weekend massacre of 68 people  in Sarajevo market place.    Echoing the Prime Minister's call this morning for  immediate,  effective and "more muscular" action to halt the bombardment of  civilians in Sarajevo, he said: "We're looking for effective  action, if necessary muscular action, to protect the civilian  population of Sarajevo."    Shadow foreign secretary Dr Jack Cunningham said if the  Serbs  and Croats did not immediately accept and implement decisions of  the international community then NATO's "vastly superior air  power" should be used.    The Commons exchanges, on an emergency question from Dr  Cunningham, came as European Union foreign ministers met to  consider the implications of military intervention in the bloody  conflict.    Mr Goodlad expressed "horror and outrage" over the weekend  massacre, adding: "The Government condemns this brutal and  senseless act."    He underlined the need for a negotiated peace but added that  action over the plight of those living in Sarajevo could not  await an overall settlement.    "It is essential that the UN and NATO should consider  immediately practical means for halting the bombardment of  civilians there."    Supporting the use of airpower, he said: "The Government  remains determined that everything possible is done to ensure  that this appalling conflict is brought to an end as soon as  possible."    Dr Cunningham joined in condemning the market place  atrocity.    "But doesn't recent history in the former Yugoslavia show  that Western policy is in disarray over these problems," he said.    "The record is one of failure to prevent atrocities  resulting  in wanton slaughter."    Dr Cunningham said UN Security Council resolutions and NATO  decisions had consistently not been implemented.    They were seen as "empty threats" by the Serbs and Croats  "and so their aggression and carnage continues."    He said: "Indecision over Britain's proposed troop  withdrawal  has further encouraged Serbs and Croatians to believe their  aggression would not only be ignored but rewarded with  territorial gain.    "And, tragically for all of us, the EU bears the principle  responsibility for this catastrophe."    He asked if the Government would immediately press for the  reopening of Tuzla airport and the lifting of the seige at  Sarajevo.    "Do you agree that if the Serbs and Croatians do not  immediately accept and allow the implementation of these  decision of the international community, then they should be  enforced by use of the vastly superior airpower of NATO?"    Mr Goodlad said UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command with  NATO support must apply the pressure necessary to halt the  attacks.    "If the military commanders advise this requires technical  air support, we shall back their judgment."    It was essential that Tuzla airport should be reopened and  NATO airpower was available if needed.    He said military commanders at NATO, the UN and in the UK  had  consistently advised that a "generalised policy of air strikes  would not end the war" and could hamper humanitarian relief.    "But in specific situations, the technical use of airpower  can help to achieve defined objectives.    "NATO will consider on Wednesday how that airpower might be  used.    "We await the assessment of military commanders but are  fully  prepared to see airpower used if it will improve the situation."</p>

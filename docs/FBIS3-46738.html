			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] agreed Wednesday [5 January] to  temporarily end its boycott of parliamentary debate on a  government-proposed package of political reform bills, LDP  officials said. The LDP boycott earlier forced the ruling  coalition to deliberate on the package in the absence of the  largest opposition force in a Diet session that reconvened the  same day.    As a result of the LDP concession, legislators from the LDP,  the Japanese Communist Party [JCP] and the Niin Club  parliamentary group will question Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and other ministers in Thursday's session, the  officials said. However, the LDP and ruling coalition partners  failed to hammer out an accord on the parliamentary agenda for  Friday and thereafter, they said.    Meanwhile, the coalition decided to hold mandatory  parliamentary hearings of a selected group of political  scientists and citizens on the package on January 12, coalition  officials said. Such hearings are mandatory procedures that  have to be followed before a vote on the package.    A standoff between the coalition and opposition, which has  been demanding major modifications to the package, will be  inevitable if the coalition proceeds with the hearings, LDP and  coalition officials agreed.    The ruling coalition earlier agreed to modify a proposed  legal requirement that the Diet refuse to allocate House of  Representatives seats to miniparties that failed to collect 3  percent of valid votes cast at the most recent national  election, coalition officials said.    The agreement came at a meeting of the executives of seven  coalition partners at the coalition's political reform  headquarters, the officials said.    Both LDP and JCP have been demanding that the controversial  provision be removed from the package of four political and  electoral reform bills.    The electoral bill calls for replacing the current 511-seat  lower chamber with a mixture of 274 single-seat constituencies  and proportional representation system, under which an  additional 226 seats would be distributed on a nationwide basis.    The so-called "3-percent requirement" would oblige the Diet  to deny miniparties that failed to win 3 percent of eligible  votes any seats that would be appropriated to bigger parties  that met the requirement in proportion to the number of votes  they had mustered in single-seat constituencies.    The provision also means that unless a party has the record  of winning 3 percent of votes in the most recent national  election, it is not qualified to receive an official subsidy to  finance its political activities from a newly created fund of  30.9 billion yen.    The LDP and JCP have argued that such a provision would  undermine the Diet's ability to translate into national policies  the desires of voters who placed their trust in miniparties that  failed to garner 3 percent of eligible votes.    Yamahana told the House of Councillors' special committee on  political reform, "The most crucial thing is to legislate the  package. We will do our utmost by responding sufficiently to  arguments between the ruling coalition and opposition camp."    The committee kicked off the new year's first deliberations  Wednesday after an eight-day recess, but the No. 1 opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) boycotted the session.    In a meeting of committee managers earlier in the day, the  LDP demanded that the resumption of debates be postponed until  Thursday, parliamentary sources said.    Prime minister told the committee session that reconvened in  the morning the LDP's boycott is "very regrettable."    "It is our heavy responsibility to settle the political  reform matter in order to revive public trust in politics," he  said.    The ruling coalition decided Tuesday to complete debate on  political reform at the upper house committee "by January 14"  even if the LDP continued to boycott the committee sessions,  coalition officials said.    The package cleared the House of Representatives on November  18, but deliberations had stalled since then due to a  parliamentary row over the opening of Japan's rice market and a  payoff scandal involving Hosokawa.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KAISER STEEL'S COMEBACK BID;  </P> <P> MANUFACTURING: THE ONCE-AILING COMPANY, NOW CONCENTRATING ON ENVIRONMENTAL  OPERATIONS, RE-ENTERS THE PUBLIC STOCK MARKET. THE MOVE RENEWS HOPE FOR  THOUSANDS OF THE FIRM'S SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RETIREES.  </P> <P> The old Kaiser Steel Co. could be called a classic victim of the business  excesses of the 1980s. Savvy investors walked into a vulnerable company and  waltzed away with more money than they had brought; the company's assets were  leveraged, exchanged and liquidated, and a debt-crippled company limped into  bankruptcy court, its pockets bulging with lawyers' bills.  </P> <P> Now, nearly two years after emerging from bankruptcy protection, a reorganized  Kaiser Steel Resources is trying to build a future from the underpinnings of  the old company -- its land, mines and water rights. Meanwhile, its KSC  Recovery subsidiary pursues the old battles in a series of lawsuits against  former officers, directors and shareholders whom it accuses of looting Kaiser  Steel.  </P> <P> Caught up in this turmoil have been thousands of former Kaiser employees  throughout Southern California, who watched first their steel-making jobs, then  their pensions and guaranteed lifetime medical insurance disappear. What they  got in exchange was a half interest in a bankrupt company already torn by a  protracted shareholder battle for control.  </P> <P> Finally, last week, that half interest seemed to have some palpable worth when  Kaiser Steel Resources, now concentrating on environmental businesses,  re-entered the public stock market. Even in its very modest trading, the  retirees saw prospects for funding their restored, but sharply reduced, medical  benefits plan for as long as there still are Kaiser Steel retirees who need it.  </P> <P> Until now, the retirees have been depending on the lawsuits to keep the benefit  plan going, but it has been "operating hand to mouth," said Nicholas Rickard,  who retired from Kaiser Steel in 1983 and now serves on the board of the  Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Assn., which administers the benefits.  </P> <P> The lawsuits have netted about $28 million in settlements -- a mere lick of  water in a desert of debt. Less than one-third of the settlement proceeds so  far have gone to the employee association, which got an initial $7 million in  funding when the bankruptcy court ordered yet more Kaiser assets to be sold  off. An even smaller amount has gone to repay the federal government, which  took over the Kaiser Steel pension fund. Attorney and administrative fees ate  up most of the rest.  </P> <P> "It's a sad, sad tale," said Daniel M. Larson, president of KSC Recovery.  </P> <P> Still pending are suits that will lead the recovery unit through a thicket of  curious business decisions to the doorsteps of a curiouser group of players,  including investors Irwin Jacobs and Joseph A. Frates, Drexel Burnham Lambert,  First Boston Corp. -- and even the Resolution Trust Corp., as inheritors of a  failed Oklahoma savings and loan.  </P> <P> Some former directors and officers feel stung by accusations that they abetted  what current management calls the looting of Kaiser Steel.  </P> <P> Among them is Stephen A. Girard, who as chairman of Kaiser Steel began the  shutdown of its mill operations in 1981, oversaw its transfer to new owners in  1984 and remained on the board until early 1987. His attorney, Daniel Schwab,  said the oil price collapse in the mid-1980s -- not looting -- caused troubles  for Kaiser, which had refocused itself on energy-related business. Schwab said  Girard and other directors of that period did not enrich themselves at Kaiser's  expense.  </P> <P> Yet some people clearly did profit. They include Jacobs' investment group,  which earned $14 million in "greenmail" in 1983 when it bought Kaiser Steel  stock, made a bid for the company, then agreed to back out -- for a premium --  when other suitors bid higher. Jacobs is among hundreds of individuals,  brokerages and professional advisers being sued -- and suing -- in a round of  charges and countercharges that Jacobs' attorney, Joseph Meyer, calls "dizzying  and bizarre."  </P> <P> KSC Recovery also sued the group that won the bidding war for Kaiser Steel --  the partnership of Denver coal man Monty Rial and Frates.  </P> <P> Rial's Perma Resources and Frates' Tulsa, Okla., investment group went 50-50 in  their 1984 leveraged buyout of Kaiser. A year later, Rial used the company's  assets to buy out Frates. Rial was ousted in 1986, when he lost a battle for  control of Kaiser to dissident shareholder Bruce Hendry.  </P> <P> Hendry took the company into bankruptcy in 1987 and oversaw the transition to  new management, including current Chairman Richard E. Stoddard, in 1988.  </P> <P> Girard's attorney Schwab said it was the Hendry team and not the former  directors and executives who abrogated Kaiser's responsibilities to its  retirees. He suggested that the bankruptcy filing was motivated not by the  company's condition but by a desire to eliminate those responsibilities.  </P> <P> Many of the retirees strongly disagree. "If it wasn't for Hendry, we wouldn't  have had anything," said Ronald Bitonti of Fontana, who represents fellow  Kaiser Steel retirees on the benefits association board and is an international  representative for the United Steelworkers of America. "The people who caused  the company to go bankrupt were Monty Rial and Frates and that gang. They raped  the company."  </P> <P> Though the company has settled with Rial, it is still suing Frates, contending  that he fraudulently made $40 million on his original $1-million investment.  Part of Frates' take was a valuable piece of Fontana real estate which he later  used as collateral to buy failing State Federal Savings &amp; Loan and its  development subsidiary in Tulsa. KSC Recovery hopes to at least get back $11  million from the sale of that property being held in escrow by the Resolution  Trust Corp., which now controls the savings and loan.  </P> <P> Also pending are actions against a number of shareholders, their brokers,  investment bankers and other professional advisers, including Drexel Burnham  and First Boston. KSC Recovery wants to recoup some of the gains investors  realized during the rapid succession of takeovers, as well as fees Kaiser Steel  paid to consultants for what KSC Recovery now believes was bad advice.  </P> <P> Despite the number of lawsuits, few expect the settlements or proceeds to  return Kaiser to the days when it was cash-healthy and asset-wealthy.  </P> <P> But nearly everyone involved in the drama believes that there's a gold mine in  the assets of Kaiser Steel Resources.  </P> <P> The "gold mine" is actually Eagle Mountain, the iron ore mine about 60 miles  due east of Palm Springs that, in 40 years of operation, yielded millions of  tons of ore for use in Kaiser's steel-making operations.  </P> <P> Kaiser, now based in Rancho Cucamonga, plans to turn the Eagle Mountain site  into a landfill. "We made some extremely large holes in the ground there. It  could take care of Los Angeles County and surrounding areas' landfill problems  for the next 100 years," said retiree Rickard.  </P> <P> Kaiser's own Eagle Mountain train, which used to ship the ore to the Fontana  plant, would be used to transport the refuse over Southern Pacific railroad  lines to the site.  </P> <P> The plan for Eagle Mountain, which still has some regulatory hurdles to  overcome, is one of four primary focus areas for Kaiser Steel Resources, all of  which rely on assets that once were devoted to steel-making operations.  </P> <P> The others:  </P> <P> * An industrial park at the former steel plant in Fontana. The company owns  nearly 1,000 acres of land there, in prime Inland Empire industrial country.  That figure includes a 288-acre parcel reclaimed by KSC Recovery as part of the  settlement of its suit against Rial, but not the nearby parcel that Frates got.  </P> <P> * Fontana Union Water Co., which provides water to the Fontana area.  </P> <P> * A waste treatment plant in Fontana.  </P> <P> Where the old Kaiser Steel was a struggling company in a declining industry,  the reorganized firm views itself as being in growth businesses. And most  observers agree.  </P> <P> "Kaiser is a gold mine for its present owners (because of) assets it had all  along," said attorney Schwab.  </P> <P> The problem for many retirees is waiting for those assets to start producing a  flow of cash. The benefits group estimates it will cost $4 million to $5  million annually to provide what amounts to half the former health benefits,  with insurance costs still taking double-digit leaps each year.  </P> <P> Some retirees who were young enough at the time of the bankruptcy found jobs  and benefits elsewhere. Some have died. And others suffered through many months  without benefits.  </P> <P> "We had some older people on small pensions who were ill when we lost  hospitalization (benefits), and their doctors were giving them prescriptions  they couldn't afford to have filled," said Thomas Rabone, who after 33 years at  Kaiser retired when the mill was shut down 1983.  </P> <P> Right now, the retirees' portfolio is all Kaiser stock. "They need cash to fund  their liabilities," said Scott L. Beiser, managing director of Houlihan, Lokey,  Howard &amp; Zukin, a Los Angeles-based banking firm that is advising the  employee benefits association about managing its assets. Beiser said the  company's return to the public stock market will give retirees the option of  liquidating some of their assets and diversifying into a more traditional  portfolio.  </P> <P> For the roughly 6,000 retirees still being served by the medical and pension  plans, that option is a welcome relief.  </P> <P> "A little bit of the bitterness has worn off," said Rabone. "All we have left  now is the company and the success of the company to subsidize retirees with  health and medical needs. We've promised to get as much as we can and as soon  as we can, but it's unrealistic to think we'll recover a major portion of what  (we) lost."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MAGNETIC YOUTH': VIDEOTAPE AND TEENS ATTRACT  </P> <P> Sergio Martinez lowered his head and grinned selfconsciously as videotaped  images of him talking on the telephone flashed by on a video monitor. Martinez,  19, endured a few good-natured jabs about his screen image from Lou-ee Munoz  and Gina Padilla, friends from the Para Los Ninos center in downtown Los  Angeles, as they sat facing two screens in a cluttered corner of the  third-floor office of Visual Communications.  </P> <P> Video artist/instructor Gina Lamb joined in the banter, but she quickly  refocused attention on the work at hand -- introducing the three downtown  youths to the rudiments of editing videotape. Martinez, Padilla and Munoz have  never worked with video before, but their maiden voyage in the medium will be  premiered at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions on July 29.  </P> <P> That's the final day of the "Magnetic Youth: Teen-Powered TV" exhibit curated  by Lamb that is running at the downtown facility. The exhibit features 3 hours  of video work created by teen-age youth working with artists across the  country.  </P> <P> "My major goal is to let them know their opinion is important and video is a  way that people will see it and take notice," said Lamb, who had been doing  video art work with youth around Los Angeles for five years. For the past two,  she has been a full-time artist-in-residence at Jefferson High School in South  Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Video works on a lot of levels. One is that you can use the medium creatively,  have complete control over it and make this thing that is different from  television.  </P> <P> "It gives a certain sense of . . . empowerment is this catchword now, but it  does (apply) with the kids because they can show it to their friends. In a  sense, they build a certain self-confidence in who they are. It gives them a  direction."  </P> <P> Lamb, a Baltimore native who moved to Los Angeles in 1984 and received her  master's degree in fine arts from UCLA in 1987, got the idea for the "Magnetic  Youth" program when she attended a media arts conference last year that focused  on education. She found other video artists doing similar work and, when new  video art curator Adriene Jenik arrived at LACE with a background in education  and documentaries, the wheels were put in motion.  </P> <P> Most of the "Magnetic Youth" tapes are the work of inner-city youth and fall in  the documentary vein. The subjects include abortion, media coverage of the  Bensonhurst killing and Central Park "wilding" attack, rap music and graffiti  art. "My Three Friends" relates the harrowing escapes of three refugees from  Cambodia and Vietnam who became friends at Belmont High here.  </P> <P> "My Soul Is . . ." depicts a Living Haiku Society meeting over pizza in a New  York City school, while "Sundance" is a celebration of nature that is the most  purely "artistic" of the lot. The most sophisticated is "We Have the Force,"  which combines a cartoon puppet family with documentary footage that shows that  battling addiction is more complex than "Just Say No" sloganeering.  </P> <P> "There's a really nice tape of Navajo kids talking about their work called  'Have You Ever Seen a Rainbow at Night?' " said Lamb. "That was professionally  edited, but the kids shot and narrated it and they come through strongly.  </P> <P> "The work is beautiful. You see the beautiful mountain ranges and then a flying  carpet with a TV on it that says 'Dynasty.' The kids are really funny -- they  tell the viewer at the end how they can have an imagination."  </P> <P> Lamb's Para Los Ninos residency, funded by an Artists Projects grant from the  National Endowment for the Arts, has already had a few ups and downs. One  participant was grounded, a second who was scheduled to edit didn't show up,  and a power outage at Visual Communications left the rest working amid a  jury-rigged maze of extension cords and hot lights.  </P> <P> Sergio Martinez plans to document the contrast between rich and poor sections  of Los Angeles, and Gina Padilla is doing her individual piece on addiction.  Lou-ee Munoz, who plans to do a piece on the aesthetic side of graffiti art  murals, found a connection between video's editing process and the way he mixes  records as a music deejay.  </P> <P> The Para Los Ninos tape won't be the only new work debuted at the last of the  LACE exhibit. Lamb's Jefferson High students will also present a documentary on  the anti-narcotics barricade surrounding their school.  </P> <P> Two recent Jefferson graduates, Teresa Mercado and Irene Esquivel, were helping  Lamb. Esquivel had been undecided about future plans until she got involved  last year in a 10-minute documentary on Jefferson graduate and rock 'n' roll  pioneer Richard Berry, who wrote "Louie Louie."  </P> <P> "The surprising thing was (discovering) that working with video was the thing I  wanted to do," said Esquivel, who plans to enter Cal State Los Angeles in  September and major in broadcast and mass media. "The camera is a little box of  magic where you put your ideas into reality and show them to people. It's  another form of expression."  </P> <P> It's stories like Esquivel's that give Lamb the most satisfaction.  </P> <P> "I see myself as a person artist," she said. "I'm interested in people and  that's why I like working with kids. (It's) like Diane Arbus, going in and  becoming like your subject, but for me taking it a step further and turning the  camera over to the subject. For a lot of artists, the youth fill them with  energy and push them forward so they're learning as much as the kids are."  </P></p>

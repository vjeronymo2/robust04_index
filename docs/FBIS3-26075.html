			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 1 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President  Bill Clinton today named Boston lawyer Deval Patrick to be  deputy attorney general in charge of the civil rights division  of the U.S. Justice Department.    Patrick, 37 and black, is a Harvard Law School graduate and  a  partner of the Boston firm Hill and Barlow. The Chicago native  grew up in a poor and segregated neighborhood.    He once worked at the NAACP (National Association for the  Advancement of Colored People) legal defense and education fund  on cases concerning voting rights and death penalty matters in  the south.    Patrick's nomination filled a spot left vacant for months  after the withdrawal of Lani Guinier, Clinton's first choice for  the post.    Clinton abruptly withdrew Guinier's nomination after drawing  criticism from some people in June, saying that he was surprised  by the liberal bent to some of her writings on racial politics.  The post has been vacant since Clinton took office on January  20, 1993.    Wasting no time, conservatives called Patrick "a stealth  Guinier."    But, "he understands the law is a tool to help real people  with real problems," Clinton said in today's Oval Office  announcement, flanked by Attorney General Janet Reno and Vice  President Al Gore.    The Justice Department's civil rights division has protected  civil liberties for "tens of millions of Americans," but there  is still much more to be done, the U.S. President said.</p>

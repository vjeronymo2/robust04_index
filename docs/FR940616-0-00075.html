			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 39.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> VSAT and Equivalent C-Band Antennas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Earth station systems comprising very small aperture terminals make up authorized networks operating in the 12 and 14 GHz bands and provide a variety of communications services to other stations in the network. Each system, authorized pursuant to blanket licensing procedures in Part 25 of the Rules, consists of a network of technically-identical small fixed-satellite earth stations which often includes a larger hub station. For FY 1994, entities holding VSAT authorizations will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per antenna. Entities with less than 100 antennas will be subject to a minimum $6 fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Mobile Satellite Earth Stations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Under Part 25 of the Rules, mobile satellite service providers operate under blanket licenses for mobile antennas (transceivers), which are smaller than one meter and provide voice or data communications, including position location information, for mobile platforms such as cars, buses or trucks. For FY 1994, licensees will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per antenna. Entities with fewer than 100 antennas will be subject to a minimum $6 fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Earth Station Antennas Less Than 9 Meters. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Persons authorized or registered under Part 25 to operate fixed-satellite earth station antennas that are less than 9 meters in diameter are private and public carriers that provide telephone, television, data, and other forms of communications. This category includes antennas used to transmit and receive, transmit only, or receive only. Also included in this category are telemetry, tracking and control (TT&amp;C) earth stations. For FY 1994, we will assess an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per antenna. Entities with less than 100 antennas will be subject to a minimum $6 fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Earth Station Antennas 9 Meters or Greater. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This category covers fixed-satellite earth station antennas authorized under Part 25 that are equal to or greater than 9 meters in diameter. These earth stations are operated by private carriers and common carriers to provide telephone, television, data, and other forms of communications. Included in this category are telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&amp;C) earth stations equal to or greater than 9 meters in diameter. For FY 1994, persons authorized to operate transmit/receive and transmit-only antennas will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $85 per meter; receive-only antennas will be assessed a regulatory fee of $55 per meter. All measurements will be to the tenth of a meter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> e. Interexchange and Local Exchange Carriers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 43. For FY 1994, interexchange carriers (long distance telephone companies) (``IXCs'') will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per presubscribed line. Similarly, local exchange carriers (local telephone operating companies) (``LECs'') will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per access line. A holding company may combine the fee payments of its operating companies and pay their fees for a particular service in a single combined payment or by installments, if the aggregate of their fees in a single service qualifies the holding company to make installment payments. For IXCs we have identified regulatory fee payment amounts greater than $500,000 as large. For LECs, we have identified $700,000 as a large amount. Thus, we will permit IXCs whose annual regulatory fee exceeds $500,000 and LECs whose fee payments exceed $700,000 to make installment payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> f. Competitive Access Providers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 44. Competitive access providers (``CAPs'') are companies, other than the traditional local telephone companies, that provide interstate access services to long distance carriers and other companies. For FY 1994, each CAP will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per subscriber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> g. International Bearer Circuits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 45. The Schedule of Regulatory Fees provides that the fee for international bearer circuits is to be computed ``per 100 active 64 KB circuits or equivalent.'' The fee is to be paid by the facilities-based common carrier activating the circuit in any transmission facility for the provision of service to an end user or resale carrier. Private submarine cable operators also are to pay fees for circuits sold on an indefeasible right of use (IRU) basis or leased in their private submarine cables to any customer of the private cable operator. The fee is based upon active 64 KB circuits, or equivalent circuits. Under this formulation, 64 KB circuits or their equivalent will be assessed a fee. Equivalent circuits include the 64 KB circuit of larger bit stream circuits. For example, the 64 KB circuit equivalent of a 2.048 MB circuit is 30 64 KB circuits. Analog circuits such as 3 and 4 KHz circuits used for international service are also included as equivalent 64 KB circuits. However, circuits derived from 64 KB circuits by the use of digital circuit multiplication systems are not equivalent 64 KB circuits. Such circuits are not subject to fees. Only the 64 KB circuit from which they have been derived will be subject to payment of a fee. For analog television channels we will assess fees as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,8 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Analog television channel size in MHz <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1No. of equivalent 64 KB circuits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 36  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 630 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 288 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 240 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

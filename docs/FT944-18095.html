			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Management is election issue Sir, Fifteen years ago the Tories were emerging from an irrelevant, backward-facing approach to the modern world, Labour was in thrall to the loony left and the Liberals were in cloud cuckoo land. The political parties offered three different strategies, all fundamentally wrong. Today all three parties have roughly the same strategy, yet the columnists debate policy differences as fiercely as ever. Surely now the three parties have agreed on strategy, we should be concentrating on the effective management of policy implementation. Unfortunately, this is a skill unknown to most politicians and ignored by most commentators. As independent observers of, and advisers to, top management of leading UK businesses, we worry most if two ingredients are missing - first, powerful strategies and, second, the drive to implement them successfully. In public life we are now lacking the second. If the policies of any of the three main political parties were implemented effectively the country would, in the main, be much better off. I seriously doubt that will happen. Apathy, passive resistance, politicking, pessimism, creaking institutional structures and lack of skills will conspire to frustrate them all. A serious dose of change management is required, but do any of the politicians have the skills? Let the next election be fought on management not manifestos.

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREE POINTS OF LIGHT FROM JOHN ROBINSON  </P> <P> A few Christmas wishes from me for myself and other frustrated Ram fans: I wish  Georgia Frontiere would sell this team. I wish John Robinson would throw away  his USC playbook. I wish the Rams would stop passing when they should run and  stop running when they should pass.  </P> <P> But most of all, I wish that from now on, when the Rams have them down, they  kick 'em, not fake 'em!  </P> <P> DWAINE E. MACKEY, Sunland  </P></p>

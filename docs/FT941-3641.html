			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Film buffs trade on bad reviews Film reviews do not usually appear on the business pages of any newspaper. But the weekend slating of Paul Hogan's latest production, Lightning Jack, by New York critics is hot stock market news in Australia. The reason: Lightning Jack was financed by Australia's first, and only, publicly-quoted film trust. Units in the trust are traded on the Australian stock market, and have provided a punt on whether the archetypal Aussie movie-star would repeat the success of his 1986 film, Crocodile Dundee, or whether Lightning Jack would flop, like his subsequent 1990 film, Almost an Angel. Yesterday, the critics' views outweighed some fairly healthy box office returns from the film's opening weekend. The units, sold to investors at ADollars 1 apiece last July, fell to ADollars 1.15 at one stage yesterday morning, before recovering to around ADollars 1.20 by mid-afternoon. That compares with ADollars 1.37 on Friday night, and ADollars 1.85 in late February. In Brisbane, Morgan Stockbroking, which underwrote the ADollars 35m issue of units last summer, said there had been an early rush of panic phone calls, but reactions had calmed by the end of the day. Despite the poor reviews, the film reached number two at US box offices, after Guarding Tess starring Shirley McLaine. But whatever the eventual public verdict on Mr Hogan's 'comic western', investors will not walk away empty-handed. The trust was structured so that unitholders enjoy two years of tax breaks. Investors who hold their units until June 1994 can write off 50 per cent of their investment as a tax deduction in the current tax year. A further 50 per cent deduction will be allowed if the units are held until June 1995. Thereafter, the value of the units will depend on how popular the film is. Essentially, the unitholders own the copyright to the film for seven years after its completion. After this, copyright switches to Mr Hogan's private company, Lightning Ridge Films. As revenues start to flow, Lightning Jack must first make deferred production and marketing-related payments - including a Dollars 2m payment to Mr Hogan, representing half his acting fee. The next ADollars 35m goes to the unitholders, so that they recoup their capital outlay. Further general expenses then have to be met, such as a sales marketing fee. Finally, any residual revenues will be split 50:50 between Lightning Ridge and the unitholders. But investors had a scare recently, when a question mark loomed over whether the Australian Tax Office would agree to the full tax deductions originally mooted. In the event, these have been agreed. But the hiatus may have some bearing on whether the Australian stockmarket houses any more film stocks. Mr Clarke admits that in the light of the ATO's ruling, a precise replica of the trust is unlikely, although he thinks variants might be attempted.</p>

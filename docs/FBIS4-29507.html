			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the National Assembly held its work in the  conference hall to pass the bill on the transfer of rights on  land usage under the direction of National Assembly Vice  Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan.    At the beginning of the session, Finance Minister Ho Te read  a report compiling National Assembly deputies' views on the  bill. Then, Ly Tai Luan, deputy head of the National Assembly  Legislative Committee presented the full text of the revised  bill on tax levied on the transfer of rights on land usage after  receiving National Assembly deputies' opinions.    The bill on the transfer of rights on land usage consists of  seven chapters with 29 articles. The National Assembly  continued to contribute opinions before passing each chapter.    In the morning session, the deputies contributed many  opinions on some articles, especially article eight regulating  tax rates for the transfer of agriculture land -- particularly  rice growing land -- for other purposes. Somebody suggested  raising the tax rate from 40 percent to 50 percent in order to  protect the decreasing amount of agriculture land. However,  somebody else proposed that the tax rate for the transfer of  agriculture land to build industrial projects should be reduced  because a high tax would discourage entrepreneurs from building  industrial projects in rural areas. Some opinions suggested  that the National Assembly should only regulate a tax scale and  the government and the National Assembly Standing Committee are  empowered to set concrete tax rates for each projects built in  rural areas.    In the afternoon, after the Law Drafting Committee amended  some articles as suggested by the deputies, the National  Assembly passed the entire bill on the tax levied on the  transfer of rights on land usage. Also in the afternoon  session, National Assembly Vice Chairman Dang Quan Thuy reported  on Comrade Mai Thuc Lan's application to resign from the  positions of member of the National Assembly Standing Committee  and head of the National Assembly's Economic and State Budget  Committee for other official duty. The National Assembly voted  in secret on Comrade Mai Thuc Lan's application.    Tomorrow, the National Assembly will have an all-day break.  On Monday, it will continue its work in the conference hall.</p>

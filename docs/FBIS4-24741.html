			<p>BFN     [Text] Following are excerpts of a speech made by Chen  Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, at the  provincial work conference on opening up on 11 May:  <H5>  1. Clearly Discern the Situation and Further Enhance the </H5> Sense of Emergency in Broadening the Opening Up    Over the past few years, Hebei Province has done a great  deal  of work in opening the province to the outside world and scored  marked achievements in some fields. However, the work in this  regard has not been ideal. In particular, the development  achieved in this regard since the beginning of this year has  brooked no optimism. The work done in the first quarter can be  summarized as the following three sentences: The exports of  foreign trade showed a stable increase. The introduction of  foreign capital decreased on a large scale. The work of foreign  economic relations was not improved. Of the work of the "three  foreign", except for the foreign trade in which the province is  hopeful to fulfill the target set in the "work outline of the  provincial party committee", the work in other two fields has  lagged far behind. If we fail to conduct it well, there is a  danger that nothing will come of it.    In view of the entire country, the opening up with the  utilization of foreign capital as a mainstay has entered a new  stage. Major indicators in this regard are as follows: The  work of opening up has been further suitable to the economic  mechanism of international markets. The practice of bringing in  foreign capital has been gradually expanded from industries most  of which are of manufacturing ones to basic industries, service  industry, and industries of building infrastructures. The  target and style of investments have incurred a large change.  The investment made in industrial capital has been gradually  expanded to that made in banking affairs. The per-project  investment has gradually developed into a systematic one. These  new changes are either opportunities or challenges for us. The  current and actual situation of the province has shown that the  dynamics and extent in the opening up work have not been  sufficient and become the factors that are restricting the  deepening of reform and the accelerating of development. We  must further enhance the sense of emergency in opening up and  make all-out efforts to create a new situation in the work in  this regard.  <H5>  2. Realistically Do a Good Job in Grasping the Three Big </H5> Events of Opening Up    The first big event is to uphold the principle of paying  simultaneous attention to enrichment and improvement and to  accelerate the pace of building up the development zones. By  judging from the analysis of the situation prevailing in the 19  state-and-province-run economic and technical development zones  throughout the province, although party committees and  governments at all levels as well as departments concerned have  done a great deal of work in developing these zones, generally  speaking the work done in this regard is still not ideal.  Except for few of them that have been better run, most of them  have not achieved large development. The currently urgent task  in building up the development zones is not to increase the  number of these zones but is to persistently pay simultaneous  attention to enriching and improving them based on the existing  zones and to accelerate the pace of building them up. Paying  simultaneous attention to enrichment and improvement in this  regard means that in building up these development zones, it is  necessary to earnestly implement the strategy set by the  provincial party committee and the provincial people's  government with regard to having the export-oriented economy  bring along the development. We should adhere to the principle  of operating the development zones with "foreign capital,  industries, and exports" as mainstays. Efforts should be made to  strive to have the initially-built development zones be near to  or basically fulfill the following targets through the efforts  of three or five years: 1) The utilization of funds with the  combination between domestic and foreign ones and foreign  capital should be regarded as the main, 2) The final outlet of  products should chiefly turn toward exports or sales in foreign  countries, 3) The character of enterprises should be chiefly of  joint venture and cooperation, 4) In selecting and allocating  industrial enterprises, we should take as a support the  industrial enterprises whose products are with high added value  and which are engaging in the intensified processing of natural  resources and regard as a main guidance the knowledge-intensive  and high-and-new tech industrial enterprises, 5) In economic  operation, we should connect the standardized market mechanism  with the international markets and try doing things in line with  the international conventions, 6) We should train a large  number of managerial talented personnel who know well the  economy involved in foreign countries.    In building development zones, we should proceed from the  local reality and explore multi-channels to accelerate the  development in this regard. Through the setting up of economic  and technical associations with domestic cities and enterprises  and the breakthrough made in bringing in foreign capital and  technologies, the economic and technical development zone of  Qinhuangdao city has worked a way of development by "integrating  its economic associations with the introduction of foreign  capital and technologies". Its experience gained in this regard  is worthy of drawing on. The economic and technical development  zone of Langfang city has become a typical city in the province  due to its fast development and best management fostered by  upholding the principle of doing things according to the market  law as well as by "bringing in capital to open projects, making  money through using the land resources, raising funds through  multi-channels, and achieving snowballing development". It is  hoped that various localities should earnestly study their  successful experiences and do a good job in operating their  development zones.    The second big event is to rapidly make a breakthrough in  utilizing foreign capital to conduct technical grafting and  renovations among the out-dated enterprises. This important  channel of utilizing foreign funds, with many advantages, may  relieve the strained situation of funds among enterprises, may  bring in advanced technologies and management, is helpful for  shifting the business mechanism of enterprises, and may score  dual results in both reform and renovations. The main reason  why the province has taken so long to make a step in this regard  is still the fetter of leftist concept. Under such a concept,  localities are worrying that too much work in this regard would  adversely affect the main-body role of state-owned enterprises  and are afraid of being labelled with engaging in  "privatization". They are also afraid of being labelled with  "national betrayal" due to their transfer of some property  rights of the state-owned enterprises. Some people also are  afraid of being labelled with "the outflow of state interests"  because joint venture and cooperation will be enforced among the  profit-making enterprises. Some plant directors (managers) are  also afraid of losing their official posts while conducting  joint venture and cooperation. However, the crucial point in  this regard is the subconscious worry of being "capitalist" or  "socialist". The basic form of utilizing foreign capital to  conduct technical grafting and renovations among the out-dated  enterprises is the shareholding system that is a managerial  style of assets and does not involve in the issue of being  "capitalist" or "socialist". The first important task at  present still is to further emancipate minds and to eliminate  the "leftist" fetter.    We should earnestly study the policies on utilizing foreign  capital to conduct technical grafting and renovations among the  out-dated enterprises. Principles to determine which industry  and enterprise should first utilize the foreign capital to  conduct technical grafting and renovations, which industry and  enterprise should have control shares, and which industry and  enterprise can allow foreign firms to have control shares or to  buy their whole shares, should be defined according to the  province's strategy of economic development, according to the  demand of readjusting the industrial structure, and in line with  the role played by the industry and enterprise in the state plan  and people's life. In the view of an enterprise, major  difficult points and problems for making a decision in this  regard include asset appraisal, the burdens of enterprises'  debts, and the living arrangements for surplus staff members and  workers. In dealing with these problems, we may follow many  successful experiences gained by the province in this regard and  draw on the good methods fostered by the fraternal provinces.  The key to successfully handling them lies in whether we dare  to or are willing to study these experiences and methods. As  long as these methods can maintain and increase the value of  state assets, we should actively and boldly adopt them and  further improve them in a creative way in the course of  practice. The provincial level departments concerned should  work out specific policies and methods that are practically  feasible and with strong serviceability.    We should straighten out the systems and enhance the  organizational leadership. In viewing the utilization of  foreign capital for conducting technical grafting and  renovations among the out-dated enterprises characteristically,  it means that enterprises will have one more channel of raising  funds for technical renovations. Therefore, the task in this  regard can be more smoothly managed by the provincial economic  commission. There are almost 2,000 state-owned budgetary  enterprises and more than 1,000 backbone enterprises run by the  collectives of both urban and rural areas throughout the  province. Therefore, we should carry out general investigation  among them and form a line according to their conditions so as  to determine the number of out-dated enterprises that may allow  the enforcement of joint venture, cooperation, and technical  grafting and renovations. After the number is fixed, we should  force the enterprises to take up the enforcement and regard the  enforcement as a formidable mission. From this year on, we  should establish a strict responsibility system for the  enforcement and have the enforcement be fulfilled within three  years.    The third big event is to vigorously conduct the work of  inviting business and introducing foreign capital by regarding  as a focal point the seeking of large business partners and the  talks of large projects. By judging from the comprehensive  analysis on the current world situation in politics and the  economy and on the steady deepening of reform, the rapid  economic development, and the social and political stability in  the country, the emphasis of utilizing foreign capital in next  period should be placed on attracting the investments of large  financial groups and large transnational corporations and on  conducting joint venture and cooperation with them. In inviting  foreign business we should adhere to the principle of  introducing large, medium-sized, and small business projects  simultaneously. However, priority should be given to seeking  large business partners and holding talks on large projects.  Leading comrades should go out to look for various relations, to  establish ties with the large partners, and to strive to conduct  cooperation with the large financial groups and large  transnational corporations that are economically strong.  Establishing ties with a large number of large business  partners will play a role of getting twice the result with half  the effort. We should establish the archives of large business  partners and the responsibility system for personnel who have  dealings with the large partners. We should conduct propaganda  patiently, deeply, protractedly, and honestly among the large  business partners and render services for them so as to enable  them to feel that they are possessing the successful conditions  and confident in conducting cooperation with the province.  <H5>  3. Vigorously Improve the Environment of Opening Up and </H5> Particularly the Intangible Environment To Promote the Quickened  Development of the Export-Oriented Economy    Over the years, the province has always attached great  importance on the improvement of the investment environment. The  tangible environment that includes the infrastructures of  communications, energy resources, and telecommunications, has  been obviously improved. The intangible environment of opening  up has also been gradually improved. However, both tangible and  intangible environments are far from the demands of opening the  province to the outside world in a big way. In particular, the  gap between the intangible environment and the demands is even  larger and it has more problems. Particularly in the course of  developing the export-oriented economy, ideology and concept are  out of date; the level of business talks is low; the rhythm of  work is slow; obstacles in the cooperation are many; and the  observance of promises is poor. Thus, great attention should be  paid to concentrating efforts on enhancing the one sense,  perfecting the three large systems, improving the three  environments, and reinforcing the one contingent of  entrepreneurs in this regard.    Enhancing the one sense means to enhance the sense of the  whole people in opening up. Improving the intangible  environment of opening up includes either the act taken by the  government or the undertaking taken by the whole people, on  which the society as a whole should attach great importance. We  should truly foster a common understanding in which "every  person poses as an investment environment, every thing  represents the image of credit, every locality is involved in  the opening up". We should also foster a strong sense of  opening up and realistically integrate everything done by  localities and local departments and personnel and particularly  by the personnel involved in the business with foreign countries  closely with the work of improving the environment of opening  up, with the work of fostering and improving the province's  image, and with the work of accelerating the pace of building  Hebei into a strong province in the economy.    The three large systems that should be perfected are as  follows: The first is the system of rendering fine-quality and  high-efficiency services for the business with foreign  countries. Every department in service of the business with  foreign countries, by regarding the transformation of function  and work style as a target, should upgrade the political and  professional quality of service personnel and the quality and  efficiency of services; reinforce the service function; and  broaden the service fields. Efforts should be made to  accelerate the establishment and improvement of the social  service organizations, including the offices of accountants,  lawyers, and advisers, and to provide good services for the  broadening of opening up. The second is the system of the  policies on the business with foreign countries and the system  of laws and regulations that are conforming with international  conventions. We should earnestly formulate or revise and work  out as soon as possible policies and provisions for the province  to encourage foreign firms to invest their money in the  province. The third is the system of obtaining sensitive and  first-hand information.    The three environments that should be improved are as  follows: First, the social environment should be further  improved. Efforts should be made to vigorously enhance the  building of spiritual civilization, to deeply and protractedly  carry out the struggle against corruption, and to strengthen the  comprehensive management of public security. Second, the  financial environment should be emphatically improved. Various  financial departments should concentrate their efforts on  enlivening the circulation of funds, vigorously open the sources  of funds, and increase the loans and support for the "three  types of foreign-funded" enterprises. They should also improve  the financial service for the business with foreign countries  and strive to establish foreign-funded and joint-venture  financial organs or agents among the open cities throughout the  province. Third, the environment of applying to customs should  be improved as quickly as possible. Various relevant cities,  prefectures, and port commissions and offices at all levels  should grasp the enhancement of building up the port areas by  regarding the enhancement as an important measure of improving  the investment environment, attracting outside funds, and making  the province's economy prosperous. Efforts should be made to  improve the managerial systems of port offices, relax the  conditions on the transportation of goods transfer, simplify the  procedure of inspection, and upgrade the working efficiency.    Reinforcing the one contingent of entrepreneurs means that  enterprises are the main body of opening the province to the  outside world and that bringing in foreign capital should  chiefly rely on the operation of enterprises. In a sense, the  market economy is an economy run by entrepreneurs. Broadening  the opening up, enforcing the strategy of having the  export-oriented economy bring along development, and developing  the export-oriented economy require a large number of  entrepreneurs who know well the international conventions and  the world economy. It is impossible to develop the  export-oriented economy without the grand contingent of  entrepreneurs who are engaging in the business with foreign  countries and without high-quality partners for joint venture  and cooperation with foreign countries. The province has  possessed a quite large contingent of entrepreneurs. However,  its quality as a whole is not high enough. In particular,  talented personnel engaging in the work of high science and  technology and in the high-level management are so few. Those  who know well the foreign economic relations and foreign trade  are also so few. Those who have a good command of laws, are  good at business and management, and are proficient in foreign  languages, are even more few. We must adopt effective measures  to accelerate the training and forging of the contingent of  entrepreneurs engaging in business with foreign countries.</p>

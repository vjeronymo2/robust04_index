			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ruta Skatikaite: "The Choice of the Ignalina </F> Nuclear Station"]    [Text] A competition on the dismantling of the third block  at the Ignalina nuclear power station has ended. Following its  announcement of the competition, the nuclear station was visited  by representatives of enterprises from Vilnius, Jonava, and  Panevezys. Several German and Norwegian firms also expressed  interest in this venture. Foreigners immediately refused the  structure of the third block, because, in their opinion, its  dismantlement would require additional government assignations.  From among the Lithuanian enterprises, the station chose the  trade stock company "Lina." The latter has already concluded  agreements with construction and transportation organizations in  Visaginas. "Lina" was not daunted by the most difficult  condition of the competition -- to dismantle the block at its  own cost.    The Ignalina nuclear power station has passed on information  concerning the results of the competition to the government,  which will have to decide whether or not to allow "Lina" to  dismantle the third block.</p>

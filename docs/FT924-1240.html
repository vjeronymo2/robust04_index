			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Finland surprises market with SFr500m 8-year note THE Republic of Finland made an early start to its 1993 international borrowing programme yesterday, unexpectedly launching a SFr500m eight-year bond, priced to yield just below 6 per cent. Credit Suisse, which is arranging the issue, said that Finland took advantage of the receptive state of the Swiss bond market, where interest rates are thought to be heading lower, to launch its biggest issue in the sector so far. Bankers said that although the 6 per cent coupon is above the current market rate, the pricing was a little aggressive, given Finland's heavy borrowing requirements. The payment date is in February. The four Swiss franc issues launched yesterday were worth a total of SFr850m. The other three, for Shell Australia, Rabobank Nederland, and Total of France, were all said to be swap-driven. The European Community reopened the Ecu market with the first issue in the sector since the summer. The Ecu80m third tranche of an issue first launched in December last year was priced to yield three basis points over the bid side of the existing issue and brings the total amount outstanding to Ecu820m. Lead manager BZW reported a warm reception for a deal which, it argues, proves that reports of the death of the Ecu market have been greatly exaggerated. Demand, it said, tended to be mainly from European institutional investors. The syndicate broke within 15 minutes of the launch. Bankers said that the issue, though small, shows that the sector can still attract new money. They said if stability returns to the currency markets there could be further Ecu issuance in the new year. The London branch of NordLB issued Dollars 100m of one-year paper under an existing medium-term note programme, through Lehman Brothers. The notes are puttable every three months, and were described by other banks as commercial paper dressed up as bonds. Barclays de Zoete Wedd has issued Dollars 143m of US commercial paper backed by European trade receivables, the first asset-backed paper to be channelled through its special purpose securitisation programme, Sceptre International, writes Tracy Corrigan. The Sceptre vehicle purchases diversified pools of trade receivables, with an average size in excess of Dollars 50m equivalent, from high quality European companies, and then sells asset-backed commercial paper rated A1+/P1. The Dollars 1bn programme allows for paper to be issued in both the US domestic market, as in this case, and in the Euro-commercial paper market. The first batch of receivables to be securitised under the programme consists of close to 2,000 trade contracts sold to the vehicle by one UK company. However, Barclays has been discussing potential issues under the programme with a number of continental European companies. The London stock exchange's board agreed yesterday to proceed with links between its own trade confirmation system, Sequal, and two rival systems, writes Richard Waters. Earlier suggestions from the exchange that it might not proceed with the links had angered a number of institutional investors, since the links are seen as important in developing an electronic network through which details of international share transactions can be agreed.</p>

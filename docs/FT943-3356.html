			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: BfG Bank up 8.9% at DM50m BfG Bank, in which Credit Lyonnais of France has a majority stake, raised its bad debt provisions sharply in the first half of this year as a result of the collapse of Balsam, a sports flooring manufacturer, but still turned in an 8.9 per cent rise in operating profits to DM50m (Dollars 32m). The bank yesterday said that its provisions rose from DM106m to DM133m, mostly reflecting the problems of Balsam which filed for bankruptcy in June. BfG is owed DM33m by Balsam and DM80m by Procedo, a factoring company which is Balsam's largest creditor. BfG Bank, the biggest creditor of the two companies, has filed a suit against Procedo which claims that Procedo was not a victim but an active party to the alleged fraud surrounding Balsam. Procedo's chief executive has been arrested, as has the four-man board of Balsam. As Balsam's factoring agent, Procedo bought up most of the company's claims on customers. But the invoices have mostly turned out to be worthless. The contracts had been inflated or fabricated, it was alleged. Procedo owes more than DM1.7bn to 50 banks. BfG Bank - formerly controlled by Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, the German insurance group, with the BGAG trade union company also holding a stake - also announced a 46.5 per cent rise to DM143m in its partial operating profits, which exclude trading on its own account. All first-half figures are compared with six-twelfths of last year's full result. Interest earnings were 5.2 per cent higher at DM550m and commission earnings on securities, credit and other business were up by 21.3 per cent to DM129m. The bank's administrative and other costs, however, were held back to a rise of only 0.9 per cent to DM536m.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Restructuring: Bull New </F> Version: How It Works"--first paragraph is 01 INFORMATIQUE  introduction]    [Text] After being overhauled under emergency  conditions, the divisions are organized as profit centers. Faced  with this commando-style operation, employees and customers need  an updated map of the group. We review resources and assets.    The myth of the national computer champion has vanished for  good; the company must salvage what it can from the wreckage.  There is no time to lose: Bull must become privatizable within  two years and must again break even, while Brussels opposes the  payment of state subsidies. The reorganization carried out  briskly by Jean-Marie Descarpentries will give responsibilities  to managers, but it disrupts habits, and employees have trouble  getting their bearings. In the very short term, they must  identify profitable activities and then follow the method  already applied at Athesa: set up a joint venture with a partner  and become a subsidiary.  <H5>  Large Systems: A Stepping Stone for Other Divisions </H5>   As Bull's sales decline (by 6.4 percent in 1993, down to  28.25 billion French francs [Fr], with Fr1.9 billion in  operational losses), large systems see their share increase --  25 percent of the activity in 1993. Although it is no longer a  growth vector (new sales dropped by 10 percent in 1993), the  Enterprise Servers division has an important mission. "I must  maintain GCOS activity at as high a level as possible, while  also following customers evolution, and in doing so serve as a  stepping stone for the group's other divisions, whether Unix, FM  [facilities management], or systems integration," division  manager Francis Ackermann explained. Bull relies almost  exclusively on its partners for the development of its product  line, in particular on NEC for the successors of the new DPS  9000/900 (eight machines sold so far). If NEC should decide to  increase its stakes in Bull, it is that division that would most  certainly benefit from its contribution.  <H5>  Open Systems: To Make a Mutation Possible </H5>   The Open Systems and Software Business (OSS) division alone  supports most of Bull's technological innovation.    The OSF [Open Software Foundation] just selected Bull as  leading integrator of the Network Management Option, one of the  three building blocks of the DME, the distributed management  environment. In addition, Bull contributed its multiprocessing  knowhow to design Pegasus, the Unix server running on an IBM  Power PC, which should be introduced in spring. A DPX/20 cluster  (code named Mississippi) is also expected for 1995. In the  future, these should suffice to improve Bull's Unix sales, which  have been quite low although Alain Couder, head of the OSS  division, claims that "the DPX/20 have achieved 50 percent  growth since 1992." Finally, the OSS division is betting on the  EDP [electronic document processing] card with its Imageworks  offer. That division enjoys international fame for its work, but  it must still learn how to sell its technology.  <H5>  PC: To Take Advantage of the Market Momentum </H5>   Although ZDS [Zenith Data Systems] is still responsible for  a  large part of the manufacturer's losses, it reported increased  sales for the first time in 1993, 31 percent by value and 47  percent by volume. Marking a pause last year, the agreement with  Packard-Bell gave ZDS some purchasing leverage. In France, the  appointment of Michel Aguerreberry (the former Agena CEO) was  intended to mobilize channels (60 percent of sales are still  achieved among Bull's installed base) and eliminate delivery  problems. The Angers site will become the European distribution  center of ZDS, and Packard-Bell will set up an assembly plant  there.    The portable computer line will be renewed this year and it  will emphasize servers. PDAs [expansion not given] were  announced and the Compuprint entity (printers) was integrated.  Now they must become profitable...  <H5>  Systems Integration: Stressing Expertise </H5>   Formalized at last, Bull's systems integration offer has the  advantage of a methodology (Mosic) and an international  organization, and its objective is to sign two major contracts  per country in 1994. The new Systems Integration Services (SIS)  division will target the branches aimed at in each country  (banking, insurance, distribution, etc.) and distribute a few  international expertise centers in some of them. It is through  partnerships that Bull intends to develop its expertise in  networks, images, telecommunications, or security. Barely a few  weeks old, SIS will have to face fierce competition, especially  in France, although George McNeil, the division head, claims  that "Bull does not intend to become a service company."  <H5>  FM: To Open Government Doors </H5>   Announced with a flourish, the creation of Athesa, the  French  subsidiary of which is a joint-venture between CISI  [International Company for Data Processing Services] and Bull,  ambitions to convert government offices to facilities management.    For the time being, the board of Athesa International, the  holding company in which Bull will have a 51-percent interest,  is still not complete. "Let's not put the cart before the horse.  Athesa must first of all meet the needs of Bull's clients,"  Thierry Breton, head of the Systems Operations division and in  charge of strategy, explained. It will fall to Jacques Tordjman  (the former CEO OF EDS France) to succeed in a belated offensive  on a market where entry stakes are high. He inherited, in  France, Bull's internal data-processing department and the CISI  contracts.  <H5>  Customer Service: From Maintenance to Service </H5>   A recurring asset, customer service must increase the  value-added content of its services and help improve Bull's  image. Herve Mouren, head of the Customer Service division wants  to increase the share of services to 25 percent, although  maintenance still accounts for 90 percent of sales. As a result,  the following will be developed: micro FM (a contract to manage  6,000 PCs at Elf Aquitaine was just signed), network management,  and multibrand maintenance. This should make for increasingly  complex relations between the various Bull divisions dedicated  to service. In spite of all, Customer Service has the advantage  of having a captive clientele and of being the only division to  make a profit, with Enterprise Servers.  <H5>  To Specialize Sales People in Order to Ensure Growth </H5>   One priority: to increase efforts outside the installed  base.  One mission: to make sure that Bull breaks even in 1994. Sales  people are now specialized by client, by service, or by product.  Each division head (products or services) and the sales force in  charge of selling the products of that division have signed an  agreement concerning the sales amount to be generated in 1994  and the resources allocated to achieve that goal. In France, the  sales force supports four national and sectorial networks as  well as the regional market directorate created in 1993. "Each  customer now deals with only one network so as to improve our  productivity and efficiency," we were told by Herve Mouren, head  of Bull France. Although it reformed its pre-sales modes in  1993, Bull France, which had several general managers within a  few years, cannot manage to overcome the paralysis of its sales  force. This is due to a large extent to the uncertainty that  prevails concerning the future and to the difficult  implementation of the reorganization.

The first one is  symbolized by new relations with the State, which will pay a  Fr8-billion settlement and give us a free hand. The second one  has to do with the reorganization of Bull's expertise by branch  of activity, and my job is to find 100 executives to manage the  corporation. The third one will enable us to turn things around  and restart sales growth through a decentralization that will  give free rein to the employees' spirit of enterprise. The  entire group is energized so that we can break even in 1995. We  are implementing a program to achieve savings of Fr2 billion  and, already by June 1994, we will make decisions concerning  activities that do not show any progress. We could have  disinvested from 40 to 60 percent of the group's activities in  order to break even. In 1995, 90 percent of the activities will  still remain within Bull's perimeter. Each division will have to  develop its own partnerships. To those partners we deem of  strategic importance, we shall offer an opportunity to acquire  equity in the division(s) concerned, including the sales  networks. Later on, the equity of both the employees and the  public in the company could be increased to 20 percent.</p>

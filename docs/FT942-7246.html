			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Camelot draws the winning ticket: The victors and losers in the hotly contested battle for the UK lottery licence The 18th-century author Henry Fielding had a clear idea of how powerful a device a lottery could be for raising money. 'A lottery is a Taxation Upon all the Fools in Creation; And Heaven be prais'd It is easily raised, Credulity is always in Fashion.' The song was sung in Fielding's play The Lottery performed at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1732. Across London, in the more sober surroundings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, near the House of Commons, there was little credulity yesterday when Camelot was unveiled as the winner of the fiercely contested battle for the National Lottery licence. There was, however, a lot of optimism that enormous sums can be raised for five 'good causes' specified by the government through the first nationwide lottery in the UK for more than 150 years. Camelot is forecasting that during the seven-year term of its licence the total turnover for the National Lottery will amount to Pounds 32bn, and that Pounds 9bn will be distributed to the good causes - the Arts Councils of the UK, the Sports Councils, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Millennium Commission and the National Lottery Charity board. In its 'peak year' of operation, Camelot, which has long been seen as the potential victor in the lottery contest - although no official word of the actual winner leaked - envisages a turnover of Pounds 5.5bn and a payment to the good causes of Pounds 1.6bn. Camelot, which plans to launch the lottery in early November, believes it will be able to hand over Pounds 750m in its first full year of operation. Camelot brings together five large organisations: Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery group, De La Rue, the banknote and security printer, G-Tech, the US lottery equipment manufacturer, ICL, the computer group, and Racal, the electronics and communications group. Mr Tim Holley, the quietly spoken Racal executive who became chief executive of Camelot, said yesterday: 'This is a very, very exciting project.' He said not only would the lottery be the largest in the world, but it would also involve the largest launch of a consumer brand in the UK. The game itself could hardly be more simple. A player will pay Pounds 1 and choose six numbers out of a possible 49 on a 'play card'. The numbers do not have to be placed in any particular order. Three correct numbers will probably be worth a Pounds 10 prize; four, Pounds 50-Pounds 60; five, several thousand pounds. Pick the correct six numbers and you hit the jackpot, which could be between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m each week. 'It's easy, it's simple, and it will be a lot of fun,' said Mr David Rigg, Camelot's communications director. The draw of the winning numbers will take place live on prime-time television on Saturday nights. Camelot believes the programme could shoot straight to the top of the ratings with possible audiences of 23m. Though no television contracts have been signed, Camelot says the broadcast will 'probably' go to the BBC, partly because the corporation can offer extensive live radio as well as television coverage. The company has not yet decided whether the draw will be the climax of a 40-minute light entertainment show or a five-minute programme devoted entirely to the draw, or whether the BBC will make the programme in-house or use an independent producer. A celebrity guest will inevitably be involved. The total prize pay-out ratio over the period of the licence, which runs to the end of September 2001, will be more than 56.5 per cent of net sales after the deduction of a 12 per cent lottery tax on gross sales. The good causes' money will range from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total revenues. One of yesterday's losers, who had promised to offer all profits to a combination of good causes and charities, was Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin group. He was not alone in his disappointment. Seven applicants failed, a number of whom had been working on the project for several years. The unsuccessful bidders, ranging from The Great British Lottery Company, which includes Granada and Carlton Communications, to Mr Branson's UK Lottery Foundation, and the NM Rothschild-Tattersalls bid, spent millions in putting their consortiums together. Mr Peter Davis, the director-general of the National Lottery, who finally took the crucial decision last week, made it clear that he had no doubt that Camelot was the strongest applicant. The company came near the top or at the top of every category in which the applicants were assessed, he said. They were 'amongst the highest' in the forecasts for money to be raised, and plan to retain only 11 per cent of revenues as combined profits and operating costs - by far the lowest on offer. Out of this will come 5 per cent sales commission to retailers. This will leave profits of less than 1 per cent of sales. 'Camelot was also by a long way the best prepared,' said Mr Davis. The only thing that might have stopped Camelot winning the licence was controversy surrounding G-Tech, which has been accused by rivals in the US of irregularities. The company has never been found guilty of any wrongdoing. 'I am satisfied that we have a full and comprehensive picture of all the people involved, and I am confident in my decision that all those involved with Camelot, and Camelot itself, are fit and proper for that role,' Mr Davis said. The lottery will not just make winners of the players. Camelot itself is the most obvious winner so far. Mr Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at the stockbroker Smith NewCourt, marked Racal, which will benefit from communications contracts, and Cadbury Schweppes as 'buys', and De La Rue a 'hold' in a recent forecast if Camelot won. But there are likely to be a large number of other business winners from a lottery that plans to sell its first tickets in 26 weeks - in early November. The G-Tech lottery machines will be made at ICL's plant at Ashton-under-Lyne and contracts will soon be awarded for the provision of tickets and later the scratch-card games which will be launched next year. Camelot will directly employ about 500 at Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, and at Aintree on Merseyside, but more jobs will flow from the retail operation - selling lottery tickets in both shops, from independent corner stores to garages, supermarkets and newsagents. Camelot plans to have 10,000 outlets selling tickets by the November launch, and within two years 27,000 outlets connected to the largest computer network in the UK, plus a further 12,000 outlets selling only scratch cards. Some observers have suggested that the total number of jobs generated directly or indirectly could reach 85,000, though the figure is probably optimistic. The construction industry could be among those benefiting greatly from the proceeds of the National Lottery. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, has made it clear that he expects the money to be 'spent mainly on capital projects' to provide new and lasting improved facilities, such as sports stadiums and concert halls. Even Mr Branson, who had pledged to raise more than Pounds 11bn for charities and good causes, and angrily attacked the choice of Camelot yesterday, contributed to the lottery outcome by improving the income of the good causes. First Mr Branson and his partner Lord Young, the former trade and industry secretary, generated publicity for the lottery and dominated front pages when the bids were submitted in February by bringing along Desert Orchid, the famous racehorse. More significantly, by promising to give all his profits to the good causes and some charities of his own, Mr Branson forced all the other bidders to reduce their own profit margins. As Mr Davis observed yesterday, the bidding process had worked well, in forcing up the money for good causes and forcing down the amount absorbed by profits and operating costs. It remains to be seen, however, whether Fielding was right in saying that a lottery is 'easily raised', even when the sums involved total Pounds 32bn and the odds against winning a jackpot are roughly 14m to one.</p>

This has prompted the authorities to increase  security.    A special security council meeting is under way at this hour  at the Cundinamarca governor's office. Presiding over the  council are Governor Manuel Guillermo Infante, 13th Brigade  Commander General Norberto Adrada, and Cundinamarca Police  Commander Colonel Roberto Fajardo.    Departmental authorities are considering the serious public  order problem which affected at least five towns in the  department this weekend. The authorities are considering new  strategies to counteract the guerrillas' actions and security  measures to guarantee the electoral campaign. This weekend in  Cundinamarca, the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]  implemented a strategy aimed at isolating Bogota, which was  drafted at the most recent guerrilla summit in La Uribe. The  guerrillas operate on four fronts. In the south, they are  located in the municipalities of Fusagasuga, Cabrera, Pasca,  Gutierrez, Chipaque, and Fomeque. In the east, they are located  in the municipalities of Ubala, Chacala, and the Chingaza area.  In the northwest, they are located in Yacopi, Caparrapi, and  Topaipi in La Palma and Villa Gomez on the Boyaca border.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Market conditions depress Amcoal earnings DIFFICULT market conditions depressed attributable earnings of Anglo American Coal (Amcoal), South Africa's largest coal group, by 6.4 per cent, before extraordinary items, to R252.3m (Dollars 79.3m) from R269.4m in the year to March, writes Philip Gawith. Mr David Rankin, chairman, also forecast lower earnings in the year ahead, saying a better domestic performance would be offset by a significantly reduced contribution from exports. He said export prices appeared to be approaching levels which would call into question the viability of some of South Africa's exporting collieries.</p>

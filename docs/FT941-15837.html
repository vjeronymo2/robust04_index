			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Court decision on Thorp today Greenpeace, the pressure group, expects to be told in the High Court today that it has won permission to seek judicial review of the government's decision to grant a licence to the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield. Its application for a review will not be contested by British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, or by the government, BNF's shareholder. The terms of the licence, announced by the government before Christmas, say BNF can begin operating the plant from January 17. The 500-metre-long plant, which is designed to extract re-usable uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, will then become radioactive. Greenpeace said yesterday that if a review is granted, it will take place in early February. It will not ask for a delay in Thorp's operation until after a review. It says BNF will be occupied with preliminary tests until mid February.</p>

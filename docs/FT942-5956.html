			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Fresh row erupts over London radio Shareholders in London Broadcasting Company have called for the licence of its successor, London News Radio, to be revoked before the company even begins broadcasting. Lawyers representing Chelverton Investments, which controlled LBC until it went into receivership, have written to the Radio Authority saying the two London commercial speech-based services should be re-advertised. SJ Berwin, the lawyers, say they want either to hear within seven days that the licence will be revoked or to receive reasons why the authority has decided not to revoke it. If the reply is not satisfactory, the lawyers say they will advise their clients of their right to apply for judicial review of the authority's decision. The row over the London commercial radio licences has blown up again because of the announcement last week that Reuters Holdings, the news and information group, is proposing to acquire LNR, the Guinness Mahon-backed company which was awarded the licence last September in preference to LBC. Reuters was part of the London Radio Company, another unsuccessful applicant for the two franchises. Before the Reuters plan to buy LNR for Pounds 5m, LNR had already acquired the assets of LBC from the receivers. Chelverton, whose main investors include Mr John Porter, son of the controversial Conservative politician Dame Shirley Porter, clearly hopes to persuade the LBC receivers and other applicants for the London licences to join in a judicial-review application. Chelverton claims through its lawyers that, before the Reuters announcement, LNR had been unable to raise its financing. LNR said it had been well advanced in putting together a syndicate to fund the station when it received 'an offer it couldn't refuse'. Chelverton argues that the licence should be revoked under the 1990 Broadcasting Act because the 'nature and characteristics' of LNR are now completely different from the time of the licence award. Apart from the proposed acquisition by Reuters, Guinness Mahon had failed to comply with a statement in the LNR application that it would issue shares in LNR by way of a private placement. 'The consequence of the acquisition of LNR by Reuters is that the licence will be held by an entity which, when the statutory scheme for the award of the licence was followed, was unsuccessful,' the letter to the Radio Authority says.</p>

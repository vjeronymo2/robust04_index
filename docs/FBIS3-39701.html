			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed BB: "Swiss Foreign Policy Report: No </F> Unanimous Approval From Committee"; as released by Bern  ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Bern, 9 Feb (ATS) -- The National Council's Foreign  Policy Committee, chaired by Ernst Muehlemann [Radical  Democratic Party, Canton of Thurgau], approved the Federal  Council's report on Swiss foreign policy and the report on  neutrality. However, approval was not unanimous: 17 votes to  five. A minority requested that the report be sent back to the  Federal Council with the article asking for European Union [EU]  membership removed.    According to a press release issued on Wednesday [9  February], the majority approved the government's global  strategy. For domestic political reasons, however, a minority  wanted the Federal Council to consider EU membership not as a  goal, but as a possible solution depending on circumstances.    Similarly, during the discussion on neutrality it was stated  that this traditional rule must not be considered an end in  itself but rather a means of defending the nation's interests.  This maxim cannot remain inflexible if external circumstances  change.    As an initial success of the bilateral Swiss-EC  negotiations,  the committee cited the rapidly reached agreement on the rules  of origin. The issue of what strategy to adopt in these  negotiations was also raised. The committee expressed its  support for the new coordinator, Secretary of State Jakob  Kellenberger.  <H5>  Concern Over Events in Bosnia </H5>   In light of the situation in Bosnia, the committee expressed  its concern at the violent attacks on the civilian population.  The committee condemned the massacre of 5 February in Sarajevo  and the blatant and continued violation of the Geneva  Convention. It demanded in the strongest terms that, despite  attempts at "ethnic cleansing," a multicultural society be  guaranteed in Sarajevo.</p>

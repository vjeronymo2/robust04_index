			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed regulations provide that all holders of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payment debt instrument are bound by the issuer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected payment schedule and that an issuer must provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule to the holders. A holder may vary from the projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment schedule provided by the issuer only if the projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment schedule is unreasonable. If an issuer does not create a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected payment schedule as required or the issuer's schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is unreasonable, a holder must apply the projected payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule rules to determine a reasonable projected payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule. If a holder is not using the issuer's projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment schedule, the holder must explicitly disclose this fact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on its timely filed federal income tax return and must explain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> why it is not using the issuer's schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the proposed regulations allow considerable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility, taxpayers may attempt to create uneconomic accruals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by intentionally overstating or understating the projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts of the contingent payments. Taxpayers must use actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices in setting the payment schedule and are given flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only within the range of reasonable prices. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices of an issuer's or a holder's hedges may be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine reasonableness. Under the rules of section 6001,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayers must maintain adequate contemporaneous records to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the projected payment schedule. In addition, the rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;1.1275&hyph;2T(g) (the OID anti-abuse rule) apply to transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the proposed regulations, including transactions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the taxpayer attempts to create payment schedules that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause uneconomic accruals. Attempts to overstate or understate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amounts of the projected payments will give rise to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments of tax liability, and, if appropriate, penalties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the noncontingent bond method, if the actual amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a contingent payment differs from the projected amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment, the difference results in either a positive or negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment that must be taken into account by the taxpayer. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of the adjustments is to correct the interest accruals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that have occurred to date on the debt instrument. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adjustments generally increase or decrease the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest on a contingent payment debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the actual amount of a contingent payment is greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the projected amount of the payment, the difference is a positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment. If the projected amount of a contingent payment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than the actual amount of the payment, the difference is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a negative adjustment. Positive and negative adjustments for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable year are netted for each taxable year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A net positive adjustment for a taxable year is treated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the taxpayer as additional interest for the year. A net negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment for a taxable year is taken into account as follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, a net negative adjustment for a taxable year offsets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interest that accrued on the debt instrument for the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the projected payment schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, if the net negative adjustment exceeds the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest that accrued on the debt instrument for the taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year, the excess is treated as an ordinary loss by the holder or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as ordinary income by the issuer. However, the amount treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordinary loss by the holder is limited to the amount by which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder's total prior interest inclusions on the debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including all net positive adjustments) exceed the total net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative adjustments on the debt instrument previously treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordinary loss by the holder. Similarly, the amount treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordinary income by the issuer is limited to the amount by which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issuer's total prior interest deductions on the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument (including all net positive adjustments) exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total net negative adjustments on the debt instrument previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as ordinary income by the issuer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, because a negative adjustment adjusts interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accruals, if the net negative adjustment exceeds the sum of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of interest that accrued on the debt instrument for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable year and the amount treated as ordinary loss (or income)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the taxable year, the excess is treated as a negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment that occurs on the first day of the succeeding taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. As a result, the excess offsets interest accruals on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument in future taxable years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, any unused net negative adjustment reduces the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount realized by the holder on the sale, exchange, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retirement of a contingent payment debt instrument. Similarly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any unused net negative adjustment is taken into account by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuer on retirement of a contingent payment debt instrument as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income from the discharge of indebtedness. The IRS and Treasury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request comments on whether the regulations should provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific rules governing the treatment of net negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments determined on the occurrence of other events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS and Treasury chose this method for taking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments into account because it provided a relatively simple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method for adjusting the yield. However, the method may produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate results, for example, if there are large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments in the early years of a debt instrument. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods, such as a method that spreads adjustments over the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the debt instrument, would produce more accurate results but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be more complex. The IRS and Treasury request comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether another method should be used for taking adjustments into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Adjusted issue price, basis, and retirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the noncontingent bond method, the adjusted issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price of a contingent payment debt instrument, adjustments to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder's basis in the debt instrument, and the amount of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payment treated as made on the scheduled retirement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument are determined using the projected payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule rather than actual contingent payments. This rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate because positive or negative adjustments are used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into account the difference between actual amounts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected amounts of contingent payments. This difference would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be counted twice if adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount deemed paid on retirement were based on the actual amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of contingent payments rather than the projected amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Character on sale, exchange, or retirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the noncontingent bond method, any gain recognized by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment debt instrument is treated as interest income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, any loss recognized by a holder on the sale, exchange,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or retirement of a contingent payment debt instrument is treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as ordinary loss to the extent of the holder's prior interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusions (reduced by prior ordinary losses attributable to net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative adjustments) on the instrument. Although this rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with the treatment of noncontingent debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments, the rule is necessary because of the treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net positive and net negative adjustments. The rule prevents a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer who sells a contingent payment debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately before a positive adjustment occurs from converting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interest income from the adjustment into capital gain or from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converting the amount by which a negative adjustment would reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest income into capital loss. Consistent with the rule's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose, the rule does not apply to a sale, exchange, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retirement that occurs when there are no outstanding contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments due on a debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

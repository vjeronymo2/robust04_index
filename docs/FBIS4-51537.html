			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Defense Agency head Atsushi  Kanda on Monday [2 May] confirmed that the government has been  making a study of possible emergency legislative arrangements in  connection with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development  programs.    In a television news program of ASAHI National Broadcasting  (ASAHI TV), Kanda said,"at the present stage, (the government)  has been making a study on preparedness for various situations."    The defense agency chief said, however, that the government  has not yet reached a political decision on the matter. Kanda  was quoted as saying, "the government has not yet decided to  implement (emergency legislative arrangements)."    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa expressed a positive stance  on  the formulation of emergency legislative arrangements, during  the same TV news show.    Kakizawa commented that the Foreign Ministry will hold  comprehensive talks on the matter with the Defense Agency, when  he was asked if there is disagreement on the issue among cabinet  ministers.    In another ASAHI TV program Sunday, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai expressed reservations about the wisdom of early  Japanese action in response to North Korea's suspected nuclear  weapons programs, saying Japan is still hopeful that a  diplomatic solution can be achieved.    Such legislative measures apparently include revision of the  Self-Defense Forces Law, which enables SDF planes to carry  Japanese citizens residing overseas in an emergency.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told reporters Monday morning  that he has not received any report by government  representatives on the emergency legislative measure  preparations.    Hata said the government seems to be making a study (of the  matter). But he added that he has not yet received any report  on the issue.    Hata made the remarks when he was asked about the reported  preparation of emergency legislative arrangements disclosed by  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi kumagai in the Sunday TV program.    A government source on Monday morning said, "the government  has completed its preparations of security emergency legislative  arrangements, but the government will not submit drafts to the  diet."    The source said that the government wants to avoid  triggering  a controversy, mindful of the fact that the Social Democratic  Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan], which was the largest  group in the former coalition, opposes such legislative measures.</p>

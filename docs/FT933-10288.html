			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Clinton puts his faith in the Senate PRESIDENT Bill Clinton took the battle to win approval for his budget proposals to Capitol Hill yesterday, declaring: 'I do not think the Senate will let this plan go down. I do not think they will do that to the country.' The House of Representatives is due to vote on the compromise budget package today, with the more finely balanced Senate vote due on Friday. Under the compromise worked out by Congress the budget deficit will be reduced by Dollars 496bn (Pounds 332.8bn) over the next five years, achieved by raising more than Dollars 243bn in new taxes and cutting about Dollars 253bn in spending. Asked if he would win, the president would only say: 'I hope so'. Mr Al Gore, the vice-president whose casting vote was needed to get the original budget bill through the Senate, said yesterday he did not know whether he would decide the fate of the legislation again tomorrow. 'But one way or another, this bill is going through,' he added. To blunt Republican criticism that higher income tax charges for the country's top earners were being made retroactive to January 1, a Treasury official said yesterday the back payments could be made in three tranches. The concession, which has been written into the amended bill, would allow the additional amounts for the current fiscal year to be paid on April 15 next year and on the same date in the two succeeding years. Mr Bob Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, has accused the administration of imposing the biggest tax increase in history. He also claims that Mr Clinton and his fellow Democrats are so anxious to get their hands on the public's money 'that they made the tax increases retroactive. . . to 20 days before President Clinton got to the White House'. The latest public opinion polls underline the difficulty faced by the Democrats in persuading the public that the new income tax charges are fair and only fall on the highest earners. According to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll, about 68 per cent of respondents believed that middle-income taxpayers would shoulder most of the additional burden. Democratic Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, who party leaders are pressing hard to swing his vote in favour of the legislation, continued to tantalise yesterday. Having voted previously against the bill, he said he was still leaning in that direction.</p>

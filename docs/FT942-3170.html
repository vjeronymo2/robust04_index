It will hold a 60 per cent interest in the new venture, to be called Electrolux South Africa, which will include the operations of the hitherto Barlow-owned Electrocool, which has been making Electrolux products in South Africa under licence, and the local sales of AEG white goods bought by Electrolux this year.

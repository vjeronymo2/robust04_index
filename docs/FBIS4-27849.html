			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Grave Threat to Peace on Korean Peninsula" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- The United States and  the South Korean puppets announced that they would stage Ulchi  Focus Lens joint military exercises in South Korea for two weeks  from August 22 allegedly to fill the "gap" till the start of the  "Team Spirit" war game.    The new large-scale nuclear war drill projected by the  United  States and the South Korean puppets is a grave challenge to the  whole nation which desire peace on the Korean peninsula and its  peaceful reunification, and it is a dangerous action to carry  the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war,  declares NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today.    The analyst says:    The open announcement of the plan of a provocative war  gamble  against the North by the South Korean puppets together with  outside forces clearly indicates that they do not want a  solution to the peace problem on the Korean peninsula through  dialogue and negotiation but seek to attain their aim of  aggression with "strength".    The talk about "gap" is a poor excuse invented by them to  justify the adventurous war racket against the North.    With nothing can the United States and the Kim Yong-sam  group  justify the Ulchi Focus Lens joint military exercises which  would gravely threaten our nation and endanger peace in Asia and  the rest of the world.    Our people who love peace do not want war but are never  afraid of it and can never tolerate the aggressors provoking us.    The United States and the South Korean puppets must cancel  the plan of an adventurous war gamble, pondering over the  consequences to be entailed by their provocative play with fire.</p>

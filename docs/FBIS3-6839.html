Domestic demand contributed to pushing up the gross domestic  product (GDP) by 0.0 percentage point and external demand to  depressing it by 0.6 percentage point, the agency said.  Consumer spending, one of the prime engines of domestic demand,  rose 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, while another  pillar, corporate capital spending, declined 3.5 percent.    Meanwhile, Japan's real or inflation-adjusted gross national  product (GNP) during the quarter shrank 0.4 percent from the  quarter before, or an annualized 1.6 percent.    GDP and GNP represent the total output of goods and  services,  with the GDP excluding net income from abroad. Starting with  the previous quarter, the agency switched its emphasis from GNP  to GDP to assess the nation's economic performance more  accurately in line with international trends.</p>

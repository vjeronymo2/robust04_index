Although several countries in the old Eastern bloc are  publicly pressing to join the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation, Lithuania was only the second to make a formal  approach. Albania requested membership last year.    A NATO spokesman said the 16-member alliance had received a  letter from Lithuania. "The letter has been distributed to  member nations and will be considered by the alliance in due  course," he said.    The issue of NATO membership for East European states has  become a delicate one, with Russia strongly opposed and Western  leaders wary of doing anything to upset Moscow's reform  programmes.    NATO sources said Lithuania was likely to be steered towards  the Partnership for Peace programme of East-West military  cooperation which the alliance's summit next week is expected to  adopt.    The scheme provides for joint peacekeeping planning,  training  and other activities, as well as consultations in times of  crisis. But it stops short of full membership or outright  security guarantees.    The summit was expected to give a signal separately of  NATO's  intention to eventually expand, but without providing a list of  membership candidates or timetable.</p>

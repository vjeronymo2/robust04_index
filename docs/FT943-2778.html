			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Living with a six-year silence The broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein was announced in the House of Commons by Mr Douglas Hurd, then home secretary, on October 19 1988 after a particularly intense period of IRA violence. He said that the time had come to deny the 'easy platform' provided by radio and television to those who 'propagate terrorism'. The ban would 'remove from the men of violence an extra weapon which the existence of direct access to the media has provided for them'. He said: 'This is not censorship, because it does not deal with or prohibit the reporting of events. Broadly, we are putting broadcasters on the same basis as representatives of the written press.' The move was supported by unionists, but Mr Roy Hattersley, then shadow home secretary, said it would 'make the government look simultaneously repressive and ridiculous'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the action was 'ill-conceived, ill-judged and almost certainly counter-productive'. The government's action came more than three years after Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister, suggested after the IRA attack on the 1984 Tory conference in Brighton that the media adopt a voluntary code of conduct denying publicity to terrorists and hijackers. She said: 'We must try to find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend.' Initially the policy was judged a success. Even Sinn Fein at the time admitted it was having difficulties putting the case for the IRA campaign. Since its imposition the ban has been sidestepped by broadcasters, who have used actors' voices to dub the words of individuals such as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. In recent months ministers have come round to the view - held by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary - that the ban was no longer achieving anything and had become a lever for people to criticise the government. The Irish government lifted its broadcasting ban on January 19. Irish officials said that in the past week the lifting of the ban had been the subject of several telephone conversations between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart. Mr Reynolds said after consultations with Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader, that lifting the ban, with other measures such as lifting border controls, could help enforce the IRA leadership's commitment to the ceasefire without alienating unionist opinion. According to Downing Street the timing of yesterday's move was decided 'very late' on Thursday and followed intensive canvassing of unionist views - including those of Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader - by Mr Major and senior ministers. The lifting of the Irish ban has had little impact on Sinn Fein's electoral fortunes. The view of some Irish officials - apparently now shared by their UK counterparts - is that far from turning Mr Adams into a media star, lifting the broadcasting ban will help remove the myths surrounding him.</p>

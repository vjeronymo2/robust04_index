			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE DARKNESS  </P> <P> President Bush recently made a most welcome commitment to passage of  legislation barring discrimination against those infected with the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS.  </P> <P> Federal law already is in place guarding against discrimination in housing --  but not in employment.  </P> <P> Fear of just that kind of discrimination discourages many from seeking the  appropriate tests for the infection. This is a source of great frustration to  public-health officials in their efforts to trace the epidemiology of the  disease and improve programs of control and treatment.  </P> <P> "For those who are living with HIV and AIDS, our response is clear," the  President told the National Business Leadership Conference on AIDS. "They  deserve our compassion. They deserve our care. And they deserve more than a  chance -- they deserve a cure."  </P> <P> His endorsement of the Americans With Disabilities Act, already passed by the  Senate, should facilitate quick passage. His commitment to the fight against  discrimination would have been stronger, however, had he also spoken against  the legislation now in effect that requires foreigners with AIDS to obtain a  waiver to visit the United States. This is an unnecessary and discriminatory  measure, serving no substantial public-health purpose. Not surprisingly, it is  the object of a worldwide protest, now taking the form of a threatened boycott  of the international AIDS conference scheduled for San Francisco in June.  </P> <P> Another notable omission from the President's address was a commitment of more  money. This drew criticism from Robert D. Haas, president and chief executive  of Levi Strauss &amp; Co. "Even if the private sector helps create 'a thousand  points of light' across the land," Haas commented, "it will be of no avail if  there is darkness in the White House." It's hard to put it any better than  that.  </P></p>

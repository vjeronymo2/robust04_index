			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Still not ready to take the credit for reform: How big subsidies continue to cripple Russia MORE THAN two weeks after President Boris Yeltsin's referendum victory, the prospects for Russia's economic reforms seem as precarious as ever. While the reformers struggle to retain influence within the government, the Russian central bank is again in the firing line for lax credit policies which are expected to fuel an acceleration in inflation over the next few months. The reformers have tried to pin the blame for inflation on Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, who has been publicly portrayed by both the president and radical ministers as an enemy from within who is recklessly flooding the economy with inflationary credit. 'The reformists are still engaged in a battle with the central bank for tighter credit,' former prime minister Yegor Gaidar said in London last week. Moscow abounds with rumours of Mr Gerashchenko's imminent replacement. One scenario now being rehearsed by radicals is for Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, to take over the central bank governor's job. This might be accompanied by the return to the finance ministry of Mr Gaidar, although he has denied that he has received any such invitation. The central bank has reacted angrily to these rumours. 'To me it is plain silly to blame the central bank,' says Mr Alexander Khandruyev, a deputy governor at the central bank. 'It is very hard for the bank to implement a tough monetary policy if the government keeps increasing state credits to regions and enterprises.' Mr Sergie Vassiliev, director of the government's Centre for Economic Reform, confirms that government demands for credits from the central bank have increased in recent weeks. 'Thirty per cent monthly inflation reflects the government's inability to control its expenditures,' he says. 'If Mr Gerashchenko is to blame, it is because he should be saying No to government requests for credits.' Even Mr Fyodorov has found it difficult to practise the financial orthodoxy he has preached to the central bank. Having pushed the central bank to increase interest rates, he has failed to wean the finance ministry off the special low interest rates it continues to pay on central bank credit to finance the budget deficit. At the root of the inflation problem are subsidies that the Russian state is still paying to the enterprise sector. Experts at western financial institutions estimate that explicit budget subsidies were equivalent to a little over 20 per cent of gross domestic product last year, mainly to enterprises. But the same amount again was paid to enterprises through off-budget credits from the central bank and the ministry of finance. Recent monetary data had been relatively encouraging, with the monthly inflation rate falling to 21 per cent in March from 26 per cent in February and the growth of central bank credit dropping into single figures. But a rise in government spending and bank credits in the weeks preceding the referendum are expected to cause inflation to accelerate back towards 30 per cent over the next few months. A rise in the monthly credit emissions and inflation could not come at a worse time for Russia's reformers, who are negotiating a tough credit stance with officials from the International Monetary Fund in order that promised western aid can be released as early as the end of this month. Senior officials from the group of seven industrialised countries say they will require evidence that credit emissions are being controlled and subsidies are being cut before they will release the promised western aid. But G7 officials, desperately searching for signs that President Yeltsin is using the referendum result to press ahead with reforms, have so far been disappointed. Instead, President Yeltsin has appeared to dilute the government's radical content by appointing two first deputy prime ministers without radical credentials, which has tilted the balance in the cabinet in favour of the conservatives. An increasingly gloomy Mr Fyodorov wrote last Friday in the newspaper Izvestia that the two weeks since the referendum endorsed radical economic reforms had been wasted. The government was taking no action to close ailing state-owned enterprises while the central bank was continuing to supply the credit to keep them going. 'For instance, the level of subsidies to the coal industry are at least two trillion roubles,' Mr Fyodorov wrote. 'At the same time everybody recognises the need to close down dozens of inefficient coal mines but nobody is doing anything about it. Is there any country in the world where coal subsidies account for 20 per cent of budget revenues?' Neither side is blameless. Both the central bank and the government find it much easier to accuse each other than face up to the monumental difficulties involved in bringing inflation under control. 'It is very dangerous to make the central bank a scapegoat,' says Mr Khandruyev. 'The central bank should be organising a payments system, stabilising the rouble and managing a tight monetary policy, not be dragged into political confrontation,' he says. 'You can replace Mr Gerashchenko but what will happen tomorrow? Somebody has got to take the burden of responsibility on their shoulders.'</p>

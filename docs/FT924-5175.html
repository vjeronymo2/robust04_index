			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (22): Dream city for film buffs - Paris, with 450 cinemas, offers the world's widest choice of films old and new IF you tell a Parisian that you have been to see a film, their first question will almost certainly be what did you think of it and their second: 'Quel ecran?' - 'Which screen?' Paris is a dream city for any film buff. There is probably a wider choice of movies on show at any time in the French capital's 450 cinemas than anywhere else in the world. The Hollywood blockbusters usually arrive in Paris long before London and lovingly restored prints of even the most obscure art films play to packed houses at the Latin Quarter independents. There are also always a dozen or so retrospectives of famous directors to choose from at the art houses or the legendary Cinematheque. The first step for any film fiend visiting Paris is to buy a copy of one of the listings magazines - Pariscope, L'Officiel des Spectacles or 7 a Paris - to see which films are on, where and when. The information given in these magazines is so basic that they are easily understandable even if you do not speak French. The second step is to check which language the film is being shown in. The initials 'VO,' version originale, mean the movie is in its original language, probably with French sub-titles if it is a foreign film. 'VF,' version francaise, denotes a film in French, so foreign films will have been dubbed, and 'VA,' version anglaise, the English language version of a French film. The next step is to choose which cinema to go to. If you want to see a mainstream movie then any of the commercial cinemas, the Gaumonts or UGCs, along the Champs Elysees ought to offer the basic ingredients of big screens and air-conditioning. But there are so many really spectacular cinemas in Paris that it seems silly not to choose something special. Perhaps the prettiest picture palace of all is La Pagode, the sole surviving cinema in the snooty seventh arrondissement, a Japanese pagoda brought to Paris from Japan in the late 1890s by a director of the Bon Marche department store, originally as his private ballroom. La Pagode was converted into a cinema in 1931 and declared an historical monument by Jack Lang, the French arts minister and an avid cineaste, in 1982. There are now two screens and a small salon du the, which is perfect for tea in the ornamental Japanese garden on summer afternoons. But make sure you go to the main salle, as it has both the bigger screen and the original oriental decor. The smaller salle has a postage stamp screen and an undistinguished interior. Attractive though La Pagode may be, purist Paris film fiends tend to stick to the independent cinemas in the Latin Quarter. Paris is one of the few cities with its own arts house chain, Action, which has nine screens all on the Left Bank. Anyone with an eye for cinema history should appreciate the Studio des Ursulines, the city's oldest arts house dating back to 1926 near the Luxembourg gardens, or Le Champo, one of the rue des Ecoles independents dedicated to Jacques Tati, the cult 1950s comedian. There is also the chi-chi Escurial Panorama on boulevard du Port-Royal, a starlet's paradise with red velveteen seats in the salle and Vaseline-softened star portraits adorning the walls. Paris also offers the very latest in movie modernism. There is La Geode, the Thunderbirds fantasy at Parc de la Villette, a silver dome of a cinema where the seats tilt back so that you can see the film projected onto the dome's ceiling. There is also the shiny new Gaumont Grand Ecran on place d'Italie, the state-of-the-art Gaumont complex which boasts the biggest single screen in the city. But the best modern cinema of all is still the independent Max Linder Panorama on boulevard Poissoniere, an exercise in design excellence, with spacious seats, stunning sound, excellent expresso for before or after the show, and an enormous screen which every self-respecting French film director chooses for their premieres.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> EARLY RESULTS OF SAND BASS TAGGING PROJECT ENCOURAGING TO FISH AND GAME  </P> <P> The results of the year's first migrating sand bass tag-and-release program are  encouraging.  </P> <P> The start of the two-year scientific study was launched on Capt. Russ Izor's  boat, the First String, during five trips in August.  </P> <P> Mac Oliphant, sportfishing biologist with the State Department of Fish and Game  who heads the tagging project, said important information is being gathered.  </P> <P> Oliphant said 730 bass were tagged and released. Twenty-three tags have been  recovered and the fish traveled 10 miles in about 60 days.  </P> <P> Some of the returned tags had marine growth, which he plans to study further.  </P> <P> The question still to be answered is where the fish disappear after spawning  along sandy beaches from Huntington Beach to Santa Monica Bay.  </P> <P> Izor is planning to organize teams of 10 next year to board boats from  Oceanside to Santa Monica to expand the tagging operation, with Oliphant  keeping the data from each trip.  </P> <P> Izor said the First String will be available for the South Bay portion of the  project.  </P> <P> Anglers catching any species of fish with a tag are urged to tell Fish and Game  in Long Beach when and where the fish were caught.  </P> <P> Veteran Redondo Beach fisherman Clyde Rainwater just returned from Loreto, Baja  California, where he said he had one of the best fishing trips of his life.  </P> <P> He caught a sailfish that weighed 120 pounds and a dorado that weighed 38  pounds. In addition, he landed yellowtail and cabrillo.  </P> <P> Three San Pedro anglers on a one-day albacore trip aboard the Producer returned  early Tuesday with an excellent catch: Don Hansen decked a 30-pound bluefin and  Guy Calafeno and Larry Betencourt caught 28- and 29-pound tuna.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches:  </P> <P> Greg Luehmann of Torrance, on a two-day tuna trip aboard the Sharpshooter,  caught the whopper of the week when he brought to gaff a 50-pound yellowfin  tuna. Louis Robinson of Rolling Hills, fishing aboard the Daiwa, hit the  jackpot with a 31-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Jim Davis of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the China Clipper, caught a  28-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Matt Porter of Torrance has won the jackpot two weeks straight aboard the  Redondo Special. Last weekend he caught a 22-pound yellowtail and the previous  week a big white sea bass.  </P> <P> Bob Luna of Long Beach, on the Pacifica at San Clemente Island, caught a  22-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Tina Wang on a half-day trip aboard the Happyman caught a 21 1/2-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Brian Kinkel of West Los Angeles, aboard the Spitfire, caught a 16 1/2-pound  halibut.  </P></p>

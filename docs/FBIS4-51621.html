			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Three Seoul vernacular newspapers on 30  April carry editorials and reports on North Korea's proposal to  replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty with the  United States.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "The Pitfall of a Peace Treaty." Referring  to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea as North  Korea's main goal in nuclear negotiations with the United  States, the editorial says, "the North Korean Foreign Ministry  proposed to the United States that it would hold talks to  discuss the replacement of an armistice agreement with a peace  treaty."    The editorial adds, "North Korea shows its move to actually  link the peace treaty with the settlement of the North Korean  nuclear issue," referring to remarks made by a high-level North  Korean diplomat at his new conference regarding replacing the  armistice agreement with a peace treaty to solve the nuclear  issue.    Noting the U.S. Government's refusal of North Korea's  proposal the editorial says, "it is, however, questionable  whether the United States will continue to hold its present  position in case North Korea concretely proposes to sign the  peace treaty, while promising to resolve the nuclear issue."    Referring to the background of North Korea's nuclear  development, the editorial says, "North Korean politicians are  likely to believe that nuclear weapons can be an economical and  effective means to guarantee their security, and that their  possession of nuclear weapons can delay U.S. intervention in the  case of an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula or,  ultimately, promote the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South  Korea."    Referring to the U.S. forces in South Korea as the main  obstacle to North Korea's strategy for national reunification,  the editorial says that in the next round of U.S.-North Korean,  North Korea will more persistently push ahead with its strategy  to replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO on page 5 carries a 1,000-word  article by reporters Kang Yong-chin and Yu Yong-ku entitled  "Progress in North-South Relations Is the Key To Resolve the  North Korean Nuclear Issue." Referring to the U.S. Government's  new proposal to North Korea at the recent U.S.-North Korean  working-level contacts in New York, the report says, "this  indicates that North-South dialogue should be simultaneously  carried out with the third round of U.S.- North Korean  high-level talks in order to resolve the nuclear issue."    Noting the contents of the U.S. Government's new proposals  indicating that it will decide on the suspension of the Team  Spirit joint military exercise only if progress has been made in  North- South dialogue, the report says the United States seems  to believe that the North Korean nuclear issue cannot be  ultimately resolved if no progress has been made in North-South  dialogue.    Referring to the U.S. Government's "emphasis" on North-South  dialogue in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and to  North Korea's proposal to replace the armistice agreement with a  peace treaty, the report says, "there is a difference between  the two countries' proposals: That is, North Korea has put  forward an additional proposal, which has nothing to do with the  settlement of the nuclear issue, while the United States has  concentrated every effort to resolving the issue."    Referring to the possibility that the U.S. Government will  improve relations with North Korea to resolve the nuclear issue  and to North Korea's using the nuclear issue card as leverage to  maintain its system and to promote its economy, the report says,  "it is, therefore, possible that such proposals by the U.S.  Government may create a more complicated situation in resolving  the nuclear issue."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO on page 2 carries a 200-word report  entitled "The United States Has Expressed a Negative Attitude  Toward North Korea's Proposal for the Replacement of the  Armistice Agreement With a Peace Treaty." Referring to the U.S.  Government's negative position on the North Korean proposal, the  report says (Christine Shelly), vice spokeswoman of the U.S.  Department of State, said that the armistice agreement is still  in effect and that the U.S. is not aware of any moves concerning  North Korean military deployment and that in dialogue with North  Korea, the U.S. has "clearly taken necessary steps to hold the  third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks."    The report concludes, "the spokeswoman stressed that she  does  not believe that there is any direct relation between the  armistice agreement and the North Korean nuclear issue."</p>

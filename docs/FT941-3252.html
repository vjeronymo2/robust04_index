			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Paraguay peasants in protest Paraguayan peasants have staged the biggest demonstration in the capital Asuncion since President Juan Carlos Wasmosy took office seven months ago. The peasants demanded land reform and protested at low prices for cotton, one of their staple products. About 15,000-20,000 peasants crammed into one of the capital's main squares in front of the Congress building on Tuesday, while their leader, Mr Alfonso Cohene, met opposition leaders to demand the expropriation of unproductive land. He also demanded government subsidies to offset the decline in cotton prices. The peasants were unable to petition President Wasmosy because he was on an official visit to Brazil. No one was reported hurt in the protest, despite police efforts to prevent protesters reaching Asuncion. Last month police clashed several times with peasants in the interior of the country after protesters blocked roads and occupied farmland owned by wealthy landowners, including one property owned by a senior member of the ruling Colorado party. Over half of Paraguay's population of 4.5m lives in the countryside, often in great poverty. Demands for land reform have always been an important issue, although the 35-year regime of former President Alfredo Stroessner crushed simmering opposition.</p>

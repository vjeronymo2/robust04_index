			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL THE BOWL GAMES;  </P> <P> HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> Palomar 21, Ventura 20 -- Quarterback Scott Barrick, a sophomore from Fallbrook  High who left the San Diego State program last spring, led the Comets to the  comeback win at Balboa Stadium. It was Palomar's first bowl appearance in its  45-year history.  </P> <P> It was a happy day for the Palomar (7-4) players, but the Comets' Canadian  kicker, Lino Persi, was more than just happy. Persi, the 5-foot-10 freshman who  kicked the winning 38-yard field goal with 1:56 remaining, was just plain  relieved.  </P> <P> Trailing, 20-18, five minutes earlier, Persi had missed badly on a 27-yard  field goal attempt after the Comets, sparked by Barrick's completions of 29, 27  and seven yards, had driven 66 yards in nine plays.  </P> <P> Persi got a second chance, though. Taking over at his own 20, Barrick completed  passes of 34 and 25 yards to wide receiver Chris Chiarappa to reach Ventura's  21. The drive stalled, so on fourth down, Persi kicked the winning field goal.  </P> <P> For Ventura (7-4), it was perplexing to see a game that it had led for 58  minutes slip away in the last two. The Pirates had leads of 7-0 and 17-15 after  the first and second quarters, and were ahead, 20-18, going into the fourth.  </P> <P> Only 74 of Palomar's 459 yards in total offense came by running. Barrick  completed 33 of 53 passes for 385 yards and was intercepted twice. His favorite  targets were tight end Eric Hansen (15 catches for 162 yards and touchdowns of  41 and 7 yards) and Chiarappa (16 catches for 114 yards). KIM Q. BERKSHIRE  </P></p>

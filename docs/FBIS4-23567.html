			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The government and UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] negotiating teams are still  discussing the swearing in of UNITA members of parliament. The  government has submitted a new document on this issue. Today's  session was only between the negotiators. The mediator was not  present. The negotiators failed to reach an agreement, but a  meeting of heads of negotiating teams is scheduled for tomorrow.    Meanwhile, UNITA today reacted to the government proposal on  the organization's participation in the governing of Angola.  UNITA's response was presented to Alioune Blondin Beye, UN  special representative in Angola and is already in the  government delegation's hands.    Also today, UNITA issued an official statement in Lusaka,  saying it fully accepts the government's proposal on  participation in government. In terms of national  reconciliation, the government has offered the following posts  to UNITA: four ministries, seven deputy ministries, three  provincial governments, seven deputy provincial governments, 30  municipality administrations, 35 deputy municipality  administrations, 75 communal administrations, and six diplomatic  missions. In the statement read by Information Secretary Jorge  Valentim, UNITA says it accepts all that, but asks the  government to include the government of Huambo Province.    The government has not yet reacted officially, but confirmed  it has received UNITA's response demanding Huambo province's  government and the legitimization of districts occupied by the  force of arms.    [Luanda Radio Nacional in Portuguese at 1900 GMT on 8 June  broadcasts a similar report saying "the statement released by  UNITA in Lusaka this afternoon does not reflect the reality. A  source close to the talks says UNITA has accepted the overall  number but not the localities proposed by the government. The  source gave the example of municipal and communal  administrations, as well as diplomatic missions. The source  said UNITA only wants to impress the international public  opinion. In practice the organization wants to force the  government to legitimize the areas it occupies militarily."]</p>

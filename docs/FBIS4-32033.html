			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [M. Zurovac report: "We Reject Blackmail"] </F>   [Text] The talks between the delegations of the Republic  of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and Croatia that were supposed to be  held in Plitvice were postponed and it is still uncertain as to  whether they are going to be held at all. The Croatian  delegation had not arrived by last night. Following this  (un)expected course of events, RSK President Milan Martic has  stated for VECERNJE NOVOSTI the following:    "The venue is not contentious. We have demonstrated maximum  cooperativeness and flexibility, something Croatia had obviously  not counted on. Their behavior and request for support from the  international community and allies confirm that they were caught  by surprise and that they do not want to come to Plitvice. They  are evidently not in the mood to negotiate, as they are  fervently seeking the help of their allies in order again to  accuse the Serbian side and show that the war option is  unavoidable."  <H5>  Substantive Obstacles </H5>   "We are patiently waiting," Martic said, "because there is  no  alternative to the peaceful settlement of the problem. Croatia  has found an 'excuse' in journalists and resorted to ultimatums,  demanding their sponsors to exert pressure on us. We will not  accept any ultimatums. We enjoy the support of our assembly,  government, and the RSK people."    In response to the question whether the talks would resume  in  the course of the day, Martic said:    "As far as we are concerned, they could resume. I have sent  a written message to David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg with  regard to the message sent to the RSK leadership by Enrique  Agillar, coordinator of the civil sector. The message, which  had allegedly been sent by Owen and Stoltenberg, but not signed  by them, refers to procedural and substantive obstacles to the  negotiations in Plitvice. However, whether they are procedural  or substantive, the consequences of the message are absolutely  political.    "Croatia was not sent a message with the identical content.  The message states that the answer regarding the acceptance or  rejection of the talks be sent via Agillar in Knin. We do not  believe that Croatia will send its reply to Geneva via Knin,  which means that the Croatian side was sent a different message  or not sent one at all."  <H5>  Wrong Order </H5>   Martic also claims that the agreement that the agenda be set  at the very beginning of talks had not been respected. Instead,  the message sent to the RSK already contained the priority  issues that should be discussed. The first three of the total  of five issues were exclusively in the interest of Croatia (a  set of measures concerning the supply of electric power and  water, high voltage network, and oil pipes). The RSK was thus  put in an unequal position. Point 5, concerning UN Security  Council Resolution 820, makes it clear that the blockade of the  RSK is not going to be lifted, but only perhaps gradually  moderated. In other words, the RSK would be enabled to trade  within Croatia.    "The agreement that one Croat journalist and one photo  reporter be present in Plitvice was not respected either,"  Martic said. "Instead, the RSK was given the ultimatum to allow  five journalists in. The rescheduling of the start of the  meeting for 1600 [1400 GMT] suggests that the Croatian  delegation wanted to spend the night at Plitvice, which  contravenes previous agreements. The message also says that a  delegation could include more than five members, which was the  original maximum. The agreement that the delegations' cost  would be borne by the international conference on the former  SFRY was also annulled and replaced with a clause that the costs  would be shared by the two delegations. It is totally incorrect  to make the arrival of Owen and Stoltenberg in Knin conditional  on the agreement that the next round of talks be held on 30 June.    "At the same time, Croatian politicians' public speeches and  the media campaign have disturbed the atmosphere concerning the  negotiations to the extent that they have become impossible to  hold. The inflexible statements by Hrvoje Sarinic [chief  Croatian negotiator] have caused much disturbance among the  Serbian people in Krajina, who do not like anyone setting them  conditions.    "The negotiations are of interest for both countries,"  Martic  said at the end, "and we believe that the cochairmen of the  peace conference will invest extra effort to convince the  Croatian side of the necessity of continuing the dialogue."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Skopje's `Victory'"] </F>   [Text] A three-year cycle on the issue of Skopje closed  with the recognition of the little state by the United States in  a very bad way, for our country. Now is not the time to point  out and assign blame for the mistakes which, to a great extend,  caused the current development in the issue.    Anyway, it has been stressed many times in this column that  all our political parties, either in the government or  opposition, are equally responsible for the current situation.    Recalling the handling of the Skopje issue is particularly  harmful today. First, because it keeps the Skopje issue on the  level of unproductive and disorienting disputes among the  political parties. Second, because the next phase of the issue  is the most critical one since it will definitely lead to a  certain "solution" to the issue. Consequently, this phase calls  for a new national policy that will be free of past mistakes.    In order to correctly draw this new Greek policy, it is  necessary to examine the current development from Skopje's point  of view. The leaders of the little state may, at this time,  feel the satisfaction of a victory. But what is this victory  composed of? It means recognition by the international  community as a state entity, but with a temporary name. As a  result, the name chosen by Skopje is still negotiable. Of  course this rarely happens in world history, but it is not the  first time.    Therefore, Skopje's leaders should know that their victory  in  the battle for the name, which they fought for three years, is  not at all final. However, beyond this battle, which continues,  Skopje has to fight the real war of its survival as a state  entity. This war is not won by capitalizing on some  international coincidences, or by capitalizing on occasional  diplomatic expediencies. In order to support and reinforce the  little state's atrophic capabilities, there must be permanent  and stable props in the nearby geopolitical area to safeguard  its territorial integrity, overcome the congenital hazards born  of its racial diversity and create a basic, political, economic  and social structure that will allow its survival.    Mr. Gligorov and those around him know well that only  Greece,  in the Balkans, can offer this substantial--not  typical--"certificate of existence" to Skopje. If they have not  understood this reality, all the worse for them.    Based on these facts, our country, too, should decide its  future moves. It has nothing to loose by returning to the  dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations, after Skopje  accepts the conditions for "restoration of confidence" set by  the international community. So, let discussion for the overall  solution of the issue, including the issue of Skopje's name,  take place at the United Nations. Following de jure recognition  of its permanent name, Skopje should make sure to secure what  has been mentioned above and overcome the conditions that make  its de facto existence uncertain and temporary.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / New Polish cabinet eases IMF doubts THE NEW Polish government, headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka, appears to have restored Poland's credibility with the International Monetary Fund, despite a much higher than projected budget deficit for this year. An IMF team, led by Mr Michel Deppler, was 'impressed by the package of government policies which represent a substantial attempt to get to grips with its serious problems,' said Mr Mark Allen, head of the fund's Warsaw office. The IMF suspended disbursements on its original Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 850m) three-year extended loan facility a year ago after Poland failed to meet a series of performance targets. But the new government's refusal to be stampeded into wage concessions by the recent wave of strikes, and its plans to raise new taxes and cut social spending, have given substance to its pledges to cut next year's budget deficit to around 5.5 per cent from an expected 8 per cent this year. The IMF team leaves Warsaw today after paving the way for a new lending agreement during a week of talks with government officials. A full Fund mission is expected in Warsaw next month to negotiate a new 18-month stand-by agreement.</p>

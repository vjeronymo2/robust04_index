			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Wary eye on UK rates UK markets will open nervously today as traders watch for signs of a possible rise in UK interest rates, writes Philip Gawith. Although most observers were not expecting higher rates, a minority thought yesterday's monthly monetary meeting, between the UK chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England, might result in a decision to raise rates over the next week. There was no sign in the cash or futures markets that higher rates were expected, and sterling held steady, with the trade weighted index closing at 78.6 from 78.5. Elsewhere, the D-Mark maintained its firm tone in Europe, with the Italian lira slipping back to finish in London at L1,019, from L1,016, on worries about Italy's fiscal position. The dollar traded in a narrow range but was helped by comments from a Bundesbank official suggesting German rates might still fall. It closed at DM1.5486 from DM1.5426. The start of trade talks between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade negotiator, and Mr Ryutara Hashimoto, the Japanese trade minister, had little effect on the dollar, which finished at Y98.965 from Y98.695. Contrary to the views of almost all economists, sterling futures markets continued to discount a sharp tightening in UK interest rates. At the beginning of the year, December short sterling reflected three-month rates at 4.90 per cent. By the close of business yesterday, that had climbed to 6.45 per cent. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, said that revised expectations about the level of rates have been accompanied by a change in the slope of the sterling yield curve. In January the September and December Liffe contracts were both priced at 95-10. This slope (the spread between the two contract prices) steadily widened to a peak of 91 basis points on August 23, as worries about rising base rates deepened. Last night the spread was 84 basis points. Mr Parsons said he 'could not see rates rising at anything like the pace that is being discounted'. Even if rates were to rise by as much as 100 basis points, this would not match the current pessimism. Indeed, futures prices could rise if rates are tightened; that was the recent experience in both the US and Australia. Analysts said the reasons for the gloom probably had something to do with markets being unable to shake off the past. Mr Julian Callow, economist at Kleinwort Benson, commented: 'The key factor that the short sterling contract does not yet appear to have accepted is that the 1990s will not simply be a rerun of the 1980s. By very virtue of the huge explosion of in household indebtedness that took place then, it is effectively impossible for a consumer credit-driven boom to recur.' Markets, however, appear to be taking a 'we will believe it when we see it attitude'. Another relevant factor is that the market does not appear to have distinguished between the US recovery and the UK one. The US economy is growing above its trend rate - not so in the UK - and real rates were close to zero when the tightening started, compared to UK rates which are about 3 per cent. It is not only UK futures markets that are pessimistic. In Germany yesterday, three-month money was trading around 5 per cent, compared to 5.19 per cent being discounted by the December Euromark future. In France, three-month money at 5.6 per cent falls short of the 6.17 per cent being discounted by the December PIBOR contract. Trade in UK futures yesterday was fairly buoyant, with December short sterling having more than 46,000 lots dealt and settling 10 basis points up at 93.55. The September contract closed at 94.39 from 94.34. In the cash markets, three-month sterling LIBOR eased to 5 15/32 from 5 1/2 . The Bank of England provided Pounds 130m late assistance to UK money markets. Earlier it had supplied Pounds 42m, at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 450m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 5/8 and 6 1/2 per cent. The dollar received a brief fillip from the comments of Mr Hans-Juergen Krupp, a Bundesbank council member, who told The European newspaper that he saw room for rate reductions. These gains were later unwound as Mr Krupp's reasoning left traders baffled. Later, Mr Edward Kelley, a US Federal Reserve governor, gave dollar bulls something more substantial to chew on when he told Reuters that the Fed could not afford to be lax in achieving its inflationary goals. This helped the dollar improve to Y99.68 and DM1.5540 in New York before ending at Y99.45 and DM1.5505. The issue of a two-tier Europe continued to occupy markets, in the absence of important data releases. Numerous politicians stepped into the fray, with German ministers appearing to move back from the idea of a multi-tiered Europe, and Mr John Major, the British prime minister, singing a similar tune. Analysts said renewed talk about criteria had reminded the market that there were some countries which had public finance problems.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mu Haiping (1970 3189 1627): "Analysis of Direct </F> Foreign Investment Problems, Trends"]    [Text] 1. Analysis Of Basic Trends    Direct foreign investment in China has soared in the past  two  years, resulting in another surge in the utilization of foreign  investment, the second since the 1980's, and ushering in a new  era in foreign investment. A number of new trends is detectable.    1) Scale Of Investment    In terms of the overall scale of foreign investment, 40,264  projects were approved nationwide in all of 1992 with a total  negotiated value of $57.51 billion, while the amount actually  invested was $11.3 billion, up 180 percent, 280 percent, and 60  percent, respectively, from a year ago. The rapid increase in  the overall scale of foreign investment has been accompanied by  an increase in the scale of individual projects. According to  preliminary statistics, the average negotiated investment of a  project in 1992 was $1.2 million, compared to $900,000, the  average four years ago. In the three provinces of Jiangsu,  Guangdong, and Shandong, all leaders in the utilization of  foreign capital, there were 254, 200, and 152 large and  medium-sized projects, respectively, each with a price tag over  $10 million. The simultaneous expansion of the overall scale of  investment and the scale of individual projects is one of the  salient features of the latest surge in foreign investment in  China.    The major causes of the surge in foreign investment are not  external but have to do with changes in China's internal  economic climate. While economic growth in the rest of the world  remains sluggish, trade imbalances widen, and funds are short in  recent years, the Chinese economy has been racing ahead full  steam, its economic system beginning to operate like a socialist  market economy, its large- and medium-sized enterprises  transforming their operating mechanism with despatch, its other  economic sectors booming, and its foreign trade flourishing. All  of that has vastly improved China's investment climate, further  tapped its market potential, and created even better conditions  for foreign investment.    2) Investment Mix    Guided by the adjustment of the nation's industrial policy,  the composition of foreign investments also changed  substantially in 1992. Foreign investment in the infrastructure,  in basic industries, in capital- and technology-intensive  industries, in technological transformation, and in the tertiary  sector, including banking, commerce, tourism, and real estate,  rose proportionately, thus broadening the area open to foreign  capital. In the geographical distribution of foreign investment,  the trend is for foreign capital to move north and west. The  coastal economic region, anchored by Pudong, Shanghai; the  economic zone surrounding Bohai, with its relatively  sophisticated industrial structure; and many provincial capitals  and border areas have become the new hot spots for foreign  investors. All in all, although the generalization that foreign  investment is concentrated in the southeastern coastal region  and in processing industries remains basically valid, we can see  trends toward dispersal and diversification.    Changes in the direction and composition of foreign  investment are a function of the implementation of China's  across-the-board open policy, the decision by the government to  ease restrictions on foreign investment in some areas, and, most  important, on shifts in comparative advantage at home. Already  China has set up a whole range of foreign investment  preferential zones, including special economic zones, economic  and technical development zones, opened ports along the coast,  rivers, and borders, economic development zones, and tax  protection zones; and further delegated the power to examine and  approve foreign investment projects, the result of which is to  narrow the comparative advantage of one locality vis-a-vis the  next in policy power. Changes in the costs of capital goods like  labor, land, and resource, in particular, have forced a number  of localities which have been major destinations of foreign  capital to accelerate industrial upgrading and outward  dispersal. Hence the objective trend of an increase in scale  leading to structural upgrading.    3) Forms of Investment    Of all direct foreign investment in China in 1992,  Sino-foreign joint ventures accounted for $6.1 billion, or 55  percent; Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures, $2.1 billion,  or 18 percent; wholly foreign-funded enterprises, $2.5 billion,  22 percent; and others (including cooperative development,  international leasing, compensation trade, processing and  assembling), $500 million, or 5 percent. If we look at the  various forms of investment one by one, Sino-foreign joint  ventures first constituted over 50 percent of total investments  in 1987 and have always fluctuated between 50 and 55 percent  ever since. Wholly foreign-funded enterprises accounted for a  minor share of total investment throughout the 1980's and have  shown notable growth only after 1990, rising from less than 10  percent in 1989 to 25 percent. The absolute value of  Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures consistently hovered  around $700 million between 1986 and 1991. As the overall scale  of foreign investment expanded, however, its share of total  investment headed downward only to rebound sharply in 1992,  climbing more than 178 percent. Changes in the other forms of  investment have been insignificant because they account for a  tiny share of all investments.    The above analysis shows that there are three major forms of  direct foreign investment in China, namely the Sino-foreign  joint venture, Sino-foreign contractual joint venture, and  wholly foreign-funded enterprise, which between them make up 75  percent of all foreign investment. At present, foreign-funded  enterprises in the north are more likely to be Sino-foreign  joint ventures, while foreign investment along the southeastern  coast typically takes the form of wholly foreign-funded  enterprises. This also reflects on an objective level the  differences between north and south China in economic structure,  institutional characteristics, and degree of openness.    4) Results of Investment    China utilizes direct foreign investment in order to expand  the scale of capital formation, raise the enterprises' product  standard and technical level, increase foreign exchange-earning  exports, enhance national income, and learn managerial and  administrative experiences. Judging from the present situation,  it has achieved these objectives to varying degrees despite much  unevenness in development.    To begin with, as its scale expands, direct foreign  investment is playing an increasingly important role in  supplementing fixed assets investment in all society. Actually  utilized foreign capital accounted for 3 percent or so of all  social fixed assets in the 1980's, rose to 4.5 percent in 1991,  and exceeded 8 percent in 1992. Secondly, the three kinds of  enterprises either partially or wholly foreign-funded that are  already in business have filled part of the void in China's  lineup of industry, boosted the upgrading of the industrial  structure, and greatly narrowed the technical gap between China  and the world. The southern Chinese coast, where the  manufacturing industry used to be relatively weak, is now the  nation's leader in some processing technologies, product design,  and other areas. By attracting foreign funds and importing  foreign technology, 63 percent of the technical equipment in  Beijing's industrial enterprises have now reached the  international standards in the late 1980's, leaping through 30  years of technological progress in less than eight years. The  utilization of foreign capital has striking effects in the  technical advances China has made in optical fiber and cable  communications equipment, automated instruments and meters,  color kinescope, elevator, large-scale integrated circuitry,  microcomputer, automobile, new building materials, and drugs.  Thirdly, the three kinds of enterprises that are either  partially or wholly foreign-funded have spurred the development  of China's foreign trade. In 1992, they accounted for 26 percent  of the nation's total exports and imports, or $41.8 billion, an  increase of 51 percent, including $17.4 billion in exports and  $26.4 billion in imports, 20 percent and 44 percent,  respectively, of China's total exports and imports. Finally,  following the expansion of the production scale of the three  kinds of enterprises, the state is also collecting more  revenue--$10.7 billion in 1992, up 53 percent over  1991--generated by foreign economic activities. Meanwhile,  employment at the three kinds of enterprises has also been  climbing year after year, accompanied by a notable increase in  workers' wages. As of late 1992, almost 140,000 people were on  the payroll of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises in  Beijing, their per capita wage exceeding that of their  counterparts in domestic enterprises of the same industry by  more than 30 percent. Xiamen Shi has adopted regulations  explicitly mandating that wages in the three kinds of  enterprises exceed those in comparable Chinese enterprises by  more than 20 percent. The three kinds of enterprises have become  a key avenue for workers in pursuit of higher incomes. Then  there are the many intangible ways in which the three kinds of  enterprises have been a boon. With their management model based  on the market economy and depending on their source of capital,  they provide a good example for Chinese enterprises trying to  transform their operating mechanism. By serving as a bridge  linking the domestic and international markets and disseminating  information, the three kinds of enterprises are helping to shape  public thinking and mode of conduct.    2. Major Problems    Substantial progress has been made in the utilization of  direct foreign investment. However, as the national economy  develops and the macroeconomic situation changes, the further  development of the three kinds of enterprises still faces many  problems that need to be worked out.    1) While the scale of foreign investment has expanded  rapidly, the composition of investment is less than sound.  According to statistics, it was the industrial sector soaking up  foreign capital in a big way that accounted for the sharp jump  in the utilization of foreign capital since the 1980's. In 1985,  the negotiated amount of direct foreign investment was $6.333  billion of which $2.384 billion, or 37.6 percent, went to  industry. Corresponding figures in 1990 were $6.986 billion  $5.943 billion and 85 percent, respectively; and in 1991,  $12.422 billion, $10.055 billion, and 80.9 percent,  respectively. Within the industrial sector itself, direct  foreign investment is concentrated in labor-intensive processing  and manufacturing industries. This investment pattern changed  somewhat in 1992, with the tertiary sector gaining strength  relative to total investments, but there has been no basic shift  in the overall situation.    According to the conventional development theory of the  utilization of direct foreign investment, it is necessary for  the production sector to dominate the investment mix. However,  two points are noteworthy. First, the mix of foreign investment  should be compatible with the stage of economic development the  country is in at a given time. In other words, when foreign  investment reaches a certain scale, other fields should  gradually be opened up and made more attractive to foreign  capital. The comprehensive planning capability of the three  kinds of enterprises should be enhanced. Second, the mix of  foreign investment must not be considered in isolation from the  constraints of the domestic economic structure. At the present  stage, most of such constraints are found in the basic  industries and the infrastructure. Make use of foreign capital  to relieve the bottlenecks instead of pursuing ill-considered  development that will wind up exacerbating the bottlenecks.  Direct foreign investment in the processing industry these days  is increasing too rapidly, objectively requiring us to further  broaden the scope of investment. In particular, we should step  up measures to make the infrastructure and basic industries more  attractive to foreign investors.    It is also worth noting that of all direct foreign  investment  in traditional industries, most goes to the finished products of  the processing and assembling industries while relatively little  goes to capital goods and intermediate products. We can get a  glimpse of this pattern from the imports and exports of the  three kinds of enterprises that are either partially or wholly  foreign-funded. In 1992, those enterprises ran up a deficit of  $9 billion in their foreign trade. Most of their imports were  machinery, equipment, raw materials, and parts and components.  This also shows that China's utilization of foreign capital is  concentrated in downstream industries with the upstream  industries lagging in development.    2) While foreign-funded projects are hotly pursued, there  are  no coordinated measures to manage a project after the deal is  clinched.    Against a backdrop of runaway growth, every locality  strapped  for funds looks to foreign capital to close the gap in its  funding sources. At one point all jurisdictions were scrambling  to introduce preferential policies to attract foreign capital  and delegate power to manage foreign projects. In a certain  sense, preferential treatment and delegation are inherent in  China's drive to open itself up to the outside world, attract  foreign capital, and advance economic development. But this does  not mean that we should go easy on management and pursue  projects to the exclusion of everything else. In our  investigations, we discovered there is indeed a tendency  everywhere to scramble for projects. Some even set a specified  number of foreign-funded projects as target to be fulfilled by  the levels below. How well they meet the targets has become the  yardstick by which their performance is judged.    Major problems that occur after a deal is struck are:    First, while the amount of foreign investment negotiated is  large, the sum actually realized is on the low side. Many  contracts are drawn up and signed, but the percentage that opens  for business is not high enough. In the Beijing area, for  instance, direct foreign investment amounted to $8.11 billion on  paper by 1992, but only $3.95 billion, or 48.2 percent, were  actually realized. During the same period, Beijing approved a  total of 3,769 projects involving the three kinds of enterprises  either partially or wholly foreign-funded. In reality, a mere  942 companies opened for business, for a business start-up rate  of 25 percent. In Fujian Province, only 30 percent of the three  kinds of foreign-funded enterprises were fully capitalized in  accordance with the terms of their contracts. In Zhejiang  Province, the contract investment compliance rate is just 45.7  percent or so.    Furthermore, land is being occupied illegally and there are  no economies of scale. To attract foreign investors, some  localities have been treating land as a cheap resource, setting  land prices in development zones at excessively low levels.  Farmland is being taken in a big way and the interests of local  peasants are not properly safeguarded. Some localities have even  introduced investment incentive policies under which an investor  is free to "decide its own project and pick the plant site."  There is no overall planning. Many small-time and highly  opportunistic foreign investors take advantage of policy  loopholes at every turn to profit themselves. The result is a  scale of operations that is highly uneconomical with no external  economies.    In addition, losses are mounting and tax under-reporting and  evasion are widespread. By 1991, over 2,500 enterprises either  wholly or partially foreign-funded were in operation in Fujian.  Of these 2,500 enterprises, more than 1,200, or 48 percent, were  losing money to the tune of 400 million yuan in all. By 1992,  2,338 foreign-funded enterprises had opened for business in  Zhejiang, of which 37 percent were unprofitable, their combined  losses amounting to almost 100 million yuan. Meanwhile, 50  percent of the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises in  Beijing were losing money. There are various reasons for the  unprofitability of foreign-funded enterprises, some  policy-related, some having to do with the way they are operated  and managed. However, a good number of these enterprises claim  to be losing money but are actually making a profit. By  falsifying their books and importing at high prices and  exporting at low prices, they hope to evade paying taxes. In an  audit on 1,311 enterprises either partially or wholly  foreign-funded, the tax department in Shanghai identified 447  tax cheaters, or 34 percent.    3) The importation of "hardware" is stressed, but the  importation of "software" is neglected. In particular, there are  no mechanisms for absorption, assimilation, innovation, and  dissemination.    A key objective of the utilization of direct foreign  investment is to import advanced foreign technology and  introduce into China advanced foreign managerial experience.  Only when such "software" is mastered can we consider the  utilization of foreign capital to have basically achieved its  objective. Judging from the reality in the development of the  three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, the infusion of  foreign capital has indeed introduced into the country a  considerable amount of advanced machinery and equipment.  However, most of this equipment consists of processing and  assembling production lines. Apparently what we have been  getting is the final product, not technology or management. This  leads to a host of problems. First, it increases the import  content of the final product. To a large extent, it is our  desire to increase exports and earn more foreign exchange that  lies behind the development of the three kinds of foreign-funded  enterprises. But since both capital goods and intermediate  products consist heavily of imports, they in effect cause us to  spend more foreign exchange, thus lowering the  foreign-exchange-earning rate of exports. Second, it multiplies  the costs of attracting a project. Without absorption and  assimilation, it is very hard to avoid project duplication and  excessive competition in the utilization of foreign capital. To  facilitate the effective application of "hardware," we are also  forced to increase the importation of related materials and  parts correspondingly. Third, it lowers the efficiency with  which hardware is applied. Advanced machinery and equipment need  to be backed up by advanced management. In China, the operating  mechanism of enterprises is less than perfect and the level of  enterprise management is low. If the development of the three  kinds of foreign-funded enterprises cannot break new ground in  these areas, then we would have trouble realizing the benefits  of the utilization of foreign capital. The dissociation between  technology and management may even cause an enterprise to lose  money and go bankrupt.    4) The distribution of the three kinds of foreign-funded  enterprises is over-concentrated and the geographical division  of labor does not make much sense.    By and large the three kinds of enterprises are  over-concentrated in south and east China, which is consistent  with the objective reality of uneven economic development in  China. But this is not the only problem. Even more serious, the  three kinds of enterprises everywhere share a basically similar  structural distribution. As power is delegated, moreover,  development zones and opened zones, with their heavy  concentration of foreign capital, also tend to converge  functionally. Local characteristics are being overlooked and the  lines of division of labor are being blurred, problems that will  only continue to worsen.    The adverse consequences of this kind of regional division  of  labor are twofold. On the one hand, there is no coordination  between one region and the next when it comes to development. On  the contrary, they impose a blockade against one another and  engage in cut-throat competition. For the most minor local  benefits, they would launch a project helter-skelter, without  considering whether it is within the capability of the  macroeconomy. Hence the overcapacity in some foreign-funded  enterprises, worsening the bottleneck effects in the  macroeconomy as a whole. On the other hand, it has prevented the  many potential strengths of the localities from being tapped.  The interior abounds with resources, but since only a tiny  trickle of funds makes its way into the interior and it lacks  processing capability, its edge in resources has not been  converted into a strong industry that will back up the  development of the entire economy. Furthermore, although the  heavy and chemical industries of north China are a leader in the  nation, the absence of funds to finance technological  transformation and the lack of foreign capital to overhaul the  mechanism have prevented them from generating as much profits as  they should, which, in turn, has complicated their effort to  adjust the industrial structure or upgrade the export mix more  successfully.    The nonspecialization tendency of the three kinds of  enterprises in the various economic regions may exacerbate the  inter-regional development imbalance, complicating industrial  development planning and macroeconomic management, and possibly  enable foreign investors to "fish among troubled waters."    3. Future Strategic Choices    All in all China's macroeconomic environment has now changed  enormously. Under the stimulus of the market mechanism, the  national economy has been growing by leaps and bounds, new  industry hot spots have been springing up endlessly, traditional  industries are coming under mounting competitive pressure, and  the existing infrastructure and basic industries fall far short  of meeting the requirements of opening China to the outside  world. Changes in foreign economic relations too seem to have  been just as striking. To speed up its accession to GATT, for  instance, China has taken a number of new steps that would bring  itself more in line with international practices in such areas  as market accessibility, intellectual property rights,  imports-exports management, national treatment, and service  trade. Meanwhile, new moves are constantly being made to prepare  a coherent body of laws pertaining to foreign economic  relations, overhaul government functions, and improve foreign  capital service organizations. It was precisely against this  backdrop that the utilization of direct foreign investment in  China entered a period of runaway expansion. How should we  review our experience, overcome existing problems, and step up  guidance, regulation, and control to enable it to continue to  grow healthily in a sustained manner in balance with national  economic growth? This is an issue that every quarter should pay  close attention to.    Given the present situation, we believe we should adjust the  way we utilize foreign capital and develop the three kinds of  foreign-funded enterprises from a strategic high ground. Instead  of quantitative growth and extensive management, we should go  after qualitative upgrading and intensive management. Enhance  the economic and social benefits of the utilization of direct  foreign investment across the board and lift the development of  the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises to a new plateau.    1) Based on the changes specific to a particular stage in  the  opening of China, we should replace the unitary strategy of  foreign capital utilization with one that is diversified. There  are three basic points. First, preserve and further the key role  played by labor-intensive processing industry in attracting  foreign capital, expanding exports, and earning foreign  exchange, but take care to improve quality and increase added  value so that the industry performs even better as a source of  accumulation. Second, increase the proportions of direct foreign  investment that go to the infrastructure, basic industry,  technological upgrading, and the tertiary industry. Improve the  industrial distribution of the three kinds of foreign-funded  enterprises as a way of upgrading the industrial structure.  Third, encourage the two-way flow of funds. Localities and  enterprises with the necessary wherewithal should be allowed to  develop multinational operations and set up joint ventures  overseas. Increase the mobility of capital goods to tie in with  the all-out opening of China.    2) Strive to improve the geographical distribution of  foreign  capital even as we adopt a diversification strategy to balance  its industrial distribution. At present the most popular  destinations of foreign investment remain concentrated in the  southeastern coastal region. As the rivers and borders become  more and more open, therefore, foreign investors are poised to  strike out in a northern and western direction. Accordingly, we  should take advantage of this trend and consider offering  liberal preferential policies in the north and the interior so  that the foreign investment fever now centered on the Zhu Jiang  delta, southern Fujian, and the Chang Jiang delta would soon  spread to north China and the interior, with more foreign-funded  enterprises emerging in the backward areas in the 1990's. In the  course of seeking balanced regional development, we should pay  attention to regional characteristics and practice  specialization and division of labor on an economic regional  basis. Make the areas around Bohai and northeastern China the  focus of the "northern push." The development strategy there is  to use the existing edge in chemical industry, heavy industry,  and electrical machinery industry to develop in a big way  export-oriented and capital- or technology-intensive enterprises  that are either partially or wholly foreign-funded, upgrade the  industrial structure, and effect import substitution. [As  published] The development strategy is to rely on central  cities, exploit its ample resources, go all out to make the  region along Chang Jiang and the Gansu-Hainan railroad the focus  of the importation of foreign capital and technology, develop  foreign-funded enterprises of the resource-processing type in  order to enhance China's own resource-supplying capability, and  manufacture capital goods and intermediate articles domestically  to substitute imports.    3) To bring about strategic adjustments in the utilization  of  foreign capital, we should make more extensive use of the  industrial policy as a guide. This essentially means three  things. First, encourage large-scale projects,  technology-intensive projects, and high-added-value projects.  Scale back and perhaps abolish preferential treatments for  low-grade low-end industrial projects in order to make good use  of the policy of utilizing foreign investment. Second, to carry  the industrial policy through, the state may consider gradually  changing the examination and approval of a foreign-funded  project by scale to examination and approval by industry  (product), and cut back on projects in industries that need to  be curbed while thoroughly deregulating those projects in  industries that need to e encouraged. Support may be given at a  policy level to projects that would help ease the bottlenecks  hampering economic development. Evaluation work in the  utilization of foreign capital should put more stress on the  profitability target and quality target. Avoid the tendency  among grassroots units to pursue quantity exclusively through  administrative intervention at cross purposes with the  industrial policy. That way, the development of the three kinds  of foreign-funded enterprises, the construction of development  zones, and the introduction of preferential policies would  become more compatible with the requirements of the industrial  policy.    4) Turning to the methods of foreign investment utilization,  we should concentrate on the Sino-foreign joint venture format.  In particular, we should encourage large and medium-sized state  enterprises to form joint ventures with multinational  corporations. The Sino-foreign joint venture is the one form of  cooperation in the utilization of direct foreign investment  where its management is most amenable to the influence of the  Chinese partner and where the Chinese side can gain access to  technology and managerial experience. Large and medium-sized  state enterprises embody the level of technology and management  direction at home, in the same way that multinational  corporations embody the level of technology and development  direction globally. Accordingly, joint ventures combining the  two can result in the upgrading of foreign-funded enterprises  and make the utilization of foreign capital a more powerful  stimulant of the national economy as a whole. Change the methods  of foreign capital utilization, from small to large, from  low-end to upscale. The idea is to put an end to a pattern of  conduct--short-sighted and speculative--existent in the three  kinds of enterprises, namely "emphasizing importation but  overlooking absorption and assimilation"; accelerate the  transformation of the operating mechanism of large and mid-sized  state enterprises; and give them greater development strength to  open up the international market.    5) Invigorate the management of foreign capital utilization  in the later stage and carry through with the foreign investment  strategy centered on the increase of profitability to the point  where it really matters. On the one hand, simplify and  standardize the examination and approval procedures for the  three kinds of enterprises and improve work efficiency so that  both the Chinese side and its foreign counterpart get the  project off the ground without delay in accordance with the  contract. On the other hand, set a firm date based on the  circumstances of the case by which a foreign funded enterprise  must go into operation. If the enterprise fails to do so, its  business license may be revoked in accordance with the law.  Alternatively, the department in charge may review its  application. A corresponding effort should be made to revise the  pertinent policies, laws, and regulations. Furthermore, where  management policies are discriminatory in nature, for instance,  disparities exist between the preferential policy of one region  and that of another or when the setting of foreign sales ratios  is discriminatory, we should proceed to even up or eliminate the  disparities and gradually achieve national treatment for the  three kinds of enterprises in accordance with international  practice, creating an orderly competitive environment with a  level playing field.    6) Improve the basic climate for attracting foreign  investment and better comprehensive services for the three kinds  of foreign-funded enterprises. Essentially this will involve the  following:    First, set up without delay a unified nation-wide  information  service network which foreign-funded enterprises can tap into  for a fee. The network should provide the enterprises with  information on overseas market movements and on prices of raw  materials and products to help them make the right decisions. It  will also help the Chinese manager familiarize himself with the  situation and effectively prevent the foreign managers of  foreign-funded enterprises from importing at high prices and  exporting at low prices and shifting profits around to avoid  paying taxes.    Second, raise the standard of management and administration  at foreign-funded enterprises. Augment training for Chinese  managerial personnel. On the one hand, we should take pains to  review the managerial experiences and methods of different kinds  of foreign-funded enterprises. Work hard to assimilate and  innovate upon them to benefit tangibly from the utilization of  foreign capital. On the other hand, we should tackle the  improvement of the quality of Chinese managerial personnel as a  basic task in foreign capital utilization. Offer on-the-job  training for the personnel of foreign-funded enterprises in a  variety of ways and at all levels to meet the requirements of  achieving a new high in foreign capital utilization.    Third, accelerate the socialized management of  foreign-funded  enterprises. In areas with a heavy concentration of foreign  capital, in particular, we should create an economy to go with  the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises by doing a good  job in regional planning and social service coordination,  thereby making things more convenient for the three kinds of  foreign-funded enterprises in daily life, health care,  education, and culture.    Fourth, accelerate fiscal reform, financial reform, and  foreign trade reform. Sort out the relations among tax rates,  interest rates, and exchange rates step by step in accordance  with the requirements of the development of a market economy.  Optimize the macroeconomic climate so that foreign-funded  enterprises can operate and do business in a better  institutionalized and statutory environment.

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: France Voting Sunday. The main French right- and left-wing parties and groupings favour political and monetary union, although some of the electorate has been showing increasing scepticism. Both left and right have had their support eaten away by dissidents within their own camp. On the right, the anti-Maastricht list of dissident conservatives has seen support running unexpectedly high at 7-9 per cent. The Socialist list, led by Mr Michel Rocard, has faced even harder competition. First, from that led by Mr Bernard Tapie, nominally an ally and a declared European federalist, but whose only policy is to make youth unemployment illegal. Second, from the 'Bosnia' list led by Mr Leon Schwartzenberg campaigning for an end to the Bosnian Moslems arms embargo. In some polls it has scored the 5 per cent minimum needed to win Euro-seats in France. LIKELY RESULT: Latest polls give the UDF-RPR list of the governing coalition 31-32 per cent. Socialists expected to do badly, with one poll putting support as low as 13.5 per cent, which would be a disastrous start to Mr Rocard's campaign for the presidency next year. The Communists and National Front have polled around 7 and 10 per cent respectively.</p>

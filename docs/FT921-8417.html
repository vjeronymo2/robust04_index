			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Technology: Services grow on branches Barclays, the largest of the UK banks, has launched a six-month trial into a new generation of automatic teller machines which carry out functions previously performed by bank staff. The NCR machines, which include full-colour touch screens, have been installed at nine locations across the UK for customer trials which will last until June and cost Pounds 800,000. The bank will then decide whether to install self-service touch-screen banking in all of its branches. Barclays believes that its trials go further than any other bank has done so far in providing an all-round branch service through ATMs. Customers can get the following services: Personalised information on mortgages or insurance with on-the-spot quotations. Information on their standing orders and direct debits. Travellers cheques and foreign currency. Travel insurance. Customers get access to the system through their cash cards, though anyone can use the terminals to gain information about mortgages and insurance products by answering a series of questions. Each ATM contains a dot-matrix printer and customers are given print-outs of information ranging from bank statements to insurance quotes. The basic cost of each machine is Pounds 12,000, not including software and installation costs. The machines are designed to have as short a turn-around period for each transaction as possible. Andrew Bailey, manager of self-service banking, who is in charge of the trials, says: 'We have been pleasantly surprised by the number of people who try out the services.' Barclays has not given details of the possible roll-out it is planning for the ATMs after June, but the implications for many of its 2,600 branches are far-reaching. The trial is being carried out in small towns such as Selby and Wantage, as well as in London and the home countries.</p>

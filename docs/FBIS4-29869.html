			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  remained far apart on the "framework" insurance talks, and big  compromises are needed to reach an accord before the Group of  Seven (G-7) summit in Naples in July, a Japanese official said  Wednesday [22 June].    The chances of an agreement before the summit are "50-50,"  the Finance Ministry official said when briefing reporters on  the two- day talks that started Tuesday.    The working-level talks which he described as an  agreement-drafting session will continue until midnight, and  both sides are to meet again in Washington next week, the  official said.    "We won't reach agreement today," he said, noting that the  two sides remain "far apart" especially on objective criteria,  Japan's "keiretsu" mutual stockholding business relations and  the "third sector."    Insurance business is one of the three priority areas under  the bilateral talks to create a new trade framework, along with  automobile and auto parts, and Japanese Government procurement  of telecommunications and medical equipment.    "Both sides must compromise," the official said, dismissing  any intention on Japan's part of yielding unilaterally in  seeking agreement in the insurance field before the summit.    On objective criteria, both sides presented their proposals  which were at "the opposite ends" of the definition agreed upon  in May to restart the stalled framework talks, the official said.    The May agreement was to adopt both quantitative and  qualitative yardsticks for each of the negotiation sectors  instead of imposing overall numerical targets.    Regarding the issue of the third sector that combines the  benefits of both nonlife and casualty insurance businesses,  Japan is rejecting U.S. demands for postponement by five years  of Tokyo's lifting of a market ban.    Japan currently allows only foreign-affiliated insurers to  sell third-sector policies but is considering lifting the ban on  Japanese insurers in two years under a law revision scheduled  for submission to the Diet next year for the first time in five  decades.    The third sector is expected to remain on the table "until  the last moment" of an overall accord on the insurance business,  the official said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara, Dec. 6 (AA) -- President Suleyman Demirel  said today that 1994 will hopefully be a year when aggressors  will eventually have some common sense.    He was addressing the heads of foreign missions in Ankara,  for whom he hosted a reception on the occasion of the new year.    Demirel recalled that after the decease of President Turgut  Ozal in 1993 he was elected president and meanwhile, leaders of  leading political parties have also been replaced. [sentence as  received]    Before being elected president, Suleyman Demirel was premier  and leader of the major coalition partner True Path Party.    "All this process took place without hindering the normal  functioning of the government and the daily lives of citizens,  within the Constitution and current legislation," he said.    Demirel went on to say that Turkey faced great problems in  the field of foreign policy in 1993.    "Instability in the Caucasus and the Balkans and terrorist  activities aimed from other regions to Turkey, were the main  issues troubling us.    "However, the Turkish governments which were not influenced  by provocations chose to seek solutions by calling the  international community to enter multifaceted cooperation.    "Turkey has at all times displayed an attitude of compromise  and moderation," Demirel said.    "We hope that 1994 becomes a year which the aggressors  eventually come to common sense, Armenians withdraw from the  Azeri land they invaded, the disputes in Georgia are resolved  and the embargo which creates great grievances for the Iraqi  people ends and efforts to bring peace to the Middle East  finally yield a solution," he added.    "I am aware that the year 1993 had been a very busy one for  you diplomats who endeavoured to follow developments in and  around Turkey. I assure you that the year 1994 will not be  dissapointing for you," he concluded.</p>

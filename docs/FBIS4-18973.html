			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 11 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin on Monday [11 April] said that Turkey has agreed with  Israel to shoulder the leadership for setting up an organization  similar to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE) for the Middle East.    Cetin was speaking to reporters at a joint press conference  with his Israeli counterpart Shim'on Peres, at the conclusion of  Turkey-Israel official talks.    He said during the talks both countries have agreed on  Turkey's more active participation to the Middle East peace  process.    Cetin also said that visa applications will not be required  for Turkish citizens who want to visit Israel, adding that  Israel will not ask for a visa from Turkish businessmen or from  those visiting the country for cultural reasons.    Stressing the existence of a great cooperation potential  between the two countries, Cetin said agreements on incitement  and protection of investments, prevention of double-taxation and  technological cooperation will be concluded at the soonest.    Peres said that Turkey is a country that can play an  important role in many ways for the future of the Middle East,  adding his country gives great importance to its relations and  ties with Ankara.    He said that the fact that Turkey is a secular and  democratic  Moslem country at the same time having very good relations with  Israel gives it the possibility of being a "bridge" between  different cultures.    Peres also underlined the possibility for cooperation with  Turkey and the United States for investments in the Central  Asian republics.    He said that Turkey is the only country with enough water  for  its needs in a region where water has become as important as  oil, adding countries such as his own which are in need of water  could buy from Turkey and he has discussed this topic with Cetin.    On the Israeli pullout from Jericho and the West Bank  according to an agreement signed earlier between the PLO and  Israel, Peres said this would only be completed by the end of  the month.    Answering a reporter's question on the use of Turkish waters  for meeting the needs of the Middle East region, Cetin said  there exists a number of possibilities.    The first posibility is the use of the Manavgat river in the  Mediterranean Province of Antalya which flows into the sea, by  collecting its waters for transport to needy Middle Eastern  countries.    The second choice is the transfer of the waters of the  Euphrates and the Tigris in the southeast, via pipeline to the  Middle East region.    Cetin said Turkey considers its waters as "peace waters" and  not "conflict waters."</p>

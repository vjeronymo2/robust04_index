			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Companies face a dividend dilemma - The Bottom Line INVESTORS who rely on share dividends for income will be facing this company reporting season with trepidation. Many companies are expected to cut dividends or even omit them altogether. Since analysts expect corporate earnings to have fallen generally in 1991, companies will be under pressure to cut dividends. Even so, forecasts are for a small increase across the market. Broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd suggests a 4 per cent rise from industrial companies as a whole. This would, roughly, match the rate of inflation, against which investors look to rising equity dividends to provide a hedge (although, as the chart shows, there are periods such as the 1970s when this has not happened). Many companies must decide if they can afford to maintain a dividend, despite lower profits, in the hope that the economy and their business will recover in the near future; or if they should conserve much-needed cash and reduce the pay-out. If after-tax profits are too little for a dividend, then companies will have to draw on reserves from previous years. Brokers say the level of dividend cover - the number of times a dividend could be paid from available earnings - has fallen to around two. That is lower than in the depths of the recession early in the 1980s. Even when the economy begins to bounce back, it could take a long time for dividend cover to be rebuilt. For it to reach 2.5, BZW estimates that three years of earnings' growth of 12 per cent annually, with no dividend increases, would be needed. Investors with long memories will recall that after ICI, the chemicals group, cut its dividend in 1981, it took eight years to be restored in real terms. Already, some leading companies have announced reductions. Lonrho cut its final dividend from 8p to 5p, and Vickers from 6.2p to 2.3p. And, this week, Royal Insurance passed its final dividend, which had been 14 3/4 p in 1990. Meanwhile, other companies have not increased the pay-out as much as hoped. BP, for instance, did not raise its final dividend at all. In such cases, there is often a double blow for investors - not only the reduction in income but also a fall in the value of their shares. Royal's shares fell from 226p on Thursday morning, before its results were announced, to 183p by last night. Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, took a different course, changing from half-yearly to quarterly dividend payments. Although shareholders will end up getting the same amount in the end - and, in future, it might even be more convenient to receive dividends quarterly rather than half-yearly - it might seem in the short term that they are worse off. It is not all bad news, however. Holders of Midland Bank shares, who had braced themselves for no final dividend, were pleasantly surprised on Thursday when the clearing bank paid 1.7p, the same as for 1990. Midland's shares rose from 239p on Thursday morning to 267p last night. Vickers, which reported final results on Monday, pleased the stock market when it did not cut its final dividend by as much as analysts had expected. On Thursday, Alfred McAlpine, the construction and house-building group, decided to maintain its final dividend even though it had to dip into reserves. As March stretches ahead, though, many companies are likely to reduce final dividends. Which ones? A clue can be gleaned from the yield column in the daily share price tables. Companies with shares offering high yields on the basis of their payment last year are probable candidates for a dividend cut, since their share prices had been pushed down in anticipation. Shares in companies such as construction group Tarmac, insurance giant Guardian Royal Exchange, Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the conglomerate, and T&amp;N, the motor components group, are on historic double-figure yields. As these names show, the worst of the dividend cuts are likely to be in sectors hit most by the recession, such as building and engineering and the financial sector. Elsewhere, in such sectors as health and household, or among consumer goods groups, there are prospects of dividend increases. A year ago, some of the big fund managers were urging companies to maintain dividend payments. Now, though, cuts are almost respectable. Last autumn, the governor of the Bank of England warned companies of the dangers of paying dividends they could not afford. Many companies must hope that, with such authoritative backing, their shareholders may forgive them for taking a prudent stance.</p>

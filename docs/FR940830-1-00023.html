For purposes of this comparison, concerns in the same business area are those which are primarily engaged in the same four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. SBA will rely on published data showing business and financial profiles of similarly sized businesses operating within the same four-digit SIC code as the applicant, except where such data is not reasonably available. In such a case SBA may rely on published data pertaining to small business concerns in closely related four-digit SIC code(s) to derive the comparative profiles. In evaluating a concern's financial condition, SBA's consideration will include, but not be limited to, the following information: business assets, revenues, pre-tax profit, working capital, and net worth of the concern (including the value of the investments in the concern held by the individual claiming disadvantaged status). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) *&blank;*&blank;* (1) For purposes of the section 8(d) Subcontracting Program, Small Disadvantaged Business set-asides, Small Disadvantaged Business Evaluation preferences, and other programs requiring SBA's determination of disadvantaged status, SBA will consider the same information and factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, but will apply standards to each factor that are less restrictive than those applied when determining economic disadvantage for purposes of the 8(a) program. This approach reflects the Congressional intent that partial or complete achievement of a concern's 8(a) program business development goals should not necessarily preclude its participation in other Federal procurement programs for concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Section 124.107(b) would be revised to read as follows; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.107  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Potential for success. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) In determining whether a concern has the requisite potential for success to be admitted into the 8(a) program, SBA will look at a number of factors including, but not limited to, the technical and managerial experience and competency of the applicant concern's managers and of the concern as a whole, the financial capacity of the applicant concern and the concern's record of performance on previous Federal and private sector contracts in the primary industry in which the concern is seeking 8(a) certification. While the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based need not possess both management and technical capabilities pursuant to &sect;124.104, the applicant concern as a whole must demonstrate both technical know-how in the primary industry in which the concern is seeking 8(a) certification and management experience sufficient to run its day-to-day operations. SBA will examine each of these factors to determine whether an otherwise eligible applicant concern has the potential to successfully perform subcontracts awarded under the 8(a) program and to meet the business development objectives and goals of the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18. Section 124.108 would be amended by adding the following new paragraph (d)(3): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.108  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Additional 8(a) program eligibility requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An applicant concern seeking admission to the 8(a) program as a regular dealer need not demonstrate that it is capable of meeting the requirements of the non-manufacturer rule ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  13 CFR 121.1106(b)) for its primary industry classification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19. Section 124.109 would be amended by revising paragraphs (d) and (e), and by adding a new paragraph (f), to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.109  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Ineligible businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Non-profit organizations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A non-profit organization does not meet the general definition of a concern as set forth in part 121 and &sect;124.100 of these regulations and is, therefore, ineligible for 8(a) program participation. In addition, a business entity owned by a non-profit organization is not eligible for 8(a) program participation because such a concern does not meet the requirement of being owned and controlled by disadvantaged  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> individuals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nothing in this paragraph affects the eligibility of a for-profit concern owned and controlled by an Indian tribe, including an Alaskan Native Corporation, a Native Hawaiian Organization or a Community Development Corporation ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;&sect;124.112, 124.113, and 124.114). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Concerns owned by other concerns.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An 8(a) applicant concern which is owned by another business concern, even where that ``parent'' concern is itself owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals, may not be admitted to the 8(a) program because the applicant concern would not be owned by disadvantaged individuals. Nothing in this section is intended to affect the eligibility of joint ventures for specific 8(a) procurement requirements that are authorized pursuant to &sect;124.321. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Parole or probation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An applicant to the 8(a) program is ineligible for program participation if the proprietor, or a holder of at least 20 percent of the stock, or a partner, officer, director, or other persons, including hired managers, who have or will have the authority to speak for and commit the concern in the management of its business affairs, is currently incarcerated, on parole or on probation either pursuant to a pre-trial diversion or following conviction of a serious offense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. Section 124.110 would be amended by revising the first three sentences of paragraph (a) and by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.110  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Program term. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each concern certified for participation in the 8(a) program shall receive a Program Term of nine years from the date of such certification. The term will consist of two stages: the developmental stage, which lasts four years, and the transitional stage, which lasts five years. These stages are described in &sect;124.303. *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Once a Program Term has been established in accordance with this section, SBA is statutorily prohibited from extending such term beyond the specified expiration date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

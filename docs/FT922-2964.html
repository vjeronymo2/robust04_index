			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Both sides claim ice cream victory UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, and Mars, the US-owned food manufacturer, both claimed victory yesterday in the latest round of their legal battle over the European ice cream market. The European Court of Justice confirmed an earlier decision lifting a European Commission order which suspended until the end of the year exclusive sales agreements between German retailers, Unilever and Scholler Lebensmittel, another ice cream maker. However, the court also ruled that Mars could place ice cream freezers in 18,000 German petrol stations, regardless of any agreements tying the stations to Langnese-Iglo, Unilever's German ice cream subsidiary, and Scholler. Unilever said this concession had already been offered, and rejected by Mars. As well as contesting the agreements, Mars has complained to Brussels that the two other companies' exclusive control of freezer cabinets restricted competition. The next cold war, Page 7</p>

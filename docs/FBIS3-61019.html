			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel V. Glebov under the rubric "Under the </F> 'Interkosmos' Program": "A Plasma Experiment"]    [Text] The Interkosmos-25 (IK-25) satellite, with orbital  parameters of apogee 3,083 km [kilometers], perigee 440 km and  inclination 82.5&deg;, was launched into orbit from Russia's  Plesetsk cosmodrome using a Tsiklon launch vehicle on 18  December 1991. The mass of the spacecraft is 1,350 kg  [kilograms], and the instruments and scientific gear 340 kg.    The dampening, orientation and stabilization system provides  three-axis orientation in an orbital system of coordinates with  a precision of 25&deg; along the pitch axis and 10&deg; on the  roll and yaw axes.    The goal of the launch is to conduct an active plasma  experiment (APEKS) for the scientists of various countries, in  order to continue their basic study of the electrodynamic links  of the ionosphere and the magnetosphere of Earth within the  context of the overall Interkosmos program.    The magnetic storms and the attendant incursion into the  planet's atmosphere of powerful flows of active electrons and  ions leads to the formation of the polar lights, intensive  bursts of radio noise and other phenomena that affect the  biosphere and business and economic activity. The mechanism of  the occurrence, relaxation in the atmosphere and generation of  wave emissions of such electrons has been largely unclear up to  now, and it is thus very important to conduct the study and  model the processes with the injection of electron beams and  plasma clusters into the ionosphere and magnetosphere of the  Earth.    The possibility of creating a structureless antenna for  long-range communications using plasma-stream systems of  generators and emitting systems was verified in practice in the  course of the scientific experiments.    Specialists and organizations from our country, Bulgaria,  Hungary, Poland, Germany, Rumania, Czechoslovakia and Cuba took  part in preparing the flight program and developing and  manufacturing the on-board scientific instruments and ground  systems.    The artificial injection of a beam of electrons and plasma  from the satellite, with the synchronous measurement of the  physical parameters of the environment, beam and fields  generated using two separated spacecraft whose orbits make it  possible to perform the measurements both at various distances  (from 0.01 to 1,000--2,000 km) and at various (in relation to  the areas of excitation of the environment and dissemination of  the beam) zones of the ionosphere and magnetosphere, was at the  foundation of the APEKS. The experiment envisaged study of the  nature of the electrodynamic links of electromagnetic waves in  the ionosphere and the magnetosphere, determination of the  radio-emission properties of the modulated particles and plasma  clusters, research of their dynamics in near-Earth plasma,  modeling and initiation of the polar lights and radio emissions  and research on the generation and propagation of waves at  frequencies of 30 Hz--10 MHz and 0.1 HZ--10 KHz with the  injection of modulated electron beams and plasma streams into  the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere.    The scientific gear on the IK-25 includes two sets of  instruments. The first has the active excitation  apparatus--accelerators of electrons and plasma--and the second  has diagnostic apparatus to study the propagation of electron  energy (ions, flows of charged particles at the satellite),  parameters of the plasma and low-frequency fluctuations in the  magnetic field, as well as to measure the temperature of the  plasma, the electrical and magnetic components of the low- and  high-frequency electromagnetic emissions, the components of the  quasi-permanent magnetic and electrical fields and spectral  analysis of the electrical fields.    A subsatellite of 50 kg manufactured in Czechoslovakia was  released from the IK-25 on 28 December 1991 in accordance with  the flight program. It moved, without the use of corrective  means, into an elliptical trajectory on the orbital plane. After  separation the initial larger axis of the ellipse was about 450  meters, and the smaller about 220 meters. The distance between  the satellite and the subsatellite could increase to five  kilometers in view of the differing friction from the  atmosphere. There is the possibility of keeping the subsatellite  at a distance of dozens of meters to a hundred or more  kilometers for a time sufficient to conduct the experiment using  the corrective engine installation on the principal craft.    The subsatellite is equipped with apparatus that allows it  to  measure virtually the same set of physical values as the main  satellite. The large spectrum of the same types of instruments  of both satellites is supplemented by a system of technical  support that includes a radiometer, a decoder of radio commands,  interactive receivers, an orientation analyzer, a telemetric  measurements unit and antenna-feeder devices.    The results of measurements are recorded on board the  satellites with the aid of radio-telemetric systems and  technical support systems. The information from the telemetric  system is received on Earth by a command and telemetry complex  on the territory of our country, supported by personnel from the  space units; from the technical support system the information  is received by domestic stations at Tarusa, Apatity, Troitsk and  Medveziye Ozera as well as foreign stations as Panska Ves  (Czechoslovakia), Neustrelitz (Germany), Havana (Cuba) and Stara  Zagora (Bulgaria).    The flight and the operation of support and scientific  instruments of the satellite are controlled from the Flight  Control Center (TsUP) for spacecraft for national-economic and  scientific purposes (Moscow), while the subsatellite is  controlled by specialists and technical apparatus from the  Panska Ves scientific station. The control of both satellites is  coordinated by the main operations control group at the TsUP.    There are three to five communications sessions a day with  the IK-25 satellite, in the course of which radio monitoring of  the orbit, the transmission of command programs to the satellite  and the downloading of telemetric and scientific information are  accomplished. The on-board scientific apparatus is able to  function in active and passive modes. The active mode is  characterized by the injection of electron accelerators and  plasma against a background of the operation of the remaining  instruments in conjunction with the radio-telemetric system in  the information-recording mode. The observations of natural  geophysical phenomena, in the absence of injections of electron  beams and plasma streams, is an important part of the program,  since the spatial and temporal dependencies in  ionospheric-magnetospheric processes can be researched with the  aid of the two separated satellites.    There is a regular exchange of data among the participants  in  the international space program for planning and operational  control (current ballistic parameters, operating modes of the  scientific apparatus, readiness for operation of the technical  gear and reporting on the receipt of telemetric data, among  others).    The APEKS project is being executed successfully.    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

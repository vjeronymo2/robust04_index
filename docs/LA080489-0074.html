Residents  will be asked to use the city containers for aluminum and steel cans, glass  bottles and jars and clear plastic soda bottles. Newspapers, either tied or in  shopping bags, can also be placed beside the containers at curbside.  </P> <P> The expansion raises the number of homes participating in the city's voluntary  recycling pilot program to 90,000. Elliott said the bureau plans to propose  citywide mandatory recycling within 30 days.  </P></p>

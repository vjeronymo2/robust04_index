It makes one wonder  what drove the two climbers, Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat, to  exchange peaceful Norwegian country houses for the media  spectacle at the World Economic Forum in Davos. If the "miracle  of Washington" -- the Rabin-'Arafat handshake of 13 September --  has taught us anything, it is the obligation to be discreet.  Major conflicts, such as the Arab-Israeli one, are not solved  at CNN speed -- and especially not in a forum that invites  participants to pose for the media rather than engage in hard  work to increase mutual confidence.    Thus, Peres and 'Arafat could meet the world press hand in  hand, but they could not present an agreement on enforcing the  autonomy accord to the world policy groupies. They only got  "very close." Foreign Minister Peres, a poet manque, cannot have  read his "Magic Mountain" properly, which he quotes as a symbol  for rising and overcoming problems. Thomas Mann's novel was  inspired by his wife's stay at a Davos sanatorium. He describes  the "Magic Mountain" as a mystical, dreamy world -- the absolute  opposite of the "flat country," where, just as in real politics,  sobriety and reality prevail. The two ideological opponents,  Naphta and Settembrini, "are both great wafflers," whose fierce  debates turn into "major irritability." Finally they fight a  duel: One fires a shot in the air, the other -- Naphta -- shoots  himself. The more modest mountains of Norway would have  provided a happier metaphor.    But this is not the right time for literary excursions.  Although the appearance in the snow failed, the model worked  out in the Norwegian solitude last year continues to be the  right one. What is more, the hand-in-hand appearance in Davos  once again showed dramatically how strong the impulse for peace  is. There is no doubt that Peres and 'Arafat want  reconciliation. The only question is whether they are able to  achieve peace in their negotiations.    The "big success" achieved in Washington avoided the crucial  question "Who will get what, when, and where?" And this is  bothering the negotiators now -- not because the devil is in the  nuts and bolts, but because the principle is in the nuts and  bolts. For the Israelis, the first principle is security, and  the second -- although not forever -- avoiding an "independent  Palestinian state" (Rabin).    For the Palestinians, however, the foremost principal is a  "state" -- as much of it and as quickly as possible. The  security of Israel and the settlers hardly bothers them. What  is worse, since 13 September the number of terrorist attacks has  soared, and escalation remains a latent option to make the  Israelis withdraw from Jericho and Gaza more quickly. After  all, 'Arafat has not yet brought himself to condemn the attacks  clearly.    This is why Peres and 'Arafat have to fight the agonizing  expectations hand in hand. The Israelis expect the journey to  peace not to be paid for with less security -- and this is the  reason for the seemingly endless disputes about who controls the  borders of the autonomous regions: The Jordan -- which is only  a few meters wide anyway -- must not become a channel for  weapons. Also, they are not convinced that hand-holding 'Arafat  has his own clients in hand.    The Palestinians who want to wrest more democracy from him  are mostly those who accuse 'Arafat of "selling out to the  Zionist enemy." They want the state here and now, forgetting  that such a state cannot be created in Oslo or Davos, but only  in the blood- soaked strip of land between the Mediterranean and  the Jordan River. There, in their day-to-day lives, Israelis and  Palestinians will have to realize that the other does not want  to overpower them. This conflict cannot be solved by a stroke of  the pen, but only by a daily demonstration of "live and let  live."    The appearance of the Davos duo has created misleading  confidence in this respect: Neither Rabin-Peres, nor 'Arafat  can rely on their followers at the moment. If elections were  held in Israel today, Rabin would be very likely to lose.  Whether the one-man-regime 'Arafat would pass such a test is an  open question. This is why the adversaries could not keep up  the momentum of Washington, why symbols are no longer enough,  and why each detail is being bargained over.    But this may be the very reason why the descent from the  "Magic Mountain" should not be sneezed at. Israel and the PLO  have to get back to the "flat country," which has virtually to  be surveyed with a tape measure: Who gets which road, which  allotment? What are the conditions for extending the autonomy  area, both geographically and politically? The more precise the  rules, the fewer the reasons for dispute. And the fewer the  spectators, the greater the chances for a peace that nobody  could even have dreamed of a year ago.</p>

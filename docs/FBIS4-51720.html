			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia and Albania will open new ground in  bilateral cooperation, including an unprecedented military  cooperation when Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak  began his three-day official visit today to the former communist  state. Seen as a follow-up to the historic visit by Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed last July to the eastern  European state, Datuk Sri Najib will formally establish military  ties with Albania under a memorandum of understanding, MOU, to  be signed the following day.    Datuk Sri Najib is flying from Stockholm for the first leg  of  his visit to Sweden, Albania, and Croatia when he will meet  Malaysian troops. He will also establish closer rapport and  Islamic cooperation with his majority Muslim states.    Albania has 3.3 million people, more than 80 percent of them  Muslims. According to the minister's press secretary Zulkifli  Ali, Datuk Sri Najib will hold a dialogue session tomorrow with  Albanian religious leaders in a Tirana mosque, built in 1793  situated in the heart of the state capital. Like previous  official visits by Malaysian leaders, Datuk Sri Najib is also  expected to take the opportunity from his stay to explore  business opportunities for Malaysians to venture in the  redevelopment process of Albania.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS HUDDLE ON ORDER TO REDRAW LINES  </P> <P> With their court-imposed deadline just 15 days away, four of the five Los  Angeles County supervisors began private deliberations Tuesday over how to  comply with a federal court order to redraw district boundaries to remedy  discrimination against Latinos.  </P> <P> Retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum, whose district was at the center of  litigation alleging the supervisors effectively have prevented election of a  Latino candidate, was absent from the meeting. Other supervisors said Schabarum  was fishing in Montana, and an aide to the supervisor said he was keeping in  touch by telephone.  </P> <P> Schabarum's whereabouts was one of the few revelations of the day, as  supervisors and their most trusted staff huddled in their eighth-floor suites  in the Hall of Administration. Sources among those present said that the  supervisors dusted off old maps and talked about new ways to create a Latino  district without destroying their own political bases, but few significant  details leaked from the secret meetings.  </P> <P> "The only thing you can quote me on is that Supervisor Edelman has no comment,"  said Joel Bellman, a spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon last week ruled that the five Anglo  supervisors drew their district boundaries in 1981 in a way that dilutes the  voting power of the county's 3 million Latinos. He gave supervisors until June  27 to draft a new plan that would enhance the chances of the first Latino being  elected to the board.  </P> <P> The supervisors have voted to appeal the case, which now has cost the county $4  million and could cost another $2 million if the judge awards the plaintiffs  attorneys' fees.  </P> <P> The four supervisors who met Tuesday were told that county counsel DeWitt  Clinton later this week will hand-deliver to their offices a new redistricting  plan that would comply with the court order.  </P> <P> The map would consolidate heavily Latino neighborhoods in East Los Angeles and  the San Gabriel Valley, now fragmented among three districts, into a single  district, from which the first Latino would have an improved chance of winning  a seat on the five-member board.  </P> <P> But the county counsel is expected to leave to the supervisors which of their  colleagues is placed in the district, if anyone. Supervisors could still expand  the board to provide a seat for a Latino without affecting an incumbent.  </P> <P> Complicating matters is Schabarum's decision not to seek reelection. Earlier  this month, a crowded field competed for the seat, but none emerged with the  majority needed for election. A runoff is scheduled to be held in November  between the two top finishers, a former Schabarum aide and a Superior Court  judge.  </P> <P> The board on Tuesday delayed for three weeks -- until after Kenyon's deadline  -- a vote on a proposal by Supervisor Kenneth Hahn to put a measure on the  November ballot to expand the board to seven or nine members. County attorneys  have said that the board could agree to expansion without a vote of the people.  </P> <P> According to board sources, the board's conservative majority of Mike  Antonovich, Deane Dana and Schabarum privately are drafting a plan that would  place the liberal Edelman in a new Latino district. It involves drawing a  finger that extends from the core of the district just east of downtown all the  way to Edelman's home in Westwood so that the supervisor could run in the  district.  </P> <P> Such a proposal, however, could cause problems for the conservative Dana, who  would be forced to pick up liberal Westside neighborhoods from Edelman.  </P> <P> A county source said that Edelman is considering personally negotiating with  the plaintiffs in the redistricting case. But an Edelman aide declined comment.  </P> <P> The other liberal on the board is Hahn, but his position seemed more secure.  </P> <P> "What do we have to worry about?" a Hahn deputy asked. Hahn is safe because the  supervisors cannot under the Voting Rights Act greatly juggle the boundaries of  Hahn's heavily black district.  </P></p>

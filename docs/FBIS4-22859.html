			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Chernyshov] </F>   [Text]The telephone situation in the homeland is not in  need of commentary. More than 60,000 towns that have a  population of up to 50 inhabitants do not have telephone service.    The Russian Communications Ministry is attempting to find  acceptable options to escape this communications deadlock. In  the beginning of December in Yoshkar-Ola, Russian  telecommunications workers met with specialists from the  Agriculture Ministry to discuss telephone communications  problems in the rural areas of Russia.    For the former Communications Ministry of the Soviet Union,  state and collective farms were always the main focus of  attention. The money that was sent was centralized in these  locations, and it was primarily here that systems of internal  industrial communications were created. To a certain degree,  this helped to provide telephone service to other public  facilities in the countryside, such as hospitals, clubs and the  post office. Approximately 200,000 new telephone numbers were  introduced each year. This number is small, but it has now  dropped to 75,000- 80,000 overall.    The Soviet Union Communications Ministry was essentially a  gigantic monopoly. The communications industry is one of the  largest and most profitable throughout the world. Its yearly  volume of products and services is 260 million dollars. Despite  the fact that the Communications Ministry brought large revenues  to the state, it was treated like a step-daughter. ``Now,  so-called analogue communications equipment predominates here,''  Deputy Minister Aleksandr Krupnov attests. These obsolete  systems require large industrial rooms and are not reliable or  cost-effective. Only 2% of Russian communications  equipment  meets world standards to one degree or another.    The Russian Communications Ministry now feels that its main  function should not be financing, but regulating relations  between all organizations involved in this field. The main  missions involve issuing certificates and licenses to those  commercial organizations which want to work in the  communications business. ``Today, about 700 enterprises have  already received an operating license,'' Aleksandr Krupnov  notes. For now they do not have a very large percentage of the  work. Special hopes are placed on foreign capital in the  communications industry. It is thought that foreign firms, and  far from minor ones at that, will be expressing significant  interest in Russia.    Adding to what the deputy minister said, the development of  communications equipment was heavily dependent on foreign  deliveries, as it turned out in the former U.S.S.R. For example,  we received more than 65% of automatic telephone stations  and  30% of cable from overseas. Among foreign partners, there  were  many enterprises from the Comecon countries. Today, preference  is given to such leaders as Alcatel, Bell, and Siemens, if the  latter propose profitable contracts, of course.    The second strategic line of the Russian Communications  Ministry is to have the local municipal administrations agree to  all tariffs for communications services. The cost of the  services should reimburse operating expenses for the  communications systems, pay for credits, and ensure funds  accumulate for developing communications networks. This means  that no funds will be used from the federal budget for these  purposes. On the surface, this approach seems rational, but in  practice it is difficult to implement.    In the middle of 1993, the Moscow City Telephone Network  established fairly unusual tariffs. For state organizations 80  rubles for each line per month was established. For a private  telephone, a little more than 100 rubles was charged, and for  all others 1,500 rubles. It is not the numbers themselves that  are important here since they change constantly, but their  ratios. According to Mr. Krupnov, there is a certain logic at  play here. For state locations, the lowest prices are  established because there is no point in pumping money in the  budget from one pocket to another. Those who have telephones in  their homes should receive social protection, and commercial  organizations should pay ``whole hog,'' and even more than that,  because any prices for them are still just a drop in the bucket.    At one time the Moscow City Telephone Network installed  140,000-150,000 new home and other telephone numbers per year.  Today that number is 40,000-50,000. Many districts of the  capitol suffer from total ``telephone silence,'' to say nothing  of the suburbs, where the population density is incidentally no  less than that of Moscow itself. There is much talk about  creating a system of fiber-optic communications rings along the  capitol boulevards, the Garden Ring road, the circle road and  even throughout the Golden Ring. This network will ostensibly  provide for more widespread telephone service in the capitol and  the region.    ``It is not worth becoming too carried away,'' Mr. Krupnov  warns. ``Even though fiber-optic cables have enormous capacity  compared to traditional cables, in and of themselves they cannot  resolve the problem.'' Installing such lines will make it  possible to forget about communications for the next 10-15  years, but all the rest must also be available, in addition to  the communications channels. For example, virtually all the  telephone numbers in Moscow have been selected. Therefore, new  automatic telephone stations must be constructed, and other  necessary equipment purchased. Unfortunately, we are in no  condition to do this ourselves. The technical level of even our  major communications equipment manufacturers does not meet  modern standards. The defense industries which are now  converting to the manufacture of civilian products also do not  instill hope.    Economic reasons remain the stumbling block. Of course,  the Communications Ministry feels that it is possible to develop  the most modern concept for providing telephone service for both  highly populated and sparsely habitable regions of Russia.  Foreign investors must be drawn in. In fact this is what is  being done. However, without state support it is unlikely that  communications will get on its feet.</p>

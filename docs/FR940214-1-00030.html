These sampling plans are developed for individual products and will be distributed for field use as they are developed. The type of plan applicable depends on factors such as whether the product is in containers, stage of preparation, and procedure followed by the establishment operator. The specific plan applicable depends on the kind of product involved, such as liver, oxtail, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) A U.S. retained tag shall be placed by a Program employee at the time of reinspection at any official establishment on all products which are suspected on such reinspection of being adulterated or misbranded, and such products shall be held for further inspection.

These written procedures shall describe how the establishment will maintain the identity of the suspect product, where the suspect product will be stored, how long the product will be stored, and what measures will be taken to secure the product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Approval of an establishment's written procedures for accumulating product will be based on the establishment's ability to provide the physical space to store the accumulated product and its ability to assure that the identity and security of the product is maintained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) In any situation where the establishment's written procedure for accumulating product is found by the Administrator or his/her designee to be unacceptable, formal written notification shall be given to the establishment of the basis for the denial.

The establishment shall be afforded an opportunity to submit a written statement in response to this notification of denial and a right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial.

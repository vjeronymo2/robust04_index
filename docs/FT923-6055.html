			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Russians vow to abide by IMF accord RUSSIAN authorities have convinced the International Monetary Fund they plan to stick to their current agreement with the Fund on the eve of debt talks with the Group of Seven. Mr Richard Erb, the Fund's deputy managing director, said yesterday that Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, was one of those who had agreed, despite saying in a newspaper interview last week that the deal with the IMF should be changed. His public statement appears to have been inspired more by domestic political considerations, and yesterday's show of unity with the IMF was probably necessitated by a keen desire to obtain a rapid rescheduling of the former Soviet Union's Dollars 70bn (Pounds 35.1bn) foreign debt. A Russian delegation arrived in Paris yesterday for talks today with G7 representatives to press for a rescheduling of the debt. Russia's first agreement with the Fund, which released an initial credit tranche of Dollars 1bn while setting economic targets for this year, is a basic condition for a wider agreement on rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations to agree to reschedule. Mr Erb said the Paris Club could agree to a rescheduling before Russia concluded a full standby agreement with the Fund. The standby, setting targets for next year, is to be negotiated in September and October. If it is agreed, it would unlock a further Dollars 3bn in IMF resources that were part of a Dollars 24bn western aid package promised for this year. Mr Erb said it was too early to say whether Russia could meet inflation and budget deficit targets agreed for the end of this year. But although he had warned the Russian authorities against the temptations of 'spending just a little more here and a little more there', he repeated that the Fund would be flexible. 'There will be adaptations on the way. You cannot put in place up front a detailed road map.'</p>

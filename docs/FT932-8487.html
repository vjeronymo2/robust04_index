			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: UN team chief condemns Cambodian factions MR YASUSHI AKASHI, who heads the embattled United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, yesterday bitterly criticised Cambodian factions which have failed to co-operate with the UN's peacekeeping mission and warned them not to disrupt the election scheduled for next week, Victor Mallet reports from Phnom Penh. In a statement issued in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, Mr Akashi condemned an upsurge of violence in recent days, including an artillery attack on Siem Reap airport and the assassination of three election campaigners, one from the royalist party Funcinpec and two from the Buddhist Liberal Democratic party. 'In doing our utmost to create and maintain at least the minimum acceptable conditions for the conduct of an election, we have been hampered by the unco-operativeness and outright hostility of some of the Cambodian parties that signed the Paris agreements,' he said. Mr Akashi's attack was aimed at the government in Phnom Penh, which has intimidated voters throughout the country and is blamed for the murder of dozens of opposition party officials, and at the Khmer Rouge, which has threatened to disrupt the election after flouting the Paris peace accords it and the other three factions signed in 1991. 'Any armed attack on voters or polling stations will be considered an act of betrayal against the Cambodian people,' he said. 'I will recommend to the (UN) Security Council the international community give all support to the new Cambodian government in bringing to justice the perpetrators of such crimes.' Mr Khieu Kanharith, spokesman for the Phnom Penh administration, meanwhile said the government may not launch an offensive against Khmer Rouge guerrilla strongholds if it won the election. 'If we win, and if the Khmer Rouge stay quiet in their zones, we will not take any military action,' he told a news conference. 'We have more important things to do.' He also claimed that the Khmer Rouge and Funcinpec had infiltrated 800 agents into Phnom Penh. to organise demonstrations or even an armed insurrection. In the election campaign, which ends today, the government has sought to portray itself as the only party which can protect Cambodians from the Khmer Rouge.</p>

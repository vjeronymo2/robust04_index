			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Arts: The RSC's 'Tempest' - Theatre It is widely assumed that the RSC offers high standards of accomplishment in acting, yet several RSC stagings in recent years have shown an extremely mixed bag of performers. Take, for example, the current production of The Tempest, directed by Sam Mendes, which opened last year in Stratford and which has just transferred to the Barbican Theatre. Few actors have a technique more immaculate than its Prospero, Alec McCowen. Ariel is Simon Russell Beale, who is forever expanding his range and style by allowing himself to be cast in dissimilar roles (for Mendes alone he has played Ariel, Richard III and Thersites in Troilus at the RSC). So far, so impressive. But Ferdinand is Mark Lewis Jones, whose tight, small voice is not always audible even in the stalls, who often sounds strangulated on emphatic words, and who seems to have learnt no kind of legato delivery in speaking poetry. But Jones certainly has talent; four years ago, I much admired his ardent Tristram in the Lyric Hammersmith's Morte d'Arthur. Either the RSC has cast him beyond his capacity or it no longer has the kind of voice coaches who could help him. Let no one readily assume that the RSC is an all-round ensemble of vocal accomplishment any more. But enough of this. Sam Mendes's Tempest is an intelligent, lucid, rather schematic affair, with plenty of novel touches; and it has been somewhat revised since its Stratford premiere. Ariel no longer spits in Prospero's face when he is finally released, but simply gives him a long, cool glare. None the less, Beale's interpretation - reminding us of Ariel's reluctant servitude to Prospero and of his lack of human emotions - remains the production's most innovative feature. His Ariel is glacial, ponderous, even baleful. Very arresting, but not wholly persuasive. There is a mellifluous lyricism in his account of Ariel's songs that nowhere enters into the rest of his performance; the words 'merrily, merrily' come implausibly from his lips; and Prospero calls him 'dainty' and 'my bird' to no avail. As for Prospero, McCowen performs him with the excessive precision, measure and control that have been the hallmarks of his performances in the last 10 or more years. His every word commands attention, his every phrase inspires respect, and he reaches two highly impressive peaks with his rendition of 'Our revels now are ended' (spoken with a beautifully weary bitterness) and the abdicatory 'Ye elves of hills' (uttered with increasing warmth, as if looking for a new human tenderness in life after magic). Everything is fresh, but also freshly packaged. This Prospero is so much master of himself that he robs the play of half its tension. David Troughton's laborious Caliban, as ponderous and livid as Beale's Ariel though made of opposite ingredients, successfully catches the beautiful awe of 'The isle is full of noises'. But if Shakespeare had wanted Prospero's daughter to be played with the pedestrian manners of Sarah Woodward, he would not have called her Miranda, (which means marvellous, amazing, wondrous). Too much of the clowning of David Bradley's Trinculo and Mark Lockyer's Stephano is imposed on the play, rather than drawn out of it. The stranded nobles are a pretty dull lot; and the toy-theatre masque, with its mechanical deities, is anti-poetic. The production is, however, larger than the sum of its parts. Paul Pyant's lighting and Anthony Ward's designs beautifully display the architecture of the play; I love the contrast of the yellow soil, the deep-azure sea, the clouded, blue sky - and then, as Ariel departs forever through a door, the sudden glimpse of a radiant white beyond this world. The grand plan of the play is here - but not all its inner life. In repertory at the Barbican.</p>

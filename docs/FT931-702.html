			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Letter: Clear duties and penalties the route to auditor independence Sir, Prem Sikka, Anthony Puxty and Hugh Willmott (Accountancy Column, March 25) add their voices to the popular argument that separation of audit from consultancy work for the same client would ensure auditor independence. Judging by the research carried out by NERA into this subject, I would suggest that their proposals are unworkable. What is more, this policy prescription is not at all the most direct solution to the root of the problem. When we collected data on audit-consultancy links among the Big Six accounting firms in 1990, we found that the various regulatory obstacles to such links throughout the EC were mostly ignored, avoided or evaded. In Germany (the example cited by Sikka et al as having an effective ban on audit-consultancy links) we found that more than 20 per cent of Big Six non-audit income came from audit clients. The corresponding figure was 35 per cent for the UK. Even supposing audit-consultancy links could be eradicated, the problem of the auditors owing greater financial allegiance to the managers than to the shareholders of the audit client would remain. The audit is a major piece of business in its own right, so audit partners would still have a clear financial incentive to compromise independence if lent on by unscrupulous company managers. The way to tackle this problem head on is to clarify the duties of the auditor to the shareholders. Clearer duties, and clearer penalties if these duties were not discharged, would provide an effective financial antidote to the incentive to compromise independence. Certain knowledge that poor audit checks will result in exposure to proper penalties would concentrate the auditor's mind wonderfully. Shareholders' representatives, and the accounting firms themselves, should take more rapid steps towards this goal if they are to avoid the imposition of costly and ineffectual interference with their freedom to carry on consultancy work.

Upon completing the necessary evaluations, I had to thank  certain government employees for their cooperation, as in the  case with Foreign Minister Arturo Fajardo Maldonado, who will be  replaced by Marithza Ruiz de Vielman, based on her background,  capabilities, and human and professional qualities.    In all the ministries I am going to mention, you can rest  assured we conducted a flawless examination of the appointees,  and that their appointments were based exclusively on the  capabilities they have displayed in the numerous activities they  have pursued, their qualifications, and especially their  professional and human qualities and also, unquestionably, their  performances in other disciplines or activities, public as well  as private.    Engineer Oscar Armando Martinez Anaya, who was minister of  communications, transportation, and public works, will be  replaced by Eng. Jorge Erdmenger de la Fuente. The Economy  Ministry, which soon we hope to be able to legally call by the  name we are currently using, Foreign Trade Ministry, will be  headed by Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo, replacing Fanny de Estrada,  who resigned some time ago because of health problems. The  Finance Ministry was and still is headed by Richard Aitkenhead,  who presented his irrevocable resignation some time ago because  he was appointed to an important position in an international  organization. I spoke with Aitkenhead and after accepting his  resignation I decided to replace him with Economist Ana Ordonez  de Molina, who until now was executive secretary of the  Presidency. Her appointment was based on the follow-up  evaluation I referred to earlier.    As a strategy to strengthen the economic cabinet, Romulo  Caballeros was secretary general of economic planning up until  December. He accepted the position solely to participate in and  cooperate with the government in the area of planning -- a  mission he carried out perfectly because that institution worked  with the economic cabinet on the 180-day plan and the 1994-95  government agenda. Having fulfilled his goal, and since he is no  longer with us, I have appointed Guillermo Rodriguez Magual as  secretary general of economic planning.</p>

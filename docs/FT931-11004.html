			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rights fear at Kingfisher PRESS REPORTS from France that Kingfisher was discussing the possible takeover of Darty, France's leading electrical retail group, sent shares in the UK stores company reeling on fears that a possible Pounds 900m rights issue might be involved. Darty, with more than 200 outlets, turnover of around Pounds 1bn and pre-interest profits of around Pounds 100m, is highly rated by analysts in the UK. However, the press reports, later confirmed by Kingfisher, appear to have upset negotiations which were said to have been well advanced. Sources from both camps yesterday spoke of a 'rapprochement' rather than a bid, analysts said. It was suggested that Kingfisher might seek only a 30 per cent stake, giving it a toe-hold in the French market and perhaps encouraging a joint venture buying agreement. But, analysts close to Kingfisher believe a full takeover is still the most likely outcome, and that Kingfisher may have already taken positions in the currency markets in readiness for the deal. A bid would cost Kingfisher about Pounds 1.3bn and could involve a rights issue of some Pounds 900m. While many analysts welcomed the move, others questioned whether Darty would be too risky a purchase in the current uncertain environment. Mr Nick Hawkins at Kleinwort Benson said: 'There are concerns that Kingfisher may be buying into a deteriorating economic environment.' The shares closed 20 adrift at 538p in turnover of 7.5m. Utilities switching A series of big institutional switches, mostly triggered by broker recommendations, saw the utilities register strong progress. Goldman Sachs, the US brokerage, was said to have been a big switcher into the utilities, while James Capel was said to have recommended a switch from British Gas to regional electricity stocks. Water shares were also boosted by a strong recommendation from the Panmure Gordon utilities team. Panmure said; 'The prospect of safe, growing dividends in a stable regulatory environment should ensure continued outperformance.' Severn Trent, Panmure's primary buy recommendation, jumped 9 to 466p, while Anglian added 10 at 481p and Thames 6 to 487p. North West moved up 8 to 477p. The best performers included Northern, 9 higher at 468p, Southern, better at 421p and East Midland, 7 to the good at 406p. Kleinwort Benson was said to have been responsible for pushing Scottish Hydro 4 up to 240p and Scottish Power 3 better at 219p. Kleinwort said the Scottish generators are going to become the most diversified utilities with unregulated profits making up at least 15 per cent of operating profits by 1994/5. WH Smith firm Stationer WH Smith rebounded from sustained underperformance on rumours that it will today announce cutbacks at its DIY division. There was also talk that one leading house would issue a positive note shortly. Smith shares have collapsed since the group revealed large losses and provisions at its Do-It-All joint venture, falling from 523p at the end of the year. Yesterday they rebounded 16 to 426p. The losses have led many analysts to question Smiths' strategy with regard to the DIY market, with some calling for the group to cut and run. However, any restructuring would be warmly received. As well as some closures, rumoured to be affecting upwards of 20 stores, news on the financing of a new distribution centre is also expected. Lasmo favoured News of the sale of Pounds 126.5m worth of North Sea assets triggered a sharp turnaround in Lasmo. The exploration company's shares underperformed a generally buoyant oil sector on Wednesday but rose sharply yesterday to close 5 higher at 166p. Turnover was a hefty 5.6m shares. The asset sales, made up of interests in 17 North Sea blocks sold to Germany's Deminex for Pounds 105.8m and interests in the Balmoral and Maureen fields to Pentex Oil for Pounds 30m, had been expected by the market. Oil sector specialists viewed the disposals as good for the company. There were, however, a few grumbles from the market at the terms of the deal and some question marks about the company's claim that the sales would reduce gearing by around 14 per cent. Some Pounds 53m of the deal is payable in loans redeemable in January 1994 while the rest is valued at January 1 1993 exchange rates which will lop more off the value. The general consensus, however, was that Lasmo's strategy was correct. At NatWest Securities, Mr Simon Flowers said; 'This deal shows that the asset value of 185p is realisable in cash.' RTZ weakens The world's biggest mining group RTZ suffered in spite of good trading news as the market caught wind of a profit forecast cut from one of the UK's leading agency brokers. The shares fell 21 at one stage, shrugging off an announcement that the group's gold production for the fourth quarter to December rose to 310,000 ounces from 229,000 ounces previously. Dealers heard that Cazenove was preparing to cut its 1993 forecast today by Pounds 70m to Pounds 390m. Cazenove never comments on its actions to the market or the press. The forecast compares with an estimate of Pounds 450m from Hoare Govett. RTZ shares closed 8 lower at 663p on 4.7m share turnover. BP continued to move ahead, still responding to the recent flurry of US buying. The shares closed 3 firmer at 268 1/2 p. Shell also progressed, settling 6 up at 583p. Fears of a rights issue continued to circulate around Trafalgar House. The shares gave up 1 1/2 to 92p as HongKong Land exercised its option to acquire more of the company's stock taking its holding in Trafalgar to 20.1. Redland shares raced higher, closing 8 firmer at 465p on turnover of 3m, following a highly successful presentation at Kleinwort Benson Securities and the German interest rate cut. The presentation was addressed by Mr Erich Gerlach, the head of Braas, Redland's German associate. He said Braas's industrial and roofing businesses were still expanding in response to the reconstruction of the former East Germany. Drug stocks had a volatile day, starting on a positive note and then being forced down at the close by the weight of US and European selling as well as individual factors. Glaxo opened timidly on further reflection of a US congressional hearing on drug pricing. Then, the stock rose sharply in response to a US scientific journal article which concluded that ulcer treatment Zantac is effective in eradicating ulcers if used with antibiotics. The shares, 14 higher at one stage, closed 10 off at 655p. Meanwhile, ICI shed 16 to 1118p in spite of an announcement that it is planning sell its powder coatings business. Environmental services company Rentokil eased 5 to 214p as securities house Smith New Court placed 5m shares with institutions at 207p. Defence contractor Hunting jumped 8 to 223p after an announcement that its majority owned joint venture Hunting BRAE had won a 7-year contract for the management and operation of the UK's 4 Atomic Weapons Establishment sites. Profit-taking in British Aerospace left the shares 9 easier at 278p. Losses at Dutch airliner KLM and talk of a stock overhang combined to cause British Airways to retreat 8 to 288p, with volume reaching 6.3m. Newspaper group The Telegraph added 6 at 367p after announcing the sale of its 13 per cent stake in Trinity International for Pounds 26m. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (406).

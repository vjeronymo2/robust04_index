			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly political newsletter by Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani: </F> "The Saudi Government and Some Major Concerns"]    [Text] 1. So far as the national interests of the Islamic  Republic of Iran and other nations in the Persian Gulf are  concerned, nothing is more important than the prevailing  situation in and around Saudi Arabia. We are interested in  having powerful neighbors and good relations with others. On  this basis we believe that there are noteworthy reasons to make  us concerned about the future of the Saudi system at home as  well as its foreign policies outside its borders.    2. Our major concern about the internal situation of the  Saudi rule stems from the change in U.S. policy in the way it  approaches the Islamic movement--or what they call Islamic  fundamentalism. Over the past decade the opinion of Washington  politicians was often that another type of Islam should be put  before the Islam of Iran so that the Islamic movement in the  Muslim countries could be weakened. They believed that in  implementing such a strategy, the prestige of the Saudi rulers  in the world of Islam could be counted on and capitalized.  Therefore, many mosques sprung up in Egypt, Algeria, Africa,  Europe, and Asia built with Saudi money. However, it was not  long before all these mosques turned into propaganda centers for  "Muslim fundamentalism." The Algerian experience is extremely  interesting. Saudi Arabia extended great financial assistance  to the Islamic Salvation Front, but apparently when the Muslim  masses began to move, the Koran and the holy teachings of the  Prophet become more attractive than remarks by friends like Mr.  Belhaj and his sort. The conclusion that Washington has drawn  is extremely important: It believes that artificial movements  cannot withstand the current Islamic movement which is the Islam  of Imam Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified. They concluded  that in order to harness the Islamic movement, the Egyptian or  the Algerian models should be used; that is, dictators without  religion should seize power and violently crush popular  movements and base the system not only on secularism but also  adopt an "anti-religion" ideology or doctrine. It is not  necessary to point out how much this policy is in line with  America's "democracy" slogan and how disgraceful it is. The  issue for us is the practical impact that this policy now has.  It is within this framework that America intends to carry out a  fundamental change in the Saudi ruling machinery. During some  of my recent exchanges of views with European statesmen, I  realized that the issue has gone beyond being only a strong  viewpoint in the White House and has become a "European" issue  as well.    3. The concerns that are felt should not only be a lack of  trust in the future of the Saudi regime but also in the fact  that over the past couple of years, Saudi rulers have played an  active role in numerous tensions in the region. Looking at its  differences with Qatar, with the United Arab Emirates, with  Yemen in the form of border disputes and, finally, its  provocation of the recent bloody and destructive conflicts  inside Yemen, the most natural justification that can be given  for these Saudi acts is that Saudi Arabia wants to inculcate on  the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council that everyone should be  under its control, or, in other words, that the said council is  the "council of cooperation with Saudi Arabia!" Outside of  their borders, they are afraid of the emergence of strong powers  in the region. The unification of the two Yemens paved the way  for the formation of a powerful country with a rich  historical-cultural background, a vast territory, and a  strategic position. It is precisely this that is creating  problems for the Saudi rule! I think that some of Riyadh's  "nervous actions" outside its borders may stem from its worries  at home. But nobody in the Persian Gulf should believe that  anything can be gained from fanning the flames of tension, from  political instigations, and from territorial claims! Those who  are weaker are more vulnerable. The stronger a rule, the more  populous its territory, and the more experience it gains in the  region, the more hopes for the future of the region it can give.  I can never forget Sanaa's mistake in supporting Saddam's  regime during the imposed war. But our nation and our government  can and should focus their attention on the future and recall  the heritage of cultural-historical-religious ties of Iran and  Yemen instead of looking to the past. We should support Yemen's  unity and oppose any type of separatist movement. Undoubtedly  this does not stem from hostility toward our friends in Aden but  from our profound affection for them. We consider the brothers  in Aden to be citizens of Yemen and see their interests lie in  the preservation of their country's unity. Our brothers should  set aside the war and bloodshed and think of the future of Yemen  as the strongest country in the south Persian Gulf. This is the  future that awaits them; if only they knew.</p>

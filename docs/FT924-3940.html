			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Eastern Electricity surges by 69% - Interim profits buoyed by significant cost cutting and reduced interest charges EASTERN ELECTRICITY reported a 69 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits yesterday buoyed by significant cost cutting and reduced net interest expense. Profits in the six months to September 30 increased to Pounds 26.1m compared with Pounds 15.4m last time on turnover which edged higher to Pounds 830.2m (Pounds 821.7m). The sharp increase in pre-tax profits was underpinned by a jump in operating profits which grew to Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 26m) and the decline in interest costs from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 12.4m. Earnings per share rose to 6.9p against 4.3p and the group plans an increased interim dividend of 5.5p (4.85p). Commenting on the results, Mr James Smith, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The increase in operating profit reflects the benefit of our cost reduction programmes and the continued strategic development of our portfolio of electricity purchase cont-racts.' He added that the group also saw a useful increase in sales to the competitive non-franchise market. 'Profit before tax and earning per share benefited significantly from reduced interest charges. We are confident of achieving satisfactory results for the full year.' In the core electricity distribution business net units distributed fell by 1.9 per cent, although after adjustments for weather differences and other factors the underlying level of distribution was only marginally lower. Electricity sales to domestic and industrial customers dropped but were offset by a slight gain in units distributed to commercial customers. The most significant factor affecting performance, however, was the tight control of costs. In particular, increases in costs of distribution were again kept below the rate of inflation while 400 jobs out of a total of 8,000 have been lost in the last 12 months. Earlier this week the group announced it was seeking a further 450 voluntary early retirements within the next three months. Capital expenditure, which totalled Pounds 38m in the first half, has been reduced in line with a decrease in new business, mainly reflecting the impact of the recession on new housebuilding. COMMENT Eastern has the lowest customer tariffs and the lowest added costs per customer among the 12 regional electricity companies and is clearly determined to maintain this edge. Mr John Devaney, the group's new managing director, has a reputation as an effective cost-cutter and has already set to work. This year pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 173m and earnings could reach 45.5. Assuming a dividend increase to 18.7p the shares are on a high prospective yield of 6.2 per cent reflecting caution over Eastern's role as an industry leader.</p>

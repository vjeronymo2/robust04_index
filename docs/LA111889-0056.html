			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DANA HILLS BLASTED BY HART, 41-13  </P> <P> As far as at-large teams go, Dana Hills High was a monster, it was said.  </P> <P> The Dolphins were 7-3 and had allowed only 81 points all season. Most  fourth-place teams give that up in a couple of weeks. But fourth place was as  good as Dana Hills could do in a South Coast League that boasted El Toro,  Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Hart wasn't exactly pleased about drawing such a wild wild card in the first  round of the Division III playoffs Friday night.  </P> <P> The Indians, however, were the ones running wild, riding the legs of running  back Howard Blackwell to a 41-13 win at College of the Canyons.  </P> <P> Blackwell gained 189 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns in 18 carries and  caught five passes for an additional 77 yards.  </P> <P> It wasn't the easiest draw in the playoffs, but Blackwell said that Hart (10-1)  wasn't intimidated either.  </P> <P> "We can score on anybody, any time," he said.  </P> <P> Dana Hills Coach Don Douglas couldn't argue.  </P> <P> "No one has done that to us all year," he said. "Blackwell was magnificent."  </P> <P> It wasn't that way all the way. The Dolphins scored on their first drive on  standout fullback Matt Carvalho's three-yard run.  </P> <P> "The rest of the night was all Hart, though," Douglas said. "They just whupped  us."  </P> <P> It was Dana Hills' worst loss of the season. The Dolphins were defeated, 41-21,  by El Toro.  </P> <P> Quarterback Rob Westervelt did his share, completing 10 of 20 for 170 yards and  two touchdowns. Chad Fotheringham added a 45-yard touchdown pass to John DePaco  on a double pass.  </P> <P> DePaco also caught a 27-yard pass from Westervelt.  </P> <P> Lance Migita was on the receiving end of Westervelt's other touchdown, a  seven-yard play.  </P> <P> Carvalho, who had gained more than 1,200 yards going in, was limited to 63  yards in 16 carries. Dana Hills had an opportunity to increase its 7-0 lead  when Blackwell fumbled the kickoff after Carvalho's touchdown. However, Andy  Marrone dropped a perfect Grant Taylor pass in the end zone on third down and  Ryan Harrison then missed a 23-yard field-goal attempt.  </P> <P> Marrone came back to catch an eight-yard touchdown pass from Taylor with 31  seconds left in the half, cutting the deficit to 28-13.  </P></p>

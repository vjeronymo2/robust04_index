			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY WHEELER, 44; PRODUCER FOR TV, FILM, STAGE  </P> <P> Jerry B. Wheeler, a film, television and theatrical producer and writer, has  died of complications of AIDS. He was 44.  </P> <P> Wheeler died Saturday in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> At the time of his death, Wheeler was producing "The Front Runner," a film  based on Patricia Nell Warren's 1974 novel about a college athletic coach's  homosexual affair with a young track star. Wheeler attributed delays in making  the film during the past five years to difficulty in finding a major  middle-aged male star willing to portray a homosexual.  </P> <P> Wheeler's production company, On the Right Track Productions, will continue  making the film under his instructions.  </P> <P> Born in New York, Wheeler first worked as a child actor in daytime television  shows. He also worked during his teens as an associate to a Broadway producer  and as assistant stage manager for the Metropolitan Opera Company.  </P> <P> Moving to Los Angeles in 1968, he coordinated production for such CBS-TV  variety series as "The Carol Burnett Show," "The Red Skelton Show" and the  "Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour."  </P> <P> After heading his own personal management firm for seven years, he began  producing films.  </P> <P> His first effort was "The Last Resort," later retitled "Tropic of Desire," with  Eartha Kitt and Tom Ewell.  </P> <P> For theater, Wheeler wrote, produced and directed the comedy "Dracula Sucks"  and produced "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove."  </P> <P> In 1981, Wheeler produced a controversial series of five television spots for  the California Department of Mental Health promoting tolerance about  homosexuality. The spots, featuring Ed Asner, Abigail Van Buren and other  celebrities, were kept off the air for years by the administration of then-Gov.  Jerry Brown on grounds that they were an improper use of taxpayers' money.  </P> <P> Wheeler also created and co-produced the annual media awards shows for the  Alliance for Gay &amp; Lesbian Artists and was an adviser to the Los Angeles  International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film/Video Festival.  </P> <P> He is survived by his mother, Edna; a brother, Gene, and his longtime  companion, Steve Badeau.  </P> <P> The family has requested that memorial contributions be made to AIDS Project  Los Angeles, 6721 Romaine St., Los Angeles 90038, or the American Foundation  for AIDS Research, 5900 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles 90036.  </P></p>

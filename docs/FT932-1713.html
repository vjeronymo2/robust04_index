			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (30): A messiah of the movie world - Media J ARTHUR RANK AND THE BRITISH FILM INDUSTRY by Geoffrey Macnab Routledge Pounds 30, 270 pages THE BRITISH film industry, to the extent that it exists at all as a separate entity, has been in a state of crisis as long as anyone can remember. Every decade or so the sense of doom gives way to exhilaration as the Brits invade the Oscars or a modest-budget picture unexpectedly takes off in the US market. Geoffrey Macnab's study shows just how consistent the pattern of boom and bust has been and how the pursuit of the Holy Grail - the lucrative US market - has usually stayed just that. The resulting dilemmas have continued to exercise committees of inquiry as well as film makers. Should the British concentrate on low-budget movies aimed at the domestic market, or risk more lavish productions that have to break into the US market to have any chance of recouping their costs? There were high points. In the early 1930s there was an unprecedented period of expansion, with 200 British films being made in 1936 alone - until the financiers found they were being fleeced and retired hurt. But perhaps the highest point of all, and the most extraordinary, was how the heir to a flour fortune, because he wanted to make projectors available to Methodist halls to spread the good word, turned for a time into the saviour - or to some the monopolist - of the British film industry. In nine years from 1933 to 1942 Rank created the largest integrated film industry empire in British history, owning both the Odean and Gaumont cinema chains and Pinewood and Denham studios. Rank professed not to understand the medium of film and seemed concerned with trade and profits but not exclusively so. 'He does not talk of British films in cultural or aesthetic terms. He alone is in a position to effect a turn-around in British film's fortune because he alone is powerful enough to trade on level terms with the Americans,' Macnab argues. Red Shoes may have taken Dollars 5m at the US box office but Rank still found the US market impenetrable. The audience couldn't understand the British accents and anyway were only good for 'class houses.' Macnab recounts how Rank tried everything to create an integrated successful industry. His projects included Independent Frame, the attempt to revolutionise production methods, Independent Producers Ltd, which gave producers money and creative freedom, the notorious Charm School and G-B Animation, the move into cartoons. Most ended in acrimony; cartoon characters like Corny the Crow, Ginger Nutt and Dusty the Mole did not stand a prayer against Mickey Mouse. Reality intervened in 1949 in the shape of a Pounds 16m overdraft and John Davis, the hatchet-wielding accountant. J. Arthur Rank became more and more remote from the film scene, Davis was in control and the Rank Organisation had a different kind of film success - the Doctor films, the Carry On series and the comedies of Norman Wisdom. This closely focused study is a useful addition to the history of the British cinema. More about Rank the man and the Rank the business would have been welcome. Geoffrey Macnab's conclusion is necessarily pessimistic. 'In hindsight, it seems half comic, half tragic, that all Rank's efforts to set the British industry on its feet should spawn nothing more than a photocopying company and a leisure conglomerate. Bingo halls and casinos help prop up a company which emerged from Methodist halls and Sunday schools.'</p>

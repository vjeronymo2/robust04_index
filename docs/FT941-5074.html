			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe mulls move to bigger premises The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange is considering moving to larger premises, just over two years after the completion of its Cannon Bridge headquarters at a cost of around Pounds 35m. If trading volume continues to grow at the current rate of 100 per cent a year, 'the probability is that we will need to find a larger trading floor,' said Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive. Its growth rate has further accelerated this year, as the recent sharp falls in government bond prices have spurred activity in the futures markets. Liffe's most active contract, the Euromark future, trades around 300,000 lots a day, compared with 500,000 contracts a day for the Eurodollar and T-bond contracts traded in Chicago, the world's biggest contracts. Mr Hodson stressed that any decision will be made by Liffe's board and its members. The exchange could increase floor space at Cannon Bridge from 25,000 to 35,000sq ft but if the decision is taken to look for a new site, the exchange will aim for 100,000sq ft of trading space. Mr Hodson said that, given the size requirement, a new site would probably have to be built from scratch, at an estimated cost of around Pounds 100m. He added that, while other options would be considered, 'Liffe is at the very heart of the City of London' and would be unlikely to move outside the Square Mile. A decision is expected some time this year but no specific site is being considered at present.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Rejection by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea </F> [Khmer Rouge] Spokesman;" 6 February; place not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] I. Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Puppet  Hun Sen of the two-headed government on 5 February [words  indistinct] stated that the troops of the Vietnamese communist  puppets and two-headed government have already captured Anlung  Veng [Siem Reap Province]. This statement is designed to  conceal the serious defeats suffered by the Vietnamese communist  puppets, the Vietnamese communists, the alliance, and the  two-headed government.    II. It is worth recalling that the provisional two-headed  government formed in January 1993 was set up by the Vietnamese  communists and the alliance to further the Vietnamese war of  aggression against the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  [NADK] and other national resistance forces. In fact, the  government belongs to the Vietnamese communists, the United  States, and the alliance. People are all aware that the Para  troops [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] were jointly  created by the United States and the alliance in the time of In  Tam [former prime minister under Lon Nol regime] in 1975. The  United States and the alliance supplied money, material,  uniforms, food, camps, and training schools to the troops, which  are their (?important) forces. So when it saw the forces of the  Vietnamese communists, the United States, and the alliance  combining, the two-headed government also merged the two armies  [National Army of Independent Cambodia and Cambodian People's  Armed Forces] politically and militarily. This is why the  government has only raised its three-point policy demanding that  the NADK be dissolved, that Democratic Kampuchea's liberated  zones be surrendered to the government, and that the Party of  Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] lay down arms and stop fighting in a  war that continues to be inflamed by the Vietnamese communists  and the two-headed government.    III. Political, military, and diplomatic events during the  implementation of the Paris accord, during the protectorate of  UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], and during the  tenure of the two-headed government [words indistinct] have  clearly shown that the old and new enemies of our nation and  people continue to maintain their strategy of doing away with  our nation and people. However, historic, political, military,  diplomatic, and all other events in the past two years and at  present are clear evidence that the nation's enemies can never  destroy our national forces and people, who have struggled for  years to defend the nation, people, and (?race).    IV. In particular, the offensives launched during this 16th  dry season by (?the two-headed government), the Vietnamese  communists, the United States, and the alliance in the areas of  (?Phnum Chhat), Stoung-Kompong Thom, Malai, south Sisophon,  (?Pailin), Moung-Pursat, Kompong Chhnang, (?Kompong Thom),  Kampot, Koh Kong, Kompong Cham, [words indistinct], Preah  Vihear, (?Route 12), Route 68, and so on have been defeated one  after another. The invading troops and [words indistinct] have  been opposed and counterattacked by the national resistance  forces in the political, military, economic, and communications  fields everywhere.    V. Moreover, major offensives were launched by the  two-headed government with the aim of (?capturing) the Anlung  Veng area, but they were severely defeated for the first time in  early (?October) 1993, the second time at the end of January  1994, and the third time on 4 and 5 February 1994. In Phnom  Penh, 99 percent of the two-headed government belongs to the  Vietnamese communists, while in the provinces it is 100 percent.  The government also belongs to the United States and the  alliance 100 percent.    VI. The Vietnamese communist puppet and Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh of the two-heads-three-eyes government on 5  February agonizingly proclaimed their alleged victory at Anlung  Veng. But people (?say):    A. The fact that Puppet Hun Sen spoke [words indistinct]  about its success is because the puppets have actually suffered  a great defeat on the battlefield. They have not captured even  one inch captured of Anlung Veng. Most of their forces have  been destroyed in the fighting by malaria and typhoid due to the  lack of medicine, by starvation, and by the summary executions  of puppet leaders including Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, and Keo  Prasit. Their troops do not dare to go and fight and groups of  hundreds of puppet and para soldiers have fled the battlefields.  The 1, 2, 3, and 4 February 1994 statements of Vietnamese  communist puppets and two-headed government are also not  consistent. Puppet Hun Sen stated that Anlung Veng had already  been captured, while other puppets such as Tie Banh, Toan Chay,  and other officials of the two-headed government said they were  only moving in the direction of Anlung Veng, but had not yet  reached the area.    B. Some foreign reporters and radios broadcast the  two-headed government's (?exaggerated) report about Anlung Veng,  while others, citing various views, said Phnom Penh troops have  not reached the area yet. All this shows that the  two-heads-three-eyed government is in great fear and confusion  because it and its masters have been utterly defeated in their  major campaigns against Anlung Veng.    The people are asking why the two-headed government acts  like  that. Because it wants to takeover and use Anlung Veng as its  supply line to force Democratic Kampuchea to accept its three  conditions -- accepting the three conditions means that  Democratic Kampuchea will be destroyed. However, the turning  point the two-headed government wanted to attain has been  reversed; that is, it has been defeated completely on the  battlefield [words indistinct].    VII. The entire Cambodian nation and people are pleased to  see the defeat of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the  two-headed government on the Anlung Veng Battlefield. The NADK,  the people, and Democratic Kampuchea have attacked and routed  the strategies, tactics, and ambition of the Vietnamese  communists and the alliance and their proteges who are opposed  to the king's five points for national reconciliation. The  people and the masses, especially those in Phnom Penh, are  delighted to witness the defeat of the two-headed government,  and the success of Democratic Kampuchea with this victory will  allow the nation, people, and all patriotic forces to promote  King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point national reconciliation plan  [words indistinct].    [Dated] 6 February 1994    [Signed] NADK spokesman</p>

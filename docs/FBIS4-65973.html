			<p>BFN     [Text] The rout suffered by the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] at the hands of the security forces in recent days  has been admitted by Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the  organization. Ocalan severely warned the members of the  organization, saying that there has been an incredible number of  losses.    [Correspondent Fatih Yilmaz] According to available  information, Ocalan said in his message to PKK field commanders  the previous day that those responsible for the losses will be  punished. Ocalan demanded that those not fighting voluntarily be  dismissed from the organization, and called on the PKK to carry  out low risk operations such as laying mines, sabotage, and  putting up road blocks. The PKK conducted operations to lay  mines and roadblocks yesterday.    In his message, PKK leader Ocalan said the losses suffered  by  the organization in Pulumur and Dogubeyazit are unacceptably  high. He made the following assessment: The field commanders  are misleading me, the information they provide does not conform  with reality.    The PKK suffered huge losses during operations carried out  by  the security forces in the last few months.    Meanwhile, the mop-up operation launched by the security  forces on Cudi Mountain is continuing. It is reported that  major losses has been inflicted on the PKK.</p>

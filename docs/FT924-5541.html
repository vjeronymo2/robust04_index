			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Japanese workers lead on productivity BRITISH FACTORIES lack skilled supervisors and are characterised by in-fighting among shop-floor workers to curry favour with management, a study from the institute says. In a comparison of workforce characteristics at 10 UK plants run by Japanese companies, the study says British workers are well behind their Japanese counterparts in terms of productivity, solving problems, taking breaks from work and identifying with the company line. UK shop-floor employees score higher than their Japanese counterparts in gaining qualifications, but that is mainly because these can act as passports to better jobs with other companies. More encouraging for the UK is that some aspects of the Japanese work ethos seem to be taking root in the 10 Japanese 'transplants'. The study does not identify the companies concerned but says they are mainly in electronics and car manufacturing. The study says that in the transplants 'the rate of knowledge acquisition by UK workers was broadly comparable with that in Japan'. It adds that while British employees have also taken on some of the competitive characteristics of their Japanese counterparts, in terms of wanting to outperform rival companies. Skilled factory supervisors - the all-rounders of the production line who link between management and machine operators - are, however, 'almost impossible to find' in the UK. The study defines a good supervisor as someone familiar with technology, machines and production practices who is skilled in human relations and good at creating a team spirit. The study says a typical UK manufacturing employee who hits on new insights into production processes tends to keep such facts to him-self. That is done 'so as to boost his personal standing with the company relative to his fellows'. Workers in the Japanese transplants have improved in that area, being keener to share ideas after having learnt something about the value Japanese companies give to teamwork. In seven of the 10 plants, productivity was lower than the equivalent factories run by the same companies in Japan. UK workers beat their Japanese equivalents in terms of productivity in only one case. British shop-floor employees scored poorly in their ability to repair faults on the production line or use their initiative to maintain plant to stop it breaking down. They tended to seek excuses to take a rest from work, such as during a breakdown or a component shortage. The study emerged from detailed questioning of Japanese and British managers in the plants about how equivalent sets of workers com-pared in Japan or the UK.</p>

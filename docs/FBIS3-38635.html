			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed SK: "War Crimes In Former Yugoslavia: </F> Switzerland Recognizes Authority of International Tribunal"; as  released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Bern, 2 Feb (ATS) -- Switzerland recognizes the  authority of the international tribunal for judging war crimes  in the former Yugoslavia. On Wednesday [2 February], the  Federal Council decided that Switzerland will autonomously  implement UN resolution 827 although it is not a member of the  organization. It thinks that the tribunal's action is likely to  strengthen the implementation of international humanitarian law.  Switzerland has already helped to draw up the legal bases.    UN Security Council resolution 827 of 25 May 1993 creates a  tribunal to judge people presumed responsible for serious  violations of international humanitarian law on the territory of  the former Yugoslavia since 1991. This tribunal began its work  last November. Comprising 11 judges elected by the UN General  Assembly, it has its seat in The Hague. A prosecutor appointed  by the UN Security Council -- Venezuelan Ramon Escovar-Salom --  will be responsible for prosecution. All states are obliged to  cooperate with the tribunal whether or not they are UN members.  <H5>  An Urgent Decree </H5>   Switzerland is not legally bound by the UN resolutions,  because it is not a UN member. The Federal Council can,  however, decide to implement them autonomously. Switzerland,  the depositary of the Geneva Conventions for the Protection of  the Victims of War, has a special moral responsibility in this  sphere. It condemns violations of international humanitarian  law, especially in the former Yugoslavia.    On Wednesday, the Federal Council tasked the federal justice  and police, and foreign affairs departments with drawing up an  urgent federal decree of a general nature relating to  implementation of resolution 827. The statute of the tribunal,  which accompanies the resolution, will also be implemented. A  legislative document is necessary in view of the obligations  which the resolution imposes on the Swiss authorities.  <H5>  Active Contribution </H5>   Switzerland has contributed to drawing up the legal bases  for  the tribunal. A meeting of about a dozen legal advisers of the  European countries' foreign ministries was held in Geneva on 8  and 9 February last year. Switzerland has also drawn up a  report on serious violations of the Geneva Conventions and  international humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia, which  was submitted to the United Nations in November. This report  was based on evidence from Bosnians, mainly Muslims, who have  taken refuge in Switzerland.</p>

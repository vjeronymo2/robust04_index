			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Industry's growth plans 'flawed' MANUFACTURING companies are forecasting a bright future for the next three years but their growth plans are 'fundamentally flawed', says a study by Pera International, one of Europe's leading business consultancies. A Pera survey of 345 companies released this week - mainly in mechanical engineering, medical engineering, and the electronics and automotive industries - finds that 82 per cent expect business growth this year and 96 per cent predict significant growth within three years. But nearly a quarter of respondents admitted they could not develop a growth strategy, while nearly a third could not implement development plans. In addition a fifth were unable to pinpoint their company's own strengths, identify new business opportunities or recognise the factors critical to their success. The survey found that nearly 90 per cent of manufacturers had survived the recession by cutting costs. This made them 'leaner' and more efficient but had not increased or even protected their market share. Pera says: 'Come the economic upturn, these companies will not be able to capitalise on their own leanness. 'Many of their planned growth strategies cannot bear fruit, due to a lack of specific skills to implement them. A lack of adequate financial resources is also likely to scupper many hungry companies' plans for growth.' It believes growth plans are flawed because of a worrying fundamental inconsistency. Manufacturers, understandably cautious, are mainly looking to develop within their current core business. But if most organisations are adopting the same develop-ment strategies only the 'outstanding few' will gain the increased market share they expect, says Pera. Most manufacturers surveyed also gave their employees, especially the sales team, little credit for the company's success. 'This attitude contradicts respondents' desires to grow the business,' says Pera. 'The traditional notion that 'the product sells itself' still prevails.'

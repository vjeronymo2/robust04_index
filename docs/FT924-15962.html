It incurred a reduced loss of Pounds 466,000, against Pounds 523,000, on turnover of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 6.29m). Operating profit of continuing activities was cut from Pounds 335,000 to Pounds 191,000. Head office costs took Pounds 376,000 (Pounds 260,000) and interest Pounds 281,000 (Pounds 68,000).

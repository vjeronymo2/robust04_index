			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Airport dismisses safety allegations Manchester Airport, which faces a tough fight to get permission to build a second runway at a planning inquiry next month, last night denied aircraft were being endangered by problems with navigation aids. The allegations - seen in some quarters as part of a dirty-tricks campaign to try to discredit the airport - were contained in a Sunday newspaper report. The Civil Aviation Authority, which licenses airports for safety, supported Manchester's protests. 'If the CAA felt there was any problem, Manchester would not have a licence,' the authority said last night. The public inquiry begins on June 21. A report in The Sunday Telegraph alleged malfunctioning landing lights and inaccurate information from the airport's control tower on wind speed and direction. The airport was also criticised for only having one windsock, after investigation of a 1985 accident recommended more. The authority said one pilot had filed an 'occurrence report' this year after landing lights malfunctioned. Investigation had revealed electrical interference caused by maintenance work. The authority said that the incident was iso-lated. A second pilot's report of inaccurate wind-speed information is still being investigated. However, the authority said wind variations and gusts cannot be predicted, which is why pilots are trained to deal with them on landing. The airport said neither pilot had complained to the Manchester authorities, which are responsible for about 250,000 take-offs and landings a year. The CAA said only one windsock was needed. In an aircraft fire on the Manchester runway in 1985, lives may have been lost because the pilot turned the aircraft so that flames blew on to the fuselage. 'But more windsocks would not help in a similar situation at night when you cannot see them,' the authority said. Last year more than 13m people used Manchester, Europe's fastest-growing airport, which expects to pass Copenhagen to take sixth place in the European size league shortly. A second runway is widely supported in the region, particularly by business, but is opposed by some residents. It would increase capacity to 30m passengers early next century.</p>

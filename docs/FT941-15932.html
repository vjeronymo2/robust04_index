			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex/Nymex vote expected in March The year-long merger negotiations between New York's metals exchange, Comex, and its big energy market, Nymex, are progressing, with a vote of the two memberships on the merger plan expected in early March. Comex members last week agreed to defer electing a new Board of Governors until the merger talks are completed, an action interpreted by many in the futures industry as a vote of confidence in the merger plan. Since Nymex first suggested taking over the smaller exchange last April with a Dollars 20m bid negotiators have had to overcome historical antagonism between the memberships of the two exchanges, and sentiment that Comex's record year in 1993 might reduce the urgency of a merger for the smaller exchange. Comex's board of governors will vote on a formal merger package presented by Nymex on January 19. If the plan passes the board, members of both exchanges will be asked to approve the merger.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Chief of General Staff Pays </F> Secret Visit to Beijing"]    [Text] Beijing -- Journalists' attempts to discover the  substance of the talks between Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the  Russian Army General Staff, and his Chinese colleagues have been  unsuccessful.    Following General Pavel Grachev's trip to Beijing ties  between the two neighboring powers' armies have been  strengthening. Contacts are developing between neighboring  military districts and there has been an exchange of visits by  naval vessels. All these are a natural consequence of the  normalization of relations between Moscow and Beijing.    But observers in Asian states bordering China and in the  West  are asking whether the sale of Russian arms to China will pose a  threat to the states of South and Southeast Asia. After all,  China has some outstanding territorial problems with some of  them.    Doubts have arisen above all because many aspects of the  military-technical ties between China and Russia have been  cloaked in secrecy. For instance, a Western colleague showed me  the text of the agreement on cooperation between the two defense  ministers. One article in it envisages that Russia will send its  specialists to China to overhaul arms and to train Chinese  personnel. Is this article present in the agreement?    By avoiding the press General Kolesnikov has essentially  turned his official visit into a semisecret meeting, providing  grounds for new suspicions in Asian capitals.</p>

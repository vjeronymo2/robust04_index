			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATTS, 25 YEARS POST-REBELLION  </P> <P> In "A Quarter-Century of Slipping Backward" (Commentary, Aug. 10) Profs. Melvin  Oliver, Walter Farrell and James Johnson sing an all-too-familiar refrain  regarding the plight of African Americans in the Watts area.  </P> <P> It is a song which many African American leaders chant not only about Watts but  also about similar areas in the nation. The main lyric is: "Let's blame all of  our problems on someone else."  </P> <P> It is the fostering of that attitude which, along with real and alleged  discrimination, establishes the foundation for the retardation of social and  economic progress in Watts and similar areas.  </P> <P> A destructive climate is created by many in the black leadership who, like the  professors who authored the article, look outward to fix blame rather than  inward for the formulation of constructive and creative self-help solutions.  </P> <P> MILTON GAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

CP93&hyph;618&hyph;000 and 001. In this proceeding, PGT is requesting a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity under Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, and Part 157, Subpart A of the Commission's Regulations. PGT seeks to construct and operate two extensions of its mainline facilities_the Coyote Springs Extension and the Medford Extension. These extensions would be used to provide firm transportation service to Portland General Electric Company (Portland General) and WP Natural Gas, a division of The Washington Water Power Company (Wash. Water), respectively. PGT proposes to recover the incremental cost-of-service of the respective extensions through surcharges to its existing FTS&hyph;1 Rate Schedule. In this amendment, PGT details the specific surcharge rate treatment for the volumes to be shipped by Portland General and Wash. Water over the two proposed extensions. PGT's proposal is more fully set forth in the application and amendments which are on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, PGT requests approval of a deferred cost recovery mechanism for part of Wash. Water's service on the Medford Extension. PGT states that the deferred mechanism does not alter the proposed incremental rate structure for service on the proposed extensions. PGT also states that the deferred mechanism is designed to permit Wash. Water to remain competitive with competing electric rates in its service area, and afford PGT an opportunity to recover the life cycle cost-of-service for the service for Wash. Water's on a deferred basis. PGT proposes to file annual reports containing the adjusted Wash. Water rate and related information on any deferred balance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, PGT proposes to recover the cost of extensions based upon a straight-line depreciation schedule which is equal to the length of the transportation agreements for each extension. For service to Portland General over the Coyote Springs Extension, the term of the contract is 20 years. For service to Wash. Water over the Medford Extension the, the term of the contracts is 30 years, (there are two contracts between PGT and Wash. Water). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> October 14, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> However,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> any person who has already filed an intervention(s) in Docket No. CP93&hyph;618,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , need not file again.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

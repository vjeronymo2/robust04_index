			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metsa-Serla rises to FM151m Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, yesterday reported a brisk rise in profits after financial items in the first four months of the year to FM151m (Dollars 27.4m) from FM108m in the same period last year. The improvement came in spite of a small fall in net sales to FM2.88bn from FM3.02bn. Metsa said delivery volumes for many products had risen sharply and prices had also bottomed out, with the prices for market pulp, fine paper and sawn goods in particular rising quite quickly. But some of the lift provided last year by a sharp devaluation of the Finnish markka had been eroded by a strengthening of the currency this year. Operating profits for the paper and paperboard sector fell to FM56m from FM193m, but Metsa said this reflected the start-up in January of a film-coated offset production line at the Kirkniemi paper mill. Operating profits for corrugated board, tissue and chemicals were down at FM116m, compared with FM156m. But the sawn goods and pulp division saw operating profits rise to FM112m from FM71m. Net financial expenses fell to FM72m from FM249m.</p>

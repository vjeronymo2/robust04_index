			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "jost.": "Sluggish Trade With Arab Region"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- There was a clear slump in Austria's  foreign trade with Arab countries last year. Exports and  imports decreased by 11.4 percent each. However, with just  under 2.8 billion Austrian schillings [AS], the total trade  surplus with these countries was well over AS600 million higher  than last year's surplus.    This surplus could even be surpassed this year if the  present  positive trend continues, Egon Winkler, foreign economy chief of  the Federal Economic Chamber, stated at a news conference. In  the first quarter of this year, exports to this world region  increased by 14.9 percent, while imports from there decreased by  14.3 percent.    Winkler blamed the decline in the oil price and the late  effects of the Gulf war for the decrease in trade with the Arab  countries. So far, it has not been possible to make up for  these losses. Because of the UN embargo against Iraq, this  important export market where Austrian goods valued at 2.2  billion schillings had, after all, been ordered before was also  lost. However, the peace process provides new hope for an  economic recovery of the region. In the near future, the  foreign trade organization will deal in detail with relations  with the state of Palestine, which is just developing, he said.    By far, the most important trade partner is Saudi Arabia,  which bought Austrian goods for more than 2.5 billion  schillings. Austria's imports from there, which consist almost  entirely of oil, account for 2.1 billion schilings.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Moslems and Christians clash in Egypt AT LEAST 13 people were killed yesterday in clashes between Moslems and Christians in Upper Egypt. It was among the worst outbreaks of sectarian violence in many years and is certain to prompt calls for heightened security. Egypt's Interior Ministry blamed feuding between Christian and Moslem families over the purchase of a house in a village near Assiut. Concern is growing about tension between the two communities, especially in Upper Egypt. Christians account for about 10 per cent of Egypt's population of 58m, but they are most numerous in Upper Egypt.</p>

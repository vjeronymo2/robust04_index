			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Investors threaten Marriott plan THE controversial 'demerger' plan at Marriott Corporation, the large US hotel and management services company, faced a new potential hurdle yesterday when a group of investors who hold Marriott preferred shares said that they might take legal action to oppose the scheme. The investor group made a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities industry watchdog, in which it said that it held a 6.4 per cent beneficial stake in the company (once its preferred stock and liquid yield option notes are converted). The group added that it believed the plan was 'unlawfully coercive of, and detrimental to, the holders of preferred stock'. The group comprises a handful of institutional investors, including Harvard College and UBS Securities, who together speak for about half the 4m convertible preferred shares in issue. In the filing, the investors' group said it was seeking a change to the demerger plan which would improve the treatment of preferred stockholders. It added that it would seek compensation if the plan went through as currently proposed. Marriott said that it had not seen the filing and could not comment on it. No talks between the company and investor group are believed to have taken place, although the preferred stockholders said in their filing that they were willing to negotiate. Marriott's plan to split itself into two separately-quoted companies - one containing its financially-healthy hotels business and the other, its property assets together with most of the group's debt - has already provoked anger among its bondholders. One group of bondholders, which includes some of the largest institutional investors in the US, withdrew its opposition after Marriott revised the demerger plan earlier this year. However, talks with a second group of unhappy bondholders, led by PPM America, part of the UK's Prudential insurance group, are still continuing.</p>

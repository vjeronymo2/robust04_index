			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Westminster Health Care valued at Pounds 133m WESTMINSTER Health Care, the nursing home group, has priced its new issue at 260p a share, valuing the group at Pounds 132.6m. The issue will raise Pounds 63m for the company, cutting its debt to Pounds 15m, or 20 per cent of shareholders' funds. The float involves the sale of 25.6m shares, 51 per cent of the total. All have been placed with institutions, but 25 per cent, 6.4m shares, are available through a public offer which closes on April 7. Applications from employees will have priority for up to 10 per cent of the public offer. Dealings are due to start on April 15. None of the existing shareholders are selling in the issue. National Medical Enterprises, the US healthcare group which currently holds 90 per cent of the shares will be diluted to 42 per cent. At the issue price the shares are on a prospective p/e of 16.7 on forecast pro forma earnings per share of 15.6p, based on the company's estimate of pro forma pre-tax profits for the year to end May of Pounds 9.3m. A notional net dividend of 3.75p for 1992-93 gives a gross yield of 1.8 per cent. By Tuesday evening the group had received over 17,000 requests for copies of the mini-prospectus. The issue has been underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and the brokers are de Zoete &amp; Bevan. COMMENT As one of the leading operators in a fast-growing industry there are few clouds on WHC's horizon. One might be today's switch to the new state funding system. Although this should be beneficial on balance, there could be some dislocation short term. Another is the matter of financing the rapid growth, which will cost Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m a year. The new money will fund the next two or three years growth, but after that WHC may be back for more. However, if growth continues at recent rates, shareholders should be happy to put more money in. Compared with Takare, the market leader, WHC is more conservative on capitalising interest and has a higher tax charge. It also accepts a marginally lower occupancy rate - 94 instead of 98 per cent in established homes - in order to achieve what it regards as a better mix of residents, with more private payers. The issue has been priced at a discount to Takare, and given an improving climate for flotations, should go well.</p>

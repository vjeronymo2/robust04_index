			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ra'id Salihah] </F>   [Text] Swiftly, and without any prior notice, the security  agencies arrested every member of Abu-Nidal's [Sabri al-Banna]  Fatah-the Revolutionary Council group in Jordan in an operation  that lasted no more than 48 hours. The operation started  Saturday [19 February] morning and ended Sunday evening.    Despite the fact that the security agencies are keeping a  tight lid on this swift operation, preliminary information  leaked to AL-BILAD by well-informed sources reveals that the  operation was only a warning message and a precautionary  measure. At the same time, these sources confirmed that Syrian  and Lebanese security agencies have separately obtained  confessions from the individuals accused in the assassination of  martyr Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah [Jordanian diplomat assassinated in  Beirut on 29 January] to the effect that they had organizational  links with Abu-Nidal's group. These sources also believe that  members of the Abu-Nidal group in Jordan were deceived by their  leadership, which convinced them that it had no connection  whatsoever to al-Ma'ayitah's assassination.    AL-BILAD obtained a highly-classified file, supported by  documents and information. The file shows, beyond any doubt,  that some members of Abu-Nidal group intended to carry out  bloody operations in Jordan. This was revealed in a secret  leaflet, circulated on a very limited basis inside the group,  which shows that the group is furious with the security agencies  despite clear attempts by the group leaders in Jordan to label  relations between the Revolutionary Council and Jordan as very  calm.    The latest Revolutionary Council statement to reveal this  hostile attitude appeared on 29 November 1993. The communique,  stamped by the movement's official seal, cites a statement  issued by the Central Committee of the Palestine National  Liberation Movement-General Command of the al-'Asifah Forces-The  Revolutionary Council. The statement says "...we urge every Arab  citizen living on the land of our nation to realize the threats  of the Judaization campaign. This campaign threatens destructive  civil wars, which have started in Palestine today and are  expected to explode on the Jordanian arena in the next few  months. It is regrettable that in Jordan an agency, which has  no work or mission but to pursue our movement's members and  mujahidin, continues to exist." The same statement also notes  that operations will be carried out this year without specifying  where. The statement says "... we also stress to the concerned  factions, which claim responsibility for operations we had the  honor to carry out, that we cannot keep silent after 1 January  1994."    The statement vehemently attacks Tunisia, Algeria, and  Morocco. The same attack was reaffirmed in another statement  issued by the Revolutionary Council on 1 January 1994 on the  29th anniversary of the movement [Fatah-the Revolutionary  Council celebrates the same founding anniversary as that of the  'Arafat-led, PLO mainstream Fatah Movement]. However, it is  worth noting that this statement did not mention Jordan at all.    This information seems bland when compared to the  information leaked to AL-BILAD about the abortion of an  operation to smuggle missiles from Lebanon to the group in  Jordan in order to carry out two serious operations in the  Jordanian arena. One of these operations was aimed at blowing  up a very sensitive target in Amman while the other was aimed at  assassinating an important Palestinian figure in Amman. The  planned date for carrying out these two operations was not  clear. However, the information indicated that the operations  were to be carried out on a single day during an occasion  described as an important Palestinian occasion.    In another development, elements of the Abu-Nidal group have  leaked information that an agreement on clear constants has been  reached with Jordan. The most prominent of these constants is  that, as a group in Jordan, they are not responsible for any  publication the group sends from outside Jordan and that they  are not committed to presenting any information on this issue.  Moreover, the group stopped issuing the their weekly  publication, which is of limited distribution, due to emergency  circumstances.    According to AL-BILAD's information, pressure was also  brought to bear by delaying the arrival in the Jordanian market,  or banning altogether, the magazine FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH, the  mouthpiece of the group.    AL-BILAD's investigations also revealed another plot by the  Abu-Nidal group in Jordan, aimed at opening relations with  Fatah-'Arafat cadres that have connections inside the occupied  Arab territories, especially in terms of military action.    As part of this, the Abu-Nidal group's activities focused on  Fatah cadres that oppose Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's  actions, that have reservations about the peace agreement with  Israel, or that have military groups or political activities in  the occupied territories.    Part of this plan was an unsuccessful attempt by head the of  the group in Jordan ('A.Q.) [initials as published] at contacts  with 'Abbas Zaki, member of Fatah Central Council. Zaki was  visited by this man, who came out with the impression that he  could not cooperate or coordinate with Zaki.    The bases for cooperation outlined by Abu-Nidal elements are  formed on a concentration on issues inside the occupied  territories, on building an armed structure, and on preparedness  for financing and facilitating the purchase of weapons.    Our investigations also revealed another secret plot by the  Abu-Nidal group aimed at pursuing the pro-'Arafat elements and  obtaining the greatest amount of information on their lives.  The implementation of this major plan began a few months ago  with noticeable briskness. According to AL-BILAD information,  the required information concentrated on the following:    1. Details about these people's houses and their addresses.  Is it rented or personal property? What is the rent or how  much does the house cost?    2. Their financial situation; their personal property, bank  accounts, cars, real estate, ranches, shops.    3. Names of sons, daughters; their schools, behavior,  friends, how much money they spend. From which supermarket the  family shops.    4. Social relations; what level; restaurants frequented by  the them.    5. Female relations: following up these relations and  documenting them.    Arab security sources told AL-BILAD that the Abu-Nidal group  elements had claimed that the group did not want to do any harm  to the pro-'Arafat' men, in accordance with a gentleman's  agreement with Jordan. They said that all this information had  been collected for future consideration and that their dossiers  would be reopened in occupied Palestine later when the  opportunity arose so that the Palestinian people would know the  bloodsuckers who wasted their resources. Then the people would  sentence them to death and confiscate all their possessions.    Security reports available to us also reveal another plot  being implemented in complete secrecy. It reveals in detail how  the new Abu-Nidal elements used to be dispatched to Iran and  returned back to Jordan.    The amazing details show that youths coming from the  occupied  territories carrying permits allowing them a long time for study  or tourism in Russia were later sent to Azerbaijan. Form there  they would go to Iran by land through channels well-known to  Iranian authorities. Their passports would not be stamped at  their entry to Iran.    Reports say that the new elements would be grouped and  trained by special and advanced courses. They would then be  returned to Jordan in the same way. Those residing in the  occupied territories, would leave Jordan for these territories.  Dozens of Arab and Palestinian students studying in Russia  would be recruited and sent to Iran for training during their  university holidays.</p>

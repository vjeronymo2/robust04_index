			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: 'The yen are too few, the ideas too old' - A look at the political power exerted by Tokyo's ministries WHEN Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the opposition Liberal Democratic party's policy research council, was questioned after the announcement of the package, he suggested that the yen were too few and most of the ideas were old LDP proposals. Mr Hashimoto did not specify whether the former LDP government had proposed that Japan Tobacco donate 50,000 ash receptacles to the public, but the state-owned tobacco company's contribution was counted in the package announced by the coalition government yesterday. JT's ashtrays were a symbol of the determination of state-owned companies and ministries to donate to the campaign in order to revive and deregulate the economy, though without doing themselves or the national budget much damage. The inability of the seven-party government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa to extract more funds from the finance ministry and, perhaps, more ashtrays from JT, is a measure of the difficulties that all Japanese governments face in dealing with the bureaucracy. Most of the deregulation proposals have been raised before, and there is a sense within the bureaucracy that the Hosokawa coalition will not last long enough to implement changes that would greatly undermine the power of the ministries. There is also surprise among Japanese companies at the willingness of Mr Hosokawa to believe the finance ministry's warnings that a slowing of tax revenue has made it impossible to produce a larger flow of 'real water', as fresh funds are described. A senior official at one of Japan's Big Four brokerages said he was not surprised that Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, has followed the ministry's line; this was because he is a former finance ministry bureaucrat. 'But the whole government appears to be in the pocket of the finance ministry,' the official said. Mr Hosokawa was unable to win an income tax cut from the ministry, but still argued that the package will have an effect. 'I don't think this is good enough, but I believe that we have done the best we could do at the moment.' One sign of the problems faced by Mr Hosokawa's deregulation campaign was a provision in the package giving ministries two years to suggest revisions to anti-monopoly laws, which still allow the formation of industry cartels. The seven-party coalition is divided over the emphasis that should be given to deregulation, providing the ministries with a good excuse to delay changes to the more sensitive issues, such as the abolition of cartels tolerated under the present law. Leaders of the Japan Renewal party, one of the coalition partners, have suggested that Mr Hosokawa should concentrate on introducing political reforms, and not allow himself to be 'distracted' by economic and foreign policies. The coalition has promised to introduce changes to the electoral system this year, and Mr Hosokawa has indicated he will resign if the promise is not kept. The presumption is that an election will be called when the changes are made and and a new government formed. But Mr Hosokawa's chances of another term as prime minister in a new system will depend on public perceptions of his ability as administrator. The economic downturn is putting these skills to the test. LDP officials such as Mr Hashimoto insist that the coalition's policies are a reheating of the former government's ideas and that Mr Hosokawa has even repeated turns of phrase first used by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the former prime minister. Mr Hosokawa is fortunate that the LDP, which ruled for 38 years, is still prone to division. Six MPs from the LDP quit their factions yesterday in protest at the party's inability to reform itself by abolishing the system of intra-party factions.</p>

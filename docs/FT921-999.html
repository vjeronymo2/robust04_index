			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian field upgraded by 20% STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, said yesterday that it had upgraded its assessment recoverable crude oil reserves in the North Sea Veslefrikk field by 20 per cent to 275m barrels from 230m, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. After a thorough evaluation of the field's reserves and two year's production experience, Statoil said that the upgrade of oil reserves in place, meant that the field's oil recovery factor was also increased. 'The oil zone in the southern extension of the field appears thicker than previously assumed. In addition, the production performance of the reservoir outstripped expectations,' Statoil explained. The value of the upgrade, measured at an oil price of Dollars 17.70 a barrel, is estimated at about NKr5bn (Pounds 450m). Statoil said that it was also considering a major gas injection programme to help maintain pressure in the field's reservoir to keep production at the highest possible level over the longest possible time. At the same time gas injection, combined with water injection which is currently under way, could further boost recovery from Veslefrikk. Veslefrikk currently produces at a daily rate of 70,000, barrels and is considered to be at its peak output level. In the last five years of the field's life production could fall to 15,000 barrels a day. The field came on stream in 1989 and is currently producing from seven wells out of a planned total of 19. Three wells will be drilled this year. Statoil added that, based on reservoir information, placement of future wells has also been adjusted.</p>

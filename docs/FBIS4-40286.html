The speaker of the State Duma noted it was his first meeting  with the head of the German Government and he hopes trustworthy  relations may be established between him and the federal  chancellor similar to those between the Russian president and  Helmut Kohl.    Ivan Rybkin also said during the meeting Helmut Kohl and he  were discussing history of the two countries' relations, which  "in its greater part was a period of good relations and  interaction for the good of our two nations."    Speaking of perspectives for cooperation between parliaments  of Russia and Germany, the speaker said he had always stood for  cooperation to be absolutely specific, that is "at the level of  committees." At [as received] that, Rybkin said, if need be, it  would be extremely useful to acquire experience of law-making  activity of German parliament.</p>

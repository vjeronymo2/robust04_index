			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Turning the tide for the country's lost waterways: David Bolton says new laws are needed to protect our smaller canals restoring a long-lost link between the rivers Thames and Severn - was acclaimed at the time as the peak of success in post-war waterways revival. Yet, it was by no means the end of the story. Since the public woke up some 25 years ago to the fact that the canal network - criss-crossing the country for 2,000 miles - provides an unrivalled outlet for water-based leisure activities, there has been increasing pressure to restore those waterways lost already through dereliction and change of use. The speed of restoration has increased visibly as government funding in various forms has replaced, or at least topped-up, previous voluntary efforts. Together, there are more than 100 schemes being actively pursued from the Wey and Arun in Sussex to the Forth and Clyde in Scotland. The spotlight has moved to the north east, where the recent award of a Pounds 2.3m derelict land grant to Sowerby Metropolitan District Council means that the Rochdale canal will be reconnected with the rest of the system within two years by eliminating a modern car-park which blocks it at present. The grant brings the total spent on restoring some 20 miles of canal to about Pounds 17m. The neighbouring Huddersfield canal has already benefitted from substantial government funding so that more than half of its 19 miles have been restored in just 10 years. It is likely that these trans-Pennine canals can be fully reopened by the turn of the century, creating a new cruising ring for pleasure boating in fine mountain scenery. There is, however, a flaw to this success story. Most of these canals are administered by British Waterways, a nationalised body established by the Transport Act 1968, and are described collectively and ignominiously in the Act as 'the remainder'. None of them are listed by name. Under the Act, 11 navigations linked with ports of entry, such as the Caledonian and Gloucester and Sharpness, are classified as commercial waterways, while 28 canals are defined as cruiseways, acknowledging their potential for leisure use. A statutory duty to maintain both categories in a suitable condition was laid on British Waterways by the Act, but the future of the 'remainder' was left to the mercy of economic and political events. The Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council, also set up by the Act, was however specifically asked to advise on adding to, or reducing, the list of cruising waterways. Although IWAAC did, indeed, make detailed studies of the unclassified canals early on - and recommended strongly that a number should be accorded the guarantee of cruiseway status - little has actually been done in the intervening 24 years, except for the upgrading of some 85 miles 10 years ago). In its draft Customer Charter, British Waterways has continued to draw a distinction between the groupings, though an advance has been made in publishing by name the full list of more than 50 previously unclassified canals. Disappointingly, the issue has not been addressed in the private Bill that British Waterways is hoping to press through the current session of Parliament in the face of bitter opposition from many representative groups. After years of decline and neglect, the South Stratford Canal Act became a famous test case in 1960 when the government agreed, after protracted negotiations, to allow the National Trust to undertake the first-ever canal restoration. After three years of extremely hard work by volunteers, the official reopening took place in 1964. Three years ago, the Trust handed the canal back to British Waterways, together with a grant of Pounds l5m to cover a backlog of maintenance. The longer and more complex Kennet and Avon took 28 years to restore at a cost of Pounds 2.7m, mostly raised from charitable donations. A further appeal is being launched for Pounds l8m to tackle the perennial water shortage. British Waterways is taking the initiative in starting to restore the Grantham canal, now no longer threatened with possible subsidence from coal mining. The Montgomery canal has enjoyed powerful support from the Prince's Trust and local authorities. And Britain's longest (three miles) tunnel, Standedge, on the Huddersfield canal, is expected to be the next target for restoration. British Waterways now finds itself in an embarrassing position on this issue. It has co-operated with voluntary societies and local authorities in facilitating restoration; yet is prevented by the 1968 Act from providing proper maintenance of these reopened canals unless local authorities guarantee continuing financial support. But as still more government and EC funding, together with substantial private investment in waterside amenities, is poured into the worthy cause of reviving a wasted environmental asset, the time has come when the out-dated classification of the 1968 Act should be revoked, and full recognition and permanent rights accorded to the remaining canals. Having been brought back into use, our canals now deserve to be assured of a long lease of life.

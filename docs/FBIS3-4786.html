			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- Pak Yong-su, head of  the North side to the working contact for the exchange of  special envoys between the North and the South, in his telephone  message to the chief delegate of the South side today notified  that the North will go to the South side's portion of Panmunjom  at 10:00 [0100 GMT] March 3, following appropriate procedures of  travel, to have the fourth working contact.    "We consider that the South side's stand for the resumption  of the working contact for the exchange of special envoys is  motivated by its acceptance of our demand for a stop to all the  large-scale nuclear war exercises against the dialogue partner  and renunciation of 'an international cooperation system' over  the nuclear issue," the message said.    Recalling that the South side had created artificial  obstacles to the working contact, continuing adventurous nuclear  war manoeuvres, it said: "If the South side approached the  exchange of special envoys between the two sides with sincerity,  the working contact would have been concluded long ago and  special envoys would have traveled to Pyongyang and Seoul, and  the urgent pending questions raised between the North and the  South would have been solved."</p>

When the Year of the  Rooster is replaced by the Year of the Dog, another green spring  is coming. The first solar term of the Beginning of Spring has  passed and the Spring Festival has also passed. Farm work all  over the vast land of China is getting busy from the south to  the north.    The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  made a decision on the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure, and the 29th to 36th points of the decision  especially discuss the rural work and the rural economy. The  central rural work conference also made concrete arrangements  for rural work and the rural economy. After that, the party  Central Committee and the State Council adopted a number of  policies and measures for rural work and the rural economy. All  this came like the life-giving spring breeze and rain, and  brought spring to the vast rural areas ahead of time.    What, then, are the main tasks in our current rural work?  They may be summarized in five phrases. That is, stabilizing  and improving basic policies; deepening reform; solving  prominent contradictions; concentrating strength to develop the  rural economy; and strengthening the position of agriculture as  the foundation for the national economy. In particular, the  link of deepening reform will play a leading and guiding role,  because the settlement of many things in rural work and the  rural economy have to rely on the deepening of reform.    As for deepening reform, for the time being, we should give  consideration mainly to the following three issues: First,  promoting the reasonable movement of production factors, giving  play to peasant initiative and rural economic units, raising  labor productivity and the utilization rate of all sorts of  resources. The joint-stock cooperative system is a new thing in  the course of reform, and it should be further advanced on the  basis of summing up experience. The most important thing for  township and town enterprises is to adopt flexible operational  mechanisms, which must not be given up. Of course, they should  continue to explore new organizational forms, rationalize  property rights relationships, and give better play to  competitive mechanisms. Second, establishing and perfecting the  rural market system. The most important thing in this regard is  to create good linkages between the rural and urban markets and  between industry and agriculture. The hundreds of millions of  peasant households should be properly linked with the big  markets. At present, various localities have created various  forms of agriculture-industry-trade integration and integrated  production-supply-marketing systems. They should be further  developed. Third, it is necessary to establish a state system  for guiding, protecting, regulating, controlling, and serving  agriculture, with stress laid on protection and service.    In the whole country, this year's reform intensity and depth  will be unprecedented. We can say that this year will be a  reform year in real terms. In this important year, we must  properly handle the relationship between reform, development,  and stability, and must maintain a stable political environment  and a favorable economic environment. To achieve this purpose,  we must first stabilize agriculture, ensure the sufficient  supply of farm products, prevent prices from fluctuating too  violently and keep price changes within the scope of social  endurance. Therefore, it is never a stereotyped expression to  call for strengthening the position of agriculture as the  foundation for the national economy and strengthening the rural  work. We must never neglect agriculture when the agricultural  situation is good, and must always attach importance to  agriculture when facing arduous tasks. An important link in the  adjustment of the economic structure is the proportions allotted  to agriculture and industry, in which the proportion of  agriculture in the national economy as a whole should be  increased. This is not only related to agriculture but also to  industry. At present, industry is not only facing a shortage of  funds, but more importantly, it is also facing a market problem.  Industrial products do not sell well and seriously over  stockpiled. Then, where is the biggest market for industrial  goods? It is in the vast rural areas. Without setting the  rural market in motion, we will not have a stable foundation for  industrial development, and the market for industrial products  will shrink. Therefore, adjusting the structure and  strengthening agriculture must not be just empty talk. From the  central to local authorities, all must adopt the guideline and  concrete measures for strengthening agriculture.</p>

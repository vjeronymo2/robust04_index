			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The suspect in Monday's [30  May] abortive attack on former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  has confessed that he had no intention to kill Hosokawa when he  fired a gunshot at a Tokyo hotel, police sources said Wednesday.    Rather, the sources said, Masakatsu Nozoe, 52, told police  investigators that he simply tried to "threaten" the 56-year-old  former premier who was at the Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo's  Shinjuku ward to attend a party.    But an investigation has revealed that Nozoe, who was  arrested immediately after he fired at the ceiling, had checked  into the hotel under a false name about five hours before the  incident, according to the police sources.    Nozoe had told police after his arrest that he fired a  gunshot because of Hosokawa's remarks on Japan's wartime  aggression and of Hosokawa's economic program.    On Tuesday, police searched the hotel and the Shinjuku  office  of the right-wing group "Shokonjuku," to which Nozoe had once  belonged.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Letter: Executives' pay should reflect value Sir, In 'The gravy train bumps along' (June 22), Robert Rice asks how the executive gravy train - including huge pay-offs for failure - can be stopped. Unfortunately, the problem is not just pay-for-performance. The fundamental structure of 'debt-equity' schemes is the true underlying problem. The sum of wages, retirement income and medical benefits, all senior liabilities of the firm, represent as much as 90 per cent of total compensation, with the 10 per cent remainder coming from equity claims in the form of variable pay, profit sharing, and shares or share options. This disequilibrium motivates managers to increase the firm's size, often with alarming results. A far more sensible alternative is to alter the weighting to something closer to 50-50. Moreover, bonuses should be tied to the most significant operating result associated with creating share value. Research indicates that economic value added (EVA) is as much as three times as important as earnings dividend growth, and cash flow. EVA is total capital multiplied by the difference between the rate of return on total capital and a cut-off or threshold rate of return for risk. To make maximum EVA an incentive, managers should receive a percentage of the amount of EVA as a first bonus, and a second bonus based on a percentage of the change (or improvement) in EVA. There should also be a distinction between declared and paid bonuses. I suggest only one-third be paid immediately and the remaining two-thirds be deposited into a bonus bank to be paid later. The two-thirds is subject to loss if the change in EVA next year and the year thereafter is sufficiently negative or if the manager/ employee leaves. A proportion of the bonus can be used to purchase share options that have a rising exercise price. More than 50 companies have implemented EVA incentive schemes and the results have been phenomenal. Boards of directors have aligned the interests of shareholders and managers, and realigned the distribution between senior liability claims and equity claims. Most importantly, there cannot be any pay-off for failure. Joel M Stern, managing partner, Stern Stewart &amp; Co, 40 West 57th, 20th floor, New York, NY 10019, US</p>

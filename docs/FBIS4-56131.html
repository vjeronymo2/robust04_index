			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- The Czech Army Command is  not trying to gloss over slack Army discipline, Czech Defense  Minister Antonin Baudys said in a statement today, responding to  a deputy. A blueprint for tightening Army discipline would be  ready by June 30, Baudys says in the statement.    Fifty-six percent of offenses committed by ordinary soldiers  break military codes, the statement reads, listing desertion,  disregard of the leave deadline, bullying and non-observance of  patrol and supervision duties as the most common violations.    The overall state of society is the most powerful single  factor influencing army discipline, Baudys says. Some blame  lies with officers and staffs but it is mostly non-commissioned  officers who have low standards of behavior and work, setting  the privates a bad example and even inciting trouble.    The standards of common soldiers worsen over the time  served.  The longer-serving soldiers have a negative attitude to service,  Baudys says. Broad measures involving civilian consulting  bodies will have to be adopted to stamp out bullying, the  statement reads.</p>

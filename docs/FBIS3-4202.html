			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Ling Chao: "Campaign To Give Shelter to </F> Street Kids"]    [Text] A national public awareness and fundraising  campaign aimed at helping the country's 200,000 homeless kids  will be launched next month in Beijing.    The initiative will raise money at home and abroad to  provide  shelter and schooling for the homeless street kids.    A host of metropolitan and provincial half-way housing  centres with primary school and practical education facilities  are in the pipeline according to sources at the Ministry of  Civil Affairs.    Some 200,000 homeless children between the ages of 4 and 11  have been thrown onto the streets by regional disasters,  poverty, broken families and inadequate pastoral care.    The full extent of the street urchins' plight was revealed  in  a recent major survey of over 1,000 street children.    The investigation found that: 38 percent of them left home  when their parents divorced, 23 percent ran away to escape being  beaten up by relatives for failing to get good school marks, 23  percent succumbed to the lure of social evils, like gambling or  stealing, 8 percent were abandoned for being mentally retarded  and 5 percent were forced onto the streets by poverty.    The remainder were made homeless when their parents were  jailed, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and United  Nations survey, which was conducted in Shanghai and Hunan,  Guangdong and Anhui provinces.    The kids survive by begging and sleep in the cities wharves  and railway stations at night, according to investigation, which  was financed to the tune of $100,000 by the United Nations  Children's Fund (Unicef).    And child homelessness, which is on the up and up, is  stretching government welfare resources.    Local authority camps have been set up offering food,  clothing and education in the last few years.    But much more social support is needed to answer the  children's needs.    Mortality and disability rates among homeless kids are high  and they are also prey to the temptations of crime, according to  regional investigators.    The Sino-UN investigation focused on how to keep kids off  the  streets. It also looked at education and protection of the  at-risk street children.    Similar investigations about street urchins lives have been  conducted in cities and provinces across the country over the  last four years or so.    In northeastern Jiamusi City, about 600 street children, 20  percent of the city's total vagrant population, were picked up  and sent back home by local metropolitan civil affairs agencies  between 1989 and 1991.    But within a year 500 kids below the age of 14 were back on  the streets again.    By the end of 1992 the city, which is in Heilongjiang  Province, was having to cope with 40 percent more homeless kids  than the previous year.    Shanghai picked up more than 3,000 child vagrants in 1992.    And 1,600 cases of juvenile homelessness, with the youngest  victim only 4-years-old, were reported in Shenyang, the  provincial capital of northeastern Liaoning.    China has over 300 million children.</p>

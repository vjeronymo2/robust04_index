			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin and Vitaliy </F> Chukseyev]    [Text] Washington, 19 Mar -- Vitaliy Churkin, Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister and the Russian president's special  envoy, has described the agreements concluded here on the  formation of a Muslim-Croat Bosnian federation as important, but  only the very first steps in a peaceful settlement of the  Bosnian conflict. He attended Friday's White House ceremony at  which the documents were signed. Alija Izetbegovic, president  of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian  Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman, and Kresimir Zubak, a representative of the Bosnian  Croats, appended their signatures to the documents.    On the same day Churkin arranged a news conference, at which  he declared that the agreement on a new Muslim-Croat state  formation, and especially the agreement on arranging  confederative ties between it and Croatia were of an interim  nature. It was a vital condition for a true settlement in  Bosnia that it preserved its territorial integrity and that the  Bosnian Serbs, therefore, took part in the peace process, the  high-ranking Russian diplomat explained.    Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent about  whether the agreement on confederative relations between the new  federation and Croatia might be an obstacle to the inclusion of  the Serbs within the federation, Churkin said: I don't think  so, since the agreement on a confederation with Croatia is of an  interim nature. Equally interim is the agreement on the  formation of the actual federation. In other words, both  documents may be changed if the Bosnian Serbs decide to become  involved in implementing them. I am sure that the Serbs will  demand some changes that will be in keeping with their views on  the future Bosnia. The Russian deputy foreign minister pointed  out that the territorial contradictions constituted one of the  main issues dividing the opposing sides today.    Churkin stressed the major role that is currently being  played in the process of settling the Bosnian conflict by  American and Russian diplomacy. He noted that the two  countries' interests in this respect were not opposed in  principle. He said that evidence of this was provided by the  praise for Russia's efforts that was expressed at the signing  ceremony by U.S. President Bill Clinton. Equally high praise for  Moscow's policy was forthcoming at the meeting that took place  on the same day with Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    During the visit by the Russian president's special envoy to  the American capital, he also had a conversation with German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. He held consultations with  Charles Redman, the American special envoy on Yugoslavia, and  met David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the co-chairmen of the  peace process in the former Yugoslavia.    Churkin told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that Russian  diplomacy would continue to play an active part in settling the  Bosnian conflict. He announced that he was flying on 19 March  to Zagreb to have further talks and to organize a meeting  between the sides, which are planned for the Russian Embassy on  25 March.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News in Brief THE sale of hotels and companies planned under Egypt's most serious move towards privatisation is likely to raise at least Dollars 150m, according to a consultant, Reuter reports from Cairo. Egypt has recently named four five-star hotels, other tourist facilities and some consumer product companies for what would be its biggest sale yet of state-owned assets. 'The companies for sale are worth not less than Dollars 150m,' Mr Ahmed Shawki, a consultant involved in the deals, said. Economists expect most companies to be auctioned off rather than publicly floated on Cairo's stock market. The for-sale list includes the Shepherd and Sheraton hotels in Cairo, the Hilton hotel in Luxor, the Oberoi in Aswan, luxury Nile pleasure boats and tourist village projects. No date has yet been fixed for the sales. ***** AOYAMA TRADING, the Japanese discount clothing retailer with chain stores in mainly suburban areas, plans to launch seven retail outlets in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China this year, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. It will establish a wholly-owned subsidiary to set up four retail stores in Taiwan and hopes eventually to increase the number of outlets to about 60. The company's plan also calls for one retail store in Hong Kong, one in Shanghai and another in Shenzhen. ***** WHARF Communications, part of the Wharf (Holdings) group, is to take a stake in a Sino-Hong Kong joint venture to set up a cable television station in Chengdu, capital of China's Sichuan province, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Wharf will take 40 per cent of the consortium with the remaining 60 per cent split equally between Wharf chairman, Mr Peter Woo, and MKI Corp. The consortium will then buy 50 per cent of Sichuan Allday TV Development, which will initially invest Yn33m (Dollars 5.5m) in the project. The remaining 50 per cent will be held by China-owned Sichuan Province Cable TV Enterprise Development.</p>

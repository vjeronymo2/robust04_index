The Commissioner also announced that he would begin  intensive study of the future of relations with the countries of  Central and East Europe in the field of agriculture. He also  presented the farmers with a "much better assessment and  prospects than some of us had thought some months ago, even  weeks ago." The implementation of the reform of the Common  Agricultural Policy [CAP] allowed for the withdrawal of 4.7  million hectares (more than the forecasts for this year), which  largely contributed in maintaining cereal production at a level  which "is not excessive," 165 million hectares. The set-aside  regime will, moreover, become more attractive as premiums are  increased, its applications widened and the administrative  procedures simplified. Finally, the agreement on the Uruguay  Round allows for protection to be increased and to enlarge the  Community's market shares "in third solvent countries" while  substantially lightening its budget thanks to the lifting of  export refunds. But, to take full advantage, the agricultural  sectors and the food industry will, in his opinion, have to try  to "export less raw material and more processed products making  sure that the labor used and added value remain here in Europe."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Vasilyev: "Agricultural Fields Under Threat </F> of Depletion"]    [Text] One of the main objectives of conducting land  reform in Russia is to stop the processes of land degradation.  However, today these processes have even become accelerated.  This is convincingly corroborated by data prepared by a  Roskomzem [Russian Committee on Land] state (national) report  concerning the condition and use of land in the Russian  Federation.    It will be recalled that there are 222.3 million hectares of  agricultural fields in Russia, including 132 million hectares of  arable land, 62.5 million hectares of pastures, and 26.8 million  hectares of hayfields. A substantial part is subject to various  types of erosion, and tens of thousands of hectares are being  destroyed by gullies. Almost all of the plowed land of the North  Caucasus and the Volga region are eroded or threatened with  erosion. This same situation has developed in the Chernozem area  in Ukraine. Every fourth hectare of arable land in Western  Siberia is eroded.    Because of water erosion alone about one-tenth of arable  land  has lost 30-60 percent of its fertility, and about one-fourth of  the arable land--from 10 to 30 percent. Meanwhile, the volume of  antierosion measures in 1991 compared with 1988 fell by a third.  In 1992, 11,000 hectares of windbreaks were established on  arable land, in 1985, 24,000 hectares. The volume of work on  laying antierosion plantings in narrow gorges, gullies, sands,  and other land unsuitable for cultivation decreased by one-third.    Annual humus losses on each hectare of arable land  throughout  Russia amounts to an average of 0.62 tonnes. They are especially  high in regions situated in the steppe zone. Thus, in Samara,  Chelyabinsk, and Orenburg Oblasts, Bashkortostan, and the  Kabardino-Balkar Republic these losses amount to 0.8-1 tonne. It  is calculated that to create a positive balance of humus in  arable land it is necessary to introduce 1-1.2 billion tonnes of  organic fertilizer annually. At the present time, only one-third  of this amount is covered.    A reduction in work on soil liming also has a negative  effect  on soil fertility. While in 1986 42 million tonnes of lime was  applied, only 26 million tonnes were applied in 1991.    More than one-fourth of the hayfields and 9 percent of the  pastures are in a waterlogged condition. Also in this state are  5.7 million hectares of arable land.    There has been a noticeable deterioration in recent years in  the state of affairs in land reclamation. Operational repair  work on functioning water management systems is far from being  fully carried out. And this has a negative effect on their  technical level and the output of improved sectors. More than  half of the irrigated lands (about 3,500 hectares) need  additional work on improving their qualitative condition. There  is a need to redesign the drainage network over an area of more  than 240,000 hectares.    The figures cited in the state report once again indicate  that major capital investments on the part of the state are  necessary to make up for the diminishing fertility of the land.  Agricultural enterprises and peasant farms are not now able to  cope with this difficult task under conditions of inflation and  acute shortage of resources. Only substantial state support in  combination with improvements in land and economic relations in  the village will help them to increase crop harvests and  strengthen the fodder base for livestock raising.</p>

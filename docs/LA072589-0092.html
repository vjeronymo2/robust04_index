			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KEN HERMAN: SINGER STRUGGLES TO  PLUCK SPIRITUALS FROM DEEP ABYSS  </P> <P> In both performance and recording, the current preoccupation appears to be  restoring music to its original state. Period instrument orchestras, from  London's Hanover Band to the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra, thrive, and a new  generation of singers has been trained to execute Baroque ornamentation  fluently and to improvise cadenzas on the spot.  </P> <P> Mezzo-soprano Blanche Foreman is an advocate of another rich vein of authentic  performance practice, one much closer to home for many American musicians than  the opera-ballets of Lully or the early symphonies of Haydn. Foreman sings the  solo vocal arrangements of Negro spirituals and art songs written by black  composers.  </P> <P> According to Foreman, the Negro spiritual has suffered as much from prejudice  by the American music establishment as from neglect or confusion by the current  generation of black musicians.  </P> <P> "In the most prestigious vocal competitions, you cannot sing a Negro spiritual  arranged by a black composer," explained Foreman, "although in the category of  American music, they would let you sing Aaron Copland's setting of 'Shall We  Gather at the River?' And the younger generation thinks that spirituals are  some form of Gospel music, which is now the vogue. The spiritual has really  been abandoned."  </P> <P> A member of Vassar College's music faculty, Foreman did much of her research on  the Negro spiritual while pursuing her doctorate at Indiana University. This  week in San Diego, Foreman will present two recitals in which she will combine  spirituals, art songs by black American composers, and song cycles by Gustav  Mahler. Friday night she will sing at Hillcrest's Words and Music Gallery, and  Sunday at 4 p.m. she will appear at La Jolla's St. James Episcopal Church.  </P> <P> According to Foreman, the first Negro spirituals arranged for piano and voice  were done early in the century by Henry T. Burleigh, who studied harmony with  Dvorak. Paul Robeson's accompanist, Lawrence Brown, was also a prolific  arranger of spirituals, as was Hall Johnson, whose popular choir sang the sound  track for the 1936 movie "Green Pastures."  </P> <P> Foreman not only performs this repertory, but teaches spirituals to her college  vocal students along with opera and traditional European art songs.  </P> <P> "With the right training, anyone can sing spirituals," she said. "You don't  have to be black. After all, I'm by no means German, and I sing Mahler."  </P> <P> Foreman's other crusade is performing art songs written by black American  composers. From this repertory, she champions songs composed by the late  Margaret Bonds, who set the poetry of Langston Hughes to music, as well as  compositions by Charles Lloyd and Leslie Adams.  </P> <P> "There are at least 600 of these songs out there, but getting them published is  one of the greatest problems," Foreman said.  </P> <P> Talmi tales. Last week, San Diego Symphony music director designate Yoav Talmi  smiled for the cameras and cut a red ribbon to open the new box office in  Symphony Towers. For the rest of his week in San Diego, however, he kept a low  profile. He met extensively with executive director Wesley Brustad to map out  the 1990-91 season, Talmi's first season as music director, and he listened to  some trumpet auditions. In anticipation of the orchestra's new Pulitzer Series  at UC San Diego, he visited the UCSD campus.  </P> <P> This week he is back on the podium conducting two programs for the final week  of the Houston Symphony's Mostly Mozart festival. Tomorrow night at Houston's  Jones Hall, Talmi will be joined by cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, a familiar soloist  to San Diego Symphony audiences, in the Haydn C Major Cello Concerto. Friday,  Talmi will lead the Houston crew and soloist Ken Noda in Mozart's Piano  Concerto No. 26.  </P> <P> Local audiences will have to wait until Oct. 13 for their turn to hear Talmi  and Mozart, however, when the Israeli conductor's season-opening concert will  pair Mahler's Fifth Symphony with Mozart's A Major Piano Concerto, K. 488, with  pianist Garrick Ohlsson.  </P> <P> Alfresco nuptials. Hospitality Point, the San Diego Symphony's summer digs,  provided the backdrop for orchestra horn player Doug Hall's wedding  re-enactment Thursday evening. Forty relatives and symphony colleagues gathered  behind the stage to witness Hall's restaged nuptials to Laura Zoeckler.  Minister Nels Oas presided at Thursday's reprised ceremony.  </P> <P> The two were married by a justice of the peace in June, but chose this time,  before a SummerPops concert, to allow members of Hall's musical family to  attend. In keeping with Hall's profession, the wedding music was supplied by a  brass ensemble. Hal Wingard, husband of symphony violinist Eileen Wingard,  offered an original song, which he accompanied on guitar. After the ceremony,  Hall went to work deep in the bowels of the horn section while Laura and her  attendants joined the SummerPops audience.  </P></p>

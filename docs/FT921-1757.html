			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / More spring in the cat: Jaguar's new chairman has to make Ford's investment in the company pay off Since Ford acquired Jaguar for Pounds 1.6bn in late 1989, the UK luxury car maker's losses have mounted inexorably, while its sales have almost halved. This week, Mr Nick Scheele, a 48-year-old career Ford executive, takes over as chairman and chief executive. His task is to restore the lustre to the tarnished Jaguar name and undertake the most ambitious new product programme in the company's history. Whatever their private doubts, Ford's top executives declare publicly that their commitment to the Coventry-based prestige car maker is not wavering. They insist that the strategy of taking Ford, the world's second-largest car maker, into the highest echelon of the luxury car market through the acquisition of Jaguar was right. 'We all voted for it, none of us was in the men's room,' insists Mr Allan Gilmour, Ford executive vice-president. The financial pain at Jaguar is severe, and Ford has been forced to add fresh equity to shore up Jaguar's balance sheet after its record Pounds 226m pre-tax loss last year. Yet Mr Louis Ross, head of Ford's international automotive operations, claims that Ford is prepared to take the long view of its acquisition. 'We bought Lincoln (the US luxury car marque) in 1921, and it was 1963 before it made a profit. We are going to beat that record substantially.' But the targets for putting Jaguar back on the road are more onerous, and Mr Scheele admits that he faces a 'fairly daunting task'. Born in Essex and a modern languages graduate from Durham University, Mr Scheele has been on a fast track at Ford since joining the group as a graduate trainee in 1966. After spending 12 years with Ford of Britain, he moved to the US in 1978 to work on developing a world strategy for parts and materials purchasing. He eventually ran the Dollars 10-Dollars 12bn purchasing budget for most of Ford's North American assembly plants. Mr Scheele has been parachuted into Jaguar from Mexico City. For the last four years, he has been president of Ford of Mexico, where in contrast to the challenge at Jaguar, the main problem was how to increase output to meet rapidly rising demand in the domestic market. Mr Scheele has to fill the vacuum that will be left by the early departure through poor health of Mr Bill Hayden, one of the most experienced manufacturing executives in the European car industry. Within months of arriving at Jaguar in 1990, Mr Hayden - one of the first European car executives to recognise the scale of the competitive threat posed by the Japanese car industry - was comparing its Brown's Lane assembly plant with the Russian car plant in Gorky. He quickly saw that Jaguar's engineering and manufacturing operations suffered from fundamental quality and productivity weaknesses. In the last two years, he has worked hard to reform the company's antiquated working practices and to introduce rigorous cost and quality control systems. Under the burden of recession in its two main markets, the US and the UK, Jaguar sales have plunged precipitously. Production fell to only 23,018 units last year from the peak of 51,939 in 1988. The workforce has been cut to 8,000 from 12,100 in the last 12 months. Mr Hayden's tough reforms are starting to pay off, however. Mr Scheele says productivity improved by 23 per cent last year and that the company is on course for a further 25 per cent gain in 1992. Ford has brought in its own Uniform Product Assessment System for auditing quality, and by this measure the number of defects per hundred finished cars coming off the Jaguar assembly line has been reduced to less than 500 from close to 2,500 in early 1990. 'I hesitate to think what it was like two and half years ago,' says Mr Scheele. It will be a long haul but the agenda is clear. Mr Scheele says: 'We must continue the progress in productivity and quality, develop the new model programme, generate sales, and get a return that is not a disaster.'</p>

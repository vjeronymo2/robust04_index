			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Hitachi appoints foreign pension fund managers FOREIGN investment advisory companies have scored a significant victory in their long-standing battle to break into Japanese corporate pension fund management. Hitachi, the electronics combine and controller of Japan's largest corporate pension fund, has awarded pension fund management contracts to the Tokyo subsidiaries of two British companies - Invesco MIM and Mercury Asset Management, an affiliate of the S G Warburg financial group. Hitachi is the third company to hire foreign investment advisers. The first was Nagasakiya, a medium-sized retail group, which awarded funds to Invesco MIM earlier this year. This was followed by Toyota Motor which gave a contract to Merrill Lynch International Capital Management. However, since Toyota holds a 40 per cent stake in Merrill Lynch Capital Management, Hitachi has become the first top-rank blue-chip Japanese company to award pension fund management contracts to independent foreign advisers. Invesco MIM and Mercury will each be awarded around Y1bn (Dollars 7.8m). Ten other fund management groups, all Japanese, will also receive management contracts. However, foreign investment managers believe that, despite Hitachi's decision, winning pension fund management contracts will still be difficult for foreign companies. Under government regulations, companies can award to newly-appointed fund managers only a proportion of the new money flowing in - they cannot reapportion assets already parcelled out to their long-established fund managers. Hitachi's Y1bn contracts with Invesco MIM and Mercury are a small fraction of its total pension fund of about Y400bn. Also, foreign fund managers complain that Japanese companies continue to award fund management contracts to financial groups with which they already have other kinds of dealings, such as banking or securities business. Foreign fund managers believe that attitudes are changing, but only slowly.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: Pohl to join Corange of Bermuda Mr Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank, is to become deputy chairman of Corange, the Bermuda-based holding company which owns a leading German health care concern, Boehringer Mannheim. Corange, owned by the Engelhorn family, is undergoing a board restructuring designed to 'help to simulate the disciplines of a public company'. This means setting up a framework within which management will be subjected to the same sort of independent scrutiny that public companies receive from shareholders and analysts. Its new board will contain no present or former members of management. The exception is Mr Curt Engelhorn, a member of the shareholding family who will continue as chief executive until a successor is found. Also on the board is Mr Patrick Rich, chairman and chief executive officer of BOC Group. Three other independent directors have been appointed with three more to join later. Boehringer Mannheim - which has no connection with Boehringer Ingelheim, another German pharmaceutical company - achieved sales of Dollars 2.9bn last year, against Dollars 2.5bn in 1990, with profits before interest and taxes of Dollars 243m (Dollars 229m). Its main activities are diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, orthopaedic products (through its DePuy unit), and biochemicals. Mr Pohl, who has begun speaking out again on world monetary issues, left the German central bank in the summer of 1991. He is a partner in Sal. Oppenheim, the Cologne-based private bank.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Business rate rise forecast Rating experts are expecting Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to announce an increase in the uniform business rate in his Budget on November 29. The new rate, with an assessment of the rateable value for individual properties, based on commercial rents, will determine how much businesses will pay in the five years from April 1 1995. While rents have risen in most areas since the last revaluation five years ago, large falls in London and a conservative approach by local valuation offices - to reduce the number of successful appeals - are likely to result in a lower average rateable value. If this proves to be correct the chancellor will have to increase the rate from this year's level of 42.3p in the pound to maintain the amount raised. The government has said that it does not intend to increase the overall burden of taxation but regional changes in rents in the past five years mean that the distribution will change dramatically. The chart (above) is based on rental value data for 50 towns in England and Wales and assumes that the chancellor sets a rate of 43.5p in the pound. Mr Brian Hardy, rating partner at Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, said that rates on the best City offices could fall from Pounds 25 a sq ft to Pounds 10 or less. Office occupiers in Birmingham are likely to see rates double to Pounds 16 a sq ft. The swings for retail and industrial occupiers are likely to be less severe because rents have risen less. The government has said that increases will be phased, so that rates bills will not rise by more than 20 per cent a year in real terms. It is not clear how quickly businesses with lower rateable values, mostly in London, will be allowed to feel the benefit. Even if reductions are phased over two or three years, falling rates are likely to boost the City office market by reducing the overall cost of occupying space. Regional centres are not expected to suffer, because rates are a much smaller proportion of overall occupancy costs.</p>

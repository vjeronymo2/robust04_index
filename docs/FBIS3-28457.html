			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 5 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  have struck a deal to resolve a trade dispute over government  procurement for telecommunications and medical equipment, a  Japanese Government source said Saturday [5 February].    Government procurement of telecommunications and medical  equipment is one of the areas covered under bilateral talks on a  new trade framework which the two countries hope to reach  agreement by February 11, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  is to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.    The deal came after four days of bilateral negotiations held  since Tuesday at the Foreign Ministry, the source said.    As part of the deal, Tokyo offered to introduce an open  bidding system for purchases of telecommunications and medical  equipment valued at more than 100,000 Special Drawing Rights  (SDRs) or some 19 million yen, the source said.    Japan also promised to introduce a "comprehensive"  evaluation  system to decide on which equipment to purchase on the basis of  not only price but also other factors to make it easier for U.S.  suppliers to win contracts, the source said.    Japanese and U.S. trade negotiators have long been at odds  over the minimum value of contracts to be opened to general  bidding, as Washington demanded 5,000 SDRs against the 130,000  SDRs sought by Japan.    The source indicated that the comprehensive evaluation  system  would apply only to medical equipment, as U.S. medical devices  are usually priced higher than those made in Japan.    The talks over government procurement are part of the  so-called framework talks under which the two sides hope to  agree on ways to slash Japan's massive trade surplus with the  United States.</p>

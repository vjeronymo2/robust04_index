			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE AT SOUTH COAST REPERTORY  </P> <P> Across the street from the Pacific Symphony's performing space at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center is South Coast Repertory, the county's other  main, home-grown arts organization. Its reputation exceeds the Pacific  Symphony's -- the theater received a Tony Award in 1988 -- yet ticket prices  there for main-stage productions appear to be in line with other regional  theater companies around the country.  </P> <P> Tickets for the current, acclaimed production of Howard Korder's "Search and  Destroy" run $21 to $28. Prices for main-stage productions at the La Jolla  Playhouse last season ran $18 to $25 (prices for the upcoming season have yet  to be announced). At the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, tickets for the current  production of "The Winter's Tale" are $18 to $29.  </P> <P> At the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove, tickets for the current production of  "Twelfth Night" are $16 to $20.

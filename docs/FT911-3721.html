			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Tesco chairman's earnings top Pounds 1.4m SIR Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, the grocery chain, received total remuneration of Pounds 1.48m last year, representing a steep increase on his previous year's basic pay of Pounds 345,000. The pay of the chairman of Britain's second-biggest food retailing chain advanced by Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 390,000. In addition, however, he received a substantial boost from the inclusion of Pounds 1.09m in performance-related incentive payments. The payments related to a scheme introduced in 1988 which linked directors' bonuses to the performance of the company's earnings per share. Over the three-year period, Tesco's earnings per share rose by 71 per cent. Four of Tesco's other executive directors benefited strongly from the incentive scheme. Last year, one earned over Pounds 610,000, another more than Pounds 665,000, and two are bracketed in the Pounds 785,000 to Pounds 790,000 pay range. In total, the amount paid out to all directors in the year to February 23, 1991, increased from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 6.74m. Next year, however, the directors will receive only Pounds 1.8m between them under the incentive scheme as opposed to the accumulated three-year total of Pounds 4.33m they received last year. The growth in Sir Ian's remuneration follows a series of big rises for senior executives at a number of the UK's largest companies. Observer, Page 18</p>

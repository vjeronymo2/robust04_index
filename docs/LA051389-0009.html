			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPACE ORDNANCE SYSTEMS WILL CLOSE PLANT  </P> <P> Space Ordnance Systems, the defense and aerospace firm, has begun phasing out  operations at its Mint Canyon plant at Agua Dulce northeast of Santa Clarita,  company officials said.  </P> <P> Some of the 60 workers at Mint Canyon will lose their jobs, but others will be  transferred to the company's Placerita Canyon plant about 15 miles away, said  Sheila Klein, director of administration for the firm.  </P> <P> The plant phase-out, which is to be completed by July, results from reduced  orders for the infrared decoy flares manufactured at Mint Canyon, Klein said.  The flares are used by military airplanes to divert heat-seeking missiles.  </P> <P> Space Ordnance, a division of TransTechnology Corp. of Sherman Oaks, has  occupied the Mint Canyon plant for 10 years under a lease from Garrett Corp.  and later Allied-Signal, which acquired Garrett in 1987.  </P> <P> At the Placerita plant, which employs about 130 workers, Space Ordnance  manufactures explosive bolts and other devices for military hardware and the  space program.  </P></p>

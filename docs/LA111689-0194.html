			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FBI INFORMANT CONVICTED OF O.C. MURDER ATTEMPT  </P> <P> Joseph Angelo Grosso, a longtime FBI informant with ties to organized crime,  was convicted Wednesday of attempted first-degree murder and conspiracy in the  1987 shooting of Mustang Club financier William Carroll, who had resisted mob  efforts to take over the topless bar's operation.  </P> <P> Southern California law enforcement officials were excited about the verdict in  the closely watched Grosso trial because of its implications for Los Angeles  racketeer Michael Anthony Rizzitello. Rizzitello, Grosso's co-defendant, is  scheduled to go on trial Dec. 11 for the shooting of Carroll.  </P> <P> Rizzitello, listed by the state attorney general's office as an underboss in  the Los Angeles-based Milano crime family, has a long history of fraud and  racketeering convictions. But if convicted in the attack on Carroll, he could  face the most serious sentence of his life. Rizzitello has denied participation  in the shooting.  </P> <P> Carroll, left permanently blind in the May 1, 1987, shooting in a Costa Mesa  parking garage, identified Rizzitello, 62, as the gunman, and Grosso, 46, as  the driver who held him down to prevent his escape.  </P> <P> Jury foreman Kathleen Bruck of Costa Mesa said jurors hearing Grosso's trial in  Orange County Superior Court believed the victim's testimony that Rizzitello  was the man who shot him, and that Grosso was a participant.  </P> <P> "This is a very good sign for the Rizzitello trial," said one law enforcement  official. "He has to be worried that Carroll's testimony held up here."  </P> <P> Grosso, wearing the same chocolate brown shirt he has worn throughout his  trial, showed no emotion when the verdicts were read. He has predicted "I will  be killed" for telling jurors that Rizzitello was the shooter.  </P> <P> Grosso, who faces an automatic sentence of 25 years to life in prison, was  found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, attempted first-degree murder and  mayhem for leaving Carroll permanently blind. The jurors also found use of a  firearm during the commission of a crime -- because they believe Rizzitello was  armed -- which could add one more year to Grosso's sentence.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. set a Dec. 12 sentencing date for Grosso  and ordered him to cooperate with a probation officer for a pre-sentencing  report.  </P> <P> Grosso has denied any ties to Rizzitello, or that he knew a shooting was about  to take place. But his testimony is considered important at the Rizzitello  trial, because he corroborates Carroll's claim that Rizzitello was the gunman.  </P> <P> Jurors said they found Grosso's denial of his involvement difficult to believe  because he had told too many different stories about what happened before his  trial began.  </P> <P> "If he had told just one story throughout, we could possibly have come to a  different conclusion," Bruck said. "But from the first day of our  deliberations, we believed he was involved."  </P> <P> Before the trial, Grosso had told a Times reporter that Rizzitello was not even  in the car at the time, and that the shooter had been "Big George" Yudzevich, a  bouncer at the Mustang who has since been murdered. Grosso also admitted on the  witness stand that he had told "probably more than 25" different versions of  what happened while he was at Orange County Jail awaiting trial.  </P> <P> But within a week of testimony in the trial, Grosso met with law enforcement  officials in an attempt to plea bargain, and made numerous other inconsistent  statements about his activities that day. Grosso has a long history of  informing to the FBI, and told jurors that he had provided the agency  considerable details about Carroll's activities.  </P> <P> Grosso claimed he had to lie because Rizzitello had threatened to kill him if  he didn't deny Rizzitello's involvement.  </P> <P> "We tried to show the jurors that Mr. Grosso had to tell different stories  about what happened to protect himself from being killed," said Grosso's  attorney, William Yacobozzi Jr. of Newport Beach. "But obviously they did not  accept that."  </P> <P> Jurors deliberated five full days and part of a sixth, but Bruck said there was  little disagreement that Grosso was involved in the Carroll shooting. The  number of charges, and some difficulty with the legal definition of mayhem  accounted for the lengthy deliberations, she said.  </P> <P> Carroll, 56, is one of three people involved in the operation of the  now-defunct Mustang Club on Harbor Boulevard who were targets of gunmen.  Murdered just four months before the Carroll shooting was club operator Jimmy  Casino, who borrowed money from Carroll to start the club. Also murdered nearly  a year after the Carroll shooting was Yudzevich.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials are tight-lipped about whether Rizzitello is a  suspect in either of those shootings. But Grosso told jurors that Carroll had  admitted responsibility for both murders. Law enforcement sources say  privately, however, that Carroll has never been a serious suspect in those  shootings, which remain under investigation.  </P> <P> Foreman Bruck said jurors were convinced that Carroll had not been honest with  them about all his business activities. But she declined to say which parts of  Carroll's testimony raised skepticism among the jurors.  </P> <P> Despite Grosso's claims that he was only Carroll's driver, prosecutors had a  strong witness to corroborate Carroll's testimony that Grosso was more deeply  involved.  </P> <P> Gene Lesher, a banker who took over the club's operation while Carroll was  recuperating, testified that he had caved in to Rizzitello's demands to muscle  in on the bar's profits after the racketeer threatened him. Lesher testified  that Grosso was the one who set up his meeting with Rizzitello.  </P> <P> Carroll was found bleeding and left for dead shortly after midnight in a  deserted parking garage. Police investigators at his hospital bedside urged him  to name his assailants, convinced they were taking a dying statement.  </P> <P> Although he pulled through, Carroll refused for 18 months to talk about the  shooting. A year ago, shortly after bank fraud charges pending against him  resulted only in a misdemeanor conviction, Carroll agreed to cooperate.  </P> <P> He explained to jurors that he was afraid to talk before his own case was  resolved for fear that if he had to serve time in Orange County Jail,  Rizzitello would have arranged for him to be killed.  </P> <P> Carroll said he was first approached by Rizzitello -- through Grosso -- shortly  after the Casino murder. Because Carroll had not been repaid most of $250,000  he had loaned Casino, he became the unofficial overseer of the club's  operation.  </P> <P> Rizzitello never made any overt attempts with the financier to muscle in on the  club, according to Carroll's testimony. But he said Rizzitello did pressure him  into giving him a $10,000 loan, and that friction developed between them after  that.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that Rizzitello realized he would get nowhere muscling  Carroll and decided to eliminate him to get to Lesher.  </P> <P> Carroll said Grosso arranged a meeting between Rizzitello and him at Emilia's  restaurant in Santa Ana on April 30, 1987. Someone had taken a shot at Carroll  10 days earlier, and he thought Rizzitello could tell him who it was.  </P> <P> After dinner, Carroll said, Grosso and Rizzitello asked him to drive them to  the Costa Mesa parking garage, where Grosso's wife had left his car. Grosso  drove Carroll's rented car for him, he said.  </P> <P> Carroll told jurors that once he saw that the parking garage was deserted, he  knew something was wrong. By then, he said, Rizzitello had grabbed him around  the neck and had a gun pointed at his head.  </P></p>

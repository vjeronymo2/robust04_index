			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Stock Exchange stakes claim to settlements role THE Stock Exchange intends to play a role in securities settlement in the City of London even after a successor to its failed Taurus paperless settlements system is in place. The Bank of England, heading a panel to devise a replacement for Taurus, and City officials have suggested that the Exchange's failure with Taurus has cost it the confidence of institutional shareholders and market makers who are in need of an efficient system quickly. Mr Martin Hall, head of public policy at the Stock Exchange, speaking at a conference in Birmingham, said that from July 18 next year the Exchange's existing Talisman settlements system will move to 10-day rolling periods. This will replace the two-week settlement system currently in operation. A change to five-day settlements is planned for a few months later, also via the Talisman system. 'So the Exchange is very much in the settlement business, and will necessarily be the sole provider of settlement services for several years to come,' Mr Hall said. Noting that the ownership, management and operation of the new settlements system, to be known as Crest, have yet to be decided, Mr Hall said: 'We do not expect in the long term to remain the sole providers, but we certainly do not rule out a continuing involvement.' The Exchange yesterday also announced it has introduced a new surveillance mechanism to allow regulators to track equity-related transactions. The system, known as Imas - Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance - has been designed to detect 'unusual trading activities', according to Mr Keith Robinson, head of market regulation. Speaking at the Exchange's first Midlands and Western regional conference, Mr Robinson said the system would monitor the time taken for trade transactions and how quickly they are reported to regulators.</p>

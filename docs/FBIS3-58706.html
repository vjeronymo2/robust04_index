I know  nothing of unlawful payments," Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme  (PS) [French-speaking Socialist Party] said in his defense  yesterday. Coeme also accused the French manufacturer  Aerospatiale of having made improper proposals. Meanwhile,  Walloon Minister President Guy Spitaels has said he did not want  to harm either Dehaene or Claes. With this, the danger to the  government appears to have receded.    Coeme spoke to the press yesterday after he had presented  his  document defending himself to the special parliamentary  committee. Coeme said that, at the time of the negotiations on  the helicopter purchase, he had warned against the "lobbyists  who are swarming around the contract like vultures." Some  people had never forgotten those words, Coeme said yesterday.    The minister also strongly attacked the French. Just one  month after the decision to buy Agusta, rumors appeared in the  French press about bribe payments. When the problem of the  helicopters' excessive weight emerged, these rumors resurfaced.  Coeme said, at that time, he had been approached by two  Aerospatiale representatives who asked that the contract be  broken. They exercised "very strong pressure," Coeme said, but  he provided no further details. However, he was prepared to  give additional explanations on the matter to public prosecutors.    In the meantime, the special parliamentary committee has  decided to hear investigating magistrate Ancia and Coeme next  week. Further investigations may be demanded by a councillor of  the Supreme Court on the basis of these interrogations.    The Senate Judicial Affairs Committee is to give its verdict  today on the partial lifting of the parliamentary immunity of  regional ministers Guy Spitaels and Guy Mathot.    Both regional ministers oppose the move. They argue that the  partial lifting of their immunity would make them look guilty in  the eyes of public opinion. However, Spitaels and Mathot are  prepared to answer Ancia's questions. Nevertheless, a majority  of the committee will probably vote for lifting the immunity.  In any case, the PSC [French-speaking Social-Christian Party]  announced yesterday that it would vote for their immunity to be  lifted. It is worth noting also that a number of PS members  favor the lifting of immunity as well. Minister Jean-Maurice  Dehousse and MP Jose Happart have already made comments to this  effect.    In the meantime, the danger of a government crisis seems to  have receded. The cabinet of Walloon Prime Minister Guy  Spitaels denied yesterday that in his document the minister  president had wanted to involve Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene  and Foreign Minister Willy Claes in the case. The cabinet  pointed out that the names of Dehaene and Claes were quoted by a  witness whose testimony was formally denied by another witness.  These comments were included in the defense to prove that the  evidence of some people was totally unfounded.</p>

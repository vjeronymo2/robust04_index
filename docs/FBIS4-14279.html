			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said that the  economic agreement scheduled to be signed in Paris this morning  constitutes a historic breakthrough toward establishing a  prosperous peacetime economy. Shohat told Voice of Jerusalem  radio that the agreement was good, protected Israel's economic  interests, and also permitted the development of a Palestinian  economy. Shohat noted that Israel had rejected the  Palestinians' demand for their own currency; however, the  economic committee accompanying the negotiations would continue  to discuss the issue until a decision acceptable to both sides  was reached.    Finance Minister Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the  head of the PLO's economic department, will sign the agreement  regulating economic relations between the Palestinian autonomous  areas and Israel at a festive ceremony in Paris this morning.  In the event of discrepancies between the Paris agreement and  the agreement that will be signed next week in Cairo, the latter  agreement will be considered binding by both parties.</p>

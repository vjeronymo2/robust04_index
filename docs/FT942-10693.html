			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Serbs 'still have heavy weapons' The commander of United Nations troops in Gorazde said yesterday he believed the Serbs still had heavy weapons within the 20km weapons exclusion zone around the Bosnian Moslem town, in defiance of a Nato ultimatum. Lieutenant Colonel David Santa-Olalla, the UN commander in Gorazde, said, 'I am quite certain that there are still heavy weapons being held within the zone.' He added that the Serbs still had between 100 and 150 police in the 3km zone. UN officials say the police are in fact soldiers who have just changed their uniforms. UN Protection Force spokesman Eric Chaperon said Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had assured Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN's head of civil affairs, that the troops would pull out of the Moslem enclave but nothing happened. Croatia is reviving the kuna, the currency used by the Nazi puppet regime of the second world war. It will replace the dinar, inherited from Croatia's days in the old Yugoslav federation, from May 30 - Croatian Statehood Day.</p>

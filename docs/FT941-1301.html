			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: The end of life with the Lyons Allied-Lyons' proposal to change its title to Allied-Domecq will mean the loss of a name that has played a significant part in British social history. Lyons Corner House tea shops and restaurants were common meeting places from the turn of the century until the 1950s when they began to be supplanted by fast-food outlets. The first Corner House opened in London's Coventry Street, between Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square in 1909; a second opened in the Strand in 1915; a third at the junction of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road in 1928; and the fourth, at Marble Arch, was completed in 1933, enabling J Lyons to boast that 'the four Corners of London' were serving 50m customers a year. Most of the tea shops, including the Corner Houses, had disappeared by the time Allied Breweries bought J Lyons - formed as a public company in 1894 - for Pounds 60m in 1978. One of the last tea shops, in the Strand, closed in 1981, although there was later a short-lived attempt to resurrect it as a Corner House. Lyons, the second largest tea company in the world, is also the proud inventor of the round tea bag, which has helped to give its Tetley brand a leading position in the UK, Ireland and Canada. Other produce bearing the Lyons name includes biscuits and ice-cream. The Lyons name was also attached to one of the oldest and best-known British coffee brands. However, Allied-Lyons sold its coffee interests in February: instant coffee went to Kraft Jacobs Suchard, while real coffee went to Paulig, the Finnish food group.</p>

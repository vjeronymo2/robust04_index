			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (7): Coal, gold, emeralds - Colombia MINING has become one of the most dynamic sectors of the Colombian economy in the last decade. It now contributes about 17 per cent of foreign income, even though the ambitious coal and nickel export projects have seen few ups and many downs in prices. Yet this is just a fraction of what it might earn if the government could create the confidence needed to attract investors who currently perceive lower risks in Venezuela and Chile. Both the Cerromatoso nickel plant and the huge Cerrejon coal mine were joint ventures involving substantial state investments. Coal prices are now far below those forecast when El Cerrejon was approved and the state coal company, Carbocol, accumulated a debt of more than Dollars 1.8bn as production grew to 14m tonnes a year. Although the government recently lightened the burden by shifting Dollars 1bn to the Colombian oil company and the nation, the country's first large-scale coal investment has been a bruising experience. Partly because of this, the government wants to finance future mining ventures with private and foreign capital. There has been talk of privatising the state holding in Cerromatoso and several Colombian companies, as well as Drummond, a US concern, by developing the country's abundant steam coal reserve. With exports worth Dollars 630m in 1991, Colombia is already the world's fourth coal supplier and plans to increase its share of the international market to more than 10 per cent. Domestic demand should also pick up as the government encourages new thermal power stations to reduce dependence on hydro-electricity. But private companies operating in the La Loma-La Jagua region have been bedevilled by guerrilla actions and extortion, and coal projects are behind schedule. Although agreements with communities to put in water services or other infrastructure help gain local support, guerrilla demands have escalated in recent years. 'If a company wants to work, you have to talk with people who represent the guerrillas,' warned a Colombian geologist. Mr Jairo Cuevas, manager of the state mining company, Mineralco, says investors are more concerned about legal and tax issues than about violence. A constitutional clause referring to expropriation is apparently to be defused by a congressional ruling. Recent tax changes allow all profits to be remitted, though the initial 12 per cent levy on remittances and the overall tax structure favour reinvestment. While the government is clearly anxious to attract capital as part of the whole process of opening up the economy, other sectors may discourage foreign investment in their determination to milk it. There is no lack of opportunities, says Mr Cuevas: 'Now more detailed exploration studies are needed. Projects have been identified and Mineralco has the technical - though not the financial - capacity to launch them.' Mineralco's main programmes are linked to precious metals and stones, particularly emeralds, but Mr Cuevas is also enthusiastic about finding partners to explore and develop copper deposits in the south-eastern foothills of the Andes. Products derived from phosphate-bearing rock nearby could be used in the recovery process. Colombia is famous for its high-quality emeralds - and equally famous for the violence of the rival emerald mining gangs, which left more than 3,000 dead in the 1970s and 1980s. During the last two years an uneasy truce has allowed production to settle down, and the main players are planning to establish an international emerald bourse in Bogota. Some government officials welcome this as a way of 'legalising' the emerald trade, but others fear that it could act as a 'legal' umbrella for cocaine money-laundering. Emerald exports were officially worth Dollars 150m in 1991, with most of the best stones going to Japan. Experts estimate that emeralds worth at least another Dollars 150m are smuggled out of the country each year. An exceptional deep green stone with good fire can fetch Dollars 25,000 or more per carat. While the companies dynamite and bulldoze for veins at the rock face, prospecting families sift through the black sludge and debris washed down from the mines, looking for the tiny gem that might represent a fortune once it gets past the thieves and sharp middle-men in the mining area. Gold also attracts droves of prospectors, who are ravaging river-banks and polluting streams with mercury. Mineralco plans to bring in technical experts to improve the recovery rate and to find ways of reducing environmental damage. There is a 5 per cent discount on amalgam purchases by the Central Bank, partly to cover processing and partly to try and reduce mercury use. 'The geological potential in precious metals is phenomenal,' said Mr Patrick Gorman of the US-based consulting firm, Puma Resources. 'There is something for everybody in the gold business here. I know a number of people who are interested. But anything has to be done with a view to the long-term development of the country and with respect for the people already working in these areas.' Guainia and the Vaupes, two areas on the eastern border of Colombia with Brazil, are especially promising. Although the logistics would be complicated, inaccessible jungle has its advantages and there is little guerrilla influence in the area. From the beginning of 1993, the gold market will no longer be controlled entirely by the Central Bank. Although Colombia has a 1,500-year-long tradition of fine goldwork, Italian technology is being used in the first two industrial jewellery ventures - one plant is due to start exporting gold chains next year. Already among the world's top 10 gold producers, Colombia could benefit from its low production costs and abundant reserves in times of relatively depressed international prices.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOOVER MAKES 5 ERRORS IN 7-1 LOSS TO ARCADIA  </P> <P> Opportunity didn't exactly knock for Arcadia High on Friday. It broke the door  down and barged in.  </P> <P> Hoover committed five errors and watched the Pacific League baseball game scoot  by like a botched grounder, 7-1.  </P> <P> With a win, Hoover could have moved to within a half-game of the first-place  Apaches. Instead, the Tornadoes (11-5, 6-4) remain in third behind Arcadia  (16-4, 8-1) and Pasadena (11-5, 8-2).  </P> <P> Arcadia scored two runs in the second inning when, with the bases loaded and  two out, Mike Gerken hit a routine grounder that shot between shortstop Brian  Day's legs. Earlier in the inning, Jon Graves reached base after Day's high  throw pulled first baseman Mickey Moreno off the bag.  </P> <P> In the fifth, with Hoover trailing, 3-1, pitcher David Berkey spun and  attempted to pick off Jim Aiwasian at first. But he misfired and the ball  rolled into the outfield, allowing Ted Pilmer to score from third.  </P> <P> Later in the inning, with the bases loaded, left fielder Reggie Mercado  misplayed a fly ball that sailed over his head and brought home the final three  runs.  </P> <P> "Everybody's trying their best but we just can't win with errors like that,"  Hoover Coach Bob Cooper said.  </P> <P> But the Tornadoes might have committed an error long before they stepped on the  field. Berkey (5-3) had pitched complete games in Hoover's past two victories,  on Tuesday and last Friday. He had never before pitched two -- let alone three  -- consecutive games in his career.  </P> <P> Although Berkey held the Apaches to seven hits and one earned run in 4 2/3  innings, he was running on empty for much of the game.  </P> <P> "I was trying to save my arm but we weren't getting any runs," said Berkey, who  tried to get by with off-speed pitches early. "When I started heating it up, it  wasn't there."  </P> <P> Berkey was not too tuckered to swing the bat, though, collecting two of  Hoover's five hits and scoring its only run.  </P></p>

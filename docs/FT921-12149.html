			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / National Westminster Bank to restructure management NATIONAL WESTMINSTER, the second largest UK banking group, yesterday announced a shake-up of its corporate and financial markets operations and the appointment of two deputy group chief executives who will serve under Mr Tom Frost, NatWest's chief executive. The two new deputy group chief executives are Mr Bert Morris, 57, and Mr Derek Wanless, 44. Mr Morris currently heads NatWest Support Services Division and will succeed Mr Roger Flemington, who is to retire as deputy group chief executive in May, while retaining his present executive responsibilities. The promotion of Mr Wanless, who joined the NatWest board less than two years ago when he was made head of the bank's UK financial services division, is likely to arouse the most interest. In spite of his age, he must now be a leading contender to succeed Mr Frost as group chief executive when he retires in August next year. Mr Wanless, whose career so far has been in NatWest's personal customer and retail banking business, will head a new grouping of the bank's corporate and investment banking and trading market activities, to be called NatWest Markets. It will have its own board, chaired by Sir Michael Angus, NatWest deputy chairman, with Sir Geoffrey Littler, chairman of County NatWest, as his deputy. Mr Wanless said yesterday that the changes were only a managerial restructuring and would not affect County NatWest in any other way. 'We are bringing County NatWest together with group treasury and capital market because we think that the strategies of the three can increasingly support each other across the range of activities they do,' Mr Wanless said yesterday. 'Customers are looking to get products across that whole range from us. All three of the units have tackled their problems over the last year or two and developed up their business well and increased their complementary skills well,' he said. The latest appointments come 10 days after NatWest brought in Mr Richard Goeltz, a 49-year-old American, to be its chief financial officer in succession to Mr John Burns who left the bank to become finance director at TSB.

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The District of Columbia Court of Appeals refused to block the extradition of a  juvenile facing a possible death sentence in Alabama in connection with a 1988  firebombing that killed a 14-month-old boy. A three-judge panel of the court  ruled that the district must honor an interstate agreement governing the  extradition of juveniles, despite the district's own ban against capital  punishment. The youth, identified only by the initials O.M., has been held by  district authorities since last December, when he was arrested in connection  with a warrant issued by Gadsden, Ala., authorities.  </P></p>

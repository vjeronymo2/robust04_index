			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome plummets Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome saw its share price plummet following news that its anti-AIDS drug Retrovir might be ineffective for the millions of people who are early stage carriers of the virus. The news, prompted by the most extensive and enduring trial of the drug to date, caused Wellcome shares to fall by more than 10 per cent to a low of 658p shortly after the start of trading yesterday. However, they recovered in the afternoon and closed 51 lower at 692p. The share price was also sharply lower at the start of trading in New York. The wave of heavy selling saw 10m shares traded within the first two hours of dealing and by the close 15m shares had changed hands. Aside from the unusual volumes at the time of Wellcome's 270m share issue in July, this was the heaviest volume for almost four years. Dealers said there was heavy international offloading and one added that busy institutional UK selling had still not been absorbed by the end of the day and predicted further falls. However, many analysts were keen to point out that the shares now stood on a p/e ratio below that of the overall market which, in a traditionally highly rated sector, could only imply a buying opportunity.</p>

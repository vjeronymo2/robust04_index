			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marc Deger: "Fish: Storm Warning Averted"] </F>   [Text] Following various verbal warnings, on Friday [4  March] the United States threatened France officially with  commercial retaliation because of the strict health measures  imposed by Paris on fish imports. Washington is accusing the  French Government of introducing veiled quotas aimed at allaying  the anger of Breton fishermen. "False accusations," the Hotel  Matignon [prime minister's office] retorted, stressing that "if  the Americans are stepping up the pressure on international  trade it is to cast doubt on the main achievement of the Uruguay  Round which their Senate refuses to contemplate: the  institutionalization of a World Trade Organization."    In this affair, the Clinton Administration has acted under  pressure from the National Fisheries Institute, the shipowners'  lobby, arguing that Massachusetts fishermen were losing $200,000  a week because of the restrictions on imports imposed by France.  And the U.S. Special Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  threatened to introduce trade sanctions on $100 million of  French exports, especially cheeses, because they are perishable.    In Paris, the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] immediately  issued a warning to Washington, stating that the checks carried  out by France were "perfectly in line with Community  regulations." It added that "if the United States took the path  of retaliatory measures against France, it would be responsible  for escalating tensions at the very time preparations are under  way for the Marrakesh conference, which will make it possible to  sign the GATT agreements and to set up the World Trade  Organization."    According to official French figures, only 27.3 tonnes (out  of 997) of American fish have been banned since the  strengthening of border checks purely for public health reasons.  They were batches "swollen" by chemical additives that retain  water, which amounts to selling water for the price of fish.    Paris and Washington have finally chosen the path of peace.  Fisheries Minister Jean Puech agreed with Mickey Kantor that a  team of American experts should examine the French checks. This  team is expected in Paris today.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 8 (TANJUG) -- The final results of the  early parliamentary election in Serbia show that the ruling  Socialists have retained the lead, the republican polling board  said on Saturday after the vote was repeated at 45 polling  stations.    It has been known in advance that the second round of voting  will in no way shift the balance of forces established after the  first round of voting held on December 19, because only 0.5  percent of the voters were asked to cast their ballots for the  second time.    In the 250-seat parliament, the Socialist Party of Serbia  (SPS) headed by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic retained  its 123 seats (49.2 percent).    The Democratic Movement of Serbia (Depos), a coalition of  five opposition parties headed by Leader of the Serbian Renewal  Movement Vuk Draskovic, is second with 45 seats (18 percent),  and the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Seselj third  with 39 seats (15.6 percent). They are followed by the  Democratic Party (DS) which won 29 seats (11.6 percent) and the  Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) with seven seats (2.8 percent).  The Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (DZVM), the  party of the ethnic Hungarian minority in Serbia's northern  province of Vojvodina, won five seats. A coalition of the Party  for Democratic Activity and the Democratic Party of Albanians  won two seats in Leskovac in southern Serbia. The ethnic  Albanian minority boycotted the election in the southern Serbian  province of Kosovo-Metohija, where they are the majority  population. The republican polling board said that 4,300,440 of  Serbia's 7,010,389 registered voters had turned at the polls,  and that 1,576,287 of them supported the Socialists and  2,168,467 the opposition.    President of the republican polling board Caslav Ignjatovic  said that the new parliament should be constituted within the  next 20 days, or by January 28 at the latest. [Word indistinct]  Vice-President Goran Percevic said on Saturday that the results  of the early parliamentary election in which the socialists had  scored a convincing victory would enable the forming of a stable  government in the republic of Serbia.    Seaking for the local radio in Jagodina, he said, however,  that the SPS had not yet discussed the possible variants of  one-party (Socialist) and multi-party governments.    It goes without saying that the Socialists would like to see  a government capable of dealing with the issues of vital  importance for the citizens of Serbia while the U.N. economic  embargo is in force and of coming out with a programme of social  and economic reconstruction after the international blockade has  been lifted, said Percevic.</p>

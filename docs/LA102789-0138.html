			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> CAMPBELL: No one in the all-Republican Orange County legislative delegation has  been as close to powerful Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown as state  Sen. William Campbell (A1, A22), Sacramento insiders say. . . . "If you had  something major that had to be done with the county, and if the Speaker was the  roadblock, Campbell was a good person to be involved," one said. "I don't think  there's anyone else in the delegation who can replace that." Said Brown:  "Nobody dislikes Bill Campbell. We've been friends since Day 1." . . . And with  two of the county's other prominent legislators -- Marian Bergeson and John  Seymour -- seeking statewide office in 1990, don't look for either to rush in  to fill the void. Dana Parsons and Rick VanderKnyff  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> VERTICAL GARDENING BY CAROLINE BOISSET (WEIDENFELD &amp; NICOLSON; 1988)  </P> <P> GARDEN DESIGN focuses primarily on planting the grounds around the home. But  here is a book with a different viewpoint -- working with the vertical planes  of the garden. A blank wall can serve as the canvas for a climbing garden full  of color and texture year-round.  </P> <P> "Vertical Gardening" is of interest not only to those with limited space but  also to those with larger gardens who wish to divide them into smaller, more  intimate spaces with planted fences or trellises. Sections include ideas for  window boxes, "edible" walls, walls of scent, hanging gardens and water  features.  </P> <P> The book's one drawback: As with most garden books, this one is written for  much colder climates, and many of the plants suggested for use are not suitable  to Southern California. But with a little extracurricular research to find  similar plants, the same principles of design can be applied. ($24.95) Linda  French  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUPLE FOUND SHOT TO DEATH; TODDLER CRITICALLY WOUNDED;  </P> <P> SLAYINGS: POLICE CALL INCIDENT A MURDER-SUICIDE. HUSBAND AND WIFE REPORTEDLY  HAD ARGUED FREQUENTLY OVER HIS EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR.  </P> <P> A couple who police said spent more than a year arguing frequently over the  husband's continuing extramarital affair, were found shot to death in their  Hollywood apartment Tuesday. Their 16-month-old son, wounded in the head, lay  between them on their bed.  </P> <P> The baby, Anthony Rodriguez, was reported in critical condition at Childrens  Hospital.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said the incident appeared to be the third murder-suicide  since May involving a couple in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Relatives found Leticia Peralta, 29, and Hector Rodriguez, 31, in their  one-bedroom apartment in the 1800 block of North Kingsley Drive. A  small-caliber automatic pistol was found near Peralta, said Hollywood Division  Lt. Bob Ruchhoft. Peralta, Rodriguez and the baby apparently had each been shot  once in the head, he said.  </P> <P> Relatives of Rodriguez told investigators that Peralta became distraught last  year when she learned that her husband was seeing another woman. Rodriguez, who  worked as a janitor, refused to end the relationship and he and Peralta argued  frequently, police said.  </P> <P> Peralta also began threatening to kill her husband, said Luis Romero, 25, who  identified himself as a close friend of Rodriguez.  </P> <P> "He was saying he was going to leave his wife," Romero said of Rodriguez, who  immigrated to the United States 11 years ago from Guatemala. "When she  (Peralta) was angry, she said she would kill Hector. He used to joke about it."  </P> <P> Rodriguez and Peralta, who worked as a housekeeper, had been married for about  18 months, Romero said.  </P> <P> In May, a man shot and killed his estranged wife and a daughter, wounded a  second daughter, then killed himself in an apartment on Ardmore Avenue. In  August, a few blocks away from the scene of Tuesday's shooting, a butcher, who  was reportedly consumed by jealousy, fatally stabbed the woman he lived with,  then shot to death his three children before killing himself.  </P></p>

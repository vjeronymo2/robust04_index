The two sides will probably agree that Tatarstan, unlike  other regions, will become an associate member of the  federation. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report on the results of the  talks crowning the post-communist period of tensions in  relations between Moscow and Kazan once the talks are completed.  At this stage, however, Russians living in Tatarstan are  seriously concerned about their fate. [passage omitted]    In everyday life, antagonisms between the Russian and the  Tatar parts of the republic's population are not so striking and  the authorities have been nearly ritualistically appealing to  the united people of Tatarstan. It has taken the Tatarstan  leadership a great deal of effort, however, to keep the Tatar  national movement, which demands a complete break with Russia,  within the limits of political correctness. According to  observers, now it is less "visible" politicians, but still  advocates of Tatarstan's gradual secession from the federation,  who are coming to the fore. "On the surface it has really  become quieter in Tatarstan, but this is only scenery behind  which a gradual removal of Russians to secondary roles is taking  place," Yuriy Rostovshchikov, leader of the Social Democrats in  Kazan and candidate for the State Duma, told your  KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. As he put it, this is reflected  in the "progressive Tatarization of government."    According to the "Russian Federation Citizens" movement, in  a  republic where Russians make up around 43 percent of the  population, Tatars account for 92 percent of government  ministers, state committee chairmen, and administration chiefs;  77 percent of Supreme Soviet standing commission chairmen; and  76 percent of rayon administration chiefs.    "The trend is such that soon there will be no Russians  holding government offices or high posts in industry. Then  mid-level chiefs will have to go, too," said Nikolay Borisov,  chairman of the Russian National Assembly's Duma. This  organization has proposed, among other things, the introduction  of a proportional ethnic representation in legislative,  executive, and judicial bodies; and a parliament made up of a  Russian Duma and a Tatar National Assembly.    In observers' view, the slogans of Russian patriots may gain  wide popular appeal among Russian residents of Tatarstan. If  the plunge in living standards of the republic's Russian  population (and defense enterprises with a predominantly Russian  work force are beset by economic woes) causes strikes, that same  Russian Assembly will find it easy to add nationalist slogans to  the workers' economic demands.</p>

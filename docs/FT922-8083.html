			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates ease slightly STERLING'S good performance on foreign exchange markets and promising figures on UK inflation led to a slight easing of rates in the sterling money markets yesterday. Traders were impressed that sterling had made gains against the D-Mark in spite of the dollar's heavy losses the previous day. Tuesday's lower than expected figure for core inflation also continued to have an effect on the market. On Tuesday, the index of prices of manufactured products for domestic consumption rose in the year to April by 3.8 per cent, leading to suggestions that this Friday's RPI figure could be smaller than forecast. One analyst said that a third reason for optimism was the bullish performance of the French franc yesterday, which momentarily crossed its central rate against the D-Mark. 'The market feels that there is no reason why sterling shouldn't do the same,' he said. Sterling has been nudging its central rate of DM2.95 for nearly a week. As a result, period rates ended the day a fraction lower. Three-month money, a key indicator of the market's view on future base rates, ended at 10 1/16 per cent, down  1/16 from Tuesday's close. At the long end, both nine-month and one-year money ended the day at 10 per cent, also down  1/16 from Tuesday's close. The futures markets showed less inclination to believe that rates might be cut. June short sterling ended the day at 89.95, continuing to show heavy resistance at 89.99. The volume for September trading was far higher than June at 11,878 lots, and the contract closed at 90.30, indicating the market's view that base rates in September will be 9.70 per cent. In the discount market, trading was taken up easily. In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m. In early operations the Bank purchased Pounds 150m of bills for resale to the market on June 1 at 9 15/16 per cent. In further operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 10m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 140m for resale to the market on June 1 at 9 15/16 per cent. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of Pounds 750m. In the afternoon the Bank purchased Pounds 186m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 14m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 150m, leaving a shortfall of around Pounds 100m.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Stolichnaya fortunes run low The bottle is running low for one of Russia's top vodka-makers. Bankruptcy officials have declared insolvent the Kristall joint-stock company, maker of Stolichnaya and two dozen other brands of the national drink. Kristall has debts of Rbs6.7bn, and the state, which owns 51 per cent of the company, plans to help restructure it. Company officials disputed the ruling and said they had appealed to the city and federal governments. For centuries the government had a monopoly on vodka sales. In February, the state lowered excise duties on Russian vodka to try to help the troubled domestic industry. Russian distillers have been struggling to adapt to a new market awash with foreign brands.</p>

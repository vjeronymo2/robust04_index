			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Clinton lectures Japan on access to markets PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday delivered what amounted to a public lecture to Japan on the need for 'rebalancing' its bilateral economic and trading relationship with the US. Mr Clinton confirmed that the US would seek specific targets for exports in selected markets in Japan. 'We are concerned not only by how much we sell, but by what we sell,' he said. His comments came at a joint press conference after morning White House meetings with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister. Mr Clinton was complimentary about Japan's achievements and implied few disagreements on issues such as regional security and aid for Russia. However, he focused most of his remarks on the imperative of forging a new, economically-led relationship in the post-Cold War era. 'Economics have been at the heart of our discussions,' he said, with Japan's persistent trade and current-account surpluses and 'inadequate market access' at the top of the agenda. While recognising the complexity of many of the issues, Japan, Mr Clinton declared, 'must accept the challenge of change as we have in the US'. Just as the US was acting to cut its deficit, 'so it is important that Japan lead the way to global economic growth'. He praised the Japanese economic stimulus package as 'an important first step', but said Japan had to understand that such actions were only part of a continuous process, in which co-ordinated macro-economic policies played only a role along with the removal of trade barriers. Mr Miyazawa replied with untypical asperity. He said economic prosperity was founded on deep and mutual economic inter-dependence, but added that 'this cannot be realised under managed trade or under the threat of unilateralism'. He urged US companies to improve their competitiveness. Clinton spending offer, Page 3 Editorial Comment, Page 6</p>

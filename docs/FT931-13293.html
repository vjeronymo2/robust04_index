			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Antall fends off right-wing challenge MR Jozsef Antall has fended off the strongest challenge to his leadership of Hungary by facing down a far-right bid for power within the conservative governing party. The prime minister's moderate camp within the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum held on to its majority in the party presidium, conceding few seats to the extremist Volk-national wing, at the congress which ended yesterday. Mr Istvan Csurka, the populist author who whipped up the far right with anti-semitic and anti-communist polemics, last night appeared chastened that he had been so clearly confronted and defeated. Nevertheless, his support among the party activists was sufficient to save his place on the party presidium. Qualified victory over the far-right gives Mr Antall the chance of appealing to moderate voters and boosting the Forum's popularity in time for the elections from the derisory 8 per cent it shows in the latest opinion polls. Government officials said that the main lines of economic and foreign policy would not change as a result of the congress. But the congress did give priority to an anti-communist programme, which would see trials of communist officials responsible for the suppression of Hungary's 1956 uprising against Soviet occupation; and to a purge of former secret police agents from positions of responsibility.</p>

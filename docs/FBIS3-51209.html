			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] St. George's, Grenada, 13 Jan, CANA -- The chairman  of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group, Grenada's  Agriculture Minister George Brizan, has called on the collection  of developing states to work out their own arrangement for  survival in the face of the challenges posed by the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    "We in the Caribbean and in the ACP have to put our heads  together to fashion out a package for the losers as a result of  the new GATT arrangement," he told Parliament.    He said that only four countries in Latin America stand to  benefit from the new trading agreement.    Brizan's comments came on the heels of a statement by the  president of the United Nations General Assembly, Guyana's  Samuel Insanally, who paid his first official visit to Grenada,  urging the region to make its presence felt in international  affairs.    He told government and private sector officials in St.  George's the region had the opportunity and the scope for  shaping international events.    Brizan spoke during debate on Grenada's 278 million dollar  (one EC dollar - 37 US cents) budget, which allocated 30 million  Eastern Caribbean dollars to agriculture.    Brizan said the region stands to lose under international  trading agreements such as GATT.    "There will be winners and losers and countries in the  Caribbean will be, unfortunately, losers in the GATT," Brizan  said.    He told Parliament: "So far, neither in theory nor in  international policy has anything been done to address the case  of losers as a result of this GATT agreement."    He criticised the attitude of developed countries and  international lending agencies toward smaller states,  particularly those dependent on agricultural production for  survival.    The Grenadian agriculture minister said the region would be  unable to provide for its people if its special needs and  concerns were not taken into account.</p>

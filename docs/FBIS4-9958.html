			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate for </F> Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, by Jacobo  Zabludovsky at the network's studio in Mexico City -- live or  recorded]    [Text] [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, thank you for being with  us this evening.    [Zedillo] Thank you for inviting me.    [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, a few days ago you were the  coordinator of Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign. After his  tragic demise, you are now a presidential candidate, as a result  of your party's decision. What are your feelings? How do you  feel?    [Zedillo] First, I think that like all Mexicans, I have a  deep and heartfelt feeling of pain over the tragic death of Luis  Donaldo Colosio. Like all Mexicans, it is my great hope this  crime will be cleared up very soon and that all Mexicans will  know the truth about the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio.  It is a desire, a demand which we all make. Also, I am firmly  determined to assume the responsibility given me by my party.    [Zabludovsky] You have said that you will continue what Mr.  Colosio began. How do you view this presidential race?    [Zedillo] I see it as highly competitive. The parties that  are different from mine, the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary  Party], are serious, organized political organizations that have  been working quite effectively and arduously in their campaigns.  I can see that all the presidential candidates deserve my  utmost respect and consideration. They are conducting intense  political activities. I clearly recognize that this is a  competitive race in which our party will face serious  contenders. At the same time, however, I am convinced the  voters, the Mexican people, on learning about the background of  the different candidates and on learning about the different  platforms each of us is proposing to solve the problems of  Mexico, will choose the option I represent.    [Zabludovsky] You speak about experience, your background in  public service. In a nutshell, what is that background?    [Zedillo] In a nutshell, it dates back to many years of  experience, exactly 25 years ago. I began as an assistant  auditor in the National Bank of the Army and Navy. Later, in  the early 1970's, I went over to the Presidency Secretariat.  After that, I left to study abroad. Upon my return, I worked  in the Banco de Mexico for several years. Later, after 1987, I  was appointed by the president as undersecretary for programming  and budget. On 1 September 1988, I was appointed programming  and budget secretary. In early 1992, I held the post of public  education secretary. It is a 25-year career that has taken me  to different sectors of public administration, two of the most  modest posts, and to the post of state secretary.    [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, we are especially interested in  hearing about your experiences as state secretary. First, can  you expand a bit on what you did when you were undersecretary in  the Programming and Budget Secretariat and when you headed that  Secretariat?    [Zedillo] With great pleasure. There is something that I  consider singular in my experience as undersecretary: that was  participating in the drafting and implementation of the first  national pact designed to banish the threat of hyperinflation,  which loomed large over us in late 1987. Perhaps this action by  the government was particularly important for the country's  development. Above all, it was important for the people's  welfare because inflation at that time hit the poor sectors  especially hard, as it did salaried workers; those whose buying  power deteriorates constantly with inflation. Hence, my  satisfaction at having been there at that time and having  participated at that moment in the overall planning for several  years, which we must consider successful.    [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, that satisfaction of which you  speak, the economic achievements in which you played a leading  role to create the economic system we now have in Mexico, has  been criticized by many people. Not only has it been  criticized, but changes in the economic system have been accused  of causing all our ailments. What do you say?    [Zedillo] I would respectfully but emphatically oppose that  view. We have to recognize, and I would be the first to  recognize, the serious problems we still have in our country.  In our country, there are many Mexicans, millions of Mexicans,  who are living in extreme poverty. These are Mexicans who lack  the most essential necessities. They are facing a situation of  marked inequality, not only among people but among regions of  the country.    It would be absurd to assume an air of triumph when  confronted with this reality. Likewise, I believe we should not  deny the merit of what has been done in the past few years. It  was the product of efforts not only by the government but by  Mexican society as a whole. We have spent these years facing  our country's deepest crisis in decades. We have laid the  groundwork for a future that holds better opportunities for all  Mexicans. It has been complex work, work that has led us to  reform different aspects of national life, but I believe we can  truly say that the transformation has been implemented with the  Mexican people's welfare in mind.    If you allow me, I would like to cite a specific example. A  while ago you asked me about my work at the Planning and Budget  Secretariat. One of the essential aspects of that work was  making sure that public finances would stop being the principal  cause of inflation. We went from a huge deficit in public  resources needed to cover public spending to a situation where  we had virtual equilibrium.    That was necessary to bring inflation under control, to  restore minimum order to the economy. But the great merit of  this economic policy was that not only public finances achieved  equilibrium and even surplus, but that an unprecedented policy  was applied to increase social spending in our country. This is  the most important spending because it is spending on people, on  human beings. Just as we were achieving equilibrium in our  public finances, our social spending went from nearly 30 percent  of total public sector spending to 50 percent during the first  three years of this administration, when I was planning and  budget secretary.    I believe that is the outlook that must be adopted when  analyzing efforts by all Mexicans over the last few years. We  have to look ahead. We have to recognize that renewal is  necessary in many aspects of the national life. Changes will be  necessary, but these changes will always have to be oriented by  the need to first serve the Mexican people. We must not  diminish the value of efforts of so many people in the past few  years.    [Zabludovsky] Bearing this in mind, what is the future of  the  NAFTA?    [Zedillo] NAFTA, as the other measures to open up trade,  must  only be seen as one of the many instruments we have obtained in  the last few years to generate better job opportunities, better  wage opportunities for Mexicans. That is the treaty's role. We  must not confuse the means with the end; the end is the welfare  of each Mexican family. NAFTA is one of the many means we have  available to increase the welfare of the Mexican family.    [Zabludovsky] You were also recently in charge of the Public  Education Secretariat. As public education secretary, what were  your most important experiences during your tenure?    [Zedillo] I came into the Public Education Secretariat with  instructions from the president to promote and coordinate, with  the participation of many people, thorough and profound  educational reform. This plan for educational reform was based  on an very basic-level diagnosis of the condition of our  country's schools and educational system. We were facing a  severe problem with centralization and bureaucracy in our  country's basic education system. As a result, the first  instruction I received was to reach an agreement with the  governments of each state and with the largest labor union in  Latin America, the National Teachers Union, on the  federalization or decentralization of the basic education  system. This means that all those schools, elementary schools  and high schools, that were supervised in all aspects from  Mexico City, had to be transferred to the governments of each  state so that the government authority would be closer to the  interests, the needs of the school itself. This was necessary  in laying the groundwork for a new educational system. It was a  very complex political, administrative, and financial endeavor.    Some months later, thanks to the participation, in the  first place, of the union, which played a key role in this  decision and its implementation, and thanks to state  governments, we were able to undertake what must be viewed as  one of the largest decentralization operations in the world. We  handed over to local governments 100,000 schools, 13.5 million  students, 700,000 education workers, and a budget of 20 billion  new pesos. This was the budget already earmarked for education  by the federal government plus an additional amount to improve  the operation of said schools. I think this is a very important  example because it sets a guideline for the future.    This shows the federal government's determination, based on  political consensus, to transfer authority, responsibility, and  resources to local governments. People must have confidence in  local governments because they are closer to the people. This  was the first aspect of educational reform.    We also set out to revise for the first time in 20 years the  lesson plans and programs which had been in force since 1972.  Thanks to this reform of lesson plans and programs we were able  to satisfy, within the educational system, long-standing desires  of parents and teachers. For instance, we reinstated the way in  which we learned our national language, that is by emphasizing  reading and writing instead of the structural linguistics to  which children were being exposed since the first grade of  elementary school. We decided to teach children mathematics the  way in which you and I were taught, with numbers, basic  mathematics, and, above all, problem solving.    Something especially rewarding to those who participated in  that reform was the reinstatement of the systematic study of the  history of the fatherland, national geography, and civic values,  which were lost in the 1972 reform. Parents and teachers had  demanded that the aforementioned subjects be reinstated.    Also as secretary of public education, but always as part of  a large team and counting on the support of many people and the  union, we undertook an academic reform in the higher  technological institutes of the country, which number about 130.  This was the first in-depth reform since the creation of  technological institutes.    It was also very rewarding to have participated in the  consolidation of the national system of researchers, to have  taken part toward the end of my term as public education  secretary in the creation of the national system of authors, and  to have presided over the in-depth reform of the National  Council of Science and Technology and in general of all the  institutions for scientific and technological research in our  country.    Education is truly one of the most satisfying areas in my  public life, for what it represents for Mexico and for the  contact I established with teachers, Mexican children, and  parents. There is no nobler task than education.    [Zabludovsky] While you were at the helm of the Public  Education Secretariat, the measures adopted by the government  were not superficial. A profound transformation was effected.    [Zedillo] These were the instructions of the president of  the  republic, to institute profound reform. During the  implementation of said reform, Article 3 of the Constitution was  reformed. This reform is very important because it established,  for the first time in our Constitution, the right to education.  Paradoxically, our Constitution did not guarantee this right.  This reform established secondary education as mandatory for  all people and as a mandatory obligation of the state. This did  not exist before.    It was also very satisfying that this reform of Article 3 of  the Constitution received support from all political parties in  our country. Until that time, there was no precedent for  constitutional reform of the kind approved for Article 3.    Another indication that the reform was structural is the  fact that the process generated a new general education law,  based on the new foresight the educational system should have.  This new general education law, which I believe is innovative  legislation, was approved by over 90 percent of the deputies  present for the debates on this new legal instrument. I agree  that the main objective of this was to implement profound  reform. This reform is already in motion, it is being applied,  and it will surely bear fruit in the coming years.    [Zabludovsky] I also believe, Mr. Zedillo, that one of the  consequences of this deep transformation of our educational  system was that it brought together all sectors of society to  participate in a very intense public debate. The debate took  several months. People expressed their opinion and managed to  guide certain solutions in the field of public education.    [Zedillo] That is right. There was a big debate on several  issues. One was the issue of decentralization. Thanks to a  very complex but very interesting negotiation with the union,  which I personally found very enlightening, we approved the  federalization of the education system. There was a debate of  the Education Secretariat's decision to reinstate the systematic  study of Mexican history and how we would provide the children  emergency study material -- as we called it at the time -- to  study Mexican history, once the Secretariat issued the order.  There were many differences of opinion over these books. In  the end, however, the result was clear: the study of Mexican  history was reintroduced, after 20 years of absence from Mexican  schools. We laid the foundations and established the criteria  to produce, write, and edit new and more specific textbooks,  which Mexican children are using today. The debates and the  controversy were well worth our while.    [Zabludovsky] We know the country has many problems, all of  which would be difficult to enumerate. Of all of these problems  we Mexicans face, which do you believe are the most important?    [Zedillo] Mr. Zabludovsky, I believe our country faces many  problems, but given your question and in an effort to summarize,  I would say that we face four basic problems.    First, we must recognize that there is a serious problem  with  injustice and insecurity in our country. It would be wrong to  deny this reality. The second problem is unemployment. This is  a problem that, by the way, has worsened recently. Unemployment  has worsened significantly during the past year, after several  years of improvement. The third very serious problem I see is  the very low, and in many cases, insufficient income of our  country's working classes. The fourth serious problem I see is  the enormous social imbalance that persists in our country.  Consequently, we have the conditions of poverty in which many  Mexicans live.    I would rather not assign these problems specific  priorities.  Each is as important as the others. Furthermore, I believe it  will be difficult to address any one of them without seriously  and decidedly addressing the others.    [Zabludovsky] There we have four serious problems. How do we  plan? Admitting that we need to very closely examine our system  for administering justice. This means we need to evaluate our  justice system's current situation and have the Congress examine  the results. Then, if need be, they can approve the appropriate  reforms that will permit the judicial system to execute its  basic duty more efficiently.    The other three problems that you have mentioned are very  interconnected. They are social and economic problems. One is  unemployment, another is the working class' low salaries, and  the fourth problem you mention is poverty in general. Let us  group them together. I would like to ask: How do you plan to  confront this situation that so concerns and obsesses all  Mexicans? I am talking about solutions to the problems of  poverty and economic inequality.    [Zedillo] I think these four problems must be solved in an  integrated, development-oriented fashion. We cannot just deal  with one problem at a time. We must take the four problems as  one. Thus we can identify at least four areas in which the  government can act.    First, we need to strengthen justice and democracy in our  country. We need to have fairer laws that can be better  applied. This speaks to the issue of the country's social,  economic, and political life. If we do not take care of these  problems, we will have serious difficulties in confronting the  other problems. The first thing we must do is strengthen  justice and democracy.    The second area for action is social development, which is  nothing more than investment in human beings. We have to spend  more on education, health, housing, basic urban services, and  social security, this with our retirees in mind. We need an  extremely ambitious social policy. Through this extremely  ambitious policy, citizens will be more aware of their rights  but also more willing and able to participate in national life.    The third part of the solution necessarily has to do with  the  problem of competitiveness or productivity of each person, in  each company, and in each economic unit. These are the  microeconomic aspects of development.    The fourth issue we already know about. It concerns the  country's economic stability, which is necessary but not  sufficient, I admit, for the nation's development. The country  needs financial and price stability, things that we have  achieved in the past few years through great effort.    The four issues are justice and democracy, social  development, productivity, and economic stability. If we can  come up with an integrated -- I believe this is completely  feasible -- policy that includes these four issues, we will  create a virtual circle of economic growth at a higher pace than  in the past, accompanied by price stability and an indubitably  more equitable distribution of wealth. This will help us  progressively -- and we hope rapidly -- eliminate the conditions  of extreme poverty in which many Mexicans live.    [Zabludovsky] We cannot avoid discussing a problem that  emerged on 1 January. We can call it the Chiapas problem. How  do you view this problem, and how do you view the peace process?    [Zedillo] First, I believe that, as all Mexicans have, I  must  express my feelings regarding the regrettable social conditions  behind this problem. Poverty, backwardness, lack of education,  and lack of health services are all at the root of this problem.  We must accept this first. We must recognize that these  conditions exist in Chiapas and other parts of our country. We  have a great responsibility as Mexicans to face these social  conditions that are so regrettable.    At the same time, with all due respect, with all frankness,  I deplore the use of violence in the country under any  circumstances.    I believe that in the face of what has happened, it was very  fortunate our Army acted to protect national security,  sovereignty, and peace. At the same time, I am very satisfied  the government of the republic immediately sought peaceful ways  to resolve this conflict. In this regard, I want to take this  opportunity to express my full support for the job the president  of the republic and his government have done to achieve a  peaceful solution in Chiapas.    I support the government's decisions. I support each and  every one of the steps it has taken through its representatives,  especially the commissioner for peace, so we can soon attain an  absolutely peaceful solution which can guarantee that we  Mexicans will remain united.    [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, returning to Mexico's problems,  what are your plans for Mexicans' health?    [Zedillo] The health problem is very important.  Historically, in past decades, although Mexico has made great  strides in extending its health care, we have to recognize that  public health care is still insufficient. Even more serious,  however, is that the health care system has not reached the  country's poorest sectors. In the coming years, therefore, we  must make an enormous effort to build more hospitals, increase  the numbers of doctors and nurses, and guarantee that there will  not be a single Mexican in this country who does not have access  to this service. Of course, in the case of people who do not  have access to social security, through the Mexican Social  Security Institute and other institutions, we must ensure that  the state's free medical service will take care of them. This is  fundamental for humanitarian reasons. Nobody thinks there  should be human suffering as a result of illness, or even death,  as happens in many cases. Also, for economic reasons, we need  better health in order to work better, produce more, earn higher  incomes, and ensure income for all society. We must assume an  enormous commitment to achieve better health for all Nexicans.    [Zabludovsky] One of Mexico's main problems is the  countryside, Dr. Zedillo.    [Zedillo] I believe this is one of the state's most  important  areas of action. Approximately 28 percent of the country's  total population, virtually 30 percent of Mexicans, live in  rural areas.    We have two types of problems. Please accept my  simplification. On the one hand, we have an acute social problem  in the countryside. The poorest of the poor live in the  countryside. The greatest needs for education, health, housing,  potable water, and electricity are precisely there in the  countryside.    But we also have a production problem. We have a situation  where it has become increasingly difficult to have the Mexican  countryside produce products demanded by the Mexican people for  their sustenance. We must therefore attack problems in those two  areas. We must have a very ambitious social policy to attack  the root of that existing rural poverty. We must have a  strategy to attack production problems.    The answer, as I said earlier, is to invest in human beings,  which is the most important thing. Also, with regard to  production, I think we must act on several fronts. We must  apply, with great justice, Article 27 of the Constitution and  reform the laws. We must invest in infrastructure, in technical  assistance for the countryside. We must invest in training for  farmers, support them in developing the new marketing system,  and make sure that they obtain timely and sufficient credit --  as they say now -- at competitive costs. If they are to compete  abroad, we must make sure that we give them competitive  conditions. A fundamental factor in the countryside is credit.  We cannot expect farmers to compete with imported foodstuffs  unless we make sure that they also have raw materials and  elements obtained at competitive prices on the international  market.    I think it is a very important and complex task, but I am  sure the transformation of the Mexican countryside can be  achieved. With a strong social policy and with a coherent  policy for increasing productivity in the countryside, we can  help many million Mexicans living there to overcome conditions  of extreme poverty that affect them.    [Zabludovsky] Doctor, in your proposal, what is the role of  small and medium-sized businesses?    [Zedillo] Micro-, small-, and medium-sized businesses have  always played a fundamental role in the economic life of the  country. Some 52 percent of the jobs in Mexico are generated by  these businesses. Some 98 percent of businesses in our country  are either small or medium-sized. There are 1.3 million micro-,  small-, and medium-sized businesses.    Evidently, the state and society must pay close attention to  small and medium-sized businesses. It is not a matter of  paternalism. Those businessmen would be the first to reject  turning the clock back. I have many friends who are small  businessmen, who have assumed with great dignity their new  responsibility in light of the new circumstances but who also  asked that they not be left alone. We must promote small and  medium-sized businesses.    I believe there are very specific ways to achieve this. In  the first place, the whole process must be made easier for them.  All the red tape that encumbers small and medium businessmen  must be eliminated. I am referring to the various regulations,  including of course those related to taxes.    In the second place, it is necessary to know that for these  businesses to succeed, they need to be up-to-date  technologically. I believe that given the number of those  businesses, specific state action is required, without  paternalism, so they become aware of the need to seek new  technology. All opportunities must be provided for this  modernization to take place.    In the third place, I think it is very important for the  state and businessmen to unite, making unprecedented efforts in  Mexico's history to train the work force. In my opinion, this  is one of the most significant challenges we face in the coming  years. I believe this is possible because there is a great deal  of experience in our country in this field. The problem is that  the effort has not been widespread.    In the fourth place, it is also very important to foster  models for partnerships among these types of businesses.  Therefore, sir, I realize there is a very serious problem with  regard to the small-, micro-, and medium-sized businesses. I am  also convinced, however, there are solutions, and if these are  applied we can overcome the obstacles. This is very important  for all Mexicans that this occur.    [Zabludovsky] Doctor, what is democracy's role here?    [Zedillo] As I said before, we cannot seek to progress in  one  area of the nation's development and lag behind in another.  Democracy is one of the fundamental political principles of the  Mexican nation. It has been around since our Constitutions were  drawn up during the last century. Democracy started the Mexican  revolution: the holding of elections without reelection. This  political principle was clearly established in the 1917  Constitution, and therefore it is a principle that Mexicans must  honor every day.    I must admit that this is an incomplete process. Our  democracy can still be more perfect; a great deal of progress  still has to be made. Nevertheless, I have a great deal of  faith that if we can sustain that momentum, that drive in the  progress made in the past years, very shortly all Mexicans will  be able to say: We live in a fully and absolutely democratic  nation. I believe, sir, that progress in democracy is  imperative to progress in the other sectors of the nation's life.    [Zabludovsky] So then, as candidate for president, who does  Ernesto Zedillo call on to do this?    [Zedillo] I call on all Mexicans who are willing to work so  that at the beginning of the 21st century Mexico can be a  sovereign and united country, a country that lives in peace and  progress, a country that has left way behind very serious  problems of inequality and poverty, a fully democratic country,  as I said earlier. I call on all Mexicans who want to work to  build the country in which we all believe and about which we all  dream to participate with me in this election.    [Zabludovsky] What do you think of the other candidates? Do  you think a debate would be useful?    [Zedillo] As I said earlier, I have great respect for and  hold in high esteem the other candidates for president. I agree  with Colosio and the other candidates that a debate is  necessary. It is necessary to present to the Mexican people not  only the problems of which we are all aware but also the  proposals for solving those problems. I want my proposals to  face off against the proposals of the other candidates. The  Mexican people should be given an opportunity to compare these  proposals so that everyone can cast his vote freely on 21  August. And I expect the voters to cast their votes for me  after they have compared the different proposals. As I said  earlier, I have assumed this responsibility with determination,  and I want to be president of the republic.    [Zabludovsky] Dr. Zedillo, is Mexico's existing electoral  system reliable?    [Zedillo] My answer is yes. May I explain? First, in recent  years, the Federal Congress or rather the Constituent Congress  in the case of the Constitution -- or the Permanent Constituent  Congress, as it is called, juridically speaking -- and the  Federal Congress, in the case of Cofipe [Federal Code of  Electoral Institutions and Procedures], has implemented a number  of very important reforms. At least two basic facts can be  pointed out in connection with these reforms: the existence of  autonomous electoral institutions and the existence of an  exemplary list of names, exemplary because of its outline,  control, and verification characteristics. These reforms, which  are very important, provide a much more trustworthy electoral  system than the one we had up until a few years ago.    In addition, I must point out that the proposals PRI has  drafted in past years to reinforce this electoral system and the  proposals of other parties have crystallized, through consensus,  in decisions to improve the electoral system. I have to recall  that, on 27 January, the candidates for president from eight  political parties signed an agreement for peace, democracy, and  justice. Based on this agreement, the parties reached a  consensus to reform Article 41 of the Constitution. This  reformed article will surely be translated now into action as  additional reforms to Cofipe. This enables us to expect -- we  truly desire it and I fully endorse all of these agreements, as  well as any others that derive from the Cofipe reform -- that we  will have a fully reliable electoral system for the coming  elections. So my answer is yes, we will have pure elections by  virtue of all the effort made in the past few years.    [Zabludovsky] Speaking of political parties, how long have  you been an active member of the PRI?    [Zedillo] Formally, since 1971, when I started activities at  the Institute for Political, Economic, and Social Studies with  then deputy director Leopoldo Solis. From a family standpoint,  I can say I have been a party member for a long, long time. I  am the son of an active female member of [words indistinct], who  became leader in my state, and a PRI political activist, who  always took me by the hand to all her activities. So I can say  that I have been a proud member of the PRI since very early in  my life because of my mother's influence, and formally a member  since 1971.    [Zabludovsky] In light of the new laws, how do you view  church-state relations, Dr. Zedillo?    [Zedillo] This is a very complex matter. Of course, I  endorse and support the amendments of Article 130 of the  Constitution approved two or three years ago. At the same time,  I would like to point out some aspects of Article 130 of the  Constitution. The role of the state has been historically  defined. The state must preserve and defend national  sovereignty, encourage and enforce just laws, and look after the  people's general well-being. In other words, the state's role  is more on the material side. The church's role, on the other  hand, has to do with the people's consciences and beliefs and  therefore is on the spiritual side. Hence, it is very important  to have a clear separation between the activities of the state  and the church. This is a tradition and a concept with deep  historical roots in our country. I would like to reiterate my  support for the amendments of Article 130 of our Constitution,  stressing the importance of maintaining the separation, not only  in the Constitution, but through actions, between the church and  the state. I believe this is very important for national  coexistence.    [Zabludovsky] I would like to make a pause between political  and economic matters. Please tell us about the person named  Ernesto Zedillo.    [Zedillo, laughing] Well, I am a normal person. I come from  a large family. My mother, who died when she was relatively  young, was born in Irapuato, Guanajuato. My father was born  here in Mexico City in the Morelos neighborhood, between  Sastreria and San Antonio Tomatlan. He was born and raised in a  house that still stands. My grandmother lived there until not  too long ago. She died the day I was appointed general manager  of the campaign. I have two brothers and three sisters. I have  a family, as a man of my age normally does. My wife's name is  Patricia. We have been married almost 20 years. We met when we  were students at the Higher Economy School. Later on I became  her teacher. She was a good student. We got married and now  have five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos, Linda Patricia,  and Rodrigo. We are a normal and loving family, very united, as  are all Mexican families.    [Zabludovsky] Did you say your mother passed away?    [Zedillo] Yes, very young.    [Zabludovsky] How old were you when she died?    [Zedillo] I was 18 or 19. It was a hard blow.    [Zabludovsky] Is the Morelos neighborhood north of La  Merced?    [Zedillo] Yes, the house is near the former penitentiary.  It is still there. That is where I lived as a student in  Mexico City, in the Morelos neighborhood.    [Zabludovsky] Where else have you lived?    [Zedillo, laughing] I have lived in many houses. The list  would be too long. We lived in Mexicali when we arrived in  Pueblo Nuevo, which is a very dear and traditional neighborhood.  We then moved to the newest part of the city. When I arrived  in Mexico City I lived with my grandparents for a while in the  Morelos neighborhood, then I moved to Jardin Balbuena. I am now  living in La Magdalena, Contreras, where you are welcome to  visit any time.    [Zabludovsky] Thank you. We gather from your biography that  achieving the level of responsibility you have right now,  considering your humble background, has undoubtedly required  great tenacity.    [Zedillo] It has required tenacity, effort, discipline, and  enthusiasm. It would not be fair, however, to claim all the  credit. I believe it is the result of my own effort as well as  the efforts of many other people. This of course includes my  parents, who contributed with their work and through their  example, and my family, particularly my wife, and my children  who have always encouraged me. I must also mention my teachers.  I always acknowledge their role, as what I learned from my  teachers means a lot to me, particularly from those in grade  school, high school, and at all educational levels. I always  remember them with special affection.    I want to say something to those people with whom I have  worked throughout my life and who have given me the opportunity  to keep working and advancing in my career. I wrote this a long  time ago in the introduction to my doctoral thesis. In the  foreword of my thesis, I thank Mexicans because they pay the  taxes that enable the government to open public schools, which I  attended and 90 percent of Mexicans also attend. The resources  from the National Council of Science and Technology [CONACYT]  that sponsored my doctorate also belong to the Mexicans.  Therefore, mine is not a personal endeavor; it is the result of  the support of many people.    [Zabludovsky] Did you always attend public schools?    [Zedillo] Yes, except for my doctorate, for which I attended  a private university. However, my doctoral degree was sponsored  by CONACYT.    [Zabludovsky] As the PRI candidate, what do you expect from  the 21 August elections?    [Zedillo] I expect these elections will be absolutely clean  and will take place within a legal and peaceful framework. I  also hope that they will be an exemplary civic event for us and  future generations and that they result in a more united nation  with increased confidence that will help us be a great nation.  I hope, Mr. Zabludovsky, to win the coming elections because I  reiterate: I want to be president of Mexico.    [Zabludovsky] Have you resumed the campaign that was  interrupted by Colosio's death?    [Zedillo] We will be resuming it very soon.    [Zabludovsky] Many thanks, Dr. Zedillo. Do you have anything  else to add?    [Zedillo] I only want to thank you and especially the  viewers  for this opportunity.    [Zabludovsky] This was PRI presidential candidate Ernesto  Zedillo Ponce de Leon. Thank you. Good night.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Board faces tough questions: MGN shareholders claim 'buckets of whitewash' were thrown over directors' roles THE BOARD of Mirror Group Newspapers was yesterday accused of trying to whitewash the Robert Maxwell affair and of being tainted in the public eye. The accusations were made at the first annual meeting of MGN since last year's flotation. The meeting was held against a background of overall losses of nearly Pounds 500m and what was described as probably the largest fraud this century. The claim that 'buckets of whitewash ' had been thrown over the role of the MGN board came from Mr Joseph Grizzard, a shareholder and former MGN director in the pre-Maxwell days. He said the board had made it all look like an unfortunate accident which had been beyond the control of all the directors. Mr Trevor Davis, a Daily Mirror journalist, warned that the members of the board would continue to be hounded by questions about what they knew. 'In the public eye they are tainted and they should go,' he said. But in spite of tough questions - more than 80 per cent from employee shareholders - the three-hour meeting was generally low-key. Card votes were forced on accepting the financial accounts and reappointing Mr Roger Eastoe and Mr Bernard Tominey as directors but the outcome was never in doubt. The lowest vote in favour was 99.72 per cent of votes cast. The board was supported by Mr John Talbot, administrator to the private Maxwell companies, who holds 54 per cent of MGN and most of the proxy votes. Sir Robert Clark, chairman, said: 'You may as shareholders hang whom you like but the group still has to be managed and run.' He also admitted the board had been advised that there could be claims against the company because of circumstances surrounding the flotation and subsequent events. 'If such claims were successfully established, the company might have claims against certain of its professional advisers,' Sir Robert said. Sir Robert said he expected the shares, suspended at 125p since December, would be relisted today. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at James Capel, said the share price could fall today to 50p-55p. Sir Robert confirmed that Mr Alan Stephens, the company secretary, and Mr Robert Gregory, director of human resources, were subject to internal disciplinary proceedings although no illegality was alleged. Mr Rupert Allason, the Conservative MP for Torbay who said he was the last man to receive a writ from Robert Maxwell, said the board should resign. 'How are cronies of Robert Maxwell still on the board? It is an insult to see them there,' he said to cheers. But Sir Robert emphasised that the board had exposed in the frankest way possible the effects of the frauds and what had been done to give MGN a good future. 'We have told the story warts and all. We must now build on what we have,' he said. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Charter restructuring CHARTER CONSOLIDATED shareholders have approved the restructuring of the group, which will mean that Minorco will no longer be a shareholder. Votes cast at the EGM and court meetings were overwhelmingly in favour of the proposals. A High Court hearing to sanction the scheme is expected to take place on August 18. All Charter shareholders, except Minorco, will exchange their shares in Charter Consolidated for shares in a new company, Charter plc. Minorco will receive a loan note for Pounds 235m. Trading in Charter shares is expected to begin on August 23.</p>

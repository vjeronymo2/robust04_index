			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. SUES 4 CITIES ON TOXIC WASTE DUMPING  </P> <P> The government, citing federal Clean Water Act requirements, sued four cities  today for failing to stop local industrial plants from dumping toxic waste  water into municipal sewer systems.  </P> <P> The Justice Department, acting on behalf of the Environmental Protection  Agency, filed suit against Detroit, Phoenix, San Antonio and El Paso, charging  that city officials have not enforced federal rules requiring industry to  remove toxic pollutants from waste water before discharging it into sewers.  </P> <P> EPA officials said those four cities represent only a tiny fraction of the  problem nationwide and that 57 other cities -- including San Francisco, for its  China Basin district, and West Sacramento, Calif. -- already face federal  penalties for failure to enforce the industrial "pre-treatment" rules.  </P> <P> Pre-treatment of industrial waste water is required under the Clean Water Act  to ensure toxic pollution is not flushed into rivers and lakes from sewage  systems, which are not designed to filter out hazardous chemicals.  </P> <P> City officials are supposed to enforce the pre-treatment requirements by  setting limits on toxic discharges by industry and then monitoring factories to  ensure that waste water does not contain pollution levels above those  standards.  </P> <P> "Local officials have a legal and moral responsibility . . . to make sure local  industries abide by the rules," said Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh in announcing  the lawsuits against the four cities. "Otherwise, they in effect become  polluters themselves by permitting the very discharge they are supposed to  police.  </P> <P> "We simply cannot allow harmful pollutants to reach our rivers and streams  untreated," Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, appearing with Thornburgh at a news  conference, said the lawsuits against the four cities are part of a continuing  EPA crackdown on toxic discharges by industry.  </P></p>

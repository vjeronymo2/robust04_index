			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Heseltine hits at opposition's Scottish plans MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the environment secretary, last night launched a ferocious attack on opposition policies of devolution and independence for Scotland and delivered a vivid warning about the dangers of nationalism. Addressing a delighted audience at a Conservative party rally in Edinburgh, he said: 'The future of Scotland and the Union which bind the United Kingdom together is under threat as never before. All our opponents want to change Britain. 'They want a different Britain. A Britain on the sidelines. A Scotland diminished. A Britain broken.' The Scottish Nationalist party offered Scotland the straight choice of separatism and socialism. It was a 'cynical creed which spells destruction, division and disunity'. Labour and Liberal Democrat support for devolution was a cynical move to save their votes from the SNP, he said. Devolution would produce another layer of bureaucracy with higher taxes and a worse climate for investment. Independence would destroy Scotland's ability to influence the big decisions in Nato, in Europe and in international economic forums. Nationalism was on the march and was producing 'extremism in France, riots on the streets of Marseilles, fascism on the rise in Germany' and ethnic hatred, racial bitterness and social turmoil in eastern Europe. German nationalism had nearly destroyed the UK. 'Scotland couldn't have stopped Hitler alone,' said Mr Heseltine. 'But nor could England or Wales or Ireland. None of us. Together we did. This union of ours did.' Labour's devolution was to assemblies, councils, unions, committees, working parties and pressure groups. The real devolution was to the 'real Scottish people' through the purchase of their council houses, the choice of school to which to send their children and control of schools through school boards, all of them Tory innovations.</p>

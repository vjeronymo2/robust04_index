			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Bacon falls short of target Christie's, the fine art auctioneer, experienced its second major disappointment of the week yesterday when an important painting by Francis Bacon, one of his re-interpretations of Velasquez's Pope Innocent X, failed to sell. The painting had a top estimate of Pounds 2.5m - but bidding dried up at less than Pounds 1.5m. The sale of contemporary art brought in Pounds 3.3m. and was 57 per cent sold by value. Top price was the Pounds 430,500 paid for Black Peacock, a mobile by Alexander Calder. On Monday Christie's failed to find a buyer for the most important work in its auction of impressionist and modern art, one of Braque's Atelier studies, bought in at Pounds 1.8m. That sale totalled Pounds 9.3m, but was only 51 per cent sold. In contrast Sotheby's had a good week. If Bacon is reckoned to be the UK's greatest 20th century artist, Lucian Freud is regarded as probably the best living British painter. On Wednesday night Sotheby's sold The Painter's Room, an early work from 1943 when he was 22, for Pounds 507,500, comfortably above estimate. An equally youthful work by David Hockney, painted while he was a student at the Royal College of Art, did well at Pounds 221,500. Sotheby's contemporary sale totalled Pounds 5.15m, with 75 per cent sold by value. This was in line with its Tuesday auction of impressionist and modern art which brought in Pounds 19.8m and was 78 per cent sold, with an early version of Un Bar Aux Folies Bergere by Manet making Pounds 4.4m and one of Monet's poplar series Pounds 4.84m.</p>

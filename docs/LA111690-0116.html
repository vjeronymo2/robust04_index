			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURY COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> MAN ACCUSED OF KIDNAPING, RAPE  </P> <P> A 31-year-old Ventura County man was arrested on suspicion of kidnaping and  raping a woman he promised a job as a baby-sitter, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Douglas Ray Kaufman was being held in the Ventura County Jail on $20,000 bail,  a jail spokesman said.  </P> <P> The 35-year-old woman, who is a transient, told police that she met a man  Monday when she was at the intersection of Yerba Buena Road and the Pacific  Coast Highway, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. John Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> The man, who pulled over to the side of the road, said he needed a baby-sitter  and asked if she needed work, Fitzgerald said. They arranged for him to pick  her up the next day, Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> The man drove the woman to his house on Cotharin Road south of Thousand Oaks  about 6 p.m. Tuesday, Fitzgerald said. The woman said the man then bound her  hands behind her back and raped her, Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> The woman said the man later put her back in the car, drove her to a shed about  a quarter of a mile away and left her there, Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> The woman later freed herself and made her way to a restaurant about 7:30 a.m.  Wednesday. People there called the Sheriff's Department and she then led  deputies to a house where Kaufman was arrested. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

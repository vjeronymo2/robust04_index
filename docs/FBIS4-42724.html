			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Pierre Gerard, monetary policy adviser </F> to the Bank of France, by Jean-Pierre Robin; place and date not  given: "Jean-Pierre Gerard: Solutions for the Credit Shortfall"]    [Text] Jean-Pierre Gerard is one of six monetary  policy advisers who is responsible for defining the Bank of  France's leading interest rates. With his background in  corporate management, he is worried about the difficulties  companies are encountering in finding credits to finance the  economic recovery. He suggests some solutions.    [Robin] The members of the Monetary Policy Committee (CPM)  have, for several weeks now, been stepping up their contacts  with economic agents, especially outside of the Paris region.  What are your views on the recovery?    [Gerard] The recovery appears to have started, and, as in  all  phases of transition, hope tends to alternate with doubt. It  also appears to me that industrial groups are more aware now of  exchange rates and the problems they could be faced with in  Europe caused by sterling, the peseta, and especially the lira,  since the Italian economy seems very competitive. Bankers,  however, are more concerned with interest rates and access to  the capital markets.    From the meetings I have had with representatives of  industry, it is clear that their order books are starting to  fill up again, although this has yet to be converted into actual  revenues. Moreover, economic growth is being driven a lot less  by domestic consumption than by exports.    [Robin] How does industry view the so-called "strong franc"  or policy of monetary stability?    [Gerard] First, we should note that all world currencies are  floating. The only area where there is stability is vis-a-vis  the mark and the currencies of northern Europe, since they are  linked by the European Monetary System (EMS). The problem is  where other currencies are concerned, those that are outside the  EMS exchange rate mechanism, such as the lira or sterling, not  to mention the dollar. The fluctuation in the U.S. currency  plays a key role, and yet the Bank of France and Europe in  general have no control over it.    However, in general French industry appears to be suffering  more from the weakness of the dollar than Germany's. This is  especially the case in the high-tech and aeronautics sectors,  where our companies are more exposed than the Germans to U.S.  competition. The Germans are more active in sectors like  mechanical engineering, where they can determine world prices.    [Robin] After the successive cuts of recent months, have  interest rates reached a satisfactory level for companies?    [Gerard] What companies are more concerned about today is  gaining access to credit rather than its actual cost. The banks  are subjected to the Cooke ratio, which stipulates that their  credits cannot be more than 12.5 times their capital assets.  Some of them had to absorb losses last year which reduced their  assets and thus their ability to award loans. They suffered in  1993, and are now looking to restore their operating margins by  choosing their risks more carefully and lending at still  relatively high rates.    [Robin] Should we fear a shortfall of credits for the  recovery?    [Gerard] Companies have particularly large borrowing  requirements in two circumstances. First, when they lose money  and are faced with a question of how to survive; and second, in  periods of recovery and growth. The latter is the current  situation. Companies have to replenish their stocks when the  orders begin to come in again so that more revenues can be  generated, even though the money will only start to trickle in  in another six months time. Companies therefore have high  borrowing requirements at a time when banks' offers of loans are  tending to dry up, for reasons that are not necessarily all  their own fault.    [Robin] What solutions do you propose to get us out of this  impasse?    [Gerard] We should implement a number of solutions, but one  of the simplest things we could do would certainly be to use the  "carry back" [previous two words in English] mechanism better  than we do currently. Let me remind you how it works:  Companies that go into the red in a given year can deduct this  loss from the profits made in previous years. This operation  generates a tax debt which is only called in after five years.  In reality, the state will only reimburse companies if  corporate profits for the following five years are less than the  previous loss. Companies finding themselves in this situation  would then be in quite a bad position.    [Gerard] Thus, banks will not allow companies to refinance  their loans generated by carry back, which is regrettable. The  banks would be a lot less reticent, however, if these debts  could be demanded from the tax authorities after just two years.  I should also point out that companies using this kind of  instrument are generally healthy ones, since they must have made  profits in previous years to be able to apply the carry back  principle.    [Robin] Would that be enough to trigger credit distribution?    [Gerard] Of course not. We would also have to consider  widening the field of guaranty and mutual insurance systems to  cover risks. Sofaris, which guarantees bank loans under certain  conditions, is currently playing a very positive role. However,  the guaranty system would be more efficient and less expensive  if Sofaris was not the only body of this kind. In any event, we  must try and match the banks' offer of credit with potential  company demand. Unfortunately this is not the case at present  because this has been an extremely difficult year for everyone.    [Robin] The policy of the Bank of France aims at lowering  all  interest rates as much as possible, including both short- and  long- term rates. This is a legitimate concern, but does it  really correspond to the needs of companies which have mainly  short-term debts?    [Gerard] That is a major topic for discussion: How can  different economic operators all be financed? It seems that the  state and the housing sector are mainly concerned with long-term  rates. Large companies use long- and short-term rates in  roughly the same proportions. Small- and medium-sized  companies, however, are mainly concerned with short-term  financing, with credits often index-linked to the short rates.  Let me add that, in periods of recovery, what companies need  more than anything else are short-term cash facilities to  finance their capital requirements.    This is the ground that monetary policy covers, but this  policy is clearly not neutral; like all policies, it has  redistributing effects. The CPM is looking to reduce rates  gradually. We have seen eight cuts of 0.1 percent in the  discount rate since the beginning of the year. Experience has  shown that each cut had a favorable impact on long-term rates.  During the bond market crisis that shook all the financial  markets in the first quarter, France and Germany came out on  top. The monetary policy that was implemented therefore had a  beneficial effect for everyone. From my experience in industry,  I believe gradual change is excellent. There is nothing worse  for economic activity than sudden shocks, which then require  very painful adaptation mechanisms.    [Robin] Can we expect further interest rate cuts in France?    [Gerard] The cuts we have made prove our desire to go along  with the economic recovery. However, the banking system also  has to be able and strong enough to pass this on. You cannot  have ailing banks issuing loans.    [Robin] Price stability is the final, or even sole aim of  our  monetary policy. At the end of the day, though, is this not a  secondary concern since inflation is well under control in  France and has been for several years?    [Gerard] The framework of the law, and our Constitution, is  clear: The Bank of France must guarantee price stability. The  problem is knowing what we are measuring, and this problem has  not really been considered. The CPM has set itself the aim of  preventing retail prices from growing by more than 2 percent a  year in the medium term. Maybe this gauge is not perfect. It  is designed to measure just retail prices and excludes  industrial production prices which can vary quite significantly  -- on average, these fell, sometimes quite sharply, during the  recession. How else can we define stability if there are no  other indices? The retail price index is, perhaps, the best of  a bad bunch. However, it is still open to criticism.    [Robin] Is not the link with the mark, although this is not  in the Bank of France's remit, more important than domestic  currency stability which currently guides the bank's action?    [Gerard] The Bank of France's responsibility is to maintain  the domestic stability of the currency -- price stability --  which it defines itself. This is what the law dictates. It is  the government's responsibility to set out the exchange rate  policy -- all the Bank of France has to do is implement it.  This policy has been defined, and has as its reference the  European monetary agreement of 2 August 1993.  <H5>  A Collegial Institution </H5>   [Gerard] In practice, it is clear that our aim has been to  keep interest rates as low as possible in France. However, we  must of course be careful about how the foreign exchange markets  will react.    We do not have much influence over the dollar rate, but we  do  have to take into account the behavior of the franc in the EMS.  I should add that we are happy with the current franc-mark  exchange rate because, as it stands, it means that French  industry has a competitive edge over Germany.    [Robin] The CPM is composed of very different types of  people. What are the discussions like?    [Gerard] The CPM will have been very successful when it  manages to convince people it is a collegial institution.  Having said that, our discussions can be lively, but our  decisions are taken collectively.    [Robin] After a vote?    [Gerard] Everything is possible: a consensus decision, a  common agreement, a vote, etc. Our meeting closely resembles  any other board meeting.    [Robin] Leaving aside its collegial aspect, how do you view  the CPM's mission?    [Gerard] The CPM has been asked to play the role of a kind  of  guardian of monetary morality. You have to understand that the  currency guarantees trade. All trade is a contract, a promise  that must be kept in space and time: The law demands monetary  stability, a guarantee that this promise will be kept, while  inflation distorts these contracts.    Secondly, it is the CPM's duty to listen and explain. Since  sovereignty of the currency was passed to us, we have to explain  clearly what we are doing with it. The law states that we are  responsible for our actions to the president of the republic and  parliament. The success of the CPM will finally depend on the  success of the economy -- we can make our contribution, but of  course it is not all down to us!</p>

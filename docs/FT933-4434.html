			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Azeris offer peace talks: Hope of end to Nagorno Karabakh war MR Haydar Aliyev, acting head of state of Azerbaijan, yesterday offered immediate talks with Armenian leaders. His move raised hopes for an end to the five-year struggle between the two newly-independent former Soviet states for control of the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno Karabakh, which is within the borders of Azerbaijan. Mr Aliyev, speaking at a press conference after two days of talks with Russian leaders in Moscow, said: 'I have stood and now stand for a peaceful settlement of this situation. . . it will not be settled by military means.' He refused to be drawn on whether he would trade the independent status of Nagorno Karabakh for return of the 20 per cent of Azerbaijan which has now been occupied by Nagorno Karabakh forces. Previously Azerbaijan has refused to contemplate a change of status for Nagorno Karabakh. The Russian official news agency Itar Tass quoted Mr Levan Ter-Petrossian, the Armenian president, as saying he would be willing to meet Mr Aliyev. Mr Aliyev, who is to be confirmed as president next month, was formerly first secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist party - and showed yesterday that he retains his aura of authority and appetite for power. Though he has clamped down on the opposition by jailing leading members of the Popular Front, supporters of the ousted president Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, he presents himself as a man committed to peace and uninterested in the fierce nationalism espoused by Mr Elchibey. Mr Hikmet Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister who is in Moscow with a top-level Turkish delegation, said yesterday that the issue had become an international one - and likened Armenia's capture of Azerbaijani land to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. He warned that an Armenian attack on Nakhichevan - the Azerbaijani enclave within Armenia with which Turkey has a small common border and whose security it protects through a 70-year-old treaty - would mean that 'the problem may get out of hand'. Mr Cetin disclosed that Iranian forces had crossed a kilometre or two into Azerbaijan - but said it was not a threatening move and was designed only to regulate the flow of refugees from Azerbaijan into Iran.</p>

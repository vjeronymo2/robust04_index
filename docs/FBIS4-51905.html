			<p>BFN     [Text] Two quarantine officials will face punishment for  their alleged roles in allowing importers to market frozen  U.S.-made frankfurters here despite their original labels  instructing "keep refrigerated."    An inspection team at the Ministry of Health and Social  Affairs detected illegal practices by 24 importers in March and  the ministry ordered them to destroy frankfurters valued at 19  billion won, although two-thirds had already been sold.    The officials are Chang Chun-sik, 48, who now works for the  National Institute for Safety Research, and Chi Yong-ae, 37, at  the Pusan National Quarantine Station (PNQS).    The ministry yesterday asked a disciplinary committee of the  Government Administration Ministry to determine their  punishment. Chang and Chi, who worked together for the PNQS in  November 1990, permitted importers to extend expiration dates of  refrigerated sausages from 30 days to 90 days as if they had  been frozen.</p>

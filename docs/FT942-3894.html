			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: Tax-free benefits for those made redundant - Finance Few employees like to consider the possibility of redundancy. But if you are faced with the prospect of being 'surplus to requirements', you should at least be able to get benefits, such as redundancy counselling from your employer, without being taxed for them. Usually, benefits provided by an employer are subject to income tax. But David Harris, barrister at Prince Henry's Chambers, London, says benefits provided with the sole or main purpose of helping the employee adjust to the end of his employment, and/or enabling him to find other gainful employment, are tax-exempt. 'Gainful' employment can include self-employment and even positions which carrying an honorarium, such as a job with a charity, although the position must involve payment other than expenses. As long as this condition is fulfilled, the employer can provide advice and guidance. This can take the form of the services of an out-placement counsellor, professional preparation of a curriculum vitae; training or re-training; the use of office equipment or even the services of a secretary. The exemption also extends to travelling expenses met by the employer as long as they are in connection with the tax-exempt benefits. So they can include travelling from the employee's place of work to a counsellor, a training centre or an interview and even visits to prospective clients, if you are thinking of self-employment. It is highly unlikely though that reimbursement for travel expenses from the employee's home will be tax-exempt. Harris says that although the employer cannot restrict the benefit to any particular type of employee (such as directors), it can be limited to a particular class so that an employer can require his staff to have had five years' service before giving them this benefit. Relief is not available for services performed outside the UK, so an overseas employee who is made redundant cannot benefit from the exemption unless he returns to seek 'gainful employment' in Britain. If he has been working abroad for a long time, he may not be liable to pay UK tax, anyway.</p>

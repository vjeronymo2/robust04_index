			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Conservatives enter the fray with a balancing act The balancing act is encapsulated in the manifesto's title: A strong Britain in a strong Europe. The Conservatives will be positive about Europe before the June 9 poll for the Strasbourg assembly. But the party will be more positive still about its determination to get Britain's way in Europe. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and author of the manifesto, has managed to exclude from the text the more extreme demands of colleagues on the anti-European right of the party. The doors are not slammed completely on the possibility of an eventual return to the European exchange rate mechanism - or of participation in a single European currency. There is no promise of the referendum sought by the Euro-sceptics on the next stage of European integration. As Mr John Major says in the document's foreword, the argument it advances is not framed in terms of Europe Right or Wrong but Europe Right or Left. It is the ambitions of the socialist centralisers for Europe's institutions that the government abhors, not the institutions themselves. But the manifesto's tone reflects the mood of a party willing to accept, even embrace, Europe if that can be done on Britain's terms; but quick to reject it if anyone else threatens to set the agenda. It is as defensive as it is positive. First the positive. Mr Major dismisses at the outset the idea floated by some on the Conservative right that Britain might in the next few years have to reassess whether it should belong to the EU. Its opening words state baldly: 'Our membership of the European Union is vital to Britain.' Mr Major reinforced that point at yesterday's launch when he ridiculed the notion of a repeat of the 1975 referendum on membership. A lengthy section on the European economy makes the same point. Britain's trade, its inward investment and its employment prospects are all linked inextricably to the EU. The manifesto argues that the government is winning the debate over the need for a new focus on competitiveness, flexible labour markets and de-regulation. Pledging the government's determination to promote free trade and the completion of the single market, it adds: 'Open markets are the Oxygen of Growth.' To that end Britain will press for further liberalisation of the telecommunications, transport and energy sectors. The manifesto is replete with examples of where the government has set the agenda for the rest of Europe: in the push for subsidiarity; in the promotion of intergovernmental co-operation at Maastricht; and in the acceleration of enlargement. But for every positive idea there is a plan or ambition that the Conservatives will thwart - and a charge that Labour and the Liberal Democrats would sell Britain's interests short. Conservatives will resist any move to increase the present limits on EU spending or any threat to the rebate Britain receives on its contribution to Brussels. The government will defend implacably the British veto. As Mr Major puts it in his foreword: 'We want less interference from Brussels not more.' The prime minister has been told by opinion pollsters that this negative message has the best hope of persuading disgruntled supporters to vote Conservative on June 9. The odds are that it will quickly drown out the positive.</p>

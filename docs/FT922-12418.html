			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Wine: This bourgeois star - Chateau Lilian-Ladouys MY BORDEAUX broker friend had not even heard of Chateau Lilian-Ladouys. 'Oh no, not another cru bourgeois having money lavished on it,' he said, referring to Bordeaux's underclass of more than 200 chateaux officially ranked a notch below the 60-odd chateaux, or crus, classified in 1855. 'All they do is prove there really is a difference between even the best crus bourgeois and the crus classes.' Perhaps he was thinking of Chateau Clarke, a cru bourgeois in Listrac into which Swiss banker Baron Edmond de Rothschild has immersed his not inconsiderable personal income from the family's famous crus classe Chateau Lafite-Rothschild - only to prove, some would say, that in terms of wine quality, if not geography, the Listrac hinterland is very much more than 15 kilometres away from the peak of Pauillac. The man who has decided to sink what he made out of electronic payment systems into an unglorious patch of St Estephe presumably has other crus bourgeois in mind. Chateaux Monbrison, Sociando-Mallet, Haut-Marbuzet, Chasse-Spleen and, of course, Gloria can command - purely on the basis of the quality of wine produced - higher prices than the most lacklustre (although admittedly underperforming) crus classes. Until 1990, Christian Thieblot was based in Paris and was chairman of Sodinforg, a computer company that is now part of Paribas. He and his Swiss wife, Lilian, had already tried for two years to make a go of a wine property in the Bas-Medoc, the boondocks of Bordeaux; but they realised that, to have any chance of making both an impact and fine wine, they would have to invest in one of the Haut-Medoc's four famous communes: Margaux, St Julien, Pauillac or St Estephe. The chance to acquire 10 hectares (25 acres) of vineyard entitled to the appellation St Estephe seemed too good to pass up and they decided to buy Chateau Ladouys in May 1989 without even seeing inside the rather handsome 18th century building. Because the property had belonged to the head of St Estephe's relatively important co-op, where the Ladouys grapes were vinified, the property was effectively without winemaking equipment. 'There wasn't even a screwdriver - nothing]' say the Thieblots. But the co-op connection brought an unexpected bonus. The newcomers let it be known around the village that they would be happy to buy more vineyard. And since the Marquis de St Estephe co-op had so many elderly adherents willing to swap hard weekend work for a tidy little nest egg, the Thieblots were overwhelmed by vendors. They now own about 50 hectares (125 acres) of mature vineyard, dotted about the commune, which makes Chateau Lilian-Ladouys one of St Estephe's biggest properties. (Christian decided to add his wife's first name to the original name - perhaps more graceful than Chateau Ladouys-Thieblot, which would have been the result of the more usual practice.) To the villagers of St Estephe, Christian Thieblot must seem like a fairy godfather. It must be odd to live surrounded by new cars, house extensions and small businesses that you have financed personally. The unexpected success of the Ladouys' expansion plan meant that the original architect's drawings have had to be revised dramatically. In the first summer, they had just two months in which to erect a working winery, and were rewarded with the miraculously ripe and successful 1989 vintage. They now have not just one vat room but two, with more stainless steel than most crus classes and enough tasteful tiling to line every kitchen-diner in north London. In the uplit cask hall, the barrels are scrubbed and stained with perfectionism reminiscent of Mouton. In the bottle store, the visitor is urged to take note of the quality of the bottles, the thickness of the paper in which they are wrapped, the quality of the wooden cases and the diversity of bottle sizes. What started as a mild pipedream has become a major gamble. Christian Thieblot is staking FFr110m (Pounds 11.38m) and says, calmly, that he expects to start making money - 'about six per cent ROI' (return on investment) in 1994. They have already shown they can make good wine. With Sylvie Franchini as oenologist, and other local technical expertise, they have produced a 1989 and 1990 that taste as though no expense was spared in the making of them: enormously ripe, spicy monsters with the tannins needed for a long life mainly smothered by the fruit. They are certainly wines to change the minds of those who dismiss St Estephe as hard and acid in youth, and have already been written up in both American and French wine magazines. The 1989 was recently voted top of a comparative tasting of 1989 crus bourgeois by Decanter magazine. But in a market awash with competently-made claret from the two glorious 1989 and 1990 vintages, who will soak up the wine from this as yet unknown cru bourgeois? This consideration may be behind the Thieblots' avowed intent not to plunge into the general marketplace of Bordeaux merchants but to try to seek out specific importers instead. 'We want, first of all, to sell to the British and the Belgians because they are the connoisseurs,' says Thieblot. 'The French just say we are too expensive.' Do the French have a point? The Thieblots' pricing policy is, to say the least, ambitious. They decided that to avoid disenchanting one sector of the market by raising prices once they had established themselves, they would put up their price before doing so. Accordingly, the opening price of the first, 1989 vintage was FFr57 (Pounds 5.90) - the same, presumably intentionally, as the much more established cru bourgeois Chateau Sociando-Mallet (which makes it about Pounds 12 a bottle from British merchants such as Winecellars of London SW18, 081-871-2668; and Summerlee Wines of Earls Barton, 0604-810488). Aesthetics, posh tasting room, bilingual polychrome illustrated booklet, second label (Chateau Naudet), lunches at Taillevent for France's top wine writers - Christian Thieblot has got the lot. Now all he needs is his ROI.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mykola Bagrov has resumed his duties as chairman of  the Supreme Council of Crimea. However, he has returned to his  work only for a month until the plenary powers of the current  deputies corps end. The chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council  did not change his decision to abandon politics during his  vacation. He reported on this at the news conference which was  also attended by our correspondent Yury Polonsky.    [Polonsky] Mykola Bagrov looked optimistic and confident to  the journalists. Of course, the vacation did him good. He did  not spend his vacation in Cyprus, as rumored, but was with his  relatives in St. Petersburg. He visited theaters, museums, read  a lot, and thought about what had happened in his life. The  defeat in the presidential election did not change his views.  Mykola Bagrov has not rejected his election program because he  considered and considers himself to be a realist. His program  did not contain any populist ideas. He proposed the most  realistic ways for getting out of the complicated economic  situation which, to my regret, is continuing to grow worse.  Under this situation, believes the chairman of the Supreme  Council of Crimea, it is extremely important for the session to  formulate and adopt the budget of the Republic -- the session  resumes the work on 11 March. All this made him -- despite his  statement on the resignation, which, by the way, was not  approved by the deputies -- resume the work.    [Begin Bagrov recording] You know that today we can  formulate  the budget on the one-channel principle. However, speaking  sincerely, this has always been attractive to us, but currently  this will create additional difficulties. We should take this  into consideration. Look, currently, the city should receive  profits standing at 700 billion rubles [R], but it receives only  R8 billion, so, I beg your pardon, the question arises: How  should we react? This means that the problems with communal  apartments and all the other stuff will stay unsettled. This  can lead to the closure of schools, etc. [end recording]    [Polonsky] The journalists asked about the attitude of the  chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea to the new executive  authorities in the Crimea, to the first steps of President  Meshkov.    [Begin Bagrov recording] You should excuse me, but I  expected  that much more would have been done by this time. For a while,  to my regret, I cannot say this. No one will excuse us for this  stalling of reforms, therefore, the executive authorities  should properly perform their obligations. [end recording]    [Polonsky] Mykola Bagrov is not going to oppose Yuriy  Meshkov. This is not a proper time to do this. Today, said the  chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea, we should create  normal conditions for the work of the executive bodies of the  president. In the opinion of the legislative chairman, if Yuriy  Meshkov requests some additional authorities, he should be  supported. It is possible to introduce these changes into the  law on presidency. Currently, people should be guided by vital  issues, by interests of the Crimea. He said nothing specific  about his personal matters and future. I want to stress, he  briefly said, this is not the end of my life.</p>

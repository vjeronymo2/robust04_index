			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pressure points at the margins - The ability to pass on price rises is limited Complaints about rising costs putting pressure on margins and warnings about price increases to come have punctuated the current British company results season. Yesterday there was yet more evidence of inflationary pressure in the system. Dalgety, the food manufacturer, complained of very competitive margins and a sharp rise in input prices for its consumer food businesses. British Polythene said it expected raw material prices to rise 60 per cent in the three months to October. Last week BTR, the industrial conglomerate, saw its share price decline nearly 12 per cent after warning that margins would remain under pressure, largely because it was unable to pass price increases on to customers. The impact of inflation has varied from sector to sector. In printing, paper and packaging, for example, increases in raw material prices have been largely passed on. Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper company, which last week reported a 67 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, said pulp prices had risen five times this year, resulting in an increase of 45 per cent. 'The recovery in the world economy has turned the pulp market from a buyers' one to a sellers' one,' he said, adding that the company's success in passing on price rises was in part due to its strong position in the market. Bowater, the packaging and printing group, has also been successful in passing on price rises. Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director said: 'We don't like doing it, but we have no choice. We have seen a substantial upswing in our raw material costs since the start of the year.' He expected inflationary pressure to peak by the year-end then level out. Mr Soulas said the strong pressures could run on longer than that. The competitive environment has prevented companies further down the distribution chain, like food retailers, from pushing through price rises. But the powerful market position of the top five food retailers, which control almost half the UK grocery market, has enabled them to resist suppliers price rises. 'Our prices will not increase,' said Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, the UK's third largest supermarket group. 'This is both company policy and a necessity. The marketplace just will not bear it.' Mr Derek Pretty, finance director at Kwik Save, the discount supermarket operator, added: 'We do detect more desire from suppliers for price increases, but we are not able, or willing, to accept them.' For food manufacturers, like Dalgety, the result has been constant pressure on margins. Another industry in a similar predicament is housebuilding. Reporting results last week, both Wilson (Connolly) and Bellwinch complained of the sharp rise in raw materials costs set against the dull housing market. Mr Ian Black, managing director of Wilson (Connolly), said yesterday bricks and bricklayer costs had risen 18 per cent during the first half of the year, while concrete block prices had increased 20 per cent and timber prices 15 per cent. 'House price inflation will be 3 per cent by the year end if we are lucky,' he said. 'We are being squeezed from underneath in a market which cannot bear any price increase.' He blamed the recession for reducing building material manufacturing capacity and for forcing labourers abroad.</p>

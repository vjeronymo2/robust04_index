			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Trade News: UK rejects French view on timetable MR John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday rejected a French assertion that a conclusion to talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade may now be several months away. In response to reports that Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, believes any serious transatlantic dialogue in the Gatt negotiations is 'several months' away, whatever the result of next month's US presidential election, Mr Major stated that European Community countries had agreed at last week's Birmingham summit to complete the accord by the end of the year. Reminding the House of Commons that he spoke as president of the EC council, Mr Major said the differences between the EC and the US could be bridged. 'What is needed is for both sides to stay at the negotiating table and I will do all I can to bring that about.' He said his view was shared by Mr Frans Andriessen, the trade commissioner, and 'the majority of member states.' France, like other EC members, yesterday contested US suggestions that the EC-US talks on Gatt and agriculture had come to a final rupture. But, in contrast to London and Bonn, Paris regards the farm trade negotiations as effectively in abeyance until a new US administration takes office in January. By that time, however, France will be weeks away from its own legislative elections, strengthening the government's resistance to US demands on cutting EC, chiefly French, farm exports. Mr Major's counter-claims come against a background of mounting concern in the UK that any delay in a conclusion of the Gatt talks would seriously jeopardise the prospects of economic recovery.</p>

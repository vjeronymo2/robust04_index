			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / US middle class divided by skills, says Reich The middle class in the US is being divided by its levels of education and skills, according to Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary. In a pre-Labor Day speech on the state of the workforce yesterday, Mr Reich said: 'The deepest divisions (in US society) aren't based on race or on national origin or on geography. They're based on the ability of individuals to make their way in an increasingly turbulent society.' Mr Reich said that whereas in 1979 a 'middle class' male with a college degree earned 49 per cent more than one with only a high school diploma, by 1992 the college graduate was earning 83 per cent more. Unemployment patterns, too, reflect the divergence between the skilled and the unskilled. The unemployment rate for those who completed a college education has held steady over the last 15 years at around 3 per cent. The level for those who did not finish high school, however, has jumped from 7 per cent in the 1970s to 12 per cent last year. Although Mr Reich said there was much to celebrate in the news that between last Labor Day and the end of July the economy had added 2.5m new jobs, he said the middle class had splintered into three groups: an 'underclass' isolated from the core economy and walled off from hope; an 'overclass' who profitably rode the changes in the economy; and the bulk of the population, an 'anxious class. . . pulled and stretched by the need to work two or more jobs to keep a family solvent, by uneasiness about healthcare, by the spectre that today's job will disappear tomorrow. . .' Mr Reich was one of the main intellectual forces behind the Clinton administration's pledge to reward the work of 'the forgotten middle class'. The answer to the growing divisions, he says, is education. Expanding skills, particularly in technology-related fields, in-house training programmes and keeping potential high-school drop-outs in education longer all help to build a new middle class, he believes.</p>

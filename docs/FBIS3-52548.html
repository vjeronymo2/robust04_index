			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud, minister of economy and  foreign trade, has emphasized that the Egyptian economy has  between 5 to 10 years to adjust to the GATT agreement, as part  of the Uruguay round. He added: The measures we have adopted  within the economic reform program are more strict than those  stipulated under the GATT agreement.    Speaking yesterday at a meeting of the permanent committee  that is following up on the GATT talks, the minister stressed  the need to improve the quality of Egyptian products to be  competitive with similar imported products both in the local and  external markets. He added: Liberalizing trade is inevitable,  but under this liberalization we will protect our products from  illegal trade. He pointed out that the agreement made during  the Uruguay round of talks, which lasted for seven years, will  not result in any additional burdens that the Egyptian economy  cannot handle. He added that the commitments on Egypt resulting  from the liberalization of international trade are much less  than those burdening other developing nations.    The committee will complete a study on the effects of the  recent agreement on the Egyptian economy in the next few days.</p>

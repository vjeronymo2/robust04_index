			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xu Jiangshan (1776 3068 0810) and Gao Shuhua </F> (7559 3219 5479)]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- Deputy Gu Jinchi,  secretary of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee who was  attending the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress [NPC], said that launching the anticorruption drive is  an important measure for properly handling the relationships  among reform, development, and stability, that practical  measures should be taken, and that unremitting efforts should be  made for a protracted period of time to come.    Gu Jinchi said: Premier Li Peng drew applause from deputies  when he touched on successfully launching the anticorruption  drive in his government work report. It fully shows that the  anticorruption drive is an issue of common concern to the masses  of the people, and that the central authorities' decision to  improve the building of a clean and honest government has won  their resolute support. The current anticorruption drive has  produced certain results, and the situation is good. However,  we should be soberly aware that corruption among a small number  of government functionaries is still relatively serious, that  relevant policies and regulations drawn up by the central  authorities have yet to be carried out to the letter, that the  anticorruption task is still very arduous, and that we still  need to be mentally prepared for making unremitting efforts for  a protracted period of time to come.    Gu Jinchi believed that deepening reform, amplifying laws  and  regulations, and establishing an effective supervision and  restriction system to prevent and eliminate corruption through  the system are the fundamental measures for fighting corruption  and advocating a clean and honest government. In this  connection, he made three suggestions:    1. A clear distinction between the functions and powers of  party committees and governments at all levels should be made in  earnest during reform of organizations so as to define  responsibilities and establish an appropriate supervision  mechanism. Administration should be exercised in accordance  with the laws and discipline; necessary restrictions will be  imposed on the exercise of powers to eliminate the cause and  spread of such corruption as shifting responsibility onto  others, arguing back and forth, abusing power to seek personal  gain, and taking bribes among relevant units and individuals  when fulfilling their functions and exercising their powers.    2. A system that standardizes the management and use of  personnel, funds, and materials, and makes public such  management and use must be established to persist in a system of  relying on supervision by the masses, to place those who  exercise powers under public supervision, to enable people to  inform those who violate regulations and abuse power to seek  personal gains to the authorities, and to eradicate the  environment of concealment upon which corruption subsists.    3. Restrictions should be imposed on those who indulge in  the collection and spending of fees which are apt to make them  reluctant to practice plain living and wage hard struggles or  dishonest in the performance of official duties by adopting  measures indirectly linked to the income of relevant personnel;  a system for reporting the income of leading cadres for the  record will be gradually implemented. Meanwhile, appropriate  measures will be taken to stop concealed income and to plug the  loophole that gives rise to corruption.    Deputy Gu Jinchi expressed the belief that so long as we  take  the correct road, we can achieve marked successes in the  anticorruption drive and will surely be able to fulfill the  objective determined by the central authorities.</p>

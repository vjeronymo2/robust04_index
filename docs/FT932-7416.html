			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: On a Level - Theatre If your experience of theatre-going usually lies in the West End, you hardly know the half of what live theatre can be. The great marvel of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, is its audience, which is harmoniously multi-racial, largely working-class, and highly appreciative. If a show like On a Level was given somewhere in the heart of London, it might just be a success - that is, after all, what happened to Five Guys Named Moe - but it would not belong there as it does in Stratford East, where viewers whoop at its every hint and take it to their hearts. On a Level is written, directed, and performed by seven talented young black British women who call themselves the Bibi Crew. The show is a revue that, item by item, takes the life of black women from birth and childhood through to old age and widowhood. Most of the items are comic, and at first the humour veers between Victoria Wood-type satire and teenage silliness. But, during the second half, all the skits start to add up to something larger than humour - to a warm, simple, lyrical, tender, funny, unpretentious and open-hearted idea of what it is to be black in Britain today. There is no serious racial tension about the show. You see and hear the comedy of blacks trying to conform to white ideals - kids with clothes-pegs on their noses (to make them sharp and pointed), women at the hairdressers desperate for 'relaxed' hair. But you see too the lyricism of ordinary daily black life, and honour given to the black influence on Eurocentric culture. The Bibi Crew are black artists who can take pride in black British culture and yet make its many absurdities funny (especially to black viewers). You have to have an ear for the finer points of Afro-Caribbean dialect to get all the jokes in On a level, and at Stratford East the audience has such ears. But, even if such delicacies were lost on this white male middle-class ex-Home-Counties-public-school viewer, he gradually fell for the show as a whole and three performers in particular: (in rising order) Suzette Llewellyn, Beverley Michaels and Joanne Campbell. Llewellyn in one sketch plays a frustrated teenage boy with such brilliantly acute energy that, even as you guffaw, you find you are also moved. Michaels, a tall performer with an often cool, melancholy, even severe air, impersonates a wide range of roles with striking aplomb. And Campbell, a wide-eyed performer with darling charm or deadpan delivery, has variety, authority, and complete ease. She recreates the 1930s choreographer Buddy Bradley, who found that in Britain he could choreograph West End shows and receive credit for doing so. But to single out these three is to omit the show's most expansive moment - the song 'Natural Love' sung by Janet Kay with great beauty and humanity. And it is to omit the fact that most of these numbers are feats of ensemble playing. These performers are happy to work together, and happy to make their audience happy. At the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, until June 12</p>

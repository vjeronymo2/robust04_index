			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (8): Joblessness is rising rapidly in urban areas - Labour market reforms One of the thorniest nettles waiting to be grasped by China's Communist rulers is the management of the country's labour market. Reforming the labour market is a prime requirement for China's transition from a planned to market economy. Yet reform in this area is potentially a threat to the Communist party's control of Chinese society. At the heart of the party's control in urban China is the danwei system  - a cradle-to-grave set of welfare and social constraints which binds every urban worker and his family to a danwei, or 'work unit.' Implicit in this system has been the concept of a job for life as well as constant vigilance over workers' political attitudes. This is underpinned by a system of 'household registration' which requires each urban resident to carry a permit to live in the city. Chinese state enterprises are some of the country's largest work units. With officials admitting that a only a third of these state companies are profitable, the day of reckoning is dawning. The once-iron bonds which tied the worker to his workplace and city are beginning to break. China's urban work force of 180m is undergoing unprecedented upheaval, the clash between a state sector and a vibrant private sector. Added to the stresses and strains of this big structural adjustment is the relentless pressure of population growth which is forcing the government to sanction, de facto, much greater job mobility. China's urban work force grows by 10m a year as school and college leavers enter the market for work. 'We have a huge task to satisfy the employment demands of all able bodied workers in China,' says Mr Zhang Liuji, deputy minister of labour. 'Supply exceeds demand and we think this situation will last for a long time.' Joblessness is rising rapidly in urban China, giving rise to fears among Chinese leaders that unemployment if not checked may lead to social unrest and, possibly, political instability. China's official unemployment figures only hint at the problem. The urban unemployment rate last year was 2.6 per cent; this year officials expect it to rise to 3 per cent, or some 5.4m people. 'Considering there are 5m to 6m workers who have not been paid in months, the real unemployment rate would well double government figures,' observed one official newspaper recently. Worryingly, about 80 per cent of the unemployed are young people. The government expects unemployment to rise in the coming years, the sources of which are twofold. The first is the state sector where currently 15m, or nearly 20 per cent of the total state industrial work force, are estimated officially to be redundant workers still drawing pay and entitlements. The second is the countryside where officials estimate there are 130m surplus workers, 30m of which are expected to flock to the cities in search of work after the Chinese new year holiday next year. 'A whole bowl of rice has to be eaten one spoon at a time,' says Mr Zhang, rejecting any shock treatment for the state industries. He says it is the government's hope that by the end of the century state industry can be reformed sufficiently so that manning levels can be reduced to economic levels. A plan, however, to begin an 'experiment' with China's top 100 enterprises, including widespread job shedding, has been deferred for a year. To deal with rising jobless- ness the government plans to expand its provision of unemployment services: Employment exchanges. By the end of 1993 there were 15,000 employment exchanges in China. These job centres placed 8m of the 11.4m job seekers in work. By 1995 the government hopes to extend the network of job centres to China's rural areas. Employment training. There are 2,500 training centres in China which provide pre-employment for unemployed youth and women, as well as skills training for those who have to change jobs. The job training centres have a capacity for 3m; by 1995 the government wants to raise that to 4m people a year. Subsidies. It also hopes the unemployed will seize the opportunities provided by subsidies to 'employment service enterprises.' These enterprises receive tax holidays, and cheap loans to buy equipment. At the end of last year there were some 200,000 such enterprises employing 9m; by 1995 the labour ministry wants to see 240,000 enterprises employing 10m. Say Mr Zhang: 'It is more important to be employed than receive benefits.' Alongside the worsening outlook for employment, however, has been a noticeable deterioration in conditions for the employed. This is to be expected, given Chian's stage of economic development. However, industrial safety has become a big issue, especially after some high profile industrial accidents in factories owned by investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea. There have been widespread demonstrations in China's north-east over the past year, protesting at working conditions, low pay and unemployment. Nation-wide there has been a sharp rise in labour disputes this year. Figures for the first quarter showed that there had been more than 3,000 disputes referred to in 20 provinces and municipalities - some 66 per cent more than for the previous period of 1993. Officials believe there is little reason to expect that full year figures will show much of an improvement in labour relations. Labour ministry officials hope that a new labour law, which came into force in July, will help to ameliorate some of the problems in China's factories. When introducing the law earlier this year Mr Li Boyong, the labour minister, said the law would protect the legal rights of labourers and 'establish and maintain harmonious relations between employers and employees'. It is unlikely that the law will be successful in this aim. Its thrust is, after all, to promote labour market efficiency. The law makes it easier for companies to hire and fire workers; offer pay based on skills and performance rather than just seniority as was the case in the past; and negotiate the terms on which a worker is hired. Labour contracts were introduced experimentally in 1983 and were formalised in 1986. They apply to new workers and greatly increase the flexibility provided to enterprises to reject unsuitable candidates. Yet, in spite of this, the penetration of the contract system in the state enterprise sector was low - just 27.6 per cent of enterprises had adopted labour contracts by the end of June this year.</p>

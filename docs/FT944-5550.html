			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Polish stake for Commerzbank Commerzbank yesterday became the first German bank to invest directly in Poland's financial sector, when it agreed to take a 21 per cent stake in the Export Development Bank. The move comes as Dresdner Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris are establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland. Deutsche Bank, the other leading German bank, has a representative office in Warsaw. The Commerzbank deal, signed in Warsaw by Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman, represents a DM80m (Dollars 51m) investment and gives the German bank a local partner to handle its clients in Poland. Germany accounts for about one-third of Poland's foreign trade. The Export Development Bank was established in 1986 and handles 9 per cent of the country's foreign turnover. It reported a 345.1bn zlotys net profit for the first nine months of this year on a balance sheet worth 12,671bn zlotys (Dollars 531m). Net profits in the first nine months of last year reached 131.4bn zlotys. Under the agreement Commerzbank will take up 13.7 per cent of the group's equity by purchasing a forthcoming new share issue at a minimum price of 425,000 zlotys a share. The remaining equity will be purchased on the Warsaw bourse, where the bank's stock was trading yesterday at 365,000 zlotys a share. Commerzbank has said it will not be increasing its stake in the bank above the government-imposed 21 per cent ceiling. Deutsche Bank's bid to enter Poland with a wholly-owned subsidiary is being delayed by the National Bank of Poland, the central bank, which insists that newcomers buy into existing banks. The NBP made an exception for Dresdner in recognition of its role in securing Poland's recent debt reduction agreement.</p>

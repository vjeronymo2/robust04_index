			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, March 18 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  The new privatization minister, Milan Janicina, speaks about the  problem of feverish privatization [by the outgoing government of  Vladimir Meciar in its last days in office] in an interview with  today's edition of the independent SME newspaper. He claims  many projects were incomplete and their approval therefore was  against the law.    Commenting on the suspicion that Meciar destroyed certain  documents before vacating his chair as acting head of the  Privatization Ministry, Janicina says that neither Meciar nor  his state secretary Ivan Lexa gave him an agenda, and he even  had to borrow a secretary so someone could make him coffee.    Janicina intends to propose that the new government rescind  the former government's resolution on the approval of  privatization projects. He said there were no plans as yet to  replace ministry staff. What was important was the staff "are  able and have clean hands," he said.</p>

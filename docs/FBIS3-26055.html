			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory, China's  largest mining machine building enterprise, yesterday changed  its name and hung out a huge nameboard for the Heavy-Duty  Machinery Company of the China International Trust and  Investment Corporation [CITIC], thus formally merging into  CITIC. CITIC General Manager Wang Jin, and Sun Changji, vice  minister of machine building industry, attended the ceremony  together with more than 20,000 staff members and workers, and  cut the ribbon.    The Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory was one of the 156 key  projects established by the state during the First Five-Year  Plan. In the last 35 years, this large enterprise, with fixed  assets of 420 million yuan, has provided a large amount of  equipment for basic industries including the coal,  metallurgical, building materials, mining, and electric power  industries. But this factory lacks self-accumulation and  self-transformation capacity, its equipment has become seriously  obsolete and its stamina is inadequate. Therefore it is  difficult to accomplish anything big in market competition.    The general manager of the the CITIC Heavy-Duty Machinery  Company said: Introducing the shareholding system is a new way  out for large and medium-sized state enterprises. Our purpose  in selecting CITIC, which is a solid financial group, is to move  ahead faster and better in introducing the shareholding system.    As a branch company of CITIC, the Heavy-Duty Machinery  Company still maintains the status of legal person and assumes  sole responsibility for its losses and profits in its  independent operation.</p>

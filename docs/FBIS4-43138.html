			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Jos Huypens: "European Elections Were Not a </F> National Test"]    [Text] The European elections in Belgium clearly have their  own dynamic and cannot be viewed as a test of the national  political situation. The majority parties in Flanders did not  suffer big losses compared with the November 1991 national  elections. And the parties which had made national politics the  issue in these elections scored badly in comparison with 1991.    In any case it was striking that the parties which at first  used the European elections to render a verdict on the national  elections, changed tack as the evening continued and eagerly  reached for the results of the 1989 European elections.    In addition, on the national level, these elections did not  see the expected breakthrough of the blue wave of the VLD  [Flemish Liberal Democrats] nor a further massive increase for  the VB [Flemish Block].    In comparison with previous European elections, the rise of  the single issue parties was confirmed. WOW [Getting Old With  Dignity] did strikingly well and the VB climbed a few percentage  points. Thorough analysis will have to establish whether this  time WOW picked up the protest votes which went to Rossem before.    The winners in the European election campaign compared with  1989 are WOW, the VB and to a lesser degree the VLD. The  biggest losers were the CVP [Christian People's Party], SP  [Flemish Socialist Party] and Agalev [Flemish Greens]. Another  striking aspect is that the VU [People's Union] managed to hold  its position. However, the percentage changes find very little  expression in how the seats in the European Parliament are  divided.    The most striking point in these European elections is the  large degree of absenteeism in countries where voting is not  obligatory and the considerable lack of enthusiasm among voters  in countries where voting is obligatory. This is the biggest  challenge for the newly elected candidates: To translate Europe  to voters in a more comprehensible way.    One piece of good news is the massive Austrian "yes" vote  for  membership in the European Union [EU]. Perhaps the countries  which are not yet members have a better understanding of what  the extra benefits of a united Europe can be. Probably we must  return to the EU's basic principles, rather than lose ourselves  in petty discussions which have little to do with the essence of  unification.</p>

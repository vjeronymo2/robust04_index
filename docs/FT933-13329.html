			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Trios - Theatre The bonds of marriage are so heavy that it takes two to carry them - sometimes three. Edmund White's Trios at the Riverside Studios is a many-sided look at a series of eternal triangles: two men and one woman in three different situations. It has moments of trenchant drama spread across a lengthy three-hour span, and worth seeing for the quality of acting alone. (Biography is what one would normally associate with Edmund White. His biography of Jean Genet was published this month.) The first trio is a set of 1980s New York loft dwellers, an impotent artist with a libidinous actress wife and her gradschool lover. The two men bond over TV football and The Joy of Cooking. The wife's unexpected jealousies emerge. The husband concludes, 'You need the love of new people,' the 1980s version of the comfort of strangers. The second moves the action to 1920s below-stairs England, where a brutal chauffeur torments his deaf wife while the horrified young butler looks on. Eventually, the butler plans to elope with her to Australia, but as they embrace for the first time, her husband shoots them dead. The third depicts a 19th-century society hostess who takes up with a student living in the provinces. The scene in which she leaves her husband is the most acute of the evening: 'Do you like it, our marriage?' she asks, challenging him to be direct for once. He unleashes a speech about tact, instead. The three pieces are intercut, with furious costume changing on the vast Riverside stage, and musical divisions from Bach to Lieder to country and Western. The wish to fall into someone else's arms without falling into their hands is the principle of each encounter. White's writing is rarely exciting and rather too well wrought. But the juxtaposition of times works well enough on stage, and he manages to convey that those words 'I love you' are the most and least personal one can say, simply because everyone is intimate in this way. The acting of Kelly Hunter, Robert Langdon Lloyd and Charles Edwards is uniformly excellent. Each finds an edge and scope within their characters, although Hunter has more variety to work from. Simon Usher's direction moves them around the minimal set in a way that focuses attention on a particular scene, yet which suggests the possibility of other scenes across the expansive stage. The Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, London W6, (071) 748 3354, until July 31</p>

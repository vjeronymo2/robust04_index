			<p>CSO     [Excerpts]  <H8>  CONSTITUTION OF THE BOER VOLKSTAAT </H8> <H5>  PREAMBLE </H5>   WE, the descendants of the Vortrekkers and of those who  sacrificed their lives and possessions for their nation and  homeland in the First and Second Wars of Independence, and those  who then and now identify themselves to the fullest with the  Afrikaner Boer people's striving for freedom in a sovereign,  independent homeland under their own government; IN HUMBLE  GRATITUDE towards the Triune God, Disposer over the fate of  nations and the histories of people, Who assembled our  forefathers from many lands and established them here in their  own, Who has determined their paths through the generations, Who  has so providentially guided them through dangers; MINDFUL of  the right of self-determination of peoples that is a part of  prevailing international law and as such has the nature of  jus cogens and is legally binding erga  omnes, and that is recognized in the Charter of the United  Nations, and as a consequence of which it is the inalienable  right of every people to determine for itself its own existence  without the interference of others, DECLARE hereby as  representatives of the nation that: WE ARE COGNIZANT of our  responsibility to God, the people, and our nation; WE ARE  CONVINCED of the necessity for Afrikaners who are of common  political purpose and aspiration to stand together for the  purposes of: Protecting the political independence and  territorial integrity of our country against attacks from within  and without; Maintaining law and order therein; Advancing the  fortunes and welfare of all therein; and THAT WE ARE WILLING at  all times to do our duty towards our country and our  fellow-citizens and to always treat noncitizens of the country  with respect and esteem and TO COOPERATIVELY SEEK peace with all  peace-loving peoples and with our neighboring peoples and  communities in Southern Africa in particular, and to peacefully  settle disputes where that is possible. TO THAT END we desire to  carry out the mandate from God and our people to establish our  own Volkstaat [homeland] with a Constitution that will adapt and  incorporate the best of the traditions and history of our  Fatherland. TO THAT END we now present our people in their own  Fatherland with the following constitution:  <H8>  SECTION 1: CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES </H8> <H5>  ARTICLE 1: DEFINITION </H5>   The Boer Volkstaat is a free, sovereign, and independent  state based on Christian principles.  <H5>  ARTICLE 2: SOVEREIGNTY </H5>   In recognition of the Triune God who holds in His hands the  fate and destiny of nations and peoples and thus of our people  as well, all constitutional powers and authority in this  Constitution are determined by the people who exercise these  powers and authority through their democratically elected  representatives with the proviso that these representatives of  the people are to be chosen in universal, free, equal, direct,  and secret balloting in electoral districts.  <H5>  ARTICLE 3: FORM OF GOVERNMENT </H5>   The Volkstaat is a democratic, constitutional state based  upon the principles of:    3.1 The separation of governmental powers into legislative,  executive and judicial authority;    3.2 The primacy of respect for the law in general and in  particular for the rights and duties enumerated in Article 11  [not included in excerpt] and in other articles of this  Constitution as well;    3.3 There being two levels of government--to wit, the  Parliament [Volksraad] and local governments (Burgerraad);    3.4 The preservation of the principle of the free-market  system in the field of economics.  <H5>  ARTICLE 4: JURISDICTION AND TERRITORIAL APPLICABILITY </H5>   4.1 The territory of the Boer Volkstaat shall consist of  those areas agreed upon through negotiations or through other  constitutional means or means recognized by international law as  may be determined.    4.2 This Constitution applies to the Volkstaat as defined  above as well as to those areas (cantons) having voluntarily  agreed to be a part of the Boer Volkstaat.    4.3 Cooperation between the Boer Volkstaat and those areas  (cantons) having joined it in accordance with Article 4(2) above  as well as the mutual distribution of governmental powers and  competencies shall be effected through the various levels of  government and by the elected popular representatives in the  Boer Volkstaat.    4.4 Cooperation between the Boer Volkstaat and those cantons  having joined it on the one hand, and between it and other  states in Southern Africa on the other, as well as the mutual  distribution of powers and competencies as recognized by  international law among these authorities, shall be effected on  a voluntary basis within a confederative context and shall be  articulated in mutual treaties that shall be concluded for this  purpose between the constitutive states, the text of such  treaties being made a part of the legal system of the various  contracting states by legislation.    4.5 Cantons that are constitutionally associated with other  states in Southern Africa may be created for large  concentrations of noncitizens within the Boer Volkstaat through  decree of Parliament and through treaties as cited in Article  4(4).  <H5>  ARTICLE 5: TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY </H5>   5.1 The territory of the Boer Volkstaat and the territories  of its affiliated cantons are inviolable, indivisible, and  unchangeable unless the Parliament shall determine otherwise by  way of a law enacted by a majority vote and authorized by a  popular referendum held for this purpose.    5.1.1 It is the highest priority of the state to provide for  the defense of the Volkstaat and its interests as well as for  the protection of its citizens against internal and external  threat.    5.1.2 To this end, the state must provide for an effective  defense force and a police force and associated state security  services.  <H5>  ARTICLE 6: STATE SYMBOLS </H5>   6.1 Until the Parliament adopts a distinct flag, the flag of  the Boer Volkstaat shall be the present national flag of South  Africa.    6.2 Except in the case of official embassy buildings, no  national flag of a foreign state may be flown without the  national flag of the Boer Volkstaat being flown simultaneously  with it.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, May 11 (YONHAP) -- Argentine Economic  Minister Domingo Cavallo will visit South Korea early next week.    He will sign an agreement guaranteeing investments between  South Korea and Argentina as well as discuss further investment  by Korean companies in the Latin American country and loans from  Seoul.    Cavallo, who is a strong advocate of his country's new  economic policy, told YONHAP News Agency Tuesday that the  convertibility system, which has laid the foundation for  economic stability, will not be changed even after President  Carlos Saul Menem is re-elected.    Argentina's economy has been stable for the past two to  three  years and the present policy will be continued; the Argentine  Government hopes that Korean companies will hike their  investments, he said.    He pointed to the fisheries, timber, mining and energy  industries as promising areas for further Korean investment.</p>

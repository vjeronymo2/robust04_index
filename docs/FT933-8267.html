'Not enough sand' - have reached such proportions that the American Bar Association is to spend Dollars 750,000 on trying to boost the public image of lawyers. At its annual conference in New York last week, the ABA revealed the results of a survey which show public perception of US lawyers at an all-time low. Only 8 per cent of Americans now have 'great confidence' in lawyers, compared with 12.5 per cent two years ago and 24 per cent in 1973. Meanwhile the president of the California Bar Association recently proposed that jokes about lawyers should be made a hate crime.</p>

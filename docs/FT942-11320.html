			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Students spurn accountancy jobs The number of students entering chartered accountancy has slumped to the lowest level in 20 years, a report on education within the profession says. There were just 4,074 trainees with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales joining firms in 1992-93, reducing steadily from a peak of 7,063 in 1988-89. The figure was last this low in 1974. Mr Phil Armitage, director of education and training for the institute, said the decline reflected a reduction in demand for new entrants by the UK's accountancy firms, which have been cutting numbers since the start of the recession. The decline poses a considerable threat to the finances of the institute, which relies for a substantial proportion of its income on new recruits. More than 90 per cent of entrants were graduates, and 61.5 per cent joined firms with more than 100 partners. Women comprised 37 per cent of the intake and 9 per cent were non-European by ethnic origin. 'There is absolutely no shortage of people who would like to become chartered accountants,' said Mr Armitage. 'There are a good number of applications for each place.' Mr Armitage said the quality of student entrants had increased, so that 92 per cent of those taking the final PE2 exams eventually qualified for membership of the institute. He expected demand to rise in the current year by about 5 per cent.</p>

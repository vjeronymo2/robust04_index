			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives held an extraordinary  meeting this morning under the chairmanship of Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the House speaker. Discussions centered on  developments resulting from the country's political crisis, the  latest of which are the events that took place in 'Imran.    The House told its committee, which includes members of the  Defense and Security Committee, as well as a number of deputies,  to immediately begin a fact-finding mission in 'Imran and other  problem areas, and to present a comprehensive and urgent report  to the House.    The House heard a number of proposals on these developments  and assigned the House speakership and leaders of parliamentary  blocs to issue a House statement in light of proposals and ideas  that were presented at the meeting.    We will broadcast the House statement later this evening.  The House of Representatives will continue its meetings next  Monday, God willing.</p>

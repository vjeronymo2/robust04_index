			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OREGON STATE BEATS CAL; ARIZONA IS NEXT  </P> <P> When Oregon State guard Eric Knox was growing up in Inglewood, he dreamed of  playing basketball at the Forum.  </P> <P> "I have a little tree house in my back yard, and every day when I was a kid, I  used to climb up there and look at the Forum," Knox said. "I always wondered  what it would be like to play at the Forum."  </P> <P> He can stop wondering.  </P> <P> Knox played well in his Forum debut, scoring 27 points as Oregon State defeated  California, 79-66, Friday in a Pacific 10 Conference tournament game.  </P> <P> Oregon State plays No. 1-ranked Arizona in a semifinal game today at 1 p.m.  Arizona beat Washington State, 62-54, Friday to advance to the semifinals.  </P> <P> Knox doesn't fear Arizona.  </P> <P> "They're Arizona, they're not the Lakers," Knox said. "They're just a college  team and they're vulnerable also. We're not going to back down. We're going to  play hard and we'll see what happens."  </P> <P> Ralph Miller, Oregon State coach, said he didn't plan to scout the Wildcats,  who defeated the Beavers by four and 21 points earlier this season.  </P> <P> "I'm not even going to waste time sitting around to watch Arizona," Miller  said. "I know what they do."  </P> <P> Arizona is 25-3, and Oregon State is 22-6.  </P> <P> Gary Payton, Oregon State's All-Pac-10 point guard, scored 21 points and had  eight assists before fouling out. Payton scored Oregon State's first 10 points  to help the Beavers get off to a 16-2 start.  </P> <P> Knox took charge after Cal shut down Payton with a box-and-one defense in the  second half.  </P> <P> Cal, which missed its first 11 shots, got into the game with a 17-4 second-half  run to cut the deficit to 39-35 with 10:56 to play.  </P> <P> But Knox made a key four-point play, sinking a three-point shot and adding a  free throw with 10:30 remaining, and Cal never recovered.  </P> <P> Center Leonard Taylor led Cal (19-12) with 16 points; forward Roy Fisher added  13, and guard Bill Elleby had 12.  </P> <P> "We hope to be playing basketball somewhere next week," Cal Coach Lou  Campanelli said. "We won 19 games this year and that's a lot to feel good  about. We'll just wait and see what happens."  </P></p>

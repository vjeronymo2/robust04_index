			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. DEMANDS GASOLINE PRODUCTION RECORDS  </P> <P> The Justice Department said today it has subpoenaed records of major oil  companies, refiners and marketers as part of its investigation of gasoline  price hikes since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> The issuance of civil investigative demands for detailed records on gasoline  production indicated that the department had stepped up its investigation of  the price hikes.  </P> <P> James F. Rill, head of the department's antitrust division, said that the  subpoenas will enable investigators to analyze the accuracy of explanations  given by gasoline producers and marketers for the price hikes.  </P> <P> The antitrust investigation began Aug. 6 following the steep rise in gasoline  prices. Oil company officials were interviewed by Justice Department  investigators about the price hikes.  </P> <P> The preliminary phase of the investigation "developed substantial information  about the nature of crude oil and gasoline markets and how they behaved in the  wake of the Aug. 2 invasion," Rill said in a statement. "It also provided us  with an opportunity to have the parties explain the factors that caused them to  raise gasoline prices."  </P> <P> "We aggressively will pursue this investigation until we determine whether or  not violations of antitrust law contributed to the rise in gasoline prices,"  Rill said.  </P> <P> The average pump price of gasoline has risen 27.1 cents a gallon since the  invasion, according to a survey issued this week by the American Automobile  Assn.  </P></p>

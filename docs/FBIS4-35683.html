			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 30 May (INA)--National Assembly Speaker  Sa'di Mahdi Salih has called for healing the rift among the Arab  nation's ranks through a positive and unified Arab position  based on cooperation and developing the mutual fraternal  interests of all sides.    During a National Assembly session here today, he expressed  Iraq's readiness to develop this position to put the Arab house  in order in the interest of the Arab and Islamic nations.    The National Assembly speaker reviewed the situation in the  Arab and international arenas, as well as developments in light  of the U.S. statements on the continuation of the embargo and  the postponement of lifting it in violation of the desire of the  international community, particularly the UN Security Council  itself.    He said that the increasing world calls for lifting the  embargo indicate all countries' desire to restore relations with  Iraq to their previous level and to establish economic and trade  relations in a way that will achieve their interests in this  important region of the world.    Sa'di Mahdi Salih praised the international efforts to this  effect, and said that the calls by France, Russia, China,  Brazil, Spain, Pakistan, Nigeria, and other states constitute a  positive stand toward the Iraqi people. He expressed the hope  that these efforts will bear fruit in the interest of our people  and nation.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (1): Doubts and confusion - Japan is gripped by serious doubts over its economy and confused and uncertain about its role in the world. But even in bad times the Japanese economy still continues to out-perform those of the US and Europe MR KIICHI MIYAZAWA, Japan's prime minister, played his part well at last week's Munich summit of the Group of Seven industrialised countries. With his quick mind and fluent command of English, he did his country proud. But behind Mr Miyazawa's polished performance is a country gripped by serious doubts over its economy, and confused and uncertain about its role in the world. These concerns are coming to the fore in the campaigns now under way for national elections to be held on July 26 for seats in the Diet's upper house. Many Japanese fear that the recent collapse of land and stock prices could herald a long slowdown for the whole economy. The worldwide economic downturn has come late to Japan but in the past year it has arrived with a vengeance. Economic growth, which remained at a healthy 3.5 per cent in the year to March 1992, could fall to below 3 per cent in the current financial year ending in March 1993. The effects of this slowdown are rippling around the world. Economic growth has declined, but so, too, has the growth which was previously taking place in imports. As a result Japan's trade surplus has surged from Dollars 52bn in 1990 to a likely Dollars 100bn plus in 1992. Meanwhile, the turmoil in Tokyo's financial market has undercut Japanese investors' capacity to invest overseas - after exporting record amounts of capital in the 1980s, Japan last year became a net capital importer. The government is considering economy-boosting measures, including extra public spending of about Y6,000bn. But there are doubts in Tokyo about whether this will prove sufficient. There are fears that - as well as a severe short-term cyclical down-swing in demand - the economy faces unsettling long-term structural changes. As Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a leading member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and possible future prime minister, said recently: 'I see the Japanese economy facing quite a serious structural recession. In many ways we have enjoyed very good economic conditions in the past. But it is impossible to continue behaving in the same way in the future.' The mood in Tokyo is so grim that Japan's strengths are being forgotten. The truth is that in bad times as in good, the Japanese economy continues to out-perform the US and Europe. Companies in key industries, including steel, machine tools, motors and electronics, are under pressure. But their foreign competitors are also suffering. Even in a slowdown, Japanese companies are loath to cut research and development spending or capital investment. They do not sack their employees, except as a last resort. While demand for recruits has eased in the past year, vacancies still outnumber job-seekers by about 20 per cent. Nevertheless, companies face some difficult challenges. They must adjust to the fact that the high-speed growth of the 1980s was, in retrospect, something of an aberration. The outlook is for slow growth, in which costs will be restrained and expansion plans considered for their contribution to profits as well as to sales. Capital costs have soared due to the difficulty of raising stock market funds. Banks, burdened by bad debts, will find it harder to lend than in the past, thus creating a potential shortage of credit. On the demand side, companies cannot look to exports for salvation because of rising protectionist sentiment in the main export markets of the US and Europe. At home, Japanese consumers could eventually generate a huge surge in demand - if they were allowed to spend as freely as westerners. Unfortunately, the job of liberalising Japan's tightly-regulated post-Second World War economy is not yet finished. The rules still favour producers at the expense of consumers. For example, food prices are kept artificially high to protect farmers. As a result, Japanese must spend more than 30 per cent of their disposable income on food compared with about 20 per cent for Americans and Germans. So the Japanese have less available for other goods and services. Mr Miyazawa's government recently published a five-year plan which puts a priority on improving the consumers' lot. There is no doubt about the sincerity of Mr Miyazawa's intentions. But his scope for action is limited by his lack of political clout inside the ruling Liberal Democratic party. Also, the authority of the party itself has been undermined by financial scandals and by a constant need to do deals with opposition parties to secure the passage of legislation. After nearly 40 years in office, the Liberal Democratic party's ageing leaders see little need to take risks. They are not willing to ride rough-shod over the interests of their supporters who are often, like farmers, prime beneficiaries of the economic status quo. As Mr Ozawa said in a recent press conference: 'Japanese people. . . have not really got out of their old ways of living and thinking. Change will require a great deal of effort.' The LDP has good reason to be cautious. It has presided over nearly 40 years of prosperity. Japanese people in opinion polls express complaints about their living standards, especially about housing costs, but are generally satisfied with the country's economic management. Nevertheless, if the current slowdown were to turn into a prolonged full-blown recession, accompanied by bankruptcies, sackings and a decline in real income, the pressure for action might become intense. If Japanese are more concerned about their economy than at any time since the oil shocks of the 1970s, they are also more worried than in the past about their country's political role in the world. Japan has responded to international demands for it to play a more active part in global affairs by passing a bill which will allow Japanese troops to serve on United Nations peace-keeping missions. Tokyo was stung into action by criticism of its role in the Gulf crisis when it contributed money to the allied cause but no manpower. However, the peace-keeping bill has left Japan divided between those who believe an economic superpower should share the burden of policing the world and those who fear such involvement could lead to a revival of Japanese militarism. The government, despite its internationalist intentions, will be obliged to tread carefully for fear of inflaming domestic opposition. Meanwhile, the end of the Cold War could lead to changes in east Asian international relations. The cornerstone of Japan's policies remains close friendship with the US, including a security alliance. Both partners remain committed to each other and indeed are held together by a common interest in, among other things, the stability of the region. But this interest differs in subtle ways. For example, Japan has been noticeably more friendly than the US towards China since the suppression of demonstrations in Beijing in 1989. Tokyo is considering an invitation from Beijing for Emperor Akihito to visit China this autumn. Japan's policies are also coloured by its dispute with Russia over territories seized by Soviet troops in 1945. Japan insists that it cannot extend large-scale financial support to the states of the former Soviet Union until its claims are recognised. While Tokyo has fudged this condition in recent years - by granting increasingly large quantities of humanitarian aid - it remains reluctant to participate in the grand plans for economic assistance being formulated in the US and Europe. But Japan's willingness to become more independent of the US in its foreign policies is strictly limited. As the debate over the peace-keeping bill showed, Tokyo's priority is to grow in its role as a fully-fledged member of the international community. And that community, for the foreseeable future, is US-led.</p>

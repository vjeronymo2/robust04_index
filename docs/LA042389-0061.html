			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL: 'GET IT DONE'  </P> <P> Sixteen people killed in Soviet Georgia. Tanks and armed soldiers deployed to  suppress people demonstrating for freedom and independence. Stiff prison  sentences and heavy fines imposed upon anyone publishing or circulating  literature which criticizes the government. Confiscation of previously  registered firearms.  </P> <P> And so much for glasnost.  </P> <P> Americans would do well to learn from the example set by the Soviets that  freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and other civil liberties are more  easily destroyed after firearms are registered and banned from individual  ownership. The Second Amendment to the Constitution protects and guarantees the  longevity of the others. Some of our governing officials are aware of this  fact. How they choose to act upon this knowledge will one way or another affect  all of our lives in the future.  </P> <P> Anyone who cherishes a particular constitutional right should think about this;  if the Second Amendment goes, sooner or later all of them will go.  </P> <P> DAVE CULVER  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLOMBIAN MAN TO FACE CHARGES IN COCAINE SEIZURE  </P> <P> A Colombian national is scheduled to be arraigned today in connection with the  seizure in Newhall of more than 100 pounds of cocaine estimated by authorities  to be worth $15 million.  </P> <P> Julian Alberto Zuluaga, 29, of Burbank is expected to answer charges in Los  Angeles Municipal Court of possession and transportation of cocaine for sale  stemming from the arrest Monday night. Investigators have described it as one  of the largest cocaine seizures in the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> Zuluaga was arrested after undercover investigators from the West Covina Police  Department watched him load three large bags into his car in the 24300 block of  San Fernando Road in Newhall about 9:30 p.m., Detective Marc Taylor said. The  bags were found to contain cocaine, Taylor said.  </P> <P> Taylor said police officers had followed Zuluaga to Newhall from a house in  Buena Park, which had been staked out as part of an investigation into drug  trafficking in West Covina. Taylor refused to say what led detectives to the  house.  </P> <P> Zuluaga, described as a middleman in a larger drug operation, apparently  stashed the cocaine at a Newhall business where he worked, Taylor said. He  would not describe the nature of the business, saying police do not suspect it  is involved in the drug operation.  </P> <P> Officers arrested Zuluaga without incident, capping several months of  investigation by West Covina police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation,  Taylor said. Zuluaga is being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of  $5-million bail.  </P> <P> Taylor said he did not expect any additional arrests to be made in the near  future because news of the seizure undoubtedly would cause others in the  operation to scatter.  </P> <P> Narcotics investigators with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said  Monday's seizure could be the second-largest in the Santa Clarita Valley. A  joint operation between the Sheriff's Department and the FBI netted 682 pounds  of cocaine in 1988.  </P></p>

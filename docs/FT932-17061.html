			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Economy the loser from N Sea tax change Sir, Your leader, ''Spoils of the North Sea' (March 29), gives welcome prominence to the chancellor's proposed changes to the North Sea tax regime. We would agree that the most important issue is to ensure that maximum economic benefit is extracted from the North Sea. However, certain points are in danger of becoming 'truths'. First, much has been made of the refund of Pounds 200m of Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) that the government made in 1991-92. This arose from treatment of insurance in connection with a one-off anomaly - the Piper Alpha tragedy. Second, there is no evidence that in North Sea exploration, diminishing returns have set in. Contrary to the falling success rates quoted in your article, the government's own Brown Book statistics show a fairly constant success rate since the early 1970s, albeit as discoveries have become smaller. Finally, the polarisation of companies into winners and losers is not really accurate. Almost any company can become a 'winner' by cutting UK exploration. Turning now to the main issue. The loser will be the UK economy as a whole. The immediate effect will be felt by those companies supplying services to the UK industry whose business will be hard hit as oil companies reduce exploration budgets. It is unrealistic to expect them to find export markets to fill the gap when their domestic business is destroyed at a stroke. The proposed measure will, in the short term, result in job losses among geological and geophysical staff, drilling contractors and others such as helicopter pilots and the crews of support vessels. This is already happening and many jobs will be lost as a result. In the longer term, engineering, fabrication and supplies jobs will suffer. The number of jobs at stake here could run into tens of thousands. There will also be wider consequences in the longer term as drilling fewer wells will inevitably result in less oil being found. The chancellor's proposals quadruple the cost of exploration for oil companies in the UK. This is true even for those companies which have been identified as 'winners' by analysts. We estimate that this could lead to at least 50 per cent fewer wells being drilled over the next five years. At recent average rates of success there will be about 2bn fewer barrels discovered, Pounds 2bn-Pounds 4bn less tax revenues and an adverse effect on the balance of payments of some Pounds 20bn. This is a terrible squandering of a vital national energy resource. The broad thrust of the chancellor's proposals is not in the nation's or the industry's best interests. It is too early to reduce the North Sea to the status of a 'cash cow' for a few investors whose main attentions are turned overseas. The future of the North Sea is characterised by smaller fields which will not now be found or developed. The government must decide whether it wants to see a viable and active oil province. If it does, it should reconsider these changes.

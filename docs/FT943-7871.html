			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook directors' pay rises The directors of Tiphook, the transport leasing company, fared better than their employer last year, with total remuneration climbing from Pounds 3.96m to Pounds 6.41m in the year that Tiphook lost Pounds 331m. The annual report, released yesterday, reveals that Mr Robert Montague, the founder and chief executive, was the highest paid of the directors, with a bonus of Pounds 250,000 helping push his total pay from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 1.34m. Mr Montague, who recently stepped down as chairman, has agreed to a substantial cut in pay from an Pounds 816,000 package down to Pounds 200,000 as of March, but will receive a total minimum bonus of Pounds 250,000 over the next five years. Mr Montague also agreed, as part of Tiphook's sale of its container leasing business to TransAmerica, that he would not compete with their container operations for five years. The latest bonus was agreed in order to recompense him for this agreement.</p>

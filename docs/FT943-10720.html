			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: CLT to let Chiltern bid lapse CLT, the European broadcaster, has decided to let its recommended cash offer for Chiltern Radio lapse. CLT blamed the consolidation of Chiltern's shareholder base. More than 50 per cent is now held by Daily Mail and General Trust and its associate, European Media Associates, GWR and Capital Radio. The Takeover Panel recently dismissed an appeal by Chiltern that DMGT, GWR and Capital were acting in concert to obtain control. Mr Peter Burton, chairman of Chiltern, said: 'The board is very concerned that, as a result of the panel's decision, (DMGT, GWR and Capital) will continue to hold the majority of shares in Chiltern Radio without the minority shareholders being offered the 300p per share which DMGT and GWR were prepared to pay to secure their stakes.'</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / French ports in a storm over reform of dock labour scheme FRENCH dockers are to step up their seven-month campaign of strikes against plans, presented to parliament yesterday, to scrap their 45-year-old protected status. The reform of the dock labour scheme is a long-delayed attempt to restore the competitiveness of French ports against cheaper and more efficient competitors in Belgium and the Netherlands. The reform would transform dockers into normal salaried workers and give freight handling companies the right to decide how many employees they need. The number of jobs in the docks and their distribution between ports would no longer be decided centrally, except for temporary workers. Dockers out of work would receive ordinary unemployment benefits, rather than be paid through a central organisation. France is one of the last European countries to attempt to modernise labour practices in its ports and accordingly has lost billions of francs of port traffic to Antwerp and Rotterdam, easily reached by rail, motorway or canal. The problem has been worrying the government for years, but has been too sensitive to tackle until now because the docks are one of the last strongholds of the well organised and aggressive communist-led trade union, the CGT. The 1947 ports labour law gives the CGT a near-monopoly on jobs in the docks and the system of a central ports labour office has made it hard to dismiss surplus workers. However, political sympathy for the CGT has declined along with support for the communist party. There is a growing consensus between the main parties, and especially among industrial companies, that France can no longer afford the old restrictive practices. Over the past decade, the share of French exports to pass through its sea ports has fallen from 75 per cent to 59 per cent, while their share of imports has fallen from 35 per cent to 33 per cent. Over the seven years to 1990, the share of French sea-born exports to go through foreign ports has nearly doubled from 15 per cent to 29 per cent. This has cost France heavily. The government estimates that FFr210bn (Pounds 21.2bn) of French exports and imports went through non-French ports last year, while the dockers' strikes cost freight handlers around FFr1bn in lost charges. It is surprising the damage has not been greater, given that that French ports are so overmanned that dockside handling charges - by far shippers' biggest single port cost - are between 30 per cent and 50 per cent above the European norm. The reform is now being pushed hard by the maritime affairs minister, Mr Charles Josselin, who aims to get them passed by parliament next month. The CGT reckons about half the 8,300 dockers will lose their jobs if Mr Josselin gets his reforms. It is unimpressed by government offers of early retirement and redundancy payments, plus retraining. In response, the union has called 31 short strikes since October, the most recent a week-long stoppage, starting last Monday, timed for the parliamentary debate. Yesterday, the CGT also held demonstrations in Paris and the main ports. Freight handling companies warn that more French shippers will be tempted to cheaper and more reliable ports in Belgium and Holland for good if the strikes get much worse. But neither the government nor the CGT are in a mood to give in.</p>

However, the Exchange's Committee on Floor Procedure has approved the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Exchange, <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  on October 20, 1992, the Exchange received a comment letter from an Exchange specialist in opposition to the proposed rule change. The commentator opposes the rule change for several reasons. Specifically, the commentator states that the proposed rule does not provide for the protection of customer orders; that the proposed rule is not necessary because there is not a problem now except for a few specialists; that the proposed rule will be subject to abuse because of the inability to determine whether or not the crosses are really agency crosses on an immediate basis; that the Exchange should be encouraging more orders and less crosses; and that, as a result of the new rule, specialists will not be able to participate, among other things. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the commentator's concerns are misplaced. First, the proposed rule change will not interfere with public orders in the book. Customer orders will continue to be protected under the proposed rule, even if, through oversight, they are not displaced. The specialist must fill a customer order at the limited price even if an agency cross takes place at the limit price. This should also encourage specialists to be more efficient in displaying customer orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the proposal will encourage more institutional trades to be sent to the floor; whether this will result in more revenue to the Exchange is a secondary consideration. The proposal will provide a more attractive marketplace for institutional orders without sacrificing traditional agency/auction principles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the potential that some firms may abuse the rule by not having an agency order on both sides of the trade is not an argument for not having the rule. There are literally dozens of rules in place today which inherently cannot be surveilled on an immediate basis to monitor compliance. If the Exchange finds that firms are abusing the rule, it will take appropriate action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, the proposed rule does not reduce the possibility of order interaction on the floor. The specialist is the only one who cannot participate in a cross if he is not displaying his market at the cross price; this should encourage specialists to quote their true markets. The requirement for a firm with agency orders to cross to bid or offer at the post still remains and any other interest in the crowd can participate. It is only the specialist who cannot, unless he is quoting at the cross price or unless he has been previously solicited for his help. This is not a major departure from agency auction principles and should encourage more orders to the Exchange floor to participate in the auction process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Colombian Foreign  Minister Nohemi Sanin Posada, in a meeting with Czech Parliament  Chairman Milan Uhde today, pointed to the as yet not-utilized  possibilities for Czech-Colombian political, economic and  cultural cooperation.    She described the current level of Czech-Colombian trade as  a  symbolic one, adding that the Czech and Colombian economies were  fully compatible and were not competing each other in any  branch. She said that the Czech Republic was capable of standing  up to competition in Latin American area too.    "We have lost many opportunities and this should be  stopped,"  she said, referring to Czech-Colombian political, economic and  cultural cooperation.    Uhde said that the Czech Republic was capable of offering,  under advantageous conditions, different kinds of technology to  Columbia. He mentioned metro construction project in the  Colombian town of Medelin, Posada's native town, adding that  such an opportunity should be made use of.    Uhde described the Czech Republic as a reliable partner  pointing to the political stability and its favorable economic  development. He said that agreements on investment protection  and on the prevention of double taxation and tax evasion would  contribute to Czech-Colombian cooperation.</p>

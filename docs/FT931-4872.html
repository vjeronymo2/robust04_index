			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West hit by fall in house prices BRISTOL &amp; West Building Society yesterday announced a 42 per cent fall to Pounds 39.1m in pre-tax profits after it was forced to triple provisions for possible bad debts on mortgage lending to Pounds 74.1m, writes John Gapper. The society, the 10th largest by asset size, was affected by the fall in house prices in the south. The bad debt charge, which rose from Pounds 24.5m in 1991, cut profits despite a 23 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 113.2m (Pounds 91.9m). Mr Tony FitzSimons, chief executive, said provisions had risen because the value of many properties on which the society lent has fallen below the level at which repossession losses were absorbed by mortgage indemnity insurance. Mr FitzSimons said the society anticipated a reduction in its provisions for this year unless there was 'a significant deterioration' in house prices. It also expected to raise profits in 1993 barring a worsening of the recession. The society confirmed it was planning to sell about two thirds of the 160 branches in estate agent chains Hamptons and Bristol &amp; West Property Services. More will be invested in remaining branches to boost profitability. Pre-tax profits in the second half were Pounds 26m, double those in the first. Mr FitzSimons said they had been 'even stronger than anticipated' when the society announced half year figures. He said the society's policy of seeking arrangements with borrowers rather than repossessing had led to a rise in arrears of over 12 months.</p>

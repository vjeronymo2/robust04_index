			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "G.Pa.": "Creation of a Sixth Parliamentary </F> Group `Suspended'"]    [Text] According to the JOURNAL OFFICIEL for 15 June, the  National Assembly now has a sixth group, the Republicans and  Independents, formed by 27 deputies who have resigned from the  UDF [French Democratic Union] group. And yet, no offense to the  venerable JOURNAL OFFICIEL, this group does not exist. At least  not yet. It did make an appearance and even had a president  (Jose Rossi, deputy for Corse-du-Sud) on Tuesday 14 June, but  only between late morning and the middle of the afternoon....    It was the reading of a letter by Charles Millon, president  of the UDF caucus in the Assembly, on 13 June which revived the  tension which appeared after the surprise appointment of  Dominique Baudis (Social Democratic Center) as head of the  majority list for the European elections, when Jean-Francois  Deniau (Republican Party [PR]) was the favorite. At the time, a  minority of PR deputies had demanded the creation of an  autonomous group to safeguard the identity of their party, which  they think is too easily manipulated by UDF President Valery  Giscard d'Estaing. PR President Gerard Longuet had restored  calm by postponing this problem until after the European  elections.    A meeting of the PR Executive Committee on 8 June decided to  postpone this initiative indefinitely, although it has been  welcomed by the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], which  is annoyed by Mr. Millon's criticism and his statements on the  need for a UDF candidate in the presidential election. Indeed,  Mr. Longuet wanted to keep the choice of an autonomous group as  a means of retaliation against Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, in case of  departures from the rule of a single candidate for the Elysee  [office of the president], which the PR wants to defend.    The PR president wanted to reexamine this hypothesis at a  meeting with the deputies scheduled for Tuesday 14 June, in the  afternoon, which was to be the occasion of a solemn appeal for a  single candidate for the presidential election. Those  supporting the secessionist line preferred to present Mr.  Longuet with a fait accompli, thereby speeding things up and  thus crossing their own Rubicon. It was therefore from a French  Press Agency dispatch that the PR president, on a visit to  Lorraine, learned of the creation of the Republicans and  Independents group.  <H5>  Decision on 26 June </H5>   Faced with the chaos and confusion caused by the decision  made by Jose Rossi and his 26 acolytes, frowned on by the Hotel  Matignon, Mr. Longuet had to urgently organize a crisis meeting  at the National Assembly, during which he sharply attacked Mr.  Millon and Gilles de Robien, who had also spoken out in favor of  a UDF candidate in the presidential election, and, more  moderately, the secessionist deputies.    After more than two hours of exchanges, Mr. Longuet was able  to secure the "suspension" of Mr. Rossi's initiative, proposing  a meeting on 26 June of the PR National Council in order to  define the party's position within the UDF and in relation to  the government and the usefulness of the autonomous group. The  PR members will be asked to give their verdict on Mr. Longuet's  mandate and on the group's choice, unless this latter decision  is reserved for the deputies.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Business Travel: US warns against Russian flights The US has warned the public not to travel on successors to the Soviet-era airline Aeroflot. The government had earlier warned its own officials against travelling on Russian airlines. David Johnson, a spokesman for the State Department, said no specific incidents prompted the warning. The department last Monday made public a notice that the US Embassy in Moscow had issued to US government officials operating in Russia. It noted that 'travel within Russia is often unreliable', adding 'domestic air travellers must often cope with unpredictable schedules and difficult conditions, including overloading'. The statement said 'government officials working in Russia are instructed to defer routine air travel'. It warned that until the US Federal Aviation Administration has completed its evaluation of the Russian civil aviation system 'only official air travel deemed important and absolutely necessary to the US government should be undertaken on Russian air carriers'. 'Private Americans may wish to consider this information when making travel plans,' the State Department said. But Johnson stressed air travel on Russian lines by US citizens is not forbidden.</p>

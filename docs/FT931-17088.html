			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: French insurers top active list for cross-border deals FRENCH insurers have been the most active in European cross-border expansion while Italy has been the country most frequently targeted, according to a survey by Tillinghast, the management consultants and actuaries. The survey lists 201 cross-border initiatives between 1987 and 1991, of which French companies were responsible for 54. The favoured targets of the initiating companies were the developing markets of Italy (48) and Spain (25), while 29 of the new initiatives favoured France. British companies were responsible for 45 initiatives, although only 14 have taken place in 1990 and 1991, and several of the earlier initiatives, such as those taken by Guardian Royal Exchange in Italy in 1989, have already unwound. Swiss companies took 31 initiatives, Italian companies 17 and German companies 15. The technique most favoured in cross-border initiatives was acquisition  - either outright or by building up a stake. Genuine co-operative agreements such as the merger between Amev of the Netherlands and Groupe AG of Belgium, were rare.</p>

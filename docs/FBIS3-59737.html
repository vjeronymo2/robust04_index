			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]Hitachi Ltd. has developed the industry's first  next-generation ultrathin standard DRAM modules for 64-bit  busses. Although DRAM modules for 32-bit busses are currently on  the market, the new modules can be easily used with 64-bit  busses, and are ultrathin at 3.8mm. Two types of modules have  been developed with different capacities--one is an 8-kilobyte  product and the other is a 32-kilobyte product. Samples are  scheduled to begin shipping in December, 1993. The samples are  priced at &yen;60,000 and &yen;345,000 respectively. Mass  production will start in January, 1994, at 1000 units per month  (for both types combined), and will be increased to 5,000 units  per month in June later in the year.    The modules developed by Hitachi can be used with both  32-bit  and 64-bit busses, which provides greater ease of use. The model  substrate is mounted on a printed wire board (1.27mm thick)  which has low thermal expansion. Nine DRAMs sealed in TSOP  ultrathin packages can be mounted on each side of the board.    The 8-megabyte product can accommodate 4M DRAMs, and the  32-megabyte product can accommodate 16M DRAMs.    In the past, DRAM modules contained chips sealed in SOJ  packages. However, in the new module, TSOP packages are used to  achieve an ultrathin dimension of 4.0mm thick.    There are 168 power source pins in the new module. This is  five times greater than in former modules made by Hitachi.  Depending on the version use, read time is 60, 70, or 80  nanoseconds. The module is 133.35mm long, and 25.4mm wide.    Hitachi is currently commercializing 32-pin and 72-pin DRAM  modules. Compared to the 72-pin module, the new module has one  third the volume, and is 60&percnt; thinner. The new modules are  expected to be widely used in work stations, where fast  operation and large capacity is required.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 20 (XINHUA) -- The State Council,  China's Central Government, is to publish this year a set of  regulations that will allow foreign investment in China's mining  sector, XINHUA learned from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral  resources today.    The regulations, expected to become effective on  publication,  will encourage foreign companies and individuals to invest in  prospecting and mining China's mineral resources independently  or through joint venture or cooperative projects, a ranking  official said.    The official said that the regulations "explicitly state the  rights and responsibilities of foreign investors as well as the  preferential treatment they are to receive for their investment."    In drafting the regulations, he added, officials and experts  at the ministry have also seen to it that they will be easy to  apply.    Over the years, many foreign companies have sent people to  China to probe the possibility of investing in China's mining  sector. But, said the official, "for lack of legislation, the  sector has been behind other sectors in opening to the outside  world."    He noted that the "Law on Mineral Resources of the People's  Republic of China," effective since 1986, contains no clause on  foreign investment in the country's mining sector.    The law has played a big role in promoting the development  of  the sector. But "it was formulated under the planned economy  and some of its clauses are obviously obsolete and therefore  need to be revised," the official said.    The National People's Congress has included revisions of  these clauses in the "mineral resources law" into its plans for  legislation, the official disclosed.    The State Council, for its part, has approved a set of  regulations on the collection of mineral resources compensation  fees, which will be published soon.    The fees, explained the official, embody the rights of the  nation to the ownership of the mineral resources and are meant  to prevent undue mining. They will be used to cover part of the  prospecting costs.    Until now, mineral resources have been extracted free of  charge. "We have to do away with this legacy of the planned  economy, which often causes waste," he said.    China depends on minerals for 95 percent of the energy and  80  percent of the industrial raw materials it needs. But its  mineral resources are limited in relation to its vast  population, the official pointed out.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- As of 24 July, there  will be no budget deficit thanks to the speed at which our  taxation system is recovering. Such hopes are not groundless  given the stable position of the dinar and stagnant prices,  Dragoslav Avramovic, the governor of the National Bank of  Yugoslavia, said today at the "TANJUG's Guest" panel.    Hard currency reserves have gone up by about 450 million  German marks in the past 100-odd days. One third of this amount  has been earmarked for the importation of necessities and what  is missing on the market. These goods, Avramovic says, will  arrive soon, thus changing the ratio of supply and demand.    "Instead of reducing the hard currency reserves we have  registered their increase, something that confirms our belief  that the best way has been chosen in these difficult  circumstances. In spite of the severe embargo we are  outmaneuvering the unprecedented and unjust sanctions by relying  on our creativity.    ``There is no reason whatever to devalue the dinar.  Production is on the rise while every issued dinar is covered  by hard currency or goods. [passage omitted] Despite  predictions, when sanctions are lifted, Avramovic believes, our  position will not be untenable because we will have a great deal  to offer to the world market -- textiles, footwear, meat, and  all the other goods that proved successful abroad in the past.    ``We have done everything possible in today's circumstances  to facilitate the country's speedy recovery. We started with a  200 million U.S. dollar hard currency reserve with the provision  that the National Bank of Yugoslavia could borrow 300 million  U.S. dollars. This, in addition to the measures of fiscal  policy and eliminating the budget deficit, will be yet another  impetus for reviving production, public works, and suchlike."  [passage omitted]    The initial successes in curbing the rate of inflation and  our economic difficulties have already impressed the world, the  blockade has practically been breached. These days it is  evident that foreign reporters are constantly interested in our  present and future moves, Avramovic said.    Of course, not all our problems have been solved. The key  remains -- a strong dinar based on the recovery of the economy.  Some things, such as development plans and others, disappeared  from our practices in the past. Some of these institutions,  Avramovic maintains, should be reintroduced and we should  proceed along the conventional path. We should not fear credits  geared to the reviving of production, particularly so if their  price is realistic. This in itself obliterates the fear of  increased production being stranded in an allegedly small market.    The National Bank governor categorically says that a large  number of products would find their niche in the market, even in  today's circumstances, and even more so if national income goes  up by 100 percent in a certain period of time. ``For example,  of the 1.5 million cars on our roads at least half of them  should be replaced because of their age. This is enough to keep  Zastava [automobile producer] busy for another 10 years."  [passage omitted]</p>

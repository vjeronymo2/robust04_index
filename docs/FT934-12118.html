			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Five Tories defy whip in coal vote FIVE Conservative MPs voted against the government and three abstained last night after a vitriolic Labour attack on the government's plans for the coal industry. The debate, initiated by the opposition, was prompted by British Coal's announcement that it expects to shut a dozen pits thought to have been saved by a coal review earlier this year. The rebellion was bigger than the revolt which followed the publication of the government's pit closure plans last year, when four Conservative MPs voted with Labour and three abstained. However, there was little of the tension which surrounded the earlier vote, when the future of senior ministers, and possibly the government, seemed to be at risk. The rebels - Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, Mrs Ann Winterton, Mr Bill Cash, Mr Winston Churchill and Mr Richard Alexander - were all long-standing critics of the government's energy policy. The government won a division on the Labour motion by 317 votes to 283, a majority of 34. Mr Patrick Cormack, Mr Stephen Day and Mr David Nicholson abstained. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, strongly defended the government's plans to privatise the coal industry, which he said was the only way to secure the future of the remaining mines. But Mr Robin Cook, shadow industry secretary, said ministers had fraudulently suggested in the white paper that they would reprieve 12 pits that had been marked for closure. 'The white paper has not saved a single miner's job, and it was not intended to,' he said. Addressing himself to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Cook said: 'The only job it was intended to save was yours and that of your junior minister for energy (Mr Tim Eggar).' Mr Cook claimed that the market for coal had been rigged by 'sweetheart contracts' between electricity companies and gas-fired stations, 'many of which they own themselves'. He said: 'That is not a market in competition. That is a cartel which is closing down the doors on Britain's pits.' Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, gave no firm indication of how many pits would close. But he said the government would accept the recommendations of the Health and Safety Commission on safety in the coal industry. Mr Eggar said that every pit was entering a modified colliery review procedure, which was the standard way of examining whether a pit would continue to operate. Before the debate more than 300 miners and their families lobbied parliament. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the NUM mineworkers' union, said the aim of the action was to maintain public pressure. But he warned: 'Tory rebels voting for a common-sense policy are as rare as snowflakes in the middle of July.' Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, last night said that uneconomic pits should be closed steadily - but with mining communities given good warning and with favourable redundancy terms available. Interviewed on ITV, Lady Thatcher said she had two main points - she wanted to protect miners who crossed the picket lines in the 1984-85 miners' strike and were 'so loyal' to Britain. And to do this meant keeping the colliery review procedure. 'That is what the miners rely on, and so you close the uneconomic pits steadily and with good warning, and you give them good redundancy.'</p>

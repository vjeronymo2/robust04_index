			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 06, BNS -- The Latvian capital, Riga,  will be cut off from heating and hot water supplies for four  hours April 4 unless the local governments cover part of their  debt to the Latvenergo enterprise by that date, Latvenergo  President Gunars Koemecs.    The decision was taken in compliance with a resolution by  the  previous government, Koemecs said.    The heating supply won't be suspended to kindergartens,  schools and nationally important institutions.    In total, local governments owe Latvenergo 19 million lats  for the 1993-1994 heating season. In addition, local  governments fixed lower heating tariffs (0.20 lats per square  meter of floorspace) than the Board of Electric Energy and  Heating Tariffs 0.38 lats per square meter of floorspace).    Latvenergo plans to meet with local leaders on April 12.    The enterprise has already cut heating to 63 consumers, hot  water to 65 consumers and 359 consumers have been warned of the  measures.    Latvenergo owes the Latvijas Gaze (Latvian Gas) enterprise  60  million lats for natural gas supplies.    Latvijas Gaze itself owes Russia 34.2 million USD. Russia  has already warned the enterprise's management that its Gazprom  consortium will stop pumping gas into the Latvian Incukalns  container unless Latvijas Gaze covers the debt until May 1.    Latvijas Gaze plans to cover part of the debt with a  23-million-dollar Japanese credit. Another 11 million USD could  be collected from debtors, the enterprise's management said.  Local consumers owed Latvijas Gaze 42.5 million lats on March  20.</p>

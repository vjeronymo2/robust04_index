			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Wales to get Pounds 28m jobs boost MR DAVID HUNT, Welsh secretary, said yesterday that investment projects totalling Pounds 28m were expected to create more than 840 jobs. Automotive components, food production, electronic equipment, plastic mouldings and the processing of motor insurance claims are among the 13 projects involved, which have secured regional assistance totalling more than Pounds 7m. The announcement failed to stem Labour protests about unemployment in Wales, said by Mr Barry Jones, shadow Welsh secretary, to be set to rise above 124,000. Mr Jones claimed that the decision to scrap the National Economic Development Council had called into question the proposals for establishing a Welsh Economic Council. Mr Hunt insisted that the new projects would provide 'another tremendous boost' for the Welsh economy, which had undergone a transformation over the past 10 years. He said: 'Our plans for a Welsh economic council continue and we shall shortly be issuing a consultation paper.' Commenting on the new projects, Mr Hunt said they demonstrated the continuing success of Wales in encouraging existing companies to expand and new companies to invest. Mr Hunt told MPs that, subject to the consultation process and the completion of the necessary statutory procedures, Anglesey and Radnor should formally be designated as environmentally sensitive areas by the end of the year. It was hoped that Preseli and the Clwydian Range would be designated by next June.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Ye. Krishtalev and I. Roytapel: "Development of </F> the Power Generation Sector and Social Problems"]    [Text] Last week a meeting with Academician Chingiz  Dzhuvarly, a leading specialist in the field of power generation  in Azerbaijan, was held at the Baku Institute of Social  Administration and Political Sciences. He informed his listeners  about the current situation in power generation and its  situation in Azerbaijan, and associated social problems.    The academician elaborated on two problems facing the power  generation industry in Azerbaijan and the world: first, power  generation per se and increasing the equipment's efficiency; and  second, transfer of power over distances.    Azerbaijan currently produces 4 million kwhr of electric  power. It is envisaged to bring the power output to 10 million  kwhr by the year 2005 (one large station in the West produces  about 12 million kwhr).    On the subject of exporting electric power and Azerbaijan's  potential, Academician Dzhuvarly said that our republic may  become an electric power exporter and even now, in this  difficult time for us, we export a quantity of power to  neighboring Georgia.    In an interview specially for GUNAY, the scientist  emphasized  that according to the terms of the contract with a Western oil  consortium, all payments for power consumption will be made by  representatives of these companies. Chingiz Dzhuvarly also said  that the republic population is not being deprived of its  legitimate share of electric power despite the increase in power  consumption due to oil companies' activities, since currently  only 40 percent of the power produced is being utilized, and the  other 60 percent "disappears" who knows where.    Academician Dzhuvarly talked about the trends in electric  power generation from so-called small-scale sources--solar,  wind-powered, and tide-powered power stations. The potential of  solar energy is extremely great. If we process only 3 percent of  the energy of our sun we will produce approximately 1 trillion  kw. But, noted the academician, another serious problem  arises--the problem of safety of life on the planet. The  scientist named the limits for developing power generation and  civilization on Earth--100 billion kw per 10 billion persons. If  the capacity is increased above 100 billion kw, irreversible  changes may occur on Earth, and a catastrophe is inevitable.    Ch. Dzhuvarly also shared his forecast of social relations  in  the future: He believes that large, developed, militarily strong  countries in pursuit of gain will encroach on the interests of  small, less developed countries, imposing on them a certain  population and power generation limit, because overproduction of  power and overpopulation may destroy civilization.</p>

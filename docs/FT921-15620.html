			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: G7 companies' profits expected to fall STOCK MARKET analysts have cut their profits forecasts for both 1991 and 1992 for companies in the seven leading economies, according to the IBES research service, based in New York. The IBES survey was carried out at the end of December by adding together thousands of individual company earnings forecasts from analysts around the world. In all the G7 countries except Germany, profits are forecast to fall in 1991  -by as much as 21.9 per cent in Canada, 11.4 per cent in the US and 9.8 per cent in the UK. German profits are forecast to rise by 1.5 per cent in 1991, which represents a drop in real terms. The outlook has worsened in the past three months: profits forecasts for both 1991 and 1992 are lower than they were in September. Forecasts for both periods have been reduced most sharply in Canada and Italy. In Japan, where the forecast for profits growth in 1992 is particularly weak  -only 4 per cent - profits for the corporate year that ends in March 1993 are expected to be below the level of two years before. In all the other countries, where the figures are based on calendar years, 1992 profits are forecast to be higher than in 1990, though often by small amounts after allowing for inflation. At the end of December, price-earnings ratios based on 1992 earnings were higher in three countries - Canada, Italy and the US - than at the end of September. A higher p/e ratio is usually taken to mean that stock prices are more 'expensive' than they were. P/es were unchanged in Germany and the UK and lower in Canada, Italy and Japan.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                  CONSENSUS ESTIMATES FOR EARNINGS GROWTH  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                  EPS Growth %         P/E 1992                               1991*      1992       Sept       Dec Canada - TSE                 -21.9       53.5        13         15 France - CAC 40               -2.7       15.7        15         11 Germany - Dax                  1.5        7.2        13         13 Italy - BCI                   -6.7       15.3        12         14 Japan - Nikkei                -6.4        4.0        37         38 UK - FTSE                     -9.8       26.2        12         12 US - S&amp;P 500                 -11.4       30.0        13         15  -------------------------------------------------------------------- *As at end-Dec 1991  -------------------------------------------------------------------- P/E column compares end-Sept figure with end-Dec  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IBES  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

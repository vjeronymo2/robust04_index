He was fouled by  Clarence Weatherspoon to set up the winning foul shots. He clinched the victory  with a steal.  </P> <P> Louisville (23-7, 12-2), the regular season conference champion, plays Tulane  on Thursday in the conference tournament at Biloxi, Miss. Southern Mississippi  (18-10, 9-5) is seeded second and plays Virginia Tech.  </P> <P> OTHER GAMES  </P> <P> SOUTH  </P> <P> Florida State 79, South Carolina 70 -- Tharon Mayes, playing in only his second  game in a month, scored 25 points, including four free throws in the final  minute, to lead the Seminoles to the Metro Conference win at Columbia, S.C.  </P> <P> Mayes, who was suspended for seven games by Florida State Coach Pat Kennedy for  an on-campus altercation, scored 13 points in the final 8:10 as the Seminoles  (16-14, 6-8) held off a pair of late rallies by the Gamecocks.  </P> <P> The loss dropped South Carolina (13-13, 6-8) into a tie with Florida State for  fifth place in the conference.  </P> <P> MIDWEST  </P> <P> Indiana 70, Wisconsin 68 -- Calbert Cheaney made a 15-foot jump shot with two  seconds left to give the Hoosiers the Big Ten victory at Madison, Wis.  </P> <P> Cheaney's basket, which came with two defenders hanging on him, capped a 10-0  Indiana rally over the last 3:11. After a pair of timeouts, Wisconsin's Kurt  Portmann threw a baseball pass to Tim Locum. Locum took the pass just past  midcourt, but his shot fell short.  </P> <P> Indiana is 17-9 overall and 7-9 in the Big Ten. Wisconsin is 14-16 and 4-13.  </P> <P> Texas 89, DePaul 79 -- Lance Blanks scored 30 points at Rosemont, Ill., to help  the Longhorns extend their winning streak to five games.  </P> <P> The game was tied, 69-69, with 7:10 left when Joey Wright drove the baseline  for a layup to give Texas (20-6) a lead it never relinquished. Texas earlier  appeared to have the game well in hand. The Blue Demons trailed, 66-56, with  13:22 remaining. But a 10-0 DePaul run midway through the second half tied the  game, 66-66, with 9:17 left.  </P> <P> Stephen Howard's 25 points led DePaul (16-14), whose hopes of getting an  at-large berth in the NCAA tournament were hurt by the defeat.  </P> <P> Ball State 84, Central Michigan 57 -- The easy victory at Muncie, Ind., enabled  the Cardinals to become the first team to win consecutive regular-season  Mid-American Conference titles since Bowling Green in 1961 and 1962.  </P> <P> Chandler Thompson and Billy Butts each scored five points during a 12-2 run  that gave Ball State (21-6, 13-3) a 58-38 lead with 8:35 left. A 14-3 run in  which Thompson scored six points extended the lead to 74-48 with 3:09 left.  </P> <P> The Chippewas (11-16, 6-10) stayed close in the first half and trailed 37-30 at  halftime.  </P></p>

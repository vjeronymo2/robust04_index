			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Lloyd's corporate launch ONE QUARTER of the shares in a corporate capital fund designed for the Lloyd's of London insurance market will be aimed at individuals, it has emerged. The CLM Insurance Fund, which today becomes the first Lloyd's corporate capital fund to issue a 'pathfinder' prospectus, plans to target wealthy individuals as well as institutions. The emphasis on individual investment comes in spite of the disenchantment of many Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the market - who have lost large sums of money in the past few years. About 70 Lloyd's syndicates have expressed interest in offering Pounds 250m in underwriting capacity for the fund, and institutions have so far tentatively offered to invest up to Pounds 150m to the fund, which will be in the form of a quoted investment trust. The minimum investment for individuals will be about Pounds 1,000. The CLM Fund prospectus says its investments initially will concentrate on reinsurance, aviation, energy and the motor business. CLM will invest its money in equities designed to track the overall performance of the FT-SE index, based on advice from BZW asset management. The money will also be pledged on Lloyd's syndicates, allocated on advice from Instrat and Syndicate Analysis Services, both within the Sedgwick group. Lloyd's will be able to approve the fund if Names agree to permit the introduction of corporate capital with limited liability at an extraordinary general meeting on October 20. The fund also still needs to resolve some tax issues with the Revenue. The fund will be chaired by Lord Rees, chairman of Lasmo.</p>

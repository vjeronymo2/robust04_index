			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Boycott threat looms over S Africa talks SOUTH Africa's constitutional negotiations resume today under the threat of withdrawal by right-wing parties including the white-supremacist Conservative party and the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party. Both the Conservative party and Inkatha have said they will boycott today's talks, in a clear attempt to exert pressure on remaining negotiators, who are now drawing up an interim constitution. Both parties have said that their participation in the talks will be conditional on the interim constitution: unless it provides for self-determination for Afrikaners, CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg has said his party will permanently leave the talks. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of Inkatha has threatened to launch a break-away constitutional convention unless the draft constitution meets his demand for a federal state. Such brinkmanship is probably inevitable, as constitutional negotiators reach the crucial stage of considering the draft of a new constitution for the next five years. The draft is being drawn up by a committee of legal experts and will be submitted within weeks to the multi-party negotiating forum. Today's talks are likely to be largely technical. Inkatha walked out of the forum a fortnight ago, after a majority of parties fixed April 27 next year as the date for South Africa's first multi-racial elections. The Conservative party only made clear its decision to boycott the talks last weekend. The two parties are the leading members of the six-member Concerned South Africans Group. Some other members of the group are likely to participate in today's talks. Within the next few weeks, Inkatha will have to decide finally whether to participate in the talks, in which Inkatha negotiators have already gained major concessions from the government and the African National Congress. They fear that Inkatha could launch a full-scale civil war in Natal province, where political violence has claimed thousands of lives since 1984, unless it is accommodated at the talks. But negotiators from the ANC and government have become increasing exasperated in recent days as Chief Buthelezi has appeared to reject these concessions, and repeatedly threatened to lead his own breakaway convention. Inkatha negotiators say chances are good that their party will return to talks eventually. But the Conservatives, who demand a race-based state where non-whites would have inferior political rights, seem far more likely to withdraw permanently. The other 25 parties to the talks all support a multi-racial state with equal rights for all races, and are unlikely to accommodate the CP.</p>

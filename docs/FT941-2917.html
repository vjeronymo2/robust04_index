			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Parliament in need of wide-ranging reform Sir, Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, is the latest person to call for a serious review of how parliament works ('CBI chief calls for overhaul of law-making', March 15). There can surely be few people inside the Palace of Westminster who believe the theatre and yah-boo of the house is a substitute for serious professional scrutiny of the executive. Whether and when ministers lie to the Commons is a matter for debate. What is plain, however, is they now evade many reasonable requests for information as a matter of routine. Standing committees on bills often replicate the worst features of the chamber, and departmental select committees - a breakthrough 14 years ago - need to move up a gear to the level of the public accounts committee. Rather than extending the pre-legislative stitch-up to include business, as Mr Howard suggests, how much better to have open discussion on bills with standing committees taking evidence before getting locked into committee stage. There are many other areas that require reform, from the ludicrous late-night sittings to time-tabling of bills and scrutiny of European legislation. The implications for improving value for money, reducing public expenditure errors and re-invigorating economic policy-making cannot be underestimated. As part of what opposition leader John Smith has called 'a new constitution for a new century', Labour's commission on democracy this year will be looking at the possibilities for creating a modern self-respecting and democratic chamber, able to aspire to Gladstone's dictum of 'not running the country but holding to account those that do'. All of us - business included  -will be the better for that. Graham Allen, shadow home affairs minister, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

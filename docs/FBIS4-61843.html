			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 7 May TASS -- A Russian Navy delegation may  have to cancel its trip to Sevastopol scheduled for 7 May unless  Ukraine changes its mind and decides to let the delegation's  plane in.    The plane would land at Belbek's airport three miles north  of  Sevastopol, the main base of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, but  Ukraine insists that the delegation led by First Deputy Navy  Commander Igor Kasatonov go by train, a source in the Sevastopol  city administration said.    The source also said that the administration has invited  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Russian President Boris  Yeltsin to attend Victory Day celebrations to be held on 9 May.</p>

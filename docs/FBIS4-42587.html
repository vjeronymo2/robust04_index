			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Gungor Mengi: "Shameful!"] </F>   [Text] We seriously suffer from the existing problems, not  because they are very complex but because we waste time. For  example, we have been troubled by separatist and terrorist  activities over the past 10 years. Had the state been aware of  the realities and allowed the professionals to continue the  struggle against terrorism, the problem would have been resolved  a long time ago, before it assumed dangerous proportions. The  continuation of terrorist activities has not only harmed the  people's unity but also wasted many resources, which could have  been used for development.    Meanwhile, several foreign countries, in an effort to impose  their policies on Ankara, have used the separatist and terrorist  activities against Turkey. The photograph that was published in  SABAH on page one yesterday clearly indicates the way the  Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] has been used to implement the  ugly designs of foreign forces against Turkey. The photograph  depicted PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan standing beside an Armenian  priest, as if waiting for instructions and funds!    It is common knowledge that many of the Armenian people are  hostile to Turkey, so much so that they would not mind upsetting  their life. However, what can be said about Greece?    Terrorism is a very serious crime against humanity. A  country may find itself isolated for supporting terrorist  activities in the world. In fact, the countries that have been  isolated in the Middle East are not few. The suspicion Greece  has aroused on the matter may place that country in a more  degrading and despicable situation than that of Libya and Syria.    Obviously, several of Turkey's neighbors are supporting the  PKK in order to impose their policies on Ankara. However,  Greece is using that organization to promote its trade and  increase its revenues in the tourism domain. Tourists left  Turkey and made reservations in the Greek islands after bombs  exploded in Antalya in 1993. We wrote in this column at the  time that the state should abandon its timid approach and take  daring steps to deal with the matter. We urged the state to  properly assess the evidence and act accordingly. However, that  has not been done. Bombs exploded in the middle of the tourism  season in 1993. Explosions took place even before the tourism  season began in 1994.    Former President Kenan Evren has not hesitated to blame  Greece. No one in his position would dare blame any country on  mere suspicion and without official information.    Turkey must persuade its neighbors not to use the PKK as a  means to promote their interests. The silence that has been  maintained has increased the number of countries which use the  PKK as an instrument against Turkey.    Using acts of terrorism against a neighboring country is  shameful. However, it is even more shameful to condone such a  behavior in order to "avoid creasing problems."</p>

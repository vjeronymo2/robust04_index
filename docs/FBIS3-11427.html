			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santiago de Chile, 21 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian  Ambassador to Chile Guilherme Leite-Ribeiro has said that Brazil  is still interested in signing a commercial agreement with  Chile, although one that excludes the customs tariff issue.    The ambassador has thus cleared the doubts about the  bilateral negotiations, which have been stalemated for five  months.    In statements to the economic newspaper "EL DIARIO,"  Leite-Ribeiro explained that the customs tariff issue is being  excluded because Mercosur [Common Market of the South] internal  tariffs will be eliminated in January 1995, while Mercosur  members will adopt a common external tariff.    This common tariff will modify the bilateral agreements,  which will have to be renegotiated by Brazil, Argentina,  Uruguay, and Paraguay, which are the four Mercosur members.    "It would therefore be senseless to negotiate with Chile  over  a tariff reduction that will last only one year," the Ambassador  said.    The main obstacles in the Chilean-Brazilian negotiations  centered around the area of services, a sector in which Brazil  maintains a policy of restrictions that favor local enterprises.    In addition, some Chilean entrepreneurial sectors have  disagreed with the treaty with Brazil, because they have no  confidence in Brazil's macroeconomic development and because of  the state subsidies paid to some exporters.    Ambassador Leite-Ribeiro said that subsidies to Brazilian  exports were terminated three years ago, adding that the Chilean  problem is a lack of sufficient industrial supply, while in  those sectors where Chile has achieved a strong position, trade  relations with the industrialized countries are privileged.    He recalled that Brazil has a powerful industry and that its  exports amount to $40 billion annually, which is equivalent to  Chile's gross domestic product.    Brazil is Chile's main commercial partner in Latin America.  In 1993 Brazilian exports to Chile amounted to $1.06 billion,  while imports stood at $407 million.</p>

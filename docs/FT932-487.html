			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Axe hangs over military bases AN INDEPENDENT commission finished work at the weekend on a list of US military bases to be closed to bring the Pentagon's facilities into line with its force structure. The commission proposes shutting some of the US's largest and oldest naval bases, such as the Charleston naval station and shipyard in South Carolina and the Alameda naval air station and Mare Island shipyard in San Francisco bay. The commission was originally established because Congress found it so difficult to shut any of the country's military bases - one of the main mechanisms through which US government money is pumped into the constituencies of powerful legislators. The commission, supposedly more hard-hearted and less emotional than Congress, has spent weeks mulling over an original list of base closures submitted by the Pentagon. But individual members of the commission - chaired by Mr James Courter, a former congressman - often found the process tough. The list of bases to be closed must now be approved by President Bill Clinton and Congress, but the commission's recommendations cannot be tinkered with. The US has already shut more than 700 military installations overseas, mostly in Europe. The US Navy will undergo the most radical changes as a result of the proposed base closures. The shutdown of most of the Charleston facilities will leave it concentrated in one big shipyard on each coast  - San Diego in California and Norfolk in Virginia. The commission agreed for the most part with the Navy's own recommendations, after considering and rejecting the possibility of closing Norfolk instead of Charleston. Both Norfolk and San Diego will, however, lose jobs with the closure of training and aircraft maintenance depots. Studies show that communities have in the past often been able to create more jobs than they lost by converting bases to civil airports or industrial parks.</p>

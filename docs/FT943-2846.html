			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP boosts least efficient UK farmers, Touche Ross reports Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is giving a boost to Britain's least efficient farmers, according to a survey of 124 producers by chartered accountants Touche Ross. The annual sample found that the first year of CAP reform had begun to close the income gap between the most and least profitable farm businesses. Touche Ross's sample is grouped according to farm income with the farmers in the bottom 25 per cent recording losses for the past five years. These farmers showed a loss of Pounds 44 an acre in the 1992 harvest, but turned this into a profit of Pounds 17 an acre for last year's harvest. However, the more profitable farmers in the top quartile of the sample showed an income boost of just Pounds 7 an acre during the same period - taking their income from Pounds 155 an acre to Pounds 162 an acre. 'There is no doubt that net farm incomes have risen generally because of the devaluation of sterling, but the most dramatic benefits have been seen by those farmers grouped in the bottom 25 per cent of our survey,' said Mr Vincent Hedley Lewis, senior partner of Touche in Agriculture, the accountants' farming division. Touche Ross believes the disparity between the rise in earnings for farmers at the top of the sample and those at the bottom arises from the European Union's set-aside policy. All farmers are required to set aside, or lay fallow, 15 per cent of their land, but the most profitable farmers who are laying aside high-yielding land have the most to lose while set-aside payments are the same for all producers. 'I am concerned that the reforms to date have not done enough for the most efficient farmers. The EU is moving to a position where its farmers have to compete on world markets,' said Mr Hedley Lewis. 'This means that minimizing the cost of production is vital, and that is what the most efficient farmers do best.' Touche Ross also said that overhead costs in farming continued to rise despite the reduced area farmed because of set-aside.</p>

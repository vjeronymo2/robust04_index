			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang and Amy Liu] </F>   [Excerpt] China decided to grant a tax holiday for  state-run firms involved in grain wholesales in a move to curb  inflation fuelled by price rises on staple foods in recent  months.    The tax exemption which was begun early this month would  last  until the end of next year, according to an internal circular  issued by the State Council, China's cabinet.    The circular said state-run wholesalers responsible for  sales  of grain and edible oil to urban residents, military units and  farmers would be exempted from various taxes including corporate  tax and value-added tax during the holiday.    State-run wholesalers for fodder are also granted the  preferential treatment, Chinese sources quoted the document as  saying.    The move was the latest effort by the government to combat  inflation which has risen above 20 percent in major Chinese  cities in the past few months.    The spriralling prices have become a matter of great concern  to the leadership, which is worried that they may prompt social  unrest.    Inflation and rampant corruption were said to be major  factors behind the student-led protests in 1989 which ended with  the bloody military crackdown in Tiananmen Square.    Meanwhile, sources said the government's pledge of intensive  action to boost agriculture was in vain since local governments  and most central ministries were reluctant to implement the  policies.    Despite food production goals laid out by the State Council  earlier this year, no concrete measures were actually in place,  a Chinese economic source said yesterday.    Beijing's plans involve pumping an additional 1.9 billion  yuan (HK$1.69 billion) into the agricultural sector--but only a  trickle of the amount has been placed.    Beijing also planned to import great quantities of chemical  fertiliser and pesticides this year, but just a small portion of  the quota had been fulfilled so far, sources said.

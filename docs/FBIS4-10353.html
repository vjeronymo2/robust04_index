			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with PNC [National Conservative Party] Vice </F> President Adolfo Calero Portocarrero by Edgard Solorzano; place  and date not given; first six paragraphs are EL SEMANARIO  introduction]    [Text] He is the principal leader of one of the three  conservative parties in Nicaragua. He defines himself as just  another citizen of this land that has been traversed from one  end to the other by nationalist, anti-interventionist, and  frequently fratricidal wars throughout its history; in which the  leaders of gangs in parallel situations have led and sometimes  still lead the peasant masses into total slaughter. And there  are those who say that he is not innocent in connection with all  of this.    He went into exile during the period of the Sandinist  revolutionary government and was a member of the leadership  structure of the resistance movement. His role while abroad was  above all diplomatic in nature, involving negotiations, mainly  with Washington, and the solicitation of funds amounting to  millions to finance the war against Nicaragua. There are also  those who believe that it is not entirely clear where all of  this money went.    Calero Portocarrero is a tall man with a rough voice and  totally white hair. Despite his involvement in politics, and  thus the recent history of the country, he has not evidenced  much of the intellectual legacy of his father, the well-known  writer Adolfo Calero Orozco. He was one of the precursors of the  body of Nicaraguan short stories and the author of the book  "Sangre Santa" ["Sacred Blood"], among others.    "I am very proud of both my father and my mother, Mrs. Maria  Portocarrero," he is forthright in saying.    He began his political life in the Conservative Party. He  says this affiliation is in his blood, since one of his  grandfathers, his father, and his mother were conservatives as  well. After returning from Europe at the end of the last  century, his maternal grandfather, Bernabe Portocarrero, became  a liberal, imbued with liberal ideas.    Calero Portocarrero's first political activity was as a  member of the Conservative Youth in about 1957. He recently  turned 62.    [Solorzano] How would you define your political career?    [Calero Portocarrero] I have progressed in a straight line,  with no inconstancy. I have always sought the achievement of  freedom, democracy, and a social market economy, aware of the  obligation borne by those of us who have some education to share  our knowledge, ideas, ideals, and achievements with the rest of  the people. I feel very profoundly Nicaraguan. This was  something inculcated in me by my father.    [Solorzano] What role did you play during the Somoza era and  during the decade of the Sandinist government?    [Calero Portocarrero] When I returned to Nicaragua from the  United States in the 1950's, I never had a choice, in the sense  that there was a dictatorship in power, and there was one  opposition party--the Conservative Party. Thus I chose to be a  member of the opposition from the beginning, and I continued to  oppose Somoza until the dynasty came to an end. Then came the  Sandinists, in whom the people of Nicaragua placed the highest  hopes. But they were totally disappointed. I remained in  Nicaragua in opposition to the Sandinist movement until I was  refused permission to leave the country in 1982. I did leave,  legally, and they then put obstacles in the way of my return in  January of 1983. Given those circumstances, I had no alternative  to staying abroad. I was not going to remain at their mercy. Nor  did I accept the position they offered me in Ecuador, if I would  forget about politics. But I did choose and agree to join the  Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). I had been in contact with  Enrique Bermudez even before my departure from Nicaragua, and he  had urged me to join the FDN. I joined in January of 1983. That  same year, I was elected to serve as its president, and I held  that position until the Nicaraguan resistance, made up of the  various groups working against the Sandinist movement, was  formed.    [Solorzano] Why did these groups suddenly decide to join  together?    [Calero Portocarrero] This union, which included more than  90  percent of the belligerent forces, was forged by the  circumstances in the United States. It was necessary to appeal  to the Congress there, to present a broader front, and to obtain  from that country the economic aid essential for the task of  continuing the struggle.    [Solorzano] What difference do you see between the nature of  the Sandinist movement when it was in power and now that it is  out of power?    [Calero Portocarrero] The Sandinist movement was clandestine  when it began. Once it had won power, its preference for  dictatorial command, for absolute, arbitrary control, became  clear. Later, due to circumstances and the pressure exerted by  the rebel forces (and even international pressure), the  Sandinists found themselves forced to hold elections, which they  lost. Then, once they were out of power, they were never willing  to recognize that this was the situation. Instead, they  continued to wield power from below, as Mr. Ortega has put it.    Little by little, however, I have been seeing a change.    [Solorzano] What kind of change?    [Calero Portocarrero] A relatively secret one.    [Solorzano] To what do you attribute this behavior?    [Calero Portocarrero] It looks as if the Sandinists have not  been able to overcome this preference for secrecy that  characterized the beginnings of the movement. And so we find  that we are dealing with an apparently divided movement with  different factions, one moderate and one radical.    [Solorzano] Based on your analysis, what is the reason for  this situation?    [Calero Portocarrero] I think that there is no ideal in the  Sandinist movement that would provide the ranks with cohesion.  The Sandinists are confused. It was very difficult for them to  make the transition from guerrilla warfare to government power,  and then from government power to life in the countryside. Thus  the Sandinist movement has become the victim of its own errors,  its own failures, and it will be very hard for it to find a  direction. The Sandinists will have to deal with many  contradictions. Only they themselves can strip the movement down  and straighten it out, once they know who they are.    [Solorzano] Who are those you believe can give direction to  the Sandinist movement?    [Calero Portocarrero] Well, I would say that it is now  possible to discern some innovative forces that merit respect  and should be taken into account.    [Solorzano] What do you think of this internal debate in the  movement?    [Calero Portocarrero] All of the parties here in Nicaragua  tend to have internal divisions. And since we see that there are  several conservative and liberal parties, it would not be  surprising to see several Sandinist Fronts.    [Solorzano] What was your role in the 1990 elections?    [Calero Portocarrero] I was not permitted to return to  Nicaragua during that period--not until after Mrs. Chamorro had  taken office.    I did not participate in the electoral campaign and I did  not  proselytize. I even wrote an article for the MIAMI HERALD in  which I predicted that Dona Violeta would win, based on the  Gueguense [Nicaraguan folklore character]. Now then, my  party--the National Conservative Party--nominated Enrique  Bolanos as its candidate. In the end, I favored the United  Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) and Dona Violeta's candidacy.    [Solorzano] Why, at this point, does the National  Conservative Party continue to believe in the UNO and to call  for a constituent assembly?    [Calero Portocarrero] We believe, with the greatest  conviction and in all sincerity, that simply patching up or  repairing the present political problem in Nicaragua by means of  partial reforms is not the solution. I even doubt that such  reforms could be carried out, because there are forces in the  National Assembly that have entirely different interests. And so  I believe that the solution to the problem of reorganizing the  powers of the state can be found only in a new constitution. In  order for this to become a reality, it is necessary to go back  to the people, to take back the initiative, and to clarify the  ideas of the people so that it will be they who choose.    [Solorzano] My attention is drawn to the fact that while all  of the parties making up the UNO are calling for a constituent  assembly, their members have resumed their parliamentary seats.  How can these two things be reconciled?    [Calero Portocarrero] I believe it was a very great mistake  for the UNO to withdraw from the assembly in protest against the  election of the board of officers headed by Dr. Gustavo Tablada.  The UNO deputies should have stayed, opposed what they needed to  oppose, and voted "yes" when they believed it necessary. The UNO  lost the majority, whether this was due to mistakes or  conflicts. One can never hope that an elected congress will  remain united if it has no cohesive factor.    Now then, I think the fact that the UNO deputies returned to  their seats is a healthy thing, although we are opposed to any  partial reform of the Constitution. But it must be remembered  that there are other laws that are very important, and the  deputies can do nothing from outside the assembly. It is  perfectly possible for them to occupy their assembly seats while  favoring a constituent assembly. Let us remember that it is  these same deputies--those in both the UNO and the Front--who  will cast the votes.    [Solorzano] How can the UNO position be explained when, on  the one hand, it is calling for a constituent assembly, while,  on the other, a UNO commission met with the Sandinist Front to  seek out common ground with a view to partial reforms?    [Calero Portocarrero] The National Conservative Party did  not  approve of the holding of these talks. We had already decided to  wage the struggle for a constituent assembly. We have never had  faith in partial reforms, but as members of the UNO, we halted  our campaign for a constituent assembly and waited to see what  the results would be. They proved to be what we had expected  since nothing was achieved. The articles that are of principal  importance to both the Sandinist Front and the UNO were not  discussed. And so, then, I think we must look to reality,  coexistence, peace, and mutual respect, so that we can all live  in an ideal country. This can be achieved only through a  constituent assembly.    [Solorzano] One of the things the UNO proposed as a  condition  for supporting partial reforms was a change in the board of  officers of the National Assembly. Engineer Alfredo Cesar even  publicly recognized the election of Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman.  Why then do you continue to insist on a constituent assembly?    [Calero Portocarrero] In my opinion, the UNO has clung to  arguments that were not so important. I did not agree with the  UNO, but since our party is a member of the coalition, we  respected the decision of the majority. But I reiterate that I  did not approve of the withdrawal of the UNO deputies from the  assembly solely because a board of officers that deprived them  of control of the National Assembly had been elected.    It is hard for me to understand Cesar's position in the  parliament.    [Solorzano] Does the National Conservative Party regard the  present board of officers as legal?    [Calero Portocarrero] My party has made no statement on the  matter.    [Solorzano] Doesn't the participation of the UNO deputies in  the assembly perhaps give it legal status?    [Calero Portocarrero] Well, you see, the UNO deputies either  did not appear at the assembly sessions or presented themselves  but then withdrew. However, they did accept their salaries. I  believe that this was illogical. It was inconsistent for them to  question the legal status of an officer of the assembly, denying  it by withdrawing from that body, and then subsequently to  recognize the validity of his signature on their checks.    [Solorzano] Originally--in 1989, the UNO was made up of 14  parties, while now there are only seven. Do you believe the UNO  is headed toward disappearance?    [Calero Portocarrero] In 1989, there were 14 parties that  belonged to the Coordinadora [Coordination Council]. I believe  the UNO was formed with fewer parties, and that it was a  coalition organized with a view to the 1990 elections. It  contained no force that would keep it united. When the catalyst  for the formation of these coalitions disappears, they tend to  disintegrate. It is true that the UNO has a government program  to oversee, and that is the only thing that is sustaining it.  Moreover, the UNO will not be a factor in the 1996 elections,  since new alliances will be formed. It seems likely to me that  even the Sandinist Front will seek alliances with other parties  that are sympathetic to the new ideology allegedly professed by  some Sandinists.    [Solorzano] Do you believe that no single party will be able  to rally the votes needed to win the elections in 1996?    [Calero Portocarrero] Very frequently, this depends on who  the leader of a given party is. Here in Nicaragua, there is a  tendency to vote for the individual, and not necessarily for the  party. However, anyone who aspires to the presidency must have a  party behind him. For this reason, I think this is important  when the time comes to choose people. And therefore alliances  will have to be formed.    [Solorzano] What is the National Conservative Party thinking  where the 1996 elections are concerned?    [Calero Portocarrero] We are engaged in a process of  consolidation, modernization, and dynamic action. We are working  on a data bank with a view to drafting a program, and we will  operate as if we were going to proceed alone. It is possible  that we will participate in alliances.</p>

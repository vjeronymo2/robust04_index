			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, May 22 (AFP) -- India is ready to talk to  Moslem militants to end the four-year-old separatist campaign in  Kashmir, but Pakistan cannot be included in the negotiations, a  federal minister said here on Sunday [23 May].    Internal Security Minister Rajesh Pilot told the Press Trust  of India (PTI) news agency that New Delhi had "an open mind on  holding talks with anybody if it helps to bring back normalcy in  Kashmir."    But Pilot rejected suggestions from a top Kashmiri militant  leader, Yasin Malik, that New Delhi should start an  unconditional dialogue with Kashmiris and Pakistan if it wanted  peace in the northern state.    "The talks should be among ourselves," Pilot said, referring  to India and to Moslem militants in Kashmir fighting for the  secession of the state, the only one with a Moslem majority.  Pilot ruled out the inclusion of "any third party."    It was the first Indian reaction to Saturday's offer by  Malik  of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) that separatist  unrest could end in Kashmir if India talked unconditionally to  Kashmiris and Pakistan.    Indian newspapers on Sunday quoted Malik as saying in  Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir, that his outlawed JKLF  would announce a unilateral truce if New Delhi agreed to the  negotiations.    Indian leaders have said the guerrillas must renounce  violence before talks can start. But Malik, 30, freed on May 16  after nearly four years in prison, said: "You cannot talk of  peace and then make any move toward it conditional."    Malik, who returned to Kashmir two days after his release,  said the JKLF, the premier Moslem guerrilla group, stood for the  "total independence" of Kashmir, now divided between India and  Pakistan.    "The Kashmir issue is not merely a territorial dispute  between India and Pakistan," he declared. According to Indian  newspapers he denied that the Kashmiri separatist campaign, in  which nearly 10,000 have lost their lives, aimed to carve out an  independent state exclusively for Moslems.    "We do not demand freedom for a particular community or a  particular area. We strive for total independence of the 13  million Kashmiris, irrespective of their caste, colour, race,  region or faith.    "The independence of Kashmir means the independence of the  85,000 square miles (136,000 square kilometers) that constitute  our homeland," he said, making clear he meant both the  two-thirds of the state within India and the rest held by  Pakistan.    India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since  1947 over Kashmir. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of arming the  militant groups, which Pakistan denies.    All Moslem separatist groups except the JKLF want the  Indian-held Kashmir to join Pakistan.    Other Moslem groups want to make Kashmir an Islamic state,  and have forced thousands of Hindus who have lived in the  Kashmir valley for generations to flee. Malik said he wanted the  Hindus to return.    Malik, who helped launch the Kashmiri separatist campaign in  1989, was arrested by Indian security forces in Srinagar in  August 1990 and held in prison until last week.</p>

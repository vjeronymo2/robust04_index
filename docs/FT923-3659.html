			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Car dealer guilty in GM fraud MR JOHN McNamara, a car dealer on New York's Long Island, has pleaded guilty to charges that he defrauded General Motors in a Dollars 6bn loan racket, and that he used some of the money to bribe local officials so as to win approval for real estate schemes. The fraud has embarrassed GM's finance arm, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, which has a reputation for strict credit controls. It has led GM to shake up the subsidiary's management, and the group was forced to write off Dollars 171m in loans. Mr McNamara, aged 53, borrowed billions of dollars from General Motors over more than a decade to finance the purchase of cars which did not exist. He used new borrowings to pay off old debts, while siphoning off part of the money for his own Dollars 400m business empire. He faces up to 20 years jail and Dollars 800m in fines.</p>

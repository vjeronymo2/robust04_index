			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SECURITY PANEL OKS CAMBODIA PEACE PLAN;  </P> <P> UNITED NATIONS: NEGOTIATORS SAY THE SWEEPING PACT IS A BREAKTHROUGH AND CALLED  ON CAMBODIAN FACTIONS TO ACCEPT IT.  </P> <P> The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council today officially  announced agreement on a comprehensive political plan for Cambodia and called  on the Cambodian combatants to accept it in its entirety.  </P> <P> In what negotiators called a major breakthrough toward a Cambodian peace  settlement, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China, all  of whom have at one time supported one Cambodian faction or another, issued a  statement saying they had agreed on five "indispensable requirements."  </P> <P> One of the negotiators in the 8-month-old talks, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister  Igor Rogachev, even held out hopes for a cease-fire in the near future. "If  everything is going smoothly, it may take a month or two," he told reporters.  </P> <P> The statement did not reveal the terms of settlement, which include a major  role for the United Nations during a transitional stage leading to free  elections.  </P> <P> A key clause, according to diplomats, permits the United Nations to ensure that  elections are held in a neutral political environment, and if necessary, to  take control of five key ministries -- foreign, defense, public security,  finance and information.  </P> <P> U.N. peacekeeping and civilian forces are also to supervise disarmament, verify  a cease-fire, help organize elections and make sure no foreign troops are left  in the country.  </P> <P> If approved by the Cambodians and the full 15-nation Security Council, the new  U.N. peacekeeping force will be known as the U.N. Transitional Authority in  Cambodia, or UNTAC.  </P> <P> The document, agreed on by the five, includes five main sections on a  transitional government, disarmament, elections, human rights protection and  international guarantees for the neutrality of a future Cambodia.  </P></p>

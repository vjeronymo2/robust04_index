			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> PLANNERS ENDORSE DOWNTOWN PROJECT  </P> <P> An office and retail project called a "focal point of the downtown area"  cleared its first hurdle last week, winning the approval of the Planning  Commission.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the planners unanimously endorsed a site plan and tentative tract  map requested by IDM Corp. of Long Beach.  </P> <P> The company plans to construct 116,775 square feet of office and retail space  at the northwest corner of Garden Grove Boulevard and Euclid Street.  </P> <P> The 8.5-acre site now is largely vacant, and final approval of the project  still must come from the city's Agency for Community Development and the City  Council.  </P> <P> As approved by the commission, the project would be built in two phases. The  first phase would consist of a five-story office tower and the surrounding  parking area. That portion would have to be completed before construction is  begun on the second phase -- three one-story garden office buildings along  Acacia Parkway on the north and a one-story retail building along Garden Grove  Boulevard.  </P> <P> IDM's mid-rise office tower would be at the southeast corner of the project,  across the street from another five-story IDM office building constructed at  the northeast corner of the intersection in the late 1980s.  </P> <P> The project is intended to be compatible with the historic Main Street district  to the west, officials said.  </P> <P> It is the latest of several development proposals for the site. Previous plans  have all been withdrawn, and the land has stood unused for more than a decade.  JIM TORTOLANO  </P></p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: German steel makers forge link Thyssen Stahl and Krupp-Hoesch Stahl, Germany's two largest steel makers, yesterday announced they will merge their production of tin plates, non-corrosive steels and sheets for the electrical industry in a last-ditch attempt to cut costs and reduce losses. Thyssen said two new companies will be created through the merger. One will oversee the production of tin plates and will be majority-owned by Thyssen which is the market leader in Germany for the product. Thyssen Stahl's Rasselstein subsidiary in Neuwied, near Koblenz, produces 700,000 tonnes of tin plates a year, about twice the output of the Hoesch Stahl's Westfallenhutte plant in Dortmund. A second new company will regroup non-corrosive steels and metal sheets and will be largely owned by Krupp-Hoesch which produces more in these divisions than Thyssen. All three divisions at the moment account for about a tenth of the two companies' turnover and represent combined sales of roughly DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn). The merger marks the first time that the two steel giants strike a partnership in areas where they have previously been fierce competitors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Rujun (1776 1172 0193) and </F> XINHUA reporter Hu Qinghai (5170 3237 3189)]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Work Committee for  CPC Central Committee Organs held a work conference on  ideological and political work in Beijing today. Work Committee  Secretary Zeng Qinghong pointed out at the meeting: Ideological  and political work plays an important role in the party's entire  cause. It is a crucial link that helps transform the party's  line, principles, and policy into the masses' action of  consciousness, an important approach that helps unite the masses  of people and arouse their initiative, and a vital force and  important guarantee for the smooth progress of revolution and  construction.    Zeng Qinghong said: Paying high regard to ideological and  political work and giving full play to the role of ideological  and political work is our party's fine tradition and politically  strong points. As the administrative body of the CPC Central  Committee, CPC Central Committee organs shoulder important  responsibilities for formulating and carrying out the party's  line, principles, and policy and play an important pivotal role  in the party's cause. The position and role of the CPC Central  Committee organs set higher and stricter demands on the masses  of cadres and personnel in terms of politics, work style, and  administration.    Zeng Qinghong demanded that the ideological and political  work of the CPC Central Committee organs must be guided by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and closely  centered around the party's central tasks. The CPC Central  Committee organs must make efforts in ideological and political  work to meet the needs of the developing circumstances and  closely integrate it with administrative affairs of various  departments and units. They must conscientiously strengthen  ideological education; improve overall quality of their cadres  and personnel; and cultivate a team of cadres and personnel who  are promising, moral, cultured, and self-disciplined. They must  fully arouse the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativeness of  cadres and personnel; ensure the completion of various tasks in  their departments and units; and serve the deepening of reform,  promoting of development, and maintaining of stability.    Zeng Qinghong said emphatically: To arm the entire party  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics is a major task of party building in the  new period and a major task of the ideological and political  work in the new situation. The fundamental goal of the CPC  Central Committee organs' ideological and political work is to  unite the ideology of the masses of cadres and personnel with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. Party  organizations at all levels in CPC Central Committee organs must  conscientiously and carefully study the theory in an in-depth  manner. He added: Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a series of  important expositions on the ideological and political work in  the new period. These expositions have substantial content,  deep intention, and distinct features of the times. These  expositions are an important part of his theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. The masses of party  members and cadres, especially those who are involved in  ideological and political work, must conscientiously study these  expositions, grasp their essence, and use these expositions as a  guide to their work.    Gu Yunfei, deputy secretary of the Work Committee for CPC  Central Committee Organs, presided over the meeting.</p>

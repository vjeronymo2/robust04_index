			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Maria Brunet: "Government Takes Note of </F> Anguita's Moderate Tone and Proposes New Agreements With United  Left"]    [Text] Madrid -- The government takes note of the  relatively moderate tone used by United Left [IU] in the latest  parliamentary debates, Minister of the Prime Minister's Office  Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba stated yesterday. The minister made  this remark during an overall assessment of the political  framework following Wednesday's [11 May] parliamentary session  devoted to debating the Roldan affair and corruption.    According to Rubalcaba, it was made clear in the debate that  the government stands by its intention to tackle corruption, and  that it has stability to continue its work. At the same time,  it is obvious that relations with the People's Party are  experiencing a difficult time, although this does not mean that  relations between the two main parliamentary forces have been  severed.    So the main new development in the sphere of political  relations stems from the fact that the government takes note of  IU's stance in that session, and reiterates its desire to pursue  agreements with Anguita on the matters on which it is possible.  "The prime minister," Rubalcaba said, "has already expressed  gratitude for the tone of Mr. Anguita's speech, which was  different from that used by other parliamentary groups upholding  the same political stance or the the same main aim (Felipe  Gonzalez' resignation). Mr. Anguita used a radically different  tone, which undoubtedly makes possible a different political  debate and political dialogue. It is true that there are some  agreements with IU, and it is not a characteristic of this  latest stage of the legislative term, because there were already  some agreements at the beginning. We have never concealed our  desire to reach agreements with IU on the issues on which it is  possible. There are certainly considerable differences -- for  instance, on economic policy or on matters such as labor reform,  except for the matter of trade union elections -- but there can  be no doubt that there have been agreements on other matters. We  will spare no efforts to ensure that those agreements can  continue to occur."    Despite the toughness of the confrontation between Jose  Maria  Aznar and Felipe Gonzalez, the government asserts that not "all  the bridges have been broken." "At the parliamentary level,"  Rubalcaba stated, "there are some relations. Nor is anybody  unaware that relations with the People's Party are certainly not  at their best, but that does not mean that there are no kind of  relations with the People's Party. They are not smooth right  now -- they are experiencing difficult circumstances -- but  there are relations at levels other than those of the prime  minister and the People's Party chairman."    In any event, the government believes it has a stable basis  for continuing its work, and this has been made clear in the  recent sessions in the Congress of Deputies. In short, the  government emerged from Wednesday's debate on corruption with  the conviction that it has been made clear that the nationalist  forces are giving it "the parliamentary support needed to  perform its work."    The government is in constant touch with those forces. A  result of this has been the resumption of contacts with the  Basque government in order to continue the process of a "joint  reading" of the Basque autonomy statute. The Basque Nationalist  Party complained a great deal about the blocking of the dialogue  on autonomy. For its part, the government wishes at all costs  to prevent the smooth relations with the nationalists being  interpreted as a concession or quid pro quo for the support it  receives from them, especially in view of the imminence of the  election campaign.    Hence Rubalcaba was at pains yesterday to emphasize that the  recent contacts with representatives of the Basque government  stem from the pledge to enhance the government's autonomy  policy, begun at the beginning of the legislative term. In  keeping with this decision, the government yesterday passed a  resolution admitting the autonomous communities to the Spanish  committee on cooperation with UNESCO.    In addition, the government is beginning the European  campaign by denying that its results can be interpreted as if it  were a general election, Rubalcaba stated yesterday. With  respect to the opinion polls forecasting an electoral victory  for the People's Party in the coming European elections, Perez  Rubalcaba stated that the government attaches great importance  to them.    In addition, Rubalcaba added that the "it is not reasonable  to seek to turn the European elections into something other than  what they are: They are European elections, and the results  should be assessed in that context." "Those who seek to infer  other things from those elections," he continued, "will have to  explain what nature or significance they attribute to that  assessment."</p>

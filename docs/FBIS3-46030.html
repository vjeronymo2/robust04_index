			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- China and the United  States are to take effective measures to combat smuggling and  illegal immigration. This was made clear during consultations  between the two countries here on Monday [24 January].    On the basis of mutual respect, equality and strengthening  co-operation, the consultations were conducted between Zhang  Hongxi, director of the Consular Affairs Department of the  Chinese Foreign Ministry, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State  Robert Gelbard.    During the consultations, the Chinese side analysed main  reasons for the emergence of smuggling and illegal immigration,  reiterated China's consistent principled stand that the Chinese  Government has all along been against smuggling and illegal  immigration, and briefed on the unremitting efforts and resolute  measures the Chinese side had adopted in this sphere.    The Chinese side asked the U.S. to deal severe blows at  "snake heads" -- people involved in organizing smuggling inside  the territory of the U.S.    The Chinese side pointed out that China is resolutely  against  and cannot accept that "political asylum" should be offered to  smugglers who ask the U.S. for "political protection".    Such people use so-called excuses such as that "the Chinese  human rights situation is not good", or claim that they are  "suffering from political persecution", or are against China's  family-planning policy. The Chinese view is that wrongfully  granting asylum in fact encourages smuggling and provides  international smuggling organizations with opportunities.    While combating smuggling and stopping illegal immigration,  the Chinese side held that normal exchanges between people of  the two sides should be actively maintained, hoping that the  U.S. side can ensure convenience for Chinese people who are on  business or for private affairs apply for visas from the U.S.    The U.S. side said that the U.S. is formulating new laws so  as to crack down on increasing illegal activities by  international crime-committing organizations.    Paying much attention to combating smuggling activities, the  U.S. side is willing to strengthen co-operation with China in  enhancing direct contacts between the two sides and exchanging  information, and severely punish those criminals.    The U.S. side also said that relevant U.S. bodies are ready  to strengthen exchanges with relevant Chinese departments and  enhance understanding between the two sides.    The two sides agreed to establish an ad hoc consultation  system, further strengthen bilateral exchanges and co-operation  between law-enforcing departments, exchange information in good  time, and take effective measures to severely punish the  "snake-heads" and stop smuggling and illegal immigration.    The two sides held that this effort is in conformity with  the  interests of the two countries.</p>

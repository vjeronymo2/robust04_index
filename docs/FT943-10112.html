			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Books: Travelling write Some of us go off on holiday with Shirley Conran or Freddie Forsythe; a very few take Anthony Powell or Marcel Proust. But Literary Companions are different, and appear to be a growth sector of the publishing industry. They are a species of anthology, and the idea is very simple: take a country, hire a diligent author for a pittance, and tell him to string together hundreds of extracts, quotations, gobbets, from first-hand accounts of earlier travellers and writers. Curiously enough, the end-products are very different one from the other, as we can see from this summer's batch. Most of them are excellent and will certainly deserve space in your hand baggage. The distinction is between those which follow a geographical scheme and those which divide the material into categories. For instance, Martin Garrett has edited Greece: A Literary Companion (John Murray Pounds 16.99, 228 pages) according to a simple progression around mainland and islands. His style is to arrive somewhere and weave together various historical facts, quotations and references, add a (slightly) longer chunk, and move smartly on. The references are footnoted. The two Byrons - Robert and Lord - emerge as the stars. Bernard Shaw offers an iconoclastic view of the Aegean in an 1899 letter to Ellen Terry: 'Ugh] Cold, storm, sleety grey, pitching and rolling, misery, headaches, horrors of universal belchings]' By contrast, AC Grayling and Susan Whitfield's China: A Literary Companion (John Murray Pounds 16.99, 289 pages) adopts a schematic system, with chapters on 'Pleasures', 'Mutual Perceptions', 'Rites and Festivals', and so on. Freed of the obligation to report from every province and backwater, the editors bring together a fascinating range of material, from infanticide to footbinding, opium to executions, privies to pornography, and much else, not forgetting a final section on communist China and its heroic dissidents. I imagine you can only edit these books if you love the country: here we have no doubt of the affection, with a quote from Lord Dunsany in illustration: 'If China had not been there, this land of dragons, peach-trees, peonies and plum blossoms, with its ages and ages of culture, slowly storing its dreams in green jade, is just the land that poets would have invented'. Jimmy Burns does not just love Spain, he half belongs to it. His Spain: A Literary Companion (John Murray Pounds 16.99, 240 pages) makes an opening gesture to the geographical school with chapters on Madrid, Barcelona and Seville, but then settles for a looser format - 'Jewish Spain', the Civil War, 'Flamenco', and so on. He is more inclined than his colleagues to run longer extracts (though he might have sourced them more precisely) and he has an imaginative choice of authors - Richard Ford, Kate O'Brien, Cela, Montalban, VS Pritchett, Disraeli - as well as the longest bibliography. Best of all in a good John Murray bunch is PJ Kavanagh's Voices in Ireland: A Traveller's Literary Companion (Pounds 19.99, 354 pages). It is the most substantial of the four and was obviously commissioned for the series (and advertised as such), but at the last moment it has been given a different format. The scheme is geographical in the extreme. Kavanagh, a considerable poet of Irish extraction though born and resident in England, travels indefatigably around the island to produce a text dense with anecdote and history, complete with meticulous footnotes. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong emphasis on poetry. It is hard to believe that this task will ever be done better: a book to be carried in the car and read aloud at every pub and crossroads. Its theme is 'the heart of Ireland, hidden, but not concealed, in its writing'. As a second mission, Kavanagh wants to persuade the reader to explore this extraordinary landscape. He succeeds triumphantly. The latest examples of 'Traveller's Literary Companions' from In-Print Publishing are less successful, and I am surprised that Margaret Drabble should describe them as the series she has been waiting for all her life. Japan, by Harry Guest, (Pounds 12.95, 339 pages) is basically a guide book scattered with short extracts and tiny potted biographies. Africa, by Oona Strathern (Pounds 13.95, 524 pages), has the impossible task of including every African country in a single volume, requiring, for example, that South Africa and its literature be squeezed into 30 pages, half of which are taken up with a ragbag of minute extracts: Zimbabwe gets a dozen pages. I would argue that there is a lesson to be learned here: editors must be prepared to run extracts that are long enough to give the newcomer some flavour of an author's style and impact. Anything less than a page is surely an absurdity, no more useful than a Dictionary of Quotations. Incidentally, Ms Strathern confuses VS Naipaul with his late brother, Shiva. Finally, the simplest idea of all: Travelling in Italy with Henry James (John Curtis/Hodder, Pounds 20, 413 pages) is a near- complete anthology of the Master's essays and letters extending over nearly 50 years. The editor is Fred Kaplan, author of the recent biography. No-one would dare to reduce James to snippets.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Nikolayeva: "How To Make Ecological </F> Concerns a Business Subject"]    [Text] Between 15 April and 5 June, "Ecological  Safety Days" are being held in Russia; our city and oblast are  actively participating in this event.    In particular, the recently created public organization--the  Ecological Equilibrium foundation--opened its first  self-financing structure in April, the bureau of environmental  evaluation, whose primary business will be putting together  normative documents for enterprises regarding maximum allowed  discharges into the atmosphere. They will do it in cooperation  with the foundation's partner--the Logos scientific-industrial  foundation.    The bureau plans to offer other types of evaluation as well.  I would remind that the Ecological Equilibrium foundation  presented itself to the public on 1 March, describing as its  goal development of environmental business. This organization  intends to turn money-losing ecology into a zone of profitable  and stable business. The bureau will conduct independent  evaluation and project appraisal and bring it to a "working"  condition by bringing in a broad range of specialists, including  economists.    The first business project the foundation is already working  on will be waste utilization at the Kudryashevo swine-breeding  complex--one of the four largest animal husbandry complexes in  Russia. Liquid waste will be processed into a solid  substance--organic fertilizer. Remarkably, this requires minimal  equipment, while productivity is quite high--as high as the  demand for organic fertilizer.    The next step earmarked for implementation this year is the  creation of a minicomplex: a parking lot, a gas station offering  a skeleton set of repair and maintenance, and a car wash. Of  course, there are quite a few such facilities in the city, but  none meets ecological safety standards. The new one, which is  envisaged to be built in the Krasnoobsk area, will be fitted  with a closed-loop purification system. This brings up a  question: Why was it necessary to set up a public organization  if the problems of ecological equilibrium are worked on one way  or the other by state structures--the oblast and the city  committees on ecology and natural resources.    "Briefly, I can answer it this way: State ecological  organizations spend taxpayers money on liquidating the  consequences of poor management. How successfully--you judge for  yourself. Our foundation is trying to attract the public that is  in some way or the other concerned over the unhealthy  environment, earn money, and invest it in economically  profitable projects and programs, in, as they say, `high  technology,'" replies foundation President Oleg Nikolayevich  Kolmakov. "At the same time, we work in close--one may say,  brotherly--contact with the oblast and city committees."</p>

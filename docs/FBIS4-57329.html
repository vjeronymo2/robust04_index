			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 15 May (ACAN-EFE) -- At least 200  demobilized members of the 3-80 Northern Front (FN-3-80)  peacefully occupied the municipality of Quilali on 15 May  protesting the Nicaraguan Government's noncompliance with  agreements they signed in exchange for giving up the armed  struggle.    Leaders of the extinct FN-3-80 today told journalists in  Managua that Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," leader of  this organization, supported "the occupation of Quilali," which  began on 14 May. The FN-3-80 blamed National Police "Commander"  Fernando Caldera for the expulsion of former rebel leaders  "Pajarito" and "Cascabel" from the police academy due to alleged  lack of discipline. The former FN-3-80 leaders were being  trained at the police academy in Managua to occupy police  positions in the municipalities of northern Nicaragua.    Some 600 FN-3-80 members completed their disarmament on 15  April in exchange for land and credits to purchase properties  and organize a cooperative for farmers. In addition, the  government promised to incorporate dozens of demobilized FN-3-80  members into the police in 13 municipalities in northern  Nicaragua.    The former FN-3-80 leaders blamed "Commander" Caldera for  the  current "inactivity" in the implementation of the government  agreements with the demobilized rebels. There are no reports  indicating that Army troops patrolling the areas near Quilali  will move to dislodge the demobilized rebels who have occupied  this municipality near the Honduran border.</p>

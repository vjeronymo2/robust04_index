			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PICO-KENTER STORM DRAIN EXTENSION OKD  </P> <P> Santa Monica and Los Angeles have agreed to build an underground pipe to  channel contaminated rainwater from one of the area's most notorious storm  drains deep into the ocean.  </P> <P> The pipe, which will run 600 feet into Santa Monica Bay, will be an extension  of the Pico-Kenter storm drain, which empties onto the beach at the western end  of Pico Boulevard.  </P> <P> Pico-Kenter has long been considered one of the worst sources of pollution  among the 64 storm drains that empty into the bay. Pollution from the drain has  forced officials to close Santa Monica Beach on several occasions.  </P> <P> The pipe will also have an alarm system to detect illegally dumped petroleum  and other oil-based toxins.  </P> <P> The pipe and alarm system will cost approximately $580,000. Under an agreement  approved Tuesday night by the Santa Monica City Council, the cost of the  project will be split evenly among Santa Monica, the city of Los Angeles and  Los Angeles County.  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Spandex advances 22% and makes Pounds 2.9m purchase Shares in Spandex rose 35p to 585p yesterday after the USM-quoted distributor of sign-making equipment announced a 22 per cent increase in profits and a Pounds 2.9m acquisition. The Bristol-based group saw pre-tax profits rise to Pounds 5.45m (Pounds 4.46m) in the year to December 31, despite continuing recession in some of its key European markets. Growing sales of sign-making materials and labelling products lifted group turnover 8 per cent to Pounds 59.2m (Pounds 55m), while operating profits moved ahead from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 5.9m. Increased turnover in Europe - dominated by Germany, accounting for 34 per cent of sales - left the group with net cash of Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 3m) at the year end. Gearing, meanwhile, fell from 28.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent after the group cut net debt to Pounds 388,000 (Pounds 4.27m). Mr Dick Bostock, finance director, said gearing would increase following the group's FFr25m (Pounds 2.9m) cash acquisition of Adhebak, the French distributor of self-adhesive vinyls. The acquisition, involving an initial FFr17.5m payment and FFr1.5m payable in three further tranches, will complete Spandex's distribution network in western Europe. Mr Bostock said the group was now considering expansion in eastern Europe and envisaged strong demand for new machinery, such as its 'Gerber Edge' computerised sign-making equipment. Earnings per share improved to 32p (22.5p), while a recommended final dividend of 4.9p (4.6p) makes a total of 7p, compared with 6.5p. The group also announced a 2-for-1 scrip issue.</p>

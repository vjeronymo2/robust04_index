The Bosnian prime minister, who arrived here today to start  a  two-day official visit to Indonesia, told the press that  Indonesia in its capacity as the NAM chairman would exert more  political influence on the United Nations (UN) in an effort to  create peace and sovereignty in the war-torn Bosnia.    He noted that Bosnia was convinced that NAM could voice its  supports and play its active roles in the UN.    He pointed out that the future developments in Bosnia would  depend on the UN agreement. He also hoped that the countries  which had so far supported Bosnia in the UN would maintain their  supports.    During his stay, he will discuss with the Indonesian side  the  latest development about the Washington Accord, and the future  steps to be taken by Bosnia.    The Bosnian prime minister said that the diplomatic ties  between Bosnia and Indonesia will be established soon at the  right time.    Siladjzic arrived from Washington and was met at the  Sukarno-Hatta airport by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas  and Chief Executive Assistant to the NAM Chairman Nana Sutresna.    He told the press about the recent peace talks between  Bosnia  and Croatia held in Washington. Both sides agreed to form a  framework for the establishment of a federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto by by Kaija </F> Kervinen in Kuopio; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] The Finnish Government will this week discuss NATO's  Partnership for Peace offer. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto  was not yet able today to estimate when Finland will decide its  stance to Partnership for Peace.    [Begin recording] [Haavisto] The Partnership for Peace idea  is in itself a positive solution. It strengthens security in  Europe, and in that sense it is in line with Finland's basic  aims. In fact, Finland does not at present have a need for  greater security and we do not need such a treaty in itself.  However, it contains certain aspects, such as peacekeeping  cooperation in which Finland would be a considerable  contributing partner for the rest of Europe. The government  will adopt a stance on this in due course. We will hear a more  detailed report this afternoon on what timetable to follow when  the decision is made on this matter, and this week the  government's foreign affairs committee will discuss this  situation for the first time. I cannot say when Finland's final  decision will come. It requires very thorough familiarization  and deliberation.    Regarding Vaeyrynen's stance, he is no doubt right in that  we  do not need such a treaty, but the government will nevertheless  have to consider the matter as a whole from all aspects.    [Kervinen] Vaeyrynen is taking quite a critical view,  perhaps  because of these drawbacks. He says that there might be  drawbacks from it for our neutrality.    [Haavisto] It is my view that this does not affect the  neutrality one way or the other. This does not mean entering  any military alliance, but this is only a treaty on cooperation  in various matters and as it has been offered to all CSCE  countries, including Russia, I feel that this does not yet have  anything to do with neutrality, nor would this treaty endanger  Finland's neutrality. It is then a different matter whether the  treaty in general is a sensible thing for us, because we have  invested more in the possibility that as member of the European  Union, we would develop European security structures.

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / School start-age suggestion is 'absurd' Mr John Patten, the education secretary, dismissed as 'absurd' a suggestion that the school starting age should be raised from five to six to finance universal nursery education. Mr Patten said: 'I have no intention at all of bringing forward plans for compulsory schooling for three and four-year-olds.' The suggestion was made yesterday in a report from the Royal Society of Arts which also suggested that parents should be required to sign a contract to stay together until their children reach 16. The current provision of pre-school education was 'little short of a national scandal', it said, and called for half-day nursery education for all three and four-year-olds by 1999. The report's author, Sir Christopher Ball, a former warden of Keble College, Oxford, said: 'We know what to do. The question is how to do it. Children benefit from the experience of good early learning. But it must not be done on the cheap, because quality counts.' Mr Patten said half of three and four-year-olds already received some nursery education, and if the voluntary and private sectors were included, this rose to nine out of 10. Labour also rejected the idea of raising the school starting age from five to six.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: A hand for homeowners - A new scheme to help hard-pressed householders HOMEOWNERS caught in the 'negative equity' trap have a better chance of escape after the launch of two schemes from the Woolwich, the country's third largest building society, this week. Up to 1.5m people are estimated to own homes worth less than the value of their mortgage. This has combined with a shortage of buyers and an estimated 70,000 repossessed houses to deepen the inertia of the housing market. Those with negative equity cannot afford to sell their homes because they would be left with an outstanding debt to pay their lender. The first Woolwich scheme (Parent Line) will benefit householders whose parents have substantial equity in their own homes and are willing to use this as security for the new house their child wants to buy. John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, called the scheme 'the most innovative so far.' The scheme allows up to 60 per cent of the value of the parents' home to be used as security for the extra loan required by their child. Interest rates on the loan would be the same as the prevailing mortgage rate. The increased mortgage payments would be borne by the child but the parents would be named as the borrowers. This means that should the child default the parents will be responsible for mortgage payments. Woolwich says that they will only make this scheme available to children whose income is high enough to cover their increased payments and who have a perfect record. However, parents are advised to take independent legal advice before taking on the scheme. Woolwich says about 10 per cent of its 500,000 borrowers have negative equity but it cannot estimate what proportion may take up the scheme, since many may not need to move at all and others may not have parents able and willing to help. Halifax, the UK's largest lender, said it did not plan to introduce a similar scheme, preferring instead to deal with mortgage problems on a case-by-case basis. 'Each individual society is taking its own way to perk up the market,' said the society. Abbey National also said it had no specific plans but Nationwide said it was working on a scheme similar to the Woolwich's. 'Negative equity is the bane of the housing market,' said Peter Robinson, managing director of Woolwich. 'The problem is too complex and individual circumstances too diverse for it to be totally solved with one scheme. What is urgently required is government intervention to jolt the market into action.' Last month, the government attempted to address the problem of negative equity with two new measures. It raised the amount which building societies are allowed to lend on an unsecured basis from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 25,000. It also allowed the security of one house to be exchanged for another against the original mortgage loan, without the loss of mortgage interest tax relief. The first measure is unlikely to appeal to most people. Those who are already in debt will be reluctant to increase their borrowings, particularly on an unsecured basis since interest rates will be higher. Building societies themselves are also unenthusiastic about the prospect of increasing their exposure to potential bad debt. A spokesman for Woolwich said one reason it had devised its schemes was because the idea of lending on an unsecured basis did not appeal to it. The second scheme from the Woolwich is called the Mobility Mortgage, aimed at those who do not want to increase the size of their mortgage but want to move. Homeowners can move house and transfer their mortgage to the new property, as long as the value of the new home is the same or less than the one being sold. Take someone with a Pounds 100,000 loan on a house in Ashford, Kent. The borrower needs to move to Bristol but cannot afford to sell his home because it will only fetch Pounds 85,000 and he cannot pay off the Pounds 15,000 of negative equity. The Mobility Mortgage allows him to buy a house in Bristol for Pounds 85,000 and transfer the Pounds 100,000 loan to it with no loss of mortgage interest relief. The Woolwich says the schemes are only available to borrowers with an 'impeccable' payments record.</p>

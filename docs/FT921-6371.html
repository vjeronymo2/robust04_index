			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (16): Tax may be postponed, not avoided - Offshore and overseas THE TERMS 'offshore' and 'overseas investment' seem to conjure up a wealthy investor lounging in a deckchair and sipping cocktails on a sun-soaked sandy beach. However, offshore and overseas investment are not, as the layman might assume, the same thing. The difference lies in where the institution that handles the money is based. If you buy units in a Taiwanese fund run by a London-based unit trust company, that is overseas investment; if you put pounds into a sterling currency account run by a Jersey-based company, you are investing offshore. Offshore investment will be forever associated in the public mind with tax evasion, and there is little doubt that many people do park their money in various specialist centres for that purpose. The prospect of a Labour government may tempt more Britons to follow that path. But they should know that UK citizens are liable to be taxed on their worldwide income, wherever it arises. Sticking your money in a Jersey account and not declaring the income is simply breaking the law. There are exceptions, however. British expatriates only have to pay UK tax on income arising within the UK. There are thus advantages in them holding funds in an offshore account which pays interest gross. It is also possible to postpone, rather than avoid, tax via an offshore roll-up fund. If income is allowed to roll up within the fund, it will be taxed only when repatriated. So the investor who knows that he or she will shortly move into a lower tax bracket may find advantages in such a system. This could be especially true if Labour were to impose its 9 per cent investment income surcharge. The surcharge would not apply to those above the state pension age, so someone under 65 (60 for women) with savings might find a roll-up fund attractive. The old attraction of offshore deposit accounts to UK investors - that they can pay interest gross - has disappeared now that onshore banks and building societies can offer the same facility. Nevertheless, the sheer range of offshore currency and bond funds gives the investor who wants gross income more options. Those who believe sterling is set to fall, for example, might invest in one of the overseas currency funds; those who believe interest rates will drop could opt for a bond fund. Remember the dangers, however. Although some offshore operations are run by highly respectable companies, offshore centres often have less rigorous regulatory systems, and some lack compensation schemes. Overseas, rather than offshore, investment has very few tax implications. The main reason for investing overseas is to gain a higher return than is available from the UK. Those who favour overseas investment argue that Britain is only a small part of the world economy, so that it makes sense to diversify. Other countries' economies can be surging ahead while Britain stays in recession. Certainly, there have been times when those who ventured into Japan or the US achieved superior returns. And there is a good case for arguing that, as Britain integrates with Europe, UK investors should increase their holdings of European equities and bonds. But there are counter-arguments for staying in the UK. One is that many British companies have overseas operations and thus provide automatic diversification for the domestic investor. Another is that assets should match liabilities. An investor who will spend money in sterling needs to invest in sterling; to do otherwise is to expose himself to an unnecessary currency risk. Even if investors do decide to venture overseas, buying shares directly can be expensive. You will normally have to pay a handling charge for doing so, because the shares are in bearer form and need to be safeguarded. In addition, the nominal price of some overseas shares can run into thousands of pounds, making it difficult to invest small amounts. For most who invest overseas, a unit or investment trust (see letter U) is likely to be the best vehicle. It is much easier for professional managers to monitor these markets and obtain the necessary spread of shares to reduce risk. Even here, caution is needed. A fund which specialises in an individual market, say Taiwan, is likely to be much more volatile than one which covers a wide geographical area. The broadest portfolio can obviously be provided by an international unit or investment trust, but those interested in specific areas can have the choice of funds covering the whole of Europe or the Pacific region. Those attracted by the high economic growth in some smaller economies can achieve a spread by investing in one of the general emerging-markets funds. Investors should realise that overseas companies do not tend to pay such high dividends as those in the UK and that, at least, in the initial years, they may have to suffer a lower income when they invest abroad.</p>

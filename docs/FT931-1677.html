			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dairy Farm advances 21% and launches rights issue DAIRY Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine Matheson group, yesterday reported a 21 per cent increase in net profits to USDollars 177.8m in 1992, up from Dollars 146.8m the year before. The results exceeded market expectations, and were accompanied by the announcement of a rights issue of convertible preference shares to raise Dollars 202m. Operating profits increased to Dollars 159.3m, from Dollars 153.6m in 1991, and much of this growth resulted from a Dollars 12m drop in tax, due to over-provision in previous years. Under the rights issue, one Dollars 1,000 preference share will be offered for every 8,000 ordinary shares held. These will convert into ordinary shares at a price of HKDollars 11.40 (USDollars 1.47), compared with yesterday's closing price of HKDollars 10.40, and will pay a yield of 6.5 per cent. The proceeds will be used for Dairy Farm's expansion programme for its Wellcome supermarket chain in Taiwan and its Franklin's discount chain in Australia. The group's Australasian businesses performed well. Franklins and New Zealand Woolworths contributed USDollars 91.6m before interest costs, compared with Dollars 81.7m. The group's 1990 acquisition of Simago, the Spanish retail chain, is straining financial resources, contributing losses of SDollars 21m before interest costs. Mr Owen Price, managing director, said new management had been installed, and its performance had improved in the final quarter of 1992. Kwik Save, in which Dairy Farm recently increased its stake to just over 28 per cent, announced record profits for 1992. This was translated into Dairy Farm's profits at the average rate up to the UK retailer's August year-end. The subsequent fall in the sterling exchange rate is likely to lead to a decline in Kwik Save's contribution in 1993. The Taiwanese operations became profitable in the second half of 1992, and significant growth is expected. The company recommended a final dividend of 3.9 US cents per share, representing a full year pay-out of 5.38 cents, compared with 4.6 cents in 1991.</p>

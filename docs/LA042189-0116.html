			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SACRIFICES ON A 'FIELD OF DREAMS'  </P> <P> "Field of Dreams" (citywide) is a movie about crazy dreams and impossible  reunions, and it presents baseball as a kind of national sacrament, the  instrument of near-holy reconciliation between the generations. The film is set  in an Iowa cornfield, where an obsessed young farmer has built a baseball  diamond because he heard voices promising him, "If you build it, he will come."  Who? When? Is the movie a Christ fable, a sports comedy, or both?  </P> <P> Director-writer Phil Alden Robinson certainly has his heart in the right place.  He wants to make a film about loving your parents, chasing your wildest hopes,  finding and accepting your past. He wants to heal all the wounds of the  post-'60s, salve and soothe and bind them up. And he doesn't do any of this in  a cheap or sensationalized way. "Field of Dreams" is about as heartfelt a movie  as any major studio has given us recently.  </P> <P> But there's something missing, something tentative and uncertain. In order to  pull off a magic trick, you often have to distract the audience with smooth  patter, clever detail or indirection. And this movie tries to play it so pure  and unabashed that we can see right up its sleeves.  </P> <P> In the film, adapted from the W.P. Kinsella novel "Shoeless Joe," Robinson  tries to create a symbolic fable about the children of the '60s finding their  way back to their more conservative parents via the common ground of baseball.  The farmer, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), came to Iowa via New York City and  college years in Berkeley; an ex-campus radical who parted with his elderly dad  on bad terms. Costner plays Ray with the stolid no-nonsense stance of a casual  jock and eyes that always seem to be inviting you into a shared joke.  </P> <P> It's the right contrast, because everything that Ray does seems crazy. After  the voice beckons him from the corn, he blows all his family's money on the  diamond, setting himself up for a foreclosure, sitting there in the long, empty  Iowa afternoons apparently staring at nothing, waiting for the ineffable. His  wife Annie (Amy Madigan), with a saint's patience, stands behind him. Finally  the mists and the cornstalks part, and a Christlike figure appears: Shoeless  Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), baseball's ultimate outsider-hero, and the central  figure in John Sayles' "Eight Men Out" and, a few years ago, "The Natural,"  where he's the inspiration for Robert Redford's Roy Hobbes.  </P> <P> Like a prophet, speaking in the crepuscular Midwestern light, Shoeless Joe  greets his deliverer, and the voice proceeds to send Ray off again after a  missing writer: who, in the novel, was J.D. Salinger, the catcher in the rye  following the outfielder into the corn. But Robinson abandons the Salinger  reference and turns recluse-writer Terrence Mann (James Earl Jones) into a  bizarre Pulitzer-Prize winning novelist and black ex-activist who abandoned  fiction for poetry about whales and devising computer software programs for  children. Jones, amazingly, brings off this absurd role, cowing us with his  majestic presence, his wonderfully baleful glare and wry delivery. Burt  Lancaster, who can be equally majestic, brings off another peculiar role  equally well, a mixture of Norman Rockwell, Jean Hersholt and "The Twilight  Zone."  </P> <P> The movie invites us into what seems a cracked idee fixe, then suggests that  the core of the obsession is perfectly true: a mystical gig. The Iowa locations  are lit by cinematographer John Lindley ("True Believer," "The Stepfather") as  a flat but radiant heartland, and at one point Ray makes a joking connection  between "Iowa" and "heaven."  </P> <P> All of this would work better if Robinson built up the reality of the town  more, made the citizens a more palpable presence, as Frank Capra did in  Hollywood's greatest fable-fantasy, "It's a Wonderful Life." You begin to  wonder why the Kinsellas get so few non-celestial visitors, why no one in the  area asks Ray if they can use his baseball diamond for a game or two. The  family seems weirdly isolated, and when they attend a PTA meeting and Annie  wins over a book-banning audience by arguing that censorship smacks of  Stalinism, the crowd caves in en masse. It's like a version of "Harvey" where  we see James Stewart and the rabbit, but not the wondering or dyspeptic people  around them.  </P> <P> But should baseball be presented as a sacrament? Some cold, stylized,  supernatural rite where the greats of the past move in stately rhythms across a  perfect, barren field with hardly any spectators? Where are the hot dogs, the  sweat, the beer, the savage imprecations against the umpire's sight and sanity,  the wild frenzy when the tying run reaches third? Robinson trying to use  baseball as a metaphor for America's common ground ends up diminishing, in a  way, what makes it a common ground: the fact that it's a game full of sunlit  frenzy and excitement. He gets the legend of excellence but not the thrill of  combat.  </P> <P> It's a tossup. "Field of Dreams," (MPAA rated PG), like any wild fantasy, will  work if you want it to work, inspire belief if you believe it. The director and  actors -- especially Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster -- are  obviously giving it their all. The movie tries to dispel cynicism or doubts, by  ignoring the world around it, serving up its magic pure and raw. And, if you  want it, it will come.  </P> <P> 'FIELD OF DREAMS'  </P> <P> A Universal release of a Godon Co. Production. Producers Lawrence Gordon,  Charles Gordon. Director/script Phil Alden Robinson. Camera John Lindley.  Editor Ian Crawford. Music James Horner. Production Design Dennis Cassner.  Costumes Linda Bass. With Kevin Costner, Amy Madigan, James Earl Jones, Burt  Lancaster, Ray Liotta, Gaby Hoffman.  </P> <P> Running time: 1 hour, 46 minutes.  </P> <P> MPAA rating: PG (parental guidance suggested; some material may not be suitable  for children).  </P></p>

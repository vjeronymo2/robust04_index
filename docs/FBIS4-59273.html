			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, May 11 (AFP)--Lebanon's central bank has  sold 115 million dollars from its reserves since Monday to  bolster the Lebanese pound, which came under pressure after  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri decided to boycott the government.    Bankers and government officials said the central bank,  which  has reserves of around 2.7 billion dollars, wanted to maintain  the current exchange rate of 1,689.50 pounds to the dollar.    The last such intervention occurred last August, amid  speculation triggered by a major Israeli military offensive in  southern Lebanon.    Al-Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, decided Sunday to boycott  government meetings after plans for a reshuffle aimed at  including more Christian figures were opposed by President Ilyas  al-Hirawi, himself a Christian, and the parliament speaker Nabih  Birri, a Shiite Moslem.    Al-Hariri ordered the postponement of the weekly cabinet  session.    The billionaire prime minister's appointment in October 1992  and his plans to rebuild war-shattered Lebanon at a cost of up  to 12 billion dollars helped to attract back Western and Arab  investors to Lebanon.    But his 30-member Syrian-backed government, made up equally  of Christian and Moslem ministers, has failed to enjoy the trust  of many Lebanese political and religious leaders, namely the  Christians.    The situation has been exacerbated with the recent arrests  of  dozens of former Christian militiamen, including former warlord  Samir Ja'ja', in connection with a February church bombing and a  1991 political killing.</p>

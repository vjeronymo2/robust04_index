Oks, engineer, Power Generation  Equipment Design Institute (Energoproyekt), Kharkov; UDC 662.66]    [Abstract] Now that Ukraine has gained independence, it  must find ways of meeting its energy needs through its own  energy resources. At present, Ukraine's own energy resources are  providing no more than 30 percent of the power needed by the  country. Because Ukraine virtually lacks reserves of gas-and-oil  reserves, it should concentrate on developing its solid fuel  reserves and using them to meet its energy needs. To make fuel  supply as reliable as possible, Ukraine should locate its  thermal electric power plants [TES] and fuel bases as close to  one another as possible so as to create ``coal deposit-TES''  complexes. On the basis of R&amp;D conducted at the Ukraine Coal,  Ore, and Gas Industry Scientific Research and Design Institute  [UkrNIIproyekt] and State Mine and Ore Enrichment Plant Design  Institute [Yuzhgiproshakht] developments, researchers from the  institute Energoproyekt in Kharkov are working to develop ``coal  deposit-TES'' complexes near the Barvenkovskoye and  Bogdanovskoye deposits. The 12-km[.sup]2[/] Barvenkovskoye  deposit, which is located in the south of the Kharkov Oblast,  contains lignite and is suitable for open-pit mining. The  Barvenkovskoye coal is of medium quality and has been  characterized as follows: calorific value, 2,000 kcal/kg;  moisture content, 45 percent; ash content, 13.7 percent; sulfur  content, 1.5 percent; and yield of volatiles, 60 percent. The  mine is suitable for stripping at a rate of 8 million tonnes of  coal yearly, and that amount may expanded to 12 million tonnes  in the future. Barvenkovskoye coal may be burned in boilers at  electric power plants and is also suitable for briquetting and  for coal-chemical processing. Its quality is similar to that of  the lignites of the Ural and Aleksandriyskoye deposits, the  Kansk-Achinsk Basin, and the Yugoslavian and German lignites  that are widely used in power generation. The Bogdanovskoye  deposit measures 24 by 20.5 km and is located in the new  Northern Donbass Coal Region in the north of the Lugansk Oblast  and is estimated to contain total reserves of 1,068 million  tonnes and commercial-quality reserves of 860 million tonnes.  Coal from the Bogdanovskoye deposit is characterized as follows:  average calorific value, 4,362 kcal/kg; ash content, 24.8  percent; moisture content, 17.2 percent; sulfur content, 1.6  percent; yield of volatiles, 45.9 percent; ash melting point,  1,110C; and level of easily sublimed Na[.sub]2[/]O in  coals supplied to GRES, 1.2 percent. Preliminary estimates have  indicated that the Barvenkovskoye deposit may be used as a basis  for constructing a 1,600- to 1,800-MW state regional electric  power plant [GRES] and that the Bogdanovskoye deposit is  sufficient as the basis for a ``coal deposit-TES'' complex that  includes a 2,700-MW GRES. In view of the great inertia of  Ukraine's fuel-and-energy complex, technical and economic  reports regarding the creation of ``coal deposit-TES'' complexes  for the Barvenkovskoye and Bogdanovskoye deposits need to be  completed in 1993-1994.

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Markets: The money engine begins to lose power - Wall Street IS WALL Street's earnings engine, which has been firing on all cylinders for the best part of the last two years, running out of fuel? After a record-breaking 1991, and an even better start to 1992, growth in broking- house earnings appears to have slowed in the final quarter of last year, judging by some of this week's results. PaineWebber, the fourth biggest brokerage firm in the US, and Bear Stearns, another prominent Wall Street operator, reported earnings that told the same story. Revenues from stockbroking commissions were strong in the October-to-December period, but sizeable declines in revenues from investment banking, and smaller falls in proprietary securities trading earnings, meant that total profits for the quarter were lower than in the same period of 1991. Although the disappointing final quarter did not completely take the shine off what was a remarkable 1992 for both firms, PaineWebber was sufficiently concerned about the outlook for this year to announce that it had begun a hiring freeze among administrators and support staff in an attempt to restrain costs. In both companies, the fall in investment banking earnings was primarily the result of a slowdown at the end of last year in the hectic pace at which new equities and bonds have been issued. Extremely strong corporate demand for underwriting services has been one of the key elements of Wall Street's two-year boom, so any sign that this demand my be waning is a cause for concern. Investors, however, are being warned not to turn away from brokerage stocks just yet. If the first three weeks of 1993 are anything to go by, Wall Street's investment bankers are as busy today as they have ever been. Keen to take advantage of a strong bond market, which has pushed interest rates to new lows, companies have been issuing debt in record numbers this year. As of January 21, companies had sold Dollars 28.3bn of bonds, making it highly likely that the old monthly record of Dollars 36.8bn, set in January of last year, will soon be eclipsed. The rate of new issuance shows no sign of slowing down. On Thursday alone, Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co, the securities broking and credit card operation soon to be sold by retailing giant Sears, Roebuck, announced it intends to sell Dollars 3bn of its debt securities. UAL, parent of United Airlines, filed plans to raise Dollars 1.5bn through the sale of a variety of fixed-income and equity securities. The fall in underwriting business in the fourth quarter of 1992, therefore, may turn out to have been a brief interruption of an upward trend. Elsewhere in the financials sector, bank stocks were cheered this week by further evidence that the recovery in the US banking industry is now fully underway. Citicorp, which came to symbolise the problems of the banking sector, led the way with a profitable final quarter, which helped the group return to the black in 1992 after big losses the previous year. Expense reductions have played a vital part in Citicorp's revival, a point that was mirrored at other banks, such as Chase Manhattan and Chemical Banking, which unveiled strong fourth quarter earnings achieved in part because of effective cost cutting and restructuring measures. Perhaps the clearest sign that the worst is over for the banking industry, however, came not from the big New York money centres, but from their counterparts on the Pacific coast. BankAmerica, which recently completed its merger with fellow San Francisco bank Security Pacific, was reported to be close to reaching an agreement to sell as much as Dollars 2bn in bad property loans to Morgan Stanley Realty Fund. Analysts said the transaction indicated that capital is finally returning to the beleaguered California property market, which bodes well for those west-coast banks which have struggled in recent years under the weight of soured commercial property loans. A few days later, shares in another California bank, Wells Fargo, took off after the group reported that its annual earnings had improved more than tenfold to Dollars 283m. Investors rushed to buy the stock on the news, sending it soaring Dollars 13 to Dollars 99. This week also included a stark warning to anyone who invests heavily in high-flying biotechnology stocks. The market capitalisation of Centocor plummeted more than 60 per cent in just one day after the company announced it was halting testing of its Centoxin drug, which is used in the treatment of an often-fatal condition called septic shock, because an unexpectedly high number of patients had died while using the drug in trials.  ---------------------------------- Monday      3274.91  +    3.79 Tuesday     3255.99  -   18.92 Wednesday   3241.95  -   14.04 Thursday    3253.02  +   11.02 Friday      3256.81  +    3.79  ----------------------------------</p>

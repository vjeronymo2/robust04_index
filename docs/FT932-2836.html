			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Optimism over housing recovery MOST house prices have stopped falling and some have started to rise as the housing market recovery has taken root according to a survey last month by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors of more than 100 estate agents. The survey said that 95 per cent of agents reported prices either stable or rising. It warned that homeowners waiting for prices to rise before selling were stifling prospects for a strong revival in sales.</p>

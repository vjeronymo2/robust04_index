			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> VILLA SANTIAGO PLAN IS FINALLY DEFEATED  </P> <P> After more than four years of battling a proposal to develop the former  Santiago Golf Course, residents won a resounding victory this week when the  City Council unanimously rejected a plan to build a housing tract on the site.  </P> <P> The defeat of the Burnett-Ehline Development Co. project marks the third time  in less than a decade that residents have successfully stopped development of  the 37 acres along Santiago Creek, the last large tract of open space in  central Orange.  </P> <P> This time, a coalition of organizations hopes to raise funds that will allow  them to purchase the land and preserve it as a park.  </P> <P> "The system works," said Ralph Masek, president of the Santiago Creek  Homeowners Assn. and one of the leaders of the movement to "Save Santiago  Creek."  </P> <P> "People have told me, 'Ralph, you can't fight City Hall.' But the voters can  and citizens can, if they want to," he said. "City Hall is there for the  citizens, not for the developers."  </P> <P> A crowd of more than 300 people who packed City Council chambers for the public  hearing Tuesday cheered when the council voted 4 to 0 to deny the project, a  decision that followed months of public protest and lobbying on the issue.  Mayor Don E. Smith was absent.  </P> <P> Residents have long opposed the project, Villa Santiago, because it would  rezone the area to allow denser development and would fill in the creek bed,  eliminating what has been called an important flood wash.  </P> <P> The proposal, which would have consisted of 160 single-family residences along  Santiago Creek between Cambridge Street and Tustin Avenue and a seven-acre  commercial plaza, began as a 471-unit apartment complex. After several  revisions, the plan was given preliminary approval in February.  </P> <P> Councilman William G. Steiner, who had voted to approve the project in  February, said he changed his vote because he saw a deadlock between the  developer and the community.  </P> <P> "I didn't think there was any further opportunity for negotiation or  compromise, given the (public's) intensity of feeling on the issue," Steiner  said.  </P> <P> Some supporters of the Burnett-Ehline plan said they backed the project because  they did not believe the council would allow the land to remain as a greenbelt  and they felt Villa Santiago was the best alternative offered the city,  resident Joan North said.  </P> <P> Now, she added, there is no one to take responsibility for removing 22  abandoned homes on Rosewood Avenue, which was among improvements promised in  the Burnett-Ehline plan.  </P> <P> "Who's going to take care of the flood canal? Who's going to demolish those  abandoned homes? Who's going to do it?" North asked.  </P> <P> So far, Burnett-Ehline has announced no future plans for the property, but  supporters of Save Santiago Creek hope that someday they will be able to  purchase the land and turn it into a "passive park."  </P> <P> Howard DeCruyenaere, president of the Santiago Creek Greenway Alliance, said  funds to purchase the property could be raised through grants, bonds and  private fund-raising. However, DeCruyenaere said that some state grants require  cooperation from the city and he felt that it was unclear whether the city  would participate in a partnership to buy the land.  </P> <P> DeCruyenaere said he hopes this week's victory will spark a movement to create  a greenway along Santiago Creek stretching from Irvine Lake to the Santa Ana  River.

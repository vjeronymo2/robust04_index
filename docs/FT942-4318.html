			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Consensus at the Science Museum The general public normally plays little part in the development of science and technology policy. In an attempt to show that lay people can become more involved, the Science Museum in London is organising a Consensus Conference, in which a panel of non-scientists will produce a report on the future of plant biotechnology. Over the next two months, the museum will select 16 people with the widest possible range of professional and social backgrounds, by advertising through local newspapers and radio stations. The panel will meet over two weekends, to define the issues and debate the risks and benefits of using plants in new ways in agriculture, food, industry and medicine. Then, at the conference itself in November, it will cross-question expert witnesses and hold a public debate, before preparing the final Consensus Report. The concept of a lay consensus conference originated in the US and has been developed further in the Netherlands and Denmark. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, which is funding the Science Museum conference, says it will be the first UK example. Science Museum: UK, 071 938 8241.</p>

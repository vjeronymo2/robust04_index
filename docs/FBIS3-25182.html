			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] International aid organizations in Angola have  evacuated relief workers from the central highland city of Cuito  during a lull in the latest fighting between government forces  and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  rebels. The workers are for Medicins Sans Frontiers, Concern,  and the International Red Cross. The government now says at  least 200 people have been killed in Cuito in the past five  days. UNITA had told news agencies it would declare a  unilateral truce in the area. There has been no confirmation  whether one is in force. Peace talks in the Zambian capital,  Lusaka, which were adjourned last week to allow participants to  attend the funeral of the late Ivorian leader Felix  Houphouet-Boigny are expected to resume shortly. Both sides  have said they do not expect the latest outbreak of fighting to  have any effect on the negotiations.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Italian airports face disruption Industrial action by Italian airline pilots, customs officials, air traffic controllers, technicians, and ground and cabin staff threatens to disrupt arrivals and departures at Italian airports this week, particularly today, tomorrow and on Wednesday. The protests are not co-ordinated and have been called for various reasons. Under emergency rules, certain flights are guaranteed, including many intercontinental flights arriving in Italy. Alitalia has specifically warned of flight cancellations and delays between 10am and 6pm on Wednesday because of a strike by cabin staff and air traffic controllers. Some workers are protesting against the Italian government's budget plans, some against new contract proposals, and others against the planned merger between Alitalia and its domestic subsidiary, Ati. Last Friday, eight out of 10 Ati pilots reported sick, forcing cancellation of 113 mainly domestic flights. The pilots, most of whom were back at work by yesterday, object to the Alitalia-Ati merger, which they claim will hinder promotion. They plan an official strike on Friday.</p>

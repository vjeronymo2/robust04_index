			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAJORITY HOLDER OF YUBA IS SELLING TO DENVER FIRM  </P> <P> Bond International Gold of Denver is selling its two-thirds interest in the  Yuba Goldfields mining operation near Marysville to WestGold of Denver, for $16  million and a royalty interest in the mine, the companies said Thursday.  </P> <P> One-third owner in the mining operation called Yuba Placer Gold is Yuba Natural  Resources, a San Diego-based company whose former chairman, Richard Silberman,  was arrested and indicted earlier this year on money-laundering charges.  </P> <P> Before his arrest in April, Silberman was a power in statewide Democratic  politics and held a Cabinet post in then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s  administration. His trial is scheduled to begin early next year in U. S.  District Court in San Diego.  </P> <P> Yuba spokesman Marshall Mintz said the purchase by WestGold is a "positive  event" but declined to comment further on the partnership's plans for the mine.  </P> <P> The mine east of Marysville involves a giant dredge that digs ore from a river  bed at depths of 100 feet or more and which refines the ore into ingots. The  9,000 acres of land on which the mine is situated is owned by Yuba Natural  Resources, which assigned mining rights to Yuba Placer Gold in exchange for a  one-third interest.  </P> <P> WestGold, short for Western Gold Exploration &amp; Mining Co. Ltd., is a  partnership of Inspiration Resources, a publicly traded natural-resources  mining company based in New York, and Minorco of Luxembourg. WestGold's  properties include a mining project in Nome, Alaska, that accounted for about  half the 67,000 ounces of gold that WestGold produced last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Improvement Predicted  </P> <P> Last year, Yuba Placer Gold extracted about 22,000 ounces of gold from the  Marysville mine.  </P> <P> Douglas Foote, vice president of Bond International Gold, said Thursday that  his company invested $3 million in improving the dredge, which will result in a  "significant" increase in gold production this year.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Bond is selling its interest in the Yuba mine because the mine  did not fit in with its "general strategy of expanding our underground and  open-pit operations," Foote said.  </P> <P> The five other mines Bond operates, in North and South America, are either  open-pit or underground. It also has interests in several mines in Australia.  </P> <P> Bond International Gold is a publicly traded company controlled by Australian  investor Alan Bond.  </P></p>

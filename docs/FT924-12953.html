			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Hanson unlikely to be deterred THE DEMERGER defence is becoming something of a textbook classic in the takeover industry. Hanson's response to Ranks Hovis McDougall's adoption of the ploy is that it should be flattered; but it seems unlikely to be deterred from pursuing its bid. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, said that RHM's response 'demonstrates that there is some logic in what we do'. Even so, he seemed to think the RHM three-way split to be a crude break up. 'People do not understand the logic and dynamics of breaking up a business,' he said. 'You need a clear understanding of the positioning of brands and an ability to find the right buyer'. Hanson is unlikely to be put off by RHM's proposal unless the prospect of a demerger pushed the share price out of reach. That was not the immediate effect in the stockmarket yesterday, which gave a much more muted response than when Imperial Chemical Industries announced its demerger proposal in July and its shares jumped 76p to Pounds 11.71 on the day. However, ICI's shares have fallen back since, to Pounds 10.27 RHM's price is still 26p above the cash offer. Hanson need do nothing in a hurry, apart from continuing to work on its offer document expected next week. It was thought from the start that Hanson would need to sweeten its offer. Brokers believe, though, that it can pay 250p a share or more for RHM and still enhance its earnings in the first year. The worry for RHM shareholders would be if Hanson walked away, leaving them without the choice of taking cash. One broker said 'Hanson has got an excuse to walk away, but if it did it would get the reputation of being scared off too easily.' The bid timetable starts from the day the offer document is issued and can then run for up to 60 days, barring an appearance from a rival bidder. RHM's demerger plans will still be at an early stage even then. Hanson could put more pressure on RHM shareholders by shortening the offer period, and putting a 'take it or leave' challenge to them.</p>

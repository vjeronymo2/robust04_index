In response to a query from DDP/ADN, the  Finance Ministry revealed in Bonn on Thursday [13 January] that  a total of 138 billion German marks [DM] was transferred to  eastern Germany last year. In 1994, this sum will fall by DM5  billion to DM133 billion net (DM175 billion gross). [passage  omitted]    In 1991, DM107 billion net was made available for eastern  Germany. In 1992, this sum rose to DM115 billion and was  increased again last year by DM23 billion, according to official  figures. That was the highest level of payments since German  unification.</p>

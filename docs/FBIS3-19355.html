The current conflict concerns the  Aabenraa Hospital issue -- and illustrates the cool relations  between the party's group chairman and its political  spokesperson.    The party chairman is irritated.    The rank and file are irritated.    And the group chairman and the political spokesperson are  also irritated -- with each other.    It is only four months since mutual accusations of  destroying  the party's credibility flew through the air. Energy Minister  Jann Sjursen, the party chairman, had to call a meeting to clear  the air and make sure that all four group members continued to  support the government work.    The background was a number of special communiques from the  group's feminine wing, health spokesperson Inger Stilling  Pedersen and political spokesperson Merethe Due Jensen, who took  turns locking horns with the government's official position on  the law regulating store closing hours, child care, elementary  education, and mental illness. And in so doing they also clashed  with the group's masculine side, group chairman Henning Lysholm  Christensen and group secretary Ole M. Nielsen, behind the  closed doors of the group's conference room.    And now there is trouble again. This time it is the  government's lightning move against the controversial payment  system at Aabenraa Hospital that has divided the group. To such  an extent that on Tuesday [8 February] evening the party itself  considered it necessary to issue a press release on the split.    And once more the disagreement draws an invisible line  between the two women's adjoining offices and the two men's  adjoining offices on the third floor on Proviantgarden in  Christiansborg.    The men support the proposal. The women oppose it. And at  the  same time they do not understand what could lead Nielsen and  Christensen to change their position in the space of a few hours  on a hectic Tuesday.    The reason can be found in the big difference in their  attitude toward working methods.    And this also illustrates the crucial dilemma in the small  party, which is more likely to come in below the Folketing  cutoff barrier in the polls than above it.    Despite their declarations of loyalty to the government,  Merethe Jensen and Inger Pedersen are more preoccupied than  Nielsen and Christensen with the party's "explanation problem"  and stressing party viewpoints for the party's many nonsocialist  voters. Nielsen and Christensen, on the other hand, are more  inclined to regard achieving results by means of a quiet "tough  long haul" as a virtue. That is why they did not take long to  think it over when the prime minister inquired on Tuesday if at  least two members of the group could support the government's  legislative intervention -- to avoid an admission of total  failure.    The difference in their views on method is also personified  by the relations between Jensen and Christensen. The two are  very seldom seen in each other's offices and it is no secret in  the party that the "chemistry and communication" between the two  leave a lot to be desired.    Party chairman Sjursen did not want to comment on that.  However, he was annoyed that they had not managed to stand  together on the Aabenraa proposal.    "That was not smart. We should be able to agree. It is  particularly annoying because the proposal expresses our party's  position exactly," the chairman said. And thus implied that the  group's two women should approve it.    But in spite of the wrangling and fear of the coming  election, none of the KrF politicians disagree on where the  heavy emphasis should lie in a possible new government base:  family policy and the right of parents to make free choices  about child care. The question now is whether an ultimatum will  be issued.    For although no one wants to be quoted as saying so, the  attitude in the small party is clear: The Center Democrats (CD)  got something (through the government shakeup, ed.) -- now it is  our turn.</p>

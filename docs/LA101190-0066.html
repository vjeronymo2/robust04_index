			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HERMOSA REJECTS OIL FIRM'S REQUEST FOR LEASE EXTENSION  </P> <P> Unhappy with negotiations over oil drilling rights in Hermosa Beach, the City  Council this week refused Macpherson Oil Co.'s request for a two-year extension  on the lease that allows the firm to drill for oil from the city maintenance  yard.  </P> <P> The council said the refusal was intended to pressure the company, which is  negotiating an exclusive drilling contract with the city. Instead, Macpherson  was granted a 90-day extension of its current lease that covers its use of the  yard. If oil drilling does not start within that time, the lease will expire.  </P> <P> Regulatory hurdles have delayed the start of drilling, and drilling is not  expected to begin any time soon, said City Manager Kevin Northcraft.  </P> <P> This latest obstacle in the negotiations of the exclusive drilling contract  involves the firm's desire to slant drill into the city's tidelands, among  other things, Northcraft said in a memo to the council.  </P> <P> The shortened lease extension underscores the city's ongoing ambivalence about  oil drilling in Hermosa Beach.  </P> <P> In the 1930s, the city had several wells, but the noise and fumes prompted  Hermosa Beach to ban oil drilling in 1932. By 1984, however, the city found  itself with a limited tax base and little cash. Voters -- hoping to raise money  to repair the city's crumbling streets and sewers -- revived the drilling idea,  and passed a pair of initiatives permitting drilling from certain city  property.  </P> <P> Since then, the project has progressed in fits and starts, with arguments over  how much revenue the city will get from drilling, as well as how much noise and  pollution will be generated by the project. An environmental impact report was  certified by the city, but only after months of study and delay.  </P> <P> City officials would not elaborate on the contract negotiations. Don  Macpherson, president of the company, also refused to comment.  </P> <P> The 90-day extension passed by a 3-2 vote. Councilmen Albert Wiemans and Robert  Essertier, who have represented the council in the negotiations, were in favor  of giving Macpherson the full two years as a show of good faith.  </P> <P> But Councilwoman Kathleen Midstokke said the refusal to give Macpherson more  time was intended "to send a message that we want to clear up the remaining  negotiating points."  </P> <P> The city yard is as Valley Drive and 6th Street.  </P></p>

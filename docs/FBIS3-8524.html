"They will not end today," the premier said, adding that he  expected to spend the whole of the weekend in Vienna. "I do not  think we are in any hurry," he said. "We have to pay attention  to each detail. It is serious work."    The US-sponsored talks were scheduled to work out the  details  of an agreement reached earlier this month in Washington to set  up a Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia-Hercegovina.    The talks were complicated by a decision by Bosnian Croat  leaders inside Bosnia on Wednesday to insist that the  Moslem-Croat entity be formally linked in a confederation with  neighbouring Croatia.    Silajdzic said he had talks scheduled for Friday evening  with  Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic.    He said Serbs would be invited to take part in a joint  effort  to find a negotiated settlement to continued fighting between  their forces and the Moslem-led Bosnian army, even though the  Serbs have so far refused.    "Certain relations with the Serbs of Serbia and the Serbs of  Bosnia will have to be discussed," he said.    Silajdzic noted that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  had assured him during a meeting earlier this week in Moscow  that Russia would do its best to bring the Serbs into a  negotiated final solution.    There was a chance of reaching agreement in Vienna if there  is "enough goodwill and if our friends, in particular the United  States, maintain their current commitment," Silajdzic said.</p>

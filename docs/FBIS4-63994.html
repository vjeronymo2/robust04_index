			<p>BFN     [Text] The Black Sea Navy Command regrets that the  negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian Prime Ministers in  Moscow ended inconclusively. A senior naval officer has told  Interfax that the Ukrainian side did not display enough  flexibility over the issue on separate naval bases for Russia  and Ukraine.    In his opinion, the Russian negotiating team accepted a  tough  compromise, that was not simple to do, as it offered Kiev to  deploy Ukrainian ships close to the key Balaklava base near  Sevastopol. The officer disclosed that the area is the chief  submarine base for the Black Sea Fleet.    "If the Ukrainian delegation accepted the proposal, the  naval  command would confront the problem of submarines' redeployment.  But Kiev ignored even such an offer by Moscow," the officer  said.    In his opinion, the only reason for Kiev's intransigence is  the lack of funds to modernize wharfs, build headquarters, and  develop an infrastructure at a new place.    Meanwhile, he recalled that the Black Sea Navy Command had  already cut electricity supply to some Ukrainian army units.    "If Kiev fails to pay off the debts, the command reserves  the  right to apply similar sanctions to other Ukrainian military  units," he said.</p>

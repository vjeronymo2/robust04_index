			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Probe into Vancouver exchange launched BRITISH Columbia has a launched a wide-ranging investigation into the Vancouver stock exchange in an attempt to avoid further repetitions of the scandals which have plagued the exchange. The investigation will be conducted by Mr Jim Matkin, former president of the Business Council of British Columbia. Mr Matkin has been asked to report within six months. His terms of reference include the powers and responsibilities of regulatory bodies, including the VSE itself, as well as the adequacy of penalties for wrongdoing. He has also been asked to make proposals on the allocation of resources for criminal prosecutions. Numerous measures have been taken in recent years to tighten listings procedures and other rules, but the VSE's image has remained tarnished. In spite of its problems, however, the VSE index has soared by 47 per cent so far this year.</p>

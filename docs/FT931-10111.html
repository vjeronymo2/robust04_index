			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cash crunch threatens to clip Ansett's wings - The airline's financial position remains parlous IS time running out for Ansett, the Australian airline jointly owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and TNT, the transport conglomerate? Nobody disputes that Ansett's star has fallen a long way over the past three years, beginning with a year-long pilots' strike in 1989-90 which disrupted schedules and scared away passengers. A few months after the strike ended, domestic aviation was deregulated, triggering a three-way fares battle between Ansett, government-owned Australian Airlines and Compass, an independent carrier which collapsed under the competitive pressure but has since been relaunched. At the same time, Ansett was trying to cope with a two-year recession which further depressed fares and trading margins, leading to net losses of ADollars 336m (USDollars 225.3m)in the two years to last June. When the airline was making big profits - it reported net earnings of ADollars 184m in 1987-88 - its critics used to say that it was being given an easy ride by the government, which allowed only Ansett and Australian Airlines to offer national services. That era ended with deregulation. But the government twisted the sword last year when it suddenly decided, contrary to earlier undertakings, to merge Australian Airlines with Qantas, and to sell both to the private sector. The privatisation process, which began in December with the sale of 25 per cent of the merged airline to British Airways, is expected to be completed later this year with a public float of the remaining capital. But the damage to Ansett is already clear. Not only does the airline's main competitor now have a strong parent and reduced debt, it will also increase its market share at Ansett's expense through booking arrangements with BA and Qantas, which account for more than 45 per cent of in-bound passengers. Both Qantas and BA formerly had alliances with Ansett. In addition, Ansett faces further encroachment on its domestic market share by Air New Zealand, following an inter-governmental agreement last year on the creation of a single aviation market in Australia and New Zealand. Air NZ is already flying from Brisbane to Thailand and Taiwan, and may begin Australian domestic flights later this year. News Corp and TNT have remained supportive of Ansett, even though both have faced serious problems of their own. However, Mr Murdoch has said that News Corp's 50 per cent stake is for sale if a buyer can be found. Mr David Mortimer, who last year replaced the long-serving Sir Peter Abeles as TNT managing director, is preoccupied with the group's struggle against recession. But he has also made clear that part of TNT's stake is for sale. Ansett has a well-equipped fleet of modern aircraft, and about 55 per cent of the domestic market - including associated regional airlines. It has also applied for rights to compete with Qantas on international routes. Permission to fly to Malaysia and Indonesia has already been granted, and applications for flights to Japan and other Asian countries are being considered. So far, however, the search for fresh equity has failed. Singapore International Airlines (SIA), which bid unsuccessfully for a minority stake in Qantas, has said publicly it was not interested, and so has Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based carrier. Ansett is still talking to SIA, Malaysian Airlines and Air NZ, which was also an early bidder for a stake in Qantas. Air NZ is viewed by many analysts as the most likely partner because an alliance would increase its access to international routes commencing in Australia. However, an investment in Ansett by Air NZ would be frowned upon by Qantas, which holds a 19.9 per cent stake in the NZ airline. The NZ commerce commission might also seek to block such an alliance because of concerns that it could lessen competition in New Zealand, where Ansett is the only domestic competitor to Air NZ. Ansett has been trying hard to get back on an even keel. It has signed marketing agreements with a raft of foreign airlines, including Lufthansa of Germany, Cathay Pacific, All Nippon Airways of Japan, United Airlines of the US and Alitalia of Italy. Mr Ken Cowley, the News Corp director who took over as chairman of Ansett last year, has begun raising cash and cutting costs by selling non-core assets and merging regional carriers with the main airline. Ansett earned operating profits of ADollars 6.5m in the three months ended September, and is believed to have improved on that in the following quarter. But the airline's financial position remains parlous. It faces repayments of ADollars 240m this year on total net debt of ADollars 2.28bn, and has only about ADollars 70m in the form of cash and unused loan facilities. Analysts say it will need a cash injection of at least ADollars 150m to meet the bills. Executives say too much attention is being paid to the potential cash crunch. If necessary, they say, the money will be provided by the airline's parents - mainly News Corp. However, even if Mr Murdoch bails out Ansett in the short term, the airline will still need fresh equity if it is to capitalise on international opportunities and avoid being left behind by Qantas in the medium term. Ansett's rights to international routes cost virtually nothing to acquire, but will be expensive to take up. Some of the airline's Boeing 767 aircraft could be diverted from domestic services to the shorter international routes, but analysts say it is hard to see how Ansett could finance the acquisition of bigger aircraft for the Japanese routes. 'The future looks very difficult for them,' says Mr Julian Mulcahy, aviation analyst at ANZ McCaughan. 'The airline was profitable in the first half, and that may give them some help in dealing with their backers, but they do need an equity injection in the next 12 months. If they don't get it, who knows what will happen?'</p>

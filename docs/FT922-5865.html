			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Chip makers' protection spells buyers' burden - EC officials seeking tariff cuts are caught in the middle of a bitter debate TRADE officials in Brussels negotiating with the rest of the world to reduce tariffs are finding themselves in the middle of a bitter debate between Europe's semiconductor makers and its users - and both sides claim the outcome could make or break Europe's electronics industry. During the current round of multilateral talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the EC has offered to lower import tariffs on various goods by 30 per cent. This offer would apply to the existing 14 per cent import duty on semiconductors. Whether EC negotiators will keep the offer on the table depends on how the talks go. After years of struggling to hold their own, European semiconductor manufacturers believe a tariff reduction is certain to accelerate the steady fall in their share of the European market. Even with the tariff in effect, that share has fallen from 45 per cent in 1978 to about 39 per cent in 1990 and 38 per cent last year, according to Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy. US manufacturers together control about 42 per cent of the European market, while Far Eastern manufacturers have increased their share steadily. A tariff reduction would be 'one more step towards a very bad situation and eventually to the industry disappearing altogether', says Mr Klaus Brinkmann, chairman of the semiconductor working group of the European Electronic Components Association. He argues that the semiconductor industry is a key industry on which all other industries depend. 'Without semiconductors Europe has no industrial future,' says Mr Brinkmann. The EC has been the last remaining economy with a tariff on semiconductors after the US, Japan and Canada suspended their tariffs in 1985. The elimination of tariffs on semiconductors in Europe 'is among the top priorities for the Gatt round,' says the Semiconductor Industry Association, the trade body in the US. At the same time semiconductor users in Europe are fighting just as vehemently for the tariff's removal. Either the tariff, which protects semiconductor manufacturers at the expense of equipment manufacturers, goes or equipment manufacturers themselves will have to leave Europe, they say. Olivetti, the Italian computer and office equipment group, for example, has already moved production of some low-end PCs to Singapore and could move more production there, according to Mr Bruno Lamborghini, head of Olivetti's EC liaison office. 'We cannot wait too long,' he says. 'We have to take a decision.' 'We need zero tariffs,' he says. 'I don't see why we have to support an industry that cannot compete.' The semiconductor industry has always claimed that the high costs of manufacturing in Europe - over 20 per cent more than in the US or Japan - is due to high labour and capital costs which they have no control over. A tariff is needed to create a 'level playing field' with their competitors. Semiconductor users in Europe, in particular the information technology and telecommunications manufacturers, counter that they are faced with the same high costs of manufacturing in Europe. Eurobit, the association of European business machine manufacturers and the information technology industry, points out that the semiconductor tariff places the equipment manufacturers at a disadvantage since the level of tariffs on imported electronic equipment - generally between 4 and 7 per cent - is lower than the tariff on semiconductors. This means, in effect, that equipment manufacturers carry the cost of the higher level of protection provided to the semiconductor industry. 'To create an artificial market is to spell death for the electronics industry,' Mr Lamborghini says. He suggests that European semiconductor manufacturers stop trying to compete in areas where they clearly are not competitive and concentrate their efforts on areas where they have strength, such as custom chips. If they are really competitive in these areas they will be able to hold their own even without the protective tariff. Both the US and Japan are seeking suspension of the 14 per cent tariff. The SIA warns that some form of retaliation is not ruled out entirely. 'Depending on what comes out of the Gatt talks, anything is possible.' The EECA admits that the timing constraints of the Uruguay Round means that the EC is unlikely to be able to make an exception for the semiconductor industry. The options the industry is left with are to continue pushing for an integrated EC policy on electronics while seeking better access to export markets such as Japan. But most important, perhaps, it needs to shape up to meet the impending reality of a less cosy home market.  ------------------------------------------              COMPANY RANKING  ------------------------------------------ By sales (1991)                            Dollars million  ------------------------------------------ Philips Components             1,172 Siemens                          958 SGS-Thomson                      887 Motorola                         770 Intel                            760 Texas Instruments                629 Toshiba                          509 NEC                              452 National Semiconductor           408 Hitachi                          318 AMD                              307 Samsung                          263 ITT                              240 Telefunken                       220 Mitsubishi                       179 Harris                           150 Fujitsu                          147 Analog Devices                   136 Oki                              104  ------------------------------------------</p>

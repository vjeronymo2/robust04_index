			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jacques Amalric: "An American-Russian </F> Failure"]    [Text] The war in Bosnia and the capture of Gorazde,  Warren Christopher said on Monday [18 April], are "the greatest  tragedy Europe has seen since the establishment of the Iron  Curtain." He could have added, without being wrong, that is is  also the greatest American-Russian failure since the breakup of  the Soviet Union. Washington and Moscow, which in January urged  the Europeans to allow them to handle the Bosnian crisis  immediately after NATO's ultimatum to the Serbs to secure the  lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, have in fact allowed  themselves to be misled by vague Serbian promises which have  been immediately repudiated on the ground. The fall of Gorazde,  an area theoretically protected by the United Nations but in  which there were only four UN observers at the start of the  Serbian offensive, is the result of this bluff whose  consequences will not go unnoticed outside Bosnia: Russia,  which flattered itself on having returned to the forefront of  the international stage thanks to its last-minute intervention  in the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, now seems like a rather  unreliable partner. As for President Clinton's United States,  it will have to add Gorazde to its failures in Somalia and Haiti  unless there are later favorable developments. It is likely  that the lesson will not go unnoticed in Baghdad and Pyongyang.    The biggest mistake on the part of the Americans was  probably  to have underestimated their power to intimidate the Serbs by  trying to destabilize them before recognizing them as  unavoidable interlocutors. The first act in this play was the  formation of the Croatian-Muslim federation of Bosnia, which  implied a cease-fire between the two sides and hence the  possibility for the Bosnian Serbs to face a Muslim offensive  aimed at forcibly recapturing some of the territories under  Serbian control. The second act in the scenario consisted of  Washington not demanding that the Muslims give details of their  territorial claims, which was bound to increase the fears of the  Bosnian Serbs who were invited by the Americans,  unrealistically, to join the Croatian-Muslim federation.    It is in this situation of expectation that the Serbs --  those in Belgrade and those in Pale, according to the French and  British intelligence services -- decided to test the Americans'  resolution by launching an offensive against Gorazde at the end  of March. No doubt to their great surprise, they then heard the  American chief of staff and defense secretary explaining that  Gorazde could not be saved by force. That was a huge mistake,  reminiscent of the one made by President Truman when he forgot  to mention Korea in the list of areas representing a vital  interest for the United States. What came thereafter is  well-known: A few air strikes frighten the Serbs no more than  President Clinton's statements trying to erase the blunders of  his aides. [Bosnian Serb Army commander] Gen. Mladic's troops  are continuing their advance on Gorazde, while clearly showing  the UN forces that they are merely potential hostages. It was  known in Pale and in Belgrade that the United States is not  credible because it refuses any presence on the ground and that  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], just a few thousand strong, does  not have the means, the will, or the international mandate  necessary to halt the offensive. Moreover, last Friday Bill  Clinton admitted that by saying he was hostile to an extension  of the war and a modification of the "military balance" by  international forces.    Clinton, like Yasushi Akashi, [UN Secretary General] Butrus-  Ghali's representative, was counting on the presumed moderating  influence of the Russians to persuade the Serbs not to take an  irrevocable step in Gorazde. Assurances of this came from  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev who was in Belgrade on  Saturday and Sunday morning, and from Vitaliy Churkin, the  Russian negotiator, who was in Pale at the same time. But, as  early as Sunday, these assurances seemed groundless. Is this  incompetence or bad faith? Despite the accusations made on  Monday by Vitaliy Churkin against "Serbian extremists in  Bosnia," we do not yet know for sure whether the two Russian  diplomats were simply objective accomplices of the Serbs or  whether they deliberately put up a smokescreen to conceal the  Serbs' double-dealing. In either case, their credibility has  been largely undermined.    "We have returned to the situation which prevailed in Bosnia  at Christmas, but it is worse because we no longer have the  threat of air strikes up our sleeve," a French official  commented on Monday evening. "No abandonment or escalation,"  [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe said for his part. That  therefore leaves the diplomatic path, which is no longer  bilateral but multilateral, grouping Americans, Russians, and  Europeans in a first phase, and Croatians, Muslims, and Serbs in  a second phase. But these are Serbs intoxicated by their  victory and, in particular, by the destruction of a British  plane.</p>

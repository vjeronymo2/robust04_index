			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROLE WITH THE PUNCHES;  </P> <P> KINGS' JAY MILLER IS FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT TO CHANGE REPUTATION IN THE NHL  </P> <P> A chuckle was heard 'round the National Hockey League when, in the same week,  Wayne Gretzky of the Kings took a firm and formal stance against fighting while  the Kings were making a trade for Jay Miller of Boston, a player whose  credentials begin with his records for penalty minutes.  </P> <P> Miller chuckled a little, too, when he read that Gretzky was suggesting slowly  initiating some rules against fighting over the next three to five years.  </P> <P> "One way for me to read that would be to say, 'Great, phase out my job after my  career is over,' " Miller said. "But another way to read it would be to say,  'Yeah, right, Gretzky wants us out of the league, but not until his career is  over.'  </P> <P> "You've got to understand something. Guys like Gretzky -- the goal scorers, the  finesse players -- do not like to be hit. They do not like to be intimidated.  They do not like to be pushed around.  </P> <P> "Take away the physical players from his side, and there are going to be  physical players on the other side out there trying to take advantage of him.  It would take a couple of years off his career if he had to go out there every  night and get knocked around by the Lemieuxs of Montreal, the Tocchets of  Philadelphia, the Mark Hunters, the Peplinskis, the Ottos.  </P> <P> "My job is to keep those guys off of him. I've made a career of it. Maybe we  don't have to drop our gloves every time, but supply and demand says that if  one side doesn't have any so-called 'role players' the other side is going to  get physical with the goal scorers."  </P> <P> Jay Miller understands his role and he makes no apologies for it. He knows  other roles, but he took on this one quite deliberately.  </P> <P> "Believe it or not, I was a player in college," Miller said.  </P> <P> While he was earning a degree in business administration at the University of  New Hampshire, Miller also played defense and all three forward positions for  the college team. When he was drafted by Quebec as a freshman in 1980, he chose  to stay in school.  </P> <P> After floating around in the minor leagues for a couple of years, Miller took  himself aside and told himself that enough was enough. It was time to  concentrate his efforts on a real career in business. He had been selling and  maintaining swimming pools in the summer when he was at home in Boston with his  parents, and he thought he might develop that business.  </P> <P> That was when it was suggested he could develop a career as a role player in  the NHL. After all, he is a strong, 6-foot-2, 210-pound player.  </P> <P> He auditioned for the role by getting into a fight with John Blum 10 minutes  into his tryout at the Boston Bruins' training camp in 1985. When he signed  with the Bruins as a free agent that October, there was no question of his  responsibilities.  </P> <P> In Boston, Miller established himself as one of the league's premier tough  guys. In his third season, he broke Coach Terry O'Reilly's club record for  penalty minutes, getting 302 minutes in one season. He also broke Derek  Sanderson's club record for penalty minutes in a playoff season with 124.  </P> <P> In his first three seasons as a Bruin he had 11 goals and 16 assists. When he  was traded to Los Angeles Jan. 22 he had a career total of 856 penalty minutes  and 33 points -- a ratio of about 26-to-1.  </P> <P> Since he has been with the Kings, the ratio is not nearly so lopsided. In his  10 games with the Kings he has four goals and one assists for five points. He  also has 40 penalty minutes. That's a ratio of eight-to-one. And he's even in  plus/minus statistics.  </P> <P> He likes that.  </P> <P> "Being traded to the Kings gave me a new lease on life," Miller said. "It's not  only a change of scene and a lot of great guys, but it's a winning team, a  chance to win a Stanley Cup, it's all the way out of the division so I don't  have to be up tight about playing against the guys I grew up with, and it's a  team that will give me a chance to play.  </P> <P> "(General Manager) Rogie (Vachon) and (Coach) Robbie (Ftorek) told me that my  role here would be a little bit different. I'll be able to play and protect. In  Boston, it was just protect."  </P> <P> Miller said that his playing time was down to about two shifts a game, partly  because the Adams Division isn't as physical as it once was. He shrugs off the  talk that he wasn't getting along with O'Reilly.  </P> <P> "Any time your playing is down like that, you know to expect a trade," Miller  said. "I was kind of glad when it was L.A."  </P> <P> That is, if he had to be traded at all from the only NHL team he ever played  for in the city where his family lives.  </P> <P> There's no denying he still has a strong allegiance to the Bruins. He says the  two games he played for the Kings against Boston were two of the worst games he  has ever played.  </P> <P> There are those who think that Miller was needed in Los Angeles before the  playoffs began because Marty McSorley might feel the same way about mixing it  up with some of his former Edmonton Oiler teammates.  </P> <P> But what if the Kings were to meet the Boston Bruins in the playoffs?  </P> <P> "That would have to be for the Stanley Cup, and that would be different,"  Miller said, brightening at the thought. "Believe me, I'd have no problem with  that."  </P> <P> At 28, Miller is getting near the end of his career. Next year will be his  option year, so he'll have to decide, after this season, where he thinks his  future lies.  </P> <P> "My wife (Paula) is staying in Boston for now because she has her own career  there, and that leaves me free to put total concentration into playing hockey,"  Miller said. "It's been so long since I've really played much, I need to do  that.  </P> <P> "Everybody seems to think that there are two norms in hockey -- goons and  hockey players. Who says somebody can't do both roles? I've shown that I can  put the puck in the net. I have 11 points. If I had zero, then you could call  me a goon or a cement head.  </P> <P> "I want to get back to playing the way I know I can play. I want to play for  the Los Angeles Kings in the future and be a part of what I know is going to be  a winning tradition. I know what my role is; Robbie doesn't have to explain  that to me. But the thing I like about the Kings is that they can use me the  way I'm supposed to be used and not treat me like a piece of meat -- not that  I'm saying Boston treated me like a piece of meat.  </P> <P> "I'm just happy to be with a team that is giving me a chance to be a hockey  player. A tough, mean, aggressive, hard-checking, maybe even bullyish, hockey  player."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vitaliy Portnikov report in the "Conflict" column: "Crimea </F> Between a War of Rumors and a War of Nerves. The Ukrainian  Prime Minister Has Arrived in Moscow, and a Delegation of  Simferopol Parliamentarians, in Kiev"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The thesis that a Crimean war  would benefit all three sides has become so commonplace that is  no longer a subject of discussion. Everybody wants it.  Meanwhile "everybody" wants a war of nerves, not a real  shooting conflict. It is hardly likely that war is sought by  President Meshkov who has long been unable to find a common  language with his former associates in the Russian Democratic  Congress who now sit in parliament. Furthermore, Crimea's  inexperienced president would immediately become hostage to the  retired GRU [Main Intelligence Directorate] officers he  befriended "incautiously" or such people as newly appointed  Internal Affairs Minister General Kuznetov who in his time was  piqued by the suggestion that he could fight with Russia but  appeared quite capable of fighting Ukraine.    Neither is war not needed to Saburov, his Moscow team and  generally all Muscovites who have arrived in Simferopol to take  part in the reform and therefore in privatization: what kind of  reform could there be now? When guns speak, banks are  silent.... The Crimean parliament might want war as a  collective body but each individual deputy in particular....    The same in Kiev. One can talk about President Kravchuk's  wish to aggravate the situation to the limit in order to cancel  presidential elections, but if the limit is overstepped,  Kravchuk will lose one of his main trumps: the image of a person  who could keep Ukraine peaceful after its independence was  proclaimed. The Ukrainian government could also lose a great  deal in the event of a serious conflict: The Ukrainian political  elite does not need a war. Just as, incidentally, the Russian  elite: A conflict with Ukraine is not confrontation with  Georgia or Moldova; it is hard to calculate not only all the  possible military or economic consequences involved here but  also the international reaction.    Russia and Ukraine in the event of such a conflict run the  risk of losing their image as normal members of the  international community. After all, whereas in a similar  Serbo-Croat conflict in former Yugoslavia there were at least  some, even if wild, historical justifications and explanations,  here no one will be able to find any. Society itself will not  understand or accept this war: Politicians will begin to be  viewed simply as regular madmen.    This notwithstanding, it cannot but be recognized that the  sides stand to gain greatly from a war of nerves, in the course  of which it is possible to resolve some separate internal  political tasks and demonstrate commitment to principle without  an extensive expenditure of efforts or resources. It is only  important that those involved in the high-level quarrel  understand very well the limits of the boundary that they must  not cross no matter what.</p>

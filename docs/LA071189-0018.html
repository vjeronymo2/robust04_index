			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERGER PLAN FOR SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> Weary of "zoning for dollars" -- manipulating land-use controls to compete for  taxpaying commercial development -- and wary of movements under way to fragment  government, the city and county of Sacramento are studying a creative plan for  merging into a consolidated municipality with a population of about 1.3  million. The plan of the Ad Hoc Charter Commission is a sound one and the city  and county should be encouraged to approve it and present it to local voters.  </P> <P> The new government would have an 11-member legislative body called the Council  of Supervisors and a strong independently elected mayor with veto power over  council decisions. This structure is similar to consolidated county governments  in a number of states. But the Sacramento government would have a unique  feature in the creation of 20 local councils with authority to make land-use  decisions in their areas, consistent with the city's general plan. The 11  countywide council members would be full-time elected officials. The five  members of each local council would be elected, but serve on a part-time basis.  </P> <P> Growth management was a major impetus behind the proposed merger charter,  drafted over the last 10 months. There has been explosive growth along  Sacramento's northern and eastern borders and the wealthy unincorporated suburb  of Citrus Heights had launched a cityhood campaign. Charter Commission  officials say both the city and county were tired of competing for business and  commercial development that would generate new tax dollars -- a pattern that  creates haphazard development throughout Southern California.  </P> <P> The most controversial feature of the proposed charter is the strong mayor. One  City Council member said that was too much power for a single official. But the  office would be no more powerful than mayoralties in most large cities in  California and county executive positions elsewhere. The mayor's vetoes could  be overridden by the council. The greater danger would be a collective  executive, or one who was too weak.  </P> <P> The charter commission will conduct public hearings on the proposal this summer  and go to the City Council and Board of Supervisors in the fall for a decision  to put the plan before voters in 1990. Approval of the state Legislature also  is necessary.  </P> <P> The city-county decision to explore a merger was, in a sense, a defensive  action. But it also is a bold step forward that other cities and counties in  California should watch with interest.  </P></p>

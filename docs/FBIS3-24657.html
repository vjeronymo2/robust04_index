			<p>The     long-standing conflict between the Russian Academy of  Sciences (RAS) and the Ministries of Science and Technology Policy  and of Finance took a turn for the worse as a result of several  recent presidential edicts and decisions on the budgets for the  fourth quarter of 1993 and for 1994.  Other prominent S&amp;T  organizations are now joining in the feud, some taking sides with  the Academy, others supporting the science ministry.      Academy of Sciences leaders lashed out against the government  ministries when they learned that, contrary to past practice, the  Academy had been dropped as a separate line item in both the budget  for the fourth quarter of 1993 and the new 1994 state budget.  Fuel  was added to the fire when the budget announcements were followed by  a Council of Ministers decree ensuring funds for the state science  centers, but completely ignoring the Academy (Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA 10 Jan 94).  In what several newspapers described as a  "declaration of war," the Academy's leadership fired off letters to  President Yeltsin and "bombarded the Ministry of Science with angry  calls" (Moscow SEGODNYA 11 Jan 94).  They threatened to close eight  or nine institutes and to take the "extreme step" of publicly  expressing no confidence in the Russian ministers of science and  finance (Moscow IZVESTIYA 23 Dec 93).  RAS President Yuriy Osipov  described the Academy's situation as "catastrophic."  Other RAS  leaders interpreted the budget decisions as steps in the Ministry of  Science's "strategic plan" to bring about the "liquidation" of the  Academy by diverting all science-designated financial resources to a  system of ministry-controlled state science centers (Moscow SEGODNYA  30 Dec 93).      There is evidence to support the Academy leadership's interpreta-  tion of the government's actions.  Minister of Science and  Technology Policy Boris Saltykov has often said that the Russian  Academy of Sciences, in its present form, is one of Russia's most  conservative organizations and can only be reformed through the  creation of a system of parallel, alternative structures.  Saltykov  proposed creating a system of federal or state science centers  funded by the Ministry of Science, which were to compete for funds  to fulfill priority state S&amp;T programs.  The centers would be drawn   from RAS-owned institutes, thus effectively removing them from RAS  control.  The Russian Academy of Sciences and conservative  government bureaucrats lobbied intensely against the proposal, but  President Yeltsin approved it on 22 June.  Efforts to derail  implementation of the proposal continued despite Yeltsin's approval.  (See FB PN 93-451, 7 Dec 93: "Russian Science: Improved Prospects  for Reforms" and FB PN 93-307, 16 Jul 93: "Russian Academy of  Sciences: Enemies Within, Enemies Without.")      The budget decisions appear to be a setback for RAS efforts to  obstruct the state science center proposal.  Furthermore, the RAS  may have lost credibility with President Yeltsin and his cabinet.  Press accounts indicate that RAS President Yuriy Osipov, who has  complained often and personally to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and  President Yeltsin about Saltykov and his policies, suddenly found in  December that his access to the prime minister had been blocked.  According to IZVESTIYA, Osipov said that he was unable to contact  the prime minister for three weeks, even by phone.  "On various  pretexts, the clerks manning the government telephones refused to  put the Academy of Sciences president through to their boss" (Moscow  IZVESTIYA 23 Dec 93; Moscow SEGODNYA 30 Dec 93).      Another media reports indicated that Osipov did finally meet with  Chernomyrdin, who promised him that the Academy would be paid its  arrears for the fourth quarter, amounting to 24 billion rubles  (Moscow Television Network 1700 GMT 21 Dec 93).  Afterwards, Osipov  publicly expressed doubts that the Academy would actually receive  the money, and his doubts may be justified.  A 21 December  presidential edict ordered the Ministry of Finance to "ensure that  the amended expenditures of the republic budget of the Russian  Federation for the fourth quarter be financed as budget revenues are  received."  The edict reaffirmed the very policy which has been the  major point of contention between the Academy and the Ministry of  Finance.  In order to control inflation, the Ministry of Finance  releases funds as it receives them.  Often there is not enough money  in the treasury to go around, and many organizations, including the  RAS, do not receive the amount of funds allocated by the Supreme  Soviet or promised by the Council of Ministers (Moscow INTERFAX 29  Dec 93).      Other major science institutions experiencing similar budget  problems, especially in the medical and biological sciences sector,  are now becoming more vocal in their complaints against the Ministry  of Finance.  The Ministry of Finance owes the Ministry of Health  nearly 14 million rubles, the Russian Academy of Military Sciences  15 million rubles, and the State Committee for Sanitary and  Epidemiological Supervision 931 million rubles.  The Russian Academy  of Medical Sciences received only two thirds of the funds it was  supposed to get in 1993 and is complaining that this shortfall has  disrupted many of its programs.  The president of the Academy of  Medical Sciences warned of a "brain drain" and complained that "a  crisis has come about in the medical and biological industry, which  if left unresolved, will force us to buy large quantities of  medicine abroad" (Moscow Russian Television Network 1700 GMT 21 Dec  93; Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 23 Dec 93).      Not everyone is complaining, however.  Directors of nine leading  R&amp;D institutes addressed a letter to President Yeltsin in support of   Saltykov and the Ministry of Science, urging the government to  continue its competitive financing policy and to bring an end to  "departmental financing. "  Among the letter's authors were  directors of the Kurchatov Institute of Nuclear Physics, the RAS  Institute of Physics, the Institute of Physical Chemistry, Russian  Research Center for Applied Chemistry, and the All Russian Institute  of Electrical Machinery (Moscow ITAR-TASS 1220 GMT, 9 Jan 93).      Likewise, at a routine session of the Governmental Commission for  Operational Questions, First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, a doctor  of sciences and a professor, warned that, while it is impossible to  "live" on 60-70 percent of what the state promised, it is also "an  impermissible luxury to have several institutions studying one and  the same problem." Soskovets said that scientists must reorganize  themselves, because the days are gone when scientists do not have to  account for the funds that they receive or for the work that they do  (Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 23 Dec 93).

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH SQUADS KILL BRAZIL'S CRIME-PRONE STREET KIDS  </P> <P> Cleiton, 12, used to steal from the stores in a shopping gallery near the  center of Duque de Caxias, one of the grimy, violent suburbs on the sprawling  northern outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. He belonged to the ragged legion of  street kids who live by their wits and sometimes die by the gun.  </P> <P> Cleiton's killers caught up with him one night last January as he slept on a  sidewalk near the gallery. A boy called A.G., who knew Cleiton, tells the story  in a few words.  </P> <P> "He was sleeping," A.G. said, "and they filled his face with bullets."  </P> <P> Cleiton's death was not an isolated incident. Hundreds of deprived and  delinquent Brazilian minors are killed every year.  </P> <P> According to people who monitor the situation, an alarming number of youngsters  are killed by "extermination groups" -- death squads bent on cleaning up  crime-plagued areas.  </P> <P> Death squads have been at work for years in Brazil, but concern has risen in  the past year because of the number of youngsters being killed, not only in Rio  but also in other urban areas, including Sao Paulo and Recife.  </P> <P> Generally, young people are too frightened to talk about the situation, but  A.G., a thin, dark boy with shy eyes and fluffy curls, agreed reluctantly to  meet a reporter if two women he trusts, a Roman Catholic nun and a social  worker, could be present.  </P> <P> They met in a church-sponsored center where street children can come for a free  meal, a warm shower, basic schooling and kind encouragement. A.G., in a soiled  blue soccer shirt, faded shorts and rubber sandals, kept his eyes on the table  in front of him and fiddled with a piece of plastic tape as he talked.  </P> <P> "Everyone is afraid," he said. He said he had known "a heap" of youngsters  killed in Duque de Caxias. One was Luciano, 16, picked up by his killers in  January and shot in the head. His body was dumped on a hill behind the  cathedral.  </P> <P> "He robbed stores," A.G. said of Luciano. "During the day he would study the  store, and at night he would go in through a window and clean it out."  </P> <P> Two weeks after Luciano's death, gunmen killed his friend Ademir, 16. "He also  robbed," A.G. said.  </P> <P> There is no doubt, he insisted, about who the killers work for. "The store  owners pay them to kill us," he said.  </P> <P> A.G. has slept in the streets for 11 of his 16 years. He said the killers  almost got him when he was 13.  </P> <P> "I was asleep, and they threw me into a car," he recalled. "They took me to the  valao (an open sewage canal that runs through Duque de Caxias), and told me to  jump in. I jumped and fell down in the dirt. Then I got up and ran, and they  fired a shot that hit me in the leg."  </P> <P> He showed a small scar below his right knee where he said the bullet grazed  him.  </P> <P> "I felt the pain," he said, "and I went running to the train station and the  railroad police. They protected me."  </P> <P> Sister Beatriz Semiano listened as the boy talked, and she confirmed the  dangers he described.  </P> <P> "He lives in the street, he sleeps in the street, and he is threatened with  death," she said. "It is a terrible problem in Brazil."  </P> <P> Sister Beatriz and others who are concerned about the killing say the problem  has its roots in urban poverty, antiquated laws, police corruption and  ineffective systems for providing child welfare and criminal justice.  </P> <P> To survive, many street children turn to petty crime. By the time they reach  their teens, some are involved in serious crime: drugs, burglary, armed  robbery.  </P> <P> By law, offenders under the age of 18 cannot be brought to trial, and few are  held for long at low-security detention centers. Some simply walk away, and  some are let out because of overcrowding.  </P> <P> Merchants, driven to desperation by robberies, hire private security guards,  many of them off-duty or former policemen, who take the law into their own  hands and eliminate criminals of all ages.  </P> <P> In some slums, drug gangs provide security for merchants, killing robbers and  thieves. The gangs fight one another, too, and sometimes kill their own people  for violating strict codes of loyalty and secrecy.  </P> <P> Often it is hard to say who is behind a killing, a gang or an extermination  group. Wolmer do Nascimento, a coordinator for the National Movement for Street  Boys and Girls, which works with abandoned children in several Brazilian  cities, said there are 10 groups, "more or less," at work in Duque de Caxias.  </P> <P> Tiana Se, who is also a coordinator for the movement, said that death squads  hired to eliminate thieves and muggers from tourist districts of Rio --  Copacabana and Ipanema -- often dump their victims' bodies in the northern  suburbs.  </P> <P> Se, a public schoolteacher with children of her own, said the killers of  juvenile delinquents "are applauded because society says they are bandits --  nothing can be done with them."  </P> <P> "The thing is getting worse all the time," she said. "The number of deaths is  increasing."  </P> <P> Official statistics are generally imprecise and incomplete, but several recent  studies show that a significant number of youngsters are being killed and that  the problem is spreading.  </P> <P> One shows that 184 children younger than 18 were killed by firearms in Duque de  Caxias and the neighboring municipality of Nova Iguacu in 1987 and the first  half of 1988.  </P> <P> A private research center, the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic  Analysis, went through newspapers in 10 states and found 81 reports of minors  killed by death squads in the first half of 1989. The institute is working on a  study that covers all of 1989.  </P> <P> Other figures show that more than 110 young people, all under 18, have been  killed "execution style" so far this year in metropolitan Sao Paulo.  </P> <P> Gilberto Dimenstein, an investigative reporter, estimates that killers are  reducing the number of Brazil's young people at the rate of more than one a  day.  </P> <P> In a recent book, "The War of the Children," Dimenstein says that sometimes a  child is killed to eliminate a potential witness, because minors in  crime-ridden neighborhoods "know the names of policemen or bandits involved in  crimes and (death) squads."  </P> <P> In his book, Dimenstein asks a man he identifies as a former death-squad killer  if he has killed children, and the man responds:  </P> <P> "Nobody here asks the one he is going to kill for identification papers. A  bandit is a bandit, whether he is 10, 15 or 40 years old."  </P> <P> Liborni Siqueira, one of only two juvenile judges in Rio de Janeiro, a city of  7 million people, says he deals with 15 cases a day involving juvenile  offenders.  </P> <P> He criticized the juvenile detention system for not giving its wards work and  discipline, and for functioning as a revolving door.  </P> <P> "Minors enter and leave in quick succession," he said. "Whoever wants to can  escape at will." He said some repeat offenders are brought before him as many  as 30 times.  </P> <P> Tania Moreira, a public prosecutor in the Duque de Caxias criminal courts, said  death squads serve as a brutal form of control over a chaotic social  environment.  </P> <P> "When you kill a street boy, first, you take out one of the worst ones, and you  also give an example to the others that helps control them, keep them in line,"  she said. "You are exercising social control through fear."  </P> <P> Moreira said that in most death-squad killings, "we never find out who did it."  No one has been charged in 688 of the 919 homicide cases registered last year  in Duque de Caxias.  </P> <P> Death-squad convictions are rare, she said. Witnesses are threatened and  sometimes killed.  </P> <P> The judiciary is also susceptible to pressures, she said. She showed a reporter  documents relating to the case of Marcio Rodrigues Machado, 15, who in June,  1989, was abducted from his home by hooded men, beaten and shot in the head.  Last month, Moreira charged three policemen with the slaying and asked a  criminal court judge to order their arrest.  </P> <P> But Judge Rubem Medeiros refused. He held that "the seriousness of the crime,  in itself, does not give rise to the necessity of preventive imprisonment."  </P> <P> At present, 27 men face trial on charges involving death-squad killings in  Duque de Caxias. Some trials are scheduled to begin in August, and some of the  people who have been charged are in jail, but others are free on their own  recognizance or are fugitives.  </P> <P> Most of the 27 are security guards, some are petty merchants and three are  policemen, prosecutor Moreira said.  </P> <P> All these cases were brought by a special commission of the state investigative  police. Inspector Eide Trindade de Lima, who heads the commission, said it  could do more if it weren't for the fear of witnesses in death-squad cases.  </P> <P> "People are afraid to come in here," Trindade told a reporter across his desk  in a downtown Rio squad room.  </P> <P> He said death squads go unpunished because the justice system is slow,  inefficient and easily influenced, while "exaggerated formalism" in the  Brazilian criminal code ties the hands of investigators and prosecutors.  </P> <P> "You have to blame the whole legal system," he said. "Our legislation is a  joke."  </P> <P> Trindade confirmed that members of extermination groups are usually "persons  who collect from merchants for acting as security guards."  </P> <P> "Before," he said, "the merchants sought out the security guards. Now the  security guards seek out the merchants."  </P> <P> Rampant criminal activity, he said, is the result of social and economic misery  that turns abandoned children into criminals.  </P> <P> "Since the government is not providing a solution," he said, "people there seek  another solution, which is violence, the law of the strongest. As long as that  (continues), new bandits will appear. . . .  </P> <P> "We will continue to work, but we don't have hope that the picture will  change."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Rat Race: Barbara Bush has revealed that a rat was swimming in the White House  pool with her several months ago. Bush said in an interview with the Houston  Post that the rat "just went by in front of me . . . . I was out of that pool  so much faster than I thought I could."  </P> <P> Hospital Report: Surgeon Thomas Starzl, 64, was expected to be back seeing  patients this week after undergoing coronary surgery in the Pittsburgh hospital  he helped make famous for innovative transplants. He was released Tuesday from  Presbyterian-University Hospital, where doctors removed a blockage from his  right coronary artery. Starzl, who performed the world's first successful liver  transplant in 1967, was admitted Sunday with chest pains. "He's doing quite  well," said Starzl's physician, Bruce Wilson. "We expect a speedy recovery."  </P> <P> His Other Kitchen Cabinet: Dwight Eisenhower, the 34th U.S. President,  apparently had considerable culinary skills, according to Ed and Candace  Russoli, authors of "Ike the Cook." The book includes 32 recipes and  photographs of Ike in an apron. Some of his specialties were vegetable soup and  squirrel stew. The recipes come from Eisenhower's former staff members and from  Eisenhower's archives.  </P> <P> Respite: Embattled Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry spent part of the  weekend with James Usry, who faces charges of corruption resulting from his  tenure as mayor of Atlantic City, N.J. Barry, on trial in connection with drug  possession and perjury charges, said he was in Atlantic City to relax, and he  and Usry joined their wives Sunday at church services. Usry is charged with  accepting a bribe and was defeated in his reelection bid last month.  </P></p>

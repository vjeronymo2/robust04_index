			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Blair puts spotlight on EU steel crisis Britain's lack of credibility in Europe is making it harder for the UK steel industry to win its campaign for a 'level playing field' in the European market, said Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, yesterday. In his first direct comments on the crisis in the European steel industry and UK producers' fight against subsidies made to some continental European rivals, Mr Blair said the UK had to make its voice heard in Europe to achieve the action the industry needed. Speaking at the annual lunch of the British Iron and Steel Producers Association (Bispa) in London, Mr Blair said this did not mean the UK had to go along with everything other European Union nations wanted. However, the UK government's attitude was seen to be 'destructive' and it was too concerned with its own internal problems to be a credible participant in the debate about steel or other issues, such as the Common Agricultural Policy, he said. There is growing pessimism in the UK steel industry about the one big issue outstanding from the European Commission's handling of the steel crisis - the future of Eko Stahl, the biggest steel producer of former East Germany. Last month the UK industry praised the refusal by Mr Tim Eggar, the industry minister, to endorse a controversial proposal for a subsidised takeover of Eko Stahl by Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producer. But the rescue plan, which Bispa says involves the injection of DM1.6bn (Pounds 650m) of public money into Eko Stahl, is strongly backed by the German government, and one UK observer feared yesterday that the UK is losing ground. The issue will be decided in the next few weeks. Mr Blair, in a wide-ranging speech restating his views on industry, training and other issues, said the UK steel sector was a perfect example of a 'modern, traditional' industry. But the UK needed more such success stories. According to figures from the UK Steel Information Service yesterday, annual output per employee has risen to 421 tonnes this year, up 13 per cent on last year. It is the biggest annual rise in recent years, and accompanies a fall in the workforce by a further 5 per cent to 38,000.</p>

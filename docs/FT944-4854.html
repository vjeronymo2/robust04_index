			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Israelis to launch satellite as TV demand grows Spacecom, an Israeli company, has announced plans to launch a Dollars 250m communications satellite called Amos 1 before the end of next year. Amos 1 will immediately compete against the outdated Saudi-backed Arabsat which is due to be replaced in 1996. Mr Shlomo Tirosh, Spacecom chief executive officer, said Amos 1 would be able to relay video, voice and data services over an area from Iran to Libya but would concentrate on Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Gulf. The new satellite will beam directly to customers equipped with 60cm dishes and will carry analogue or compressed digital signals. It will operate in the KU band which uses transponders more powerful than the previous generation of transmitters. Spacecom will lease segments in Amos's seven transponders to Arab and Israeli customers as well as international clients such as HBO, the pay-TV subsidiary of Time Warner, CNN, the Atlanta-based world TV network and Canal Plus, the French media and pay-TV company, who will directly market their programmes in the Middle East. In the Gulf region, three rival Saudis have led the quest for the Middle East's satellite viewers (there are an estimated 1m to 2.5m dishes in the Middle East): Sheikh Walid Al Ibrahim, Sheikh Saleh Kamel, the billionaire owner of Islamic banking group Dallah Al-Baraka; and Emir Khalid Ibn Abdallah Ibn Abdel Rahman, who is head of the Mawarid Group, one of the kingdom's largest conglomerates. 'The Middle East is an emerging market for television,' said Mr Tirosh. 'There is a lot of demand from citizens for TV channels from all over the world and we believe the market will open up considerably in the coming two years.' Spacecom is a joint venture between Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), one of Israel's largest companies, and three other Israeli companies - Gilat Communications Engineering, C Mer, a telecommunications company and GSSC, a satellite venture. The lightweight-class satellite will be launched by a French-made Ariane rocket and will stay in orbit for between 10 and 11 years. It was manufactured by IAI with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany and Alcatel of France. Amos 1 will also seek telecommunications business and provide data, voice and oral telephone on the VSAT (verysmall aperture terminal) market, increasingly used for business communications in the US and Europe. Mr Tirosh said the company was seeking partners in the Middle East to operate VSAT networks and to develop a regional network. Gilat already operates VSAT networks in Israel. Mr Noam Fink, Spacecom operating officer, said Gilat would eventually transfer its services to Amos 1 including data broadcasting. Among the services currently provided by the company are distribution of Reuters and other financial information and satellite services for paging companies. Mr Fink said from January 1 next year the company would operate a sophisticated interactive distance learning network to allow interactive lessons with remote classrooms. A contact to provide these services has already been signed with Israel's open University and the ministry of education.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana -- The development and current situation of  the free press in Albania, based on the experience of Albanian  journalists themselves, was the topic of a discussion held in  the Palace of Congresses with a group of Albanian journalists  representing various newspapers, organized by the delegation of  European Democratic Union -- of which Professor Doctor Andreas  Khol was a member.    Acknowledging the birth of a free press in Albania over the  last few years, the journalists highlighted in their discussions  the existence of a dual tendency: on the one hand, abuse of the  freedom of the press and, on the other, efforts to restrict it.  Some of the speakers pointed out that the media in general was  still politicized, and the independent press remained a small  minority.    It is precisely the latter -- having financial support from  neither political forces nor government -- that is extremely  endangered by the merciless law of insolvency of the market  economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [SEGODNYA report: "Sergey Shakhray To Be Deprived of </F> Ministerial Portfolio"]    [Text] SEGODNYA has learned from reliable sources that  even before his visit to the FRG began, Boris Yeltsin signed an  edict on relieving Sergey Shakhray of his post of minister for  the affairs of nationalities and regional policy. He will be  replaced be Nikolay Yegorov, who is currently administration  chief of Krasnoyarsk Kray. Mr. Shakhray will retain the post of  deputy prime minister, however. All his deputy ministers --  particularly, Messrs. Kotenkov and Abdulatipov -- have also been  fired.    Observers infer that Sergey Shakhray's removal may have been  prompted by the increasing clout of the Federation components'  political elites following local elections. In addition, Sergey  Shakhray's successful efforts to obtain funds to implement  programs for the North could not but encounter stiff resistance  on the part of southern Russia's lobby.</p>

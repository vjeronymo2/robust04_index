			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anders Lehmann: "Police Made Whipping Boy in </F> Narcotics Debate"--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE  introduction]    [Text] The director of a drug treatment center fears that  drug addicts will be victims of neighborhood action if the  police withdraw from Vesterbro. Heightened police effort forces  drug addicts into treatment, he says.    Drug addicts would continue to use drugs even if police  ceased going after pushers. The police offensive against drugs  on the street forces many addicts into treatment.    That is what Jorgen Green, director of the County Youth  Center in Storstrom County told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. Ever since  the 1960s, when hard drugs made their impact, Green has been  working with drug abusers and their addiction.    "The police have been wrongfully made the whipping boy.  People say that police raids on drug dealers on the streets are  responsible for the death of drug addicts. I do not feel that  there is any proof of this. It has not been our experience that  this is what is happening," he said,    "The drug treatment facilities will simply have more to do  if  the police do not constantly make inroads on the drug trade," he  said. Green feels the rise in drug use is due to the fact that  drug addicts do not receive the treatment they need; that their  average age has risen; that AIDS is the cause of a number of  deaths; and that drug addicts are psychologically and physically  run down.    "Drug addicts die because they do not get into treatment or  are refused treatment. The moment the police are on the street  we find more drug addicts asking to get into treatment," said  Green. He strongly opposes stopping the police actions against  drug dealing and pushers in places such as Vesterbro.    "I know very well what the inhabitants of Vesterbro will do  if the police withdraw. They will get hold of some baseball bats  and they will drum both drug dealers and addicts out of the  Vesterbro quarter. If the police leave, they will become the  victims of local justice," he said.    These remarks come two weeks before Health Minister Torben  Lund (Social Democrat) is expected to make a drug policy  statement.</p>

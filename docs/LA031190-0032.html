			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEAN TIMES FOR FOREIGN MOVIES  </P> <P> As the owners of our area's only cinema offering foreign fare for the past 11  years, the last few years have been discouraging.  </P> <P> One problem arising from the disappearance of small distributors of alternative  films is the sorry fact of major distributors picking up small films and  placing them in Screen 10 of a multi-screen theater, overlooking the  independent cinemas that, often, would be a far better showcase.  </P> <P> Benson is right about the disinterest in subtitled films by today's high school  and college students -- the same group that spearheaded interest earlier.  </P> <P> Think back to the last great foreign-language film you saw -- maybe the popular  "My Life as a Dog" -- and we'll guarantee that the last thing you'll remember  was that it was subtitled.  </P> <P> JIM and PATTY DEE  </P> <P> Owners, Palm Theatre  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo  </P></p>

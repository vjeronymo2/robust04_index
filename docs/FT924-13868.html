			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hongkong Land fails to lift Trafalgar stake MR SIMON Keswick yesterday confirmed that his Hongkong Land company had failed to increase its stake in Trafalgar House beyond the 14.9 per cent it acquired on October 1. Mr Keswick, chairman, later met Trafalgar House directors to discuss possible boardroom changes at the UK engineering, construction, property, hotels and shipping group. The positions of Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chief executive, and Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman, are thought to be vulnerable following the Hongkong Land approach and recent shareholder criticism of the group's management. Trafalgar said discussions with Hongkong Land had been amicable but no decision had been taken on management changes, including whether Hongkong Land would be invited to the board. A full statement on various matters would be made in due course. Hongkong Land had sought to raise its stake to 29.9 per cent, but said that it had received acceptances increasing its holdings by only 1 per cent. The tender offer, therefore, had been declared void. Mr Keswick said his company had achieved its objective of acquiring a strategic investment in Trafalgar, which owned several world class businesses. He said: 'Provided the company (Hongkong Land) is adequately represented on the board, its investment will be long term and it will devote its resources to the future expansion and development of Trafalgar. 'The investment in Trafalgar represents some 3 per cent of Hongkong Land's shareholders' funds and leaves the company well placed to pursue other investment opportunities such as participation in the development of Hong Kong's newest container terminal. 'In this task Hongkong Land will be able to call upon the assistance of the wider Jardine Matheson Group.' Jardine controls 32 per cent of Hongkong Land and jointly owns with Trafalgar, Gammon construction group in Hong Kong. See Lex</p>

More than 300,000 farmers and herdsmen have made contracts  to  fight against soil erosion on the plateau. They have made 1,360  sq [square] km of wasteland, half of the land contracted, green  in the past five years. So far more than 33,330 hectares of  farmland have been reclaimed, and trees and grass now cover more  than 670,000 hectares of plateau lands.    Located on the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River,  the plateau suffers from serious soil erosion. Most of the  muddy silt which gives the Yellow River its name comes from the  plateau. About 47,000 sq km of land still suffers from serious  soil erosion.    But with effective measures taken to protect soil erosion in  recent years, less soil is washed into the Yellow River. An  annual amount of soil erodes into the river is now five times  less than the amount in the 1950s.    Farmers and herdsmen on the plateau pay equal attention to  both environmental improvement and economic efficiency while  transforming the wasteland. They build up farmland, plant  sallow thorns and apple trees in light of soil quality and are  developing a farm and sideline products processing industry.</p>

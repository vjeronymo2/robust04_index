			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad vote halts battle THE TRUCE after the four-week battle to take Amstrad private came yesterday as shareholders voted by a clear majority to keep the computers and consumer electronics company in the public domain. Out of Amstrad's 31,000 shareholders, 13,366 voted in person or by proxy with 58.7 per cent against Mr Alan Sugar's proposal to buy back the shares and 41.3 in favour. Mr Sugar needed at least 50 per cent of those voting to back the scheme in order for it to proceed. As the votes were being counted, Mr Sugar, who had already conceded defeat, and most of the 150 shareholders attending yesterday's special meeting, set their sights on the future, and focused their discussion on where the company should go from here. 'Life goes on,' was Mr Sugar's response to a shareholder's query on what he intends to do now that the company was not going to go private. 'I'll be there tomorrow in the office at 9 o'clock.' Any plans for the company were the same whether it remained public or went private, he emphasised. Mr Sugar reiterated the need to shrink Amstrad's operations but refused to specify which particular businesses the company would retreat from. 'We are only going to produce and manufacture products that are going to give us a margin,' he told one questioner. Asked about whether the effort of the past four weeks had been worthwhile, the Amstrad chairman responded philosophically. 'I'm a big boy. It was just another business venture that was tried and didn't work.' One shareholder wanted to be reassured that Mr Sugar would not now sell his 35 per cent stake. Mr Sugar replied that he had no immediate plans but that if someone were to offer him, and other shareholders, 31p, he would accept the offer. Mr Sugar now faces a dilemma. If he manages to pull the company back to profitability and the share price rises, he will be accused of having tried to buy it back cheaply. On the other hand, if Amstrad's shares fall further he has much to lose as owner of a large equity stake. 'I'm stuck in a certain way,' Mr Sugar admitted, adding that he would not stand in the way of the share price rising. But the man who was defeated by a small shareholders' coup, indicated he was not ready to make many more concessions to those whom he dismissed as 'prime karaoke candidates'. He was equally dismissive of the company's institutional shareholders, some of whom publicly slated Mr Sugar for the lack of independent directors and the absence of any financial forecasts for the current year. Amstrad has agreed to appoint two non-executive directors, but Mr Sugar accused the institutions of 'gracefully burying their heads in the sand', when they were offered the chance to vet potential candidates.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Trust up by 77% to Pounds 1.04m ABERDEEN TRUST, the fund management company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 77 per cent, from Pounds 584,000 to Pounds 1.04m, for the half year to March 31. The improvement, however, reflected the elimination of exceptional costs. Operating profits dipped from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 1.04m. Earnings per share were 0.97p (0.75p); the interim dividend is unchanged at 1p. Mr George Robb, chairman, said that Cheval Investment Management, which manages fixed interest funds for clients of Lloyd's of London, increased funds under management by Pounds 75m to Pounds 400m as Lloyd's acquired new clients. Funds under group management were Pounds 1.1bn at the period end, compared with Pounds 775m on September 30 1991. Unlike most Scottish fund management groups which prefer to centralise their fund management function, Aberdeen yesterday opened an office in Singapore to manage funds in south-east Asian companies and assist marketing to clients in the region.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Chemical cargo caution by DoT CHEMICAL cargoes may be inadequately insured against disaster, a senior civil servant warned yesterday. Department of Transport official Mr Frank Wall was giving evidence to the Donaldson inquiry into the Braer oil disaster off Shetland. The maximum liability is between Pounds 2.3m and Pounds 30m compared with Pounds 129m available after a serious oil spill. Mr Wall said the government was frustrated by the lack of progress towards an international agreement in spite of 20 years of diplomatic wrangling. He warned that the world seemed to be waiting for the chemical equivalent of an accident like the Titanic or the Amoco Cadiz before acting. A draft convention is being considered by the International Maritime Organisation but it is hampered by the definition of hazardous cargo and whetherthat should cover material in bulk or in packages. The London hearing was told that 400 claims were lodged after the Braer spill, and 244 had been settled by the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund. Slightly more than Pounds 10m had been paid out.</p>

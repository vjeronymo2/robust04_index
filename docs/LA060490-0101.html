			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOOKED ON A LIFESTYLE;  </P> <P> FISHING, CARDS AND CAMARADERIE ARE LURES RETIREE CAN'T RESIST  </P> <P> He clocks in punctually each day a bit before noon, bearing the tools of his  trade. A fishing pole is in one hand, an old scuffed tackle box in the other.  He sports a plaid flannel shirt, baggy blue jeans and a dirt-smudged, canvas  hat with a thin twine of dock rope stitched to the brim and gold portholes on  the sides.  </P> <P> Gene Peach has arrived. As he does four or five days a week, the 75-year-old  retiree steps aboard the charter fishing boat Western Pride, docked at Davey's  Locker on the Balboa Peninsula, and prepares for an afternoon on the water.  </P> <P> Time to go after some bonito, a barracuda or two, or a few calico bass. During  the jaunt in and out to the fishing spots, Peach and his buddies will also deal  a few dozen rounds of seven-card stud, nickel a hand, and high spade in the  hole splits the pot.  </P> <P> These are the common sights of summer, the fishing charters heading out of  Newport Harbor loaded with a cargo of tourists and locals armed with fishing  rods and hopes of snagging that behemoth we all know lurks beneath the choppy  swells. But none is more regular than Peach and his gang, an avuncular  contingent of fishermen who know the waters off Orange County like they know  their grandkids. Maybe better.  </P> <P> Peach has been doing this for about a decade, heading out on the Western Pride  every weekday, skipping the weekends when too many teen-agers and landlubbers  clog the boat's wooden rails. His post-retirement stint aboard the charter boat  represents just a fraction of his fishing career. Peach has been angling the  local waters since he was 10.  </P> <P> He looks the part of the old man and the sea. Deep lines crease his face, a  bushy white mustache rests below wire-rimmed glasses. His hands are thick and  stubby, callused from the years.  </P> <P> By the time the Western Pride's engines roared to life and the boat swung away  from the dock, Peach and his cohorts were huddled around one of the booths in  the cafeteria below deck, playing poker.  </P> <P> As the Western Pride lunged across the waves, the cards were dealt hard and  fast. Nickels and quarters flew. And the table listed decidedly toward Claude  Wright, a gregarious retired Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy affectionately  known as "the Sheriff" while aboard the Western Pride. Wright was winning most  of the nickels this day.  </P> <P> "It'll change. It'll change," Peach muttered, peering at his fan of cards from  a corner of the booth.  </P> <P> Nearby, Jeanne Harris settled into a booth to watch the game and offer up some  homemade brownies she had brought aboard for the men.  </P> <P> "They're all characters, but really nice guys," said Harris, a Corona del Mar  resident who spends one afternoon a week fishing on the Western Pride with her  husband John. "None of them are foul-mouthed or anything."  </P> <P> But they are competitive when it comes to fishing. Harris recalled how it stuck  in the craw of Peach and the rest when she returned from a trip off Key West,  Fla., having reeled in a record 46-pound fish.  </P> <P> "Of course they didn't talk to me for a while after that," she said, "But they  got over it."  </P> <P> Peach kept getting lousy cards, so he turned his attention to talking fishing.  He's done it all -- the ocean, lakes, streams -- and remembers the way it was  in the old days, "before everything was fished out."  </P> <P> A week earlier he returned from a trout fishing trip among the lakes flanking  Mt. Shasta. But he much prefers the ocean to fly fishing in some mountain  brook. "It's close and convenient," Peach said. "I live in Huntington Beach,  only about 10 miles up the coast from here. Anyway, I'm too old for that  mountain stuff. It's too cold."  </P> <P> Suddenly, the boat slowed. Peach and his buddies jumped up from the table.  "Here we are!" Peach said, scurrying up the ladder and out the hatch like a man  several springs younger. There were fish to be caught.  </P> <P> Left in their wake to clean the table of discarded beer cans was Fran Maxwell,  the boat's fry chef. "The regulars like Gene, I just really love them," she  said. "They're all like grandfathers to me. The old stories they tell you, of  how it was 25, 35 years ago. All the construction, it scares them. They feel  like they're being pushed away."  </P> <P> The boat motored slowly, trolling for just the right spot. Capt. Bob Ezell  scanned an electronic fish-finding scope, hunting for the bright red blob that  would indicate a school directly below. At the stern, deckhand Mike Hennessy  chucked handfuls of live anchovies he pulled with a small net from a big  storage tank.  </P> <P> Then someone spotted a fish flop off in the distance. "They're jumping back  there!"  </P> <P> "They're boiling, Mike," someone else yelled.  </P> <P> The deck was abuzz with activity. Captain Bob swung the boat around, while  Peach and the rest grabbed their poles and began casting off in all directions.  </P> <P> Jim Orstad, 68, stood just off Peach's right elbow, and within a minute he  pulled a hefty bonito from the sea. A few minutes later, Orstad pulled up  another fish, its silver and turquoise sides gleaming in the sunlight. A smile  lighted Orstad's face.  </P> <P> Peach, meanwhile, was being shut out. He shook his head and muttered something.  This, obviously, was getting hard to take. But within 10 minutes, no one was  catching fish, not even Orstad.  </P> <P> "OK boys and girls, time to go," Ezell announced over the boat's public address  system. "The fish took off and left us. That's the way it's been all day."  </P> <P> As Peach reeled in his line and the boat set off for new waters, the Sheriff  scampered over to console him. Friends could see Peach was mildly irked that  the fish were avoiding his hook.  </P> <P> Several times a week, Peach wins the fishing derby held each day aboard the  Western Pride (the boat's scrapbook has a picture of him holding two salmon,  one of them a 25-pound whopper he caught off Orange County in April). Each  participant pays $3 to enter the contest, and the angler who catches the  biggest fish takes the pot. Today nearly $70 was at stake, and Peach was off to  a bad start.  </P> <P> "He's got a reputation as the man with the most jackpots," said the Sheriff.  </P> <P> "Yeah, you can see how good I'm doing today," Peach muttered.  </P> <P> The Sheriff ignored this. "They call him Gene the fishing machine," he said  with a grin. "Jackpot Gene."  </P> <P> Even Peach, a no-nonsense guy who normally wears a poker face, smiled.  </P> <P> "There's no rhyme or reason to the fish," he said. "There's a little skill to  it, but not particularly this type of fishing. This is just finding schools of  fish and having them hit your hook."  </P> <P> Peach didn't always spend afternoons fishing. For 45 years he was a truck  driver, running loads of gasoline, diesel and propane from refineries. He never  had an accident.  </P> <P> Last Dec. 26, he and wife Eileen celebrated their 50th year of marriage. After  all the years, she still approves of his afternoons on the water. "She knows  I'm not chasing around somewhere, not sitting in a bar . . . ," Peach says.  "The secret of marriage, I think, is the longer you're away from one another  the better."  </P> <P> After a few more attempts to find a flock of fish in deep water, Capt. Bob gave  up and headed toward shore. The crew set anchor south of Crystal Cove just a  few hundred yards offshore, and the fishermen cast from the stern. They should  have good luck with calico bass in this spot, the captain explained over the  loudspeaker.  </P> <P> Jeff Patrick, relief captain and deckhand, teased Peach by nudging his rod from  behind, simulating a fish nibbling on the other end. Peach didn't even turn,  just muttered, "Keep it up and I'll throw you in the water."  </P> <P> Your luck will change, Gene. It'll change.  </P> <P> Indeed, on his first cast Peach reeled in a fat little calico. "Yeah, he caught  a fish, he caught a fish," chanted Patrick, seizing the opportunity to josh the  old fisherman.  </P> <P> Pulling out the hook with a pair of pliers, Peach tossed the fish back in the  water. It was not a keeper.  </P> <P> "Most of them I don't throw back I give away," he said. "I give them to people  on the boat, people who don't catch any fish. I eat bass maybe one day a week,  that's it."  </P> <P> For the next half hour, Peach pulled in fish on nearly every cast. His luck  continued on the trip back to port. The cards turned friendly, and he took hand  after hand in poker.  </P> <P> What lures Peach to this boat and this stretch of ocean are the people, the  camaraderie, the feel of a fish hitting his line like a lightning bolt under  the waves.  </P> <P> "It's the companionship, the poker game, not getting bored riding in and out,"  he allows. "And it's just the thrill of hooking a fish. It's just still a  thrill to me."  </P></p>

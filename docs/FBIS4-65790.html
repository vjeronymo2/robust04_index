			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Erkki Paanannen: "Niinisalo Artillery Brigade </F> Would Take All Reservists"]    [Text] Kankaanpaa -- During their formulation, the rank and  file heard only bits and pieces of information on the  reorganization plans for the Armed Forces. A description of the  situation is given in the comment by Major General Hannu Sarkio,  commander of the Turku-Pori Military Province, after the  official news release: "A sigh of relief is being breathed in  many a unit today."    The artillery brigade in Niinisalo is one of the units that  is satisfied with the results. "We are especially pleased with  the description: a large and multipurpose training center," said  Colonel Esa Tarvainen, the brigade commander. "We have already  begun developing in that direction."    The artillery brigade trains almost half of the artillery  conscripts, and the Kankaanpaa Battery trains approximately 70  percent of the reservists with this military occupation  specialty. This is about 2,000 men annually in each group.    "Already at this time we could train all of the artillery  reservists, or about 3,000 men per year," said Tarvainen.    Niinisalo was changed into a training center last year when  all of the units at the base were consolidated into an artillery  brigade. There are about 500 persons on duty there, and that is  sufficient for the current mission.    The changes will be toughest for instructors at the UN  training center operated under the supervision of the Defense  Ministry. The responsibility for training international military  observers, for example, has grown enormously. When the course  was initiated, there was one class per year, and now a total of  200 officers in five different classes are trained yearly.    The biggest problems for the brigade involve maintenance and  supply. The buildings are old, built at various times, and  operating the mess hall and the central warehouse, for example,  is expensive.    Building a mess hall is in the ministry's plan. Tarvainen  estimates that modernizing supply and maintenance facilities  will cut expenses considerably, and that as many as 30 persons  could be transferred from maintenance to training duties.</p>

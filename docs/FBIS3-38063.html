He stressed that the U.S. mass media misinterpreted his  statement on the Ames affair at the press conference on February  26. "Such misinterpretations pursue one unseemly objective -- to  get confirmation of the assumption that the CIA officer and his  wife cooperated with the Soviet and Russian intelligence  services".</p>

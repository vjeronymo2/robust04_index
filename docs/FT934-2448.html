			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / People: Movement at Midland Unilever executive director Charles Miller Smith, who was in the running for the chief executive's job at Barclays Bank, has finally found a seat in a clearing bank boardroom. He has been appointed a non-executive director of Midland Bank, the UK arm of HSBC Holdings. Miller Smith, 54, is a main board director of Unilever where he has executive responsibility for food activities in Southern Europe. He is thought to be one of the two front-runners to take over the chairmanship of the British arm of Unilever when the current incumbent, Mike Perry, retires in about three years' time. Miller Smith, who is also a non-executive director of ICI, replaces Charles Mackay, chief executive of Inchcape, who joined the Midland board in November 1992. Mackay, 53, will continue as a non-executive director of Midland's parent HSBC Holdings. Meanwhile, John Skae, 57, Midland's company secretary since 1985, retires at the end of the year. Ralph Barber, 42, HSBC's company secretary, will assume the additional responsibility as company secretary of Midland Bank.</p>

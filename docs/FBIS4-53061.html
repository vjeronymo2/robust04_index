			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, general secretary of </F> Komeito, by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date  not given]    [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What are your plans for dealing  with the Diet?    [Ichikawa] There are now so many issues to be dealt with by  Japan, such as expanding domestic demand, market liberalization,  and the suspected DPRK (North Korea) nuclear arms program.  These problems are difficult to deal with regardless of who is  in the cabinet. We are a minority in the Diet, but I think we  should find a way through--by making efforts to turn the cabinet  into one which is supported by the public.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] There is some talk about the possibility of  the House of Representatives being dissolved soon.    [Ichikawa] I expect many issues to be raised in the course  of the Diet deliberations on the budget bill, but I do not think  that will trigger dissolution of the house. Dissolution of the  house or the resignation en masse of the cabinet can be  considered only when the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] presents  a motion of no confidence in the cabinet, and the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] supports it. But if that  happens, I would like to ask this question--what is the  justification for it? If the SDPJ decides to cooperate in the  motion, that will only mean the political regime of 1955 will be  revived.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think about the possibility of  the next general election being conducted under the current  medium electoral district system?    [Ichikawa] The next general election should be held under  the new single-seat district system combined with the  proportional representation system. After all, the political  reform bills were passed with the approval of both the LDP and  the SDPJ. SDPJ Chairman Murayama recently said, "the general  election should be held under the current system after an  agreement is made on the zoning of the single-seat districts."  What he said can be interpreted as meaning he wants to crush  political reform and revert to the original state. If that  happens, it will constitute an act of blackmailing the people.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] When do you want the bill on zoning of the  single-seat districts to be enacted?    [Ichikawa] We will try to get it passed at the current  session of the Diet. We must not ignore the intentions of the  review council, but we should hasten to get ready so that the  lower house can be dissolved for an election under the new  system.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Now that the SDPJ has left the coalition,  will the concept for "another new party" envisaged by Komeito  undergo a change?    [Ichikawa] If it is assumed that the next general election  will be held under the new election system, another new party is  a necessity. There is no change in my belief that two political  forces should compete for government power.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The bases for political world reorganization  are becoming fragile.    [Ichikawa] Under the existing tripolar structure, it will be  a minority government regardless of which party assumes power.  If the LDP and the SDPJ agree on a coalition, it would be  tantamount to the two parties committing suicide. The key is  how the public will judge and decide to act if it turns out that  a ruling party cannot perform its tasks because it is a minority  in power.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you have a "next move" aimed at changing  the situation?    [Ichikawa] I do not have any particular plan. We do not  need to raise issues from our side. When a major problem does  arise, people concerned about the problem will speak up. We  must face problems squarely and not play tricks.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] You severely criticized remarks by former  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano about the Nanjing massacre.    [Ichikawa] If you consider the war not simply as a  Japan-U.S.  war, but as a 15-year war that started with the Manchurian  conflict in 1931, the nature of aggression of the war becomes  clear. There is no question that Japan invaded Asian countries  to reign over them.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] That view differs from the view on history  of some of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] members.    [Icikawa] There may be differences. If Japan wants to live  in the international community, however, the country cannot gain  the understanding of the Asian countries unless it does some  soul-searching and recognizes the past war as a war of  aggression. I feel so strongly about that I believe it cannot  be helped even if our party's relationship with Shinseito is  jeopardized over differences of this historic view in the future.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What are the prospects for holding talks on  the tax system reform question?    [Ichikawa] We will need to come up with a conclusion on  consistent policy direction. A tax system reform has become a  sort of international commitment. The way for the cabinet to  survive is to come up with that conclusion.</p>

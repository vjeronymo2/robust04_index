			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Marie-France Cros report: "An Anti-Belgian Campaign"] </F>   [Excerpt] Belgium is currently the target of a campaign of  denigration in Rwanda. How has this happened?    Our country supplies half of the contingent of Blue Helmets  currently in Rwanda to help the implementation of the Arusha  peace plan. However, the document does not please everybody and  particularly not the supporters of the National Republican  Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND), the former single  party. Indeed, the latter have never completely abandoned their  conviction that the best possible outcome to the war started in  1990 by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) guerrillas was a  military victory which the government army had failed to secure.  Thus any compromise required by the peace negotiations is seen,  in these conservative ranks, as a concession to the enemy.  <H5>  Human Rights </H5>   For instance, the conservatives do not like Brussels'  insistence on reaffirming the duty to respect human rights,  although these reminders have concerned all sides in the  conflict.    Similarly, they have often criticized Belgium for having  withdrawn after one month the soldiers sent at the beginning of  the war to ensure the evacuation of our fellow citizens who  wanted to leave the country in October 1990, unlike the French  who left their men until the Blue Helmets arrived last December.  The French presence made it easier for the Rwandan Government  Army to withstand the thrust of the FPR which, without that,  "diplomatic circles say," would have reached Kigali by force of  arms.  <H5>  Bitterness </H5>   It is easy to see the bitterness which this inability to  ensure a military victory for their ideas is creating in many  MRND supporters for whom the FPR is synonymous with Tutsis which  is synonymous with monarchy.    It must be remembered that the FPR was created by Tutsi (the  minority ethnic group) exiles in Uganda, although it now has in  its ranks an unspecified number of Hutus, like its President  Alexis Kanyerengwe. Moreover, since independence and the  abolition of the monarchy "with Belgium's help," the country's  past is seen in Rwanda as uniformly equal to what it had become  in the last years of colonization: A feudal-type kingdom in  which the Tutsi chiefs oppressed the Hutu peasants.    As soon as the Blue Helmets arrived, the Belgians, who form  half of them, were therefore the target of a campaign of  denigration by Rwandan conservatives, especially since, in  accordance with the peace plan, they escorted to Kigali an FPR  battalion responsible for the protection of that party's future  ministers.

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Paris acts on corruption law THE French government yesterday took action to push an anti-corruption law through parliament in an attempt to clean up the ruling Socialists' image before next spring's legislative elections. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy won cabinet approval to turn final passage of the law, which in its original draft would ban all corporate contributions to political parties, into a general vote of confidence in the government. Mr Beregovoy can now deem the law to have passed the National Assembly, unless the opposition brings down the government with a censure motion. This ruse is largely designed to whip back into line Socialist deputies, who in Tuesday's initial debate on the anti-corruption law showed themselves as averse as the opposition to seeing corporate donations to their party coffers dry up. French business, since the Socialists first won power in 1981, has been hedging its bets by giving money to the left as well as the right. Mr Beregovoy said on Tuesday that the bill was open to amendment, and its likely thrust will be just to restrict corporate campaign contributions and to ensure they are made public. The bill is largely a reaction to the indictment of Mr Henri Emmanuelli, the National Assembly president, involving alleged irregular fund-raising by the Socialists. Other elements of the law seek to put an end to the widespread practice of local politicians receiving backhanders from public contractors and from companies in search of building and trading permits. Nearly two-thirds of French voters want Socialist President Francois Mitterrand to step down if the centre-right opposition wins parliamentary elections next March, an opinion poll released yesterday showed, Reuter reports from Paris. The poll, conducted by the BVA organisation for the weekly Paris-Match, showed 62 per cent of the French wanted him out of office if, as most polls predict, the Socialists are crushed in March.

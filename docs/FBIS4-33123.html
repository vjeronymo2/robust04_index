			<p>BFN     [Text] President Eduardo Frei today confirmed that within  four weeks' time he will travel to Washington at the invitation  of U.S. President Bill Clinton.    It had been rumored in Washington that Clinton was  interested  in inviting his Chilean counterpart to a meeting at the White  House.    Today in Santiago, President Frei confirmed the invitation  to  visit the United States at the end of the month.    [Begin Frei recording] Well, we are awaiting the official  announcement by the White House and by the Chilean Foreign  Ministry of a visit to Washington on 28 June, a visit that will  include a working day with President Clinton at the White House.  [end recording]    In Washington, Patricio Silva, Chilean ambassador to the  United States, reported that the agenda of the meeting will  include political issues, but that Chile's overriding interest  will be the possibility of joining NAFTA.    [Begin Silva recording] It is a clear indication of the  Clinton administration's interest in Latin America--which is  expressed in this invitation made to the president--and  especially in Chile. As you very well know, Chile's presence in  U.S. news, public opinion, and political opinion is quite  considerable. [end recording]</p>

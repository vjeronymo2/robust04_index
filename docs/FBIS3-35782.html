Kozyrev Will Bring Back From China"]    [Text] Beijing -- Andrey Kozyrev's three-day visit to  China, which ends today, cannot be called too strenuous. Our  foreign minister's talks with Qian Qichen, his Chinese  colleague, took up only approximately 90 minutes. Then came a  brief lecture for Chinese political experts, two very brief  meetings with PRC State Council Premier Li Peng and PRC  President Jiang Zemin, and the traditional news conference for  journalists.    The chief result of the visit evidently should not be  regarded at all as the agreements signed here on crossing points  in the border region or the protocol on consultations between  the two countries' foreign policy departments but Kozyrev's very  appearance in Beijing, which interrupted the succession of  cancellations and postponements and confirmed Russia's desire  and ability to tackle in earnest the building of relations with  a great neighbor. Kozyrev assured Beijing that "the president's  foreign policy" will not undergo any changes in connection with  the government reshuffles and urged it to "judge by results, not  by persons." Rejecting accusations of neo-imperialism, our  minister declared: "If anybody thinks that he will be unable to  reach agreement with me and will find someone else with whom it  will be easier to reach agreement, I am afraid that they are  badly informed, for example, about the makeup of the present  State Duma. I invite them to familiarize themselves."    The visit to Moscow of Jiang Zemin, president of the PRC and  general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, promises to be  the next important step in the Russian-Chinese dialogue. After  failing to happen last year, this trip is now planned for the  third quarter of this year.</p>

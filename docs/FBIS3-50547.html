Quite the  contrary, he said, the Church offers to act as mediator to reach  a consensus and prevent useless bloodshed.    The prelate explained that the recent events are a desperate  measure in the face of the poverty and deprivation in which the  Indians are immersed, above all in the Lacandon zone.    Bishop Felipe Arizmendi warned that any violence in Chiapas  will result in worse repression of the Indians. He said the  important thing is to know who is behind the Zapatista army and  to learn if they are acting in favor of private interests that  do not include the Indian population.    The Catholic Church in Chiapas has reiterated its appeal  that  political wisdom and historical responsibility motivate the  parties to the conflict to seek an honest and responsible  dialogue.</p>

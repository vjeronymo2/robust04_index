			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Caesars Fined: Caesars Hotel Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., was allowed to  remain open but was fined $250,000 by the Casino Control Commission for alleged  discriminatory practices against minorities and women. A judge had recommended  that Caesars be fined only $15,600 for relocating female and black dealers to  accommodate the perceived preferences of a high roller. The $250,000 fine was  the maximum penalty Caesars could receive.  </P></p>

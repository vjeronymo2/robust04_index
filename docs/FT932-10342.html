			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Bosnia ceasefire eases pressure for intervention A FRESH ceasefire between Serb and Moslem-led forces came into force yesterday throughout Bosnia, easing pressure for early western military intervention. Calls for western action had become more persistent in the aftermath of the rejection by Bosnian Serb leaders of an international peace plan. The ceasefire appeared largely to hold for the first few hours. Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic alluded to sniping and some shelling in the capital, Sarajevo, and what he said was sporadic shooting elsewhere. But General Philippe Morillon, commander of United Nations forces in the former Yugoslav republic, said the ceasefire needed time to work. Fierce fighting erupted between Moslem forces and their former Croat allies, who were not involved in the weekend ceasefire deal, in several towns in central Bosnia, blocking a key route for humanitarian aid. UN spokesman Mr Jose Gallegos said Bosnian Croats attacked Bosnian government forces in Mostar, about 70km southwest of Sarajevo, early yesterday. The fighting among the supposed allies was so intense that the UN Spanish battalion based in Mostar was forced to pull back to surrounding hillsides. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Sarajevo said several apartment buildings in Mostar had been cleared of all Moslem inhabitants and it had reports that Croatian forces were planning to deport the Moslems to Zenica and Jablanica. There were also reports from UN observers of house-to-house fighting in the old Moslem quarter of the city, in which big fires broke out. Moslems were ordered to hang white flags on their homes and put weapons out on the street. UNHCR staff and UN military observers were barred from the city. Ten buses containing about 400 people, including women and children, guarded by Croatian soldiers, were seen leaving Mostar. UN monitors, however, who arrived in Zepa - an enclave in eastern Bosnia where 30,000 Moslems are believed to be trapped by Serbs and which the Security Council has declared a 'safe area' - reported no fighting. The ceasefire was signed by Bosnian Serb army general Ratko Mladic and Moslem commander Sefer Halilovic at Sarajevo airport on Saturday. It declares the besieged strongholds of Zepa and Srebrenica 'demilitarised zones' which will be policed by UN monitors. It also calls for the withdrawal of weapons and combatants from the enclaves. Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, said yesterday that the latest truce may have averted the possibility of rash military intervention against Serb military targets in Bosnia. Previous ceasefires since the war erupted 13 months ago have collapsed almost immediately. EC foreign ministers are expected today to use the ceasefire as an argument for resisting US pressure for military action against the Bosnian Serbs. Despite signs of a more robust attitude among German, Belgian and Italian delegations, majority sentiment led by France and the UK is leaning towards a 'wait and see' approach. In particular, the EC ministers meeting in Brussels want to see if the ceasefire will hold in the light of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic's decision to cut off all but humanitarian supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. In Washington on Saturday President Bill Clinton met foreign policy and defence advisers to hear Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, report on his trip to Europe last week for discussions with allies on what action to take in Bosnia. Air strikes or other military action appear to be, at the very least, several days off. Although US officials are dismissive of the usefulness of the referendum that Bosnian Serbs have vowed to hold over the Vance-Owen peace plan, they acknowledge that it has helped slow the movement towards military action. US officials appear to agree that Mr Clinton will not and should not move without first gauging support from Congress, as well as from public opinion. Several senior congressmen said yesterday there are not, at the moment, enough votes in Congress to support military action. Tired Belgrade stands behind Milosevic, Page 2</p>

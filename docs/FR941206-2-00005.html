Inc. (Brother) (a subsidiary of Brother International Corporation (BIC)) located in Bartlett, Tennessee. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on November 22, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Brother facilities include a manufacturing site (231,000 sq. ft., 25 acres) located at Brother Boulevard and Highway 64, Bartlett, and a nearby BIC warehouse (270,000 sq. ft., 20 acres) located at 3131 Appling Road, Bartlett. Both sites are within the Bartlett Municipal Industrial Park. The facilities (520 employees) are used to manufacture electric and automatic typewriters and word processors. Certain components are sourced from abroad, including circuit boards, disk drives, signalling devices, motors, integrated circuits, capacitors, diodes, transistors, resistors, wire, cable, springs, steel fasteners, pulleys and gears. It is estimated that foreign status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merchandise would represent 50 to 60 percent of total product value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone procedures would exempt Brother from Customs duty payments on parts and materials used in finished products that are exported. On its domestic sales, the company would be able to choose the finished product duty rates (zero to 2.2%). The duty rates on components average 4 percent. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the plant's international competitiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is [60 days from date of publication]. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to February 21, 1995).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Office of the Area Port Director,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Customs Service,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3150 Tchulahoma, Suite 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Memphis, Tennessee 38118. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of the Executive Secretary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foreign-Trade Zones Board, Room 3716,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Department of Commerce,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14th Street &amp; Constitution Avenue, NW,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, DC 20230. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John J.

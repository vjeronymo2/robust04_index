			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Gatt Excitement at the prospect of a successful Uruguay Round has not spilled over into European equity markets. Part of the reason for yesterday's falls is that there is an inclination to take profits in many markets anyway. Part is that the consequences of failure in the Round were always seen as more serious than the benefits of success. Trade liberalisation does open the way to non-inflationary growth, but only over an extended period. Some industries inevitably face painful adjustment first. Failure would have brought the immediate risk of disruptive trade conflicts which might have justified a sharper sell-off in equity markets. As it is, the deal does not mean that peace has broken out in every area. The US is retaining the notorious section 301 of its Trade Act which permits unilateral action against trading partners, and there is clamour for something similar in Europe too. There is still the risk of conflict in areas like steel and audio-visual trade - French television stocks were conspicuously weak yesterday. Moreover, the good news from Gatt was overshadowed by the Russian elections. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky seems to be toning down his rhetoric. But he remains an unpredictable politican who has established a power base in a country that seems unable to cope politically with economic adjustment. Western financial markets may have to discount the impact on confidence, not to mention a possible curtailment of the peace dividend. Against that background, a tortuously agreed Gatt deal hardly constitutes a buy signal.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles' flat Pounds 39m pleases City Shares in Courtaulds Textiles climbed 5p to 568p after fears of a sharp fall in profits at the clothing and fabrics group failed to materialise. The group, which three months ago saw its shares fall 10 per cent to 489p following a profits warning, yesterday reported flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.8m (Pounds 39.1m) for the year to December 31. Although hit by volatile consumer demand and continued recession in continental Europe, turnover increased by 3.8 per cent to Pounds 923.1m (Pounds 889.6m) and operating profits rose marginally to Pounds 49.5m (Pounds 49.3m). Expressing confidence in its future prospects, the group is proposing a final dividend of 9.5p (9.2p) to lift the total for the year to 14.2p (13.6p). Earnings per share, however, fell from a restated 30.1p to 29.2p. Mr Noel Jervis, chief executive, said the company would have reported increased pre-tax profits had it not decided to abandon its policy of offsetting interest charges by taking a pension credit through the profit and loss account. Last year the company reduced the pension credit - part of a surplus built up on the group's pension fund - to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 4.8m) and warned of no further credit payments. This led to a sharp increase in net interest payable to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 1.8m) on unchanged year-end borrowings of Pounds 17.7m. Of the group's five divisions, branded clothing suffered the sharpest decline as operating profits fell to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 5.9m) despite increased turnover of Pounds 195.1m (Pounds 193.6m). Mr Jervis blamed the downturn on operational problems at its Aristoc factory in the Midlands, which makes hosiery for retailers such as Marks and Spencer, and large stock write-downs at Georges Rech, its French underwear business. The fabrics division saw profits fall to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 22.1m) as margins in Europe were hit by falling prices, which wiped out improved performances in Britain and the US. Reduced profits in the two divisions were offset by gains in home furnishings, spinning and own-label clothing, with the latter business reporting the largest rise to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 10.9m). COMMENT Having forecast bad news last December, Courtaulds Textiles' flat performance came as a pleasant surprise. Although there are still problems to be ironed out in its fabrics business, increased reorganisation costs of Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 6.8m) signalled its intention to further restructure any operations making unsatisfactory returns. Having spent more than Pounds 41m on acquisitions, it is also expected to emerge as a group with a strong international presence and highly regarded products. That prospect is reflected in forecast profits of up to Pounds 48m which, on a forward multiple of 15.9, make the group a moderately attractive option.</p>

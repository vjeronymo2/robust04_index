			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / People: Gibson moves up at ESN Bob Gibson, managing director of ESN Securities Investment Management, is to succeed Michael Cannan as chief executive when he retires. ESN Pension Management Group is the fund management company formed out of the in-house pension scheme manager for the now-privatised electricity supply companies. Under a unique structure, the companies would keep their pension assets with ESN, buying 'units' in the fund. Although the companies have the option to move their assets after a few years, almost all the funds have remained. ESN, which offers administrative services to other pension schemes, has said it would like to expand its investment skills 'to a wider audience'. But officials there say privately that despite its strong performance record, it has difficulty attracting new clients because it has no name-brand recognition. Therefore it would be interested in acquiring a smaller outfit with a high public profile.</p>

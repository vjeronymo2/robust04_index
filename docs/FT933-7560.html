			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Conrad Ritblat cuts losses to Pounds 184,000 WITH ITS preliminary statement for the year ended May 31, showing a much reduced loss, Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith announced the purchase of the freehold of the building in Glasgow which houses its Scottish operations. It is buying the property, in West George Street, from Cityprop for Pounds 2.85m satisfied in 6m ordinary shares, subject to shareholders' approval. British Linen Bank is arranging the placing of up to 5.68m of the shares at 47.5p each, to raise Pounds 2.7m for the vendor. The group occupies some 5,150 sq ft of the building at a current rent of Pounds 61,700 per year; the remainder is let at a total of Pounds 150,000. The property is generating an income yield of 7.43 per cent. Mr John Ritblat, chairman of this surveying, estate agency and rating consultancy group, reminded shareholders that the merger of Conrad Ritblat and Sinclair Goldsmith was completed just before May 31. Despite a small drop in turnover from Pounds 2.77m to Pounds 2.67m the pre-tax loss was cut from Pounds 525,000 to Pounds 184,000 by effective control of costs. Losses per share were 1.4p (3.5p). The rating division continued to 'perform with distinction', while the professional department expanded in valuation work. Agency markets were difficult because of lack of tenant demand.</p>

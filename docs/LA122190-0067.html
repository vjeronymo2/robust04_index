			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANIELS AT THE CENTER OF NEW UNLV INQUIRY;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: NCAA SAYS FORMER LAS VEGAS RECRUITER BECAME PLAYER'S GUARDIAN AND  FUNNELED PERQUISITES TO HIM.  </P> <P> The NCAA has charged the University of Nevada Las Vegas basketball program with  violating numerous NCAA rules and showing a lack of institutional control in  its recruitment of former New York high school basketball star Lloyd Daniels.  </P> <P> The charges are described in a letter of official inquiry from the NCAA that  was received by the university Tuesday and made public Thursday.  </P> <P> The 43-page document was released by the University of Nevada system general  counsel's office in Reno with all names deleted.  </P> <P> The school has 60 days to respond to the letter, the result of a preliminary  inquiry initiated by the NCAA in October 1987. The NCAA Committee on  Infractions will then conduct a hearing and determine the validity of the  charges and assess a penalty, if necessary.  </P> <P> Because most infractions cases require an additional month of pre-hearing  meetings between NCAA enforcement representatives and school officials after  the school has responded to the official letter of inquiry, the Daniels case  apparently will not have an impact this season on the Rebels, the defending  national champions.  </P> <P> However, the case's repercussions could be felt at UNLV far into the future.  </P> <P> The infractions committee has already barred the Rebels from postseason  competition and live television appearances during the 1991-92 season, the  final penalty stemming from the infractions case that caused UNLV Coach Jerry  Tarkanian to take the NCAA to court 13 years ago.  </P> <P> If the committee decides to impose similar penalties in the Daniels case, the  sanctions would apply to the 1992-93 season or beyond.  </P> <P> In addition to Daniels' recruitment, the NCAA charged UNLV with exercising a  lack of institutional control over the basketball program in the administering  of scholarship funds and bills incurred by players at hotels during trips.  </P> <P> The infractions committee has generally considered institutional control  violations to be major in scope, according to Chuck Smrt, an assistant director  of enforcement for the NCAA.  </P> <P> UNLV President Robert Maxson was out of town Thursday and could not be reached  for comment, according to his office.  </P> <P> However, the Associated Press quoted him as saying Wednesday: "When you find  out you've made mistakes, you do whatever you have to do to correct them. We're  very anxious to get this cleared up and get the slate clean."  </P> <P> Maxson has instructed all university employees not to comment on the  allegations, said Joe Hawk, the school's sports information director.  </P> <P> Tarkanian has referred all inquiries to his attorney, Chuck Thompson of Las  Vegas.  </P> <P> Thompson has said that Tarkanian is not named in any "major allegations."  Thompson has also expressed anger at the charges, saying: "I know for a fact  some of the things in there are not true and not supportable."  </P> <P> Although names and most identifying characteristics were deleted from the  version of the letter released to the public, the bulk of the allegations,  grouped in 29 areas, match those outlined in a series of stories in Newsday  during March 1987 describing Daniels' dealings with the school and identifying  many of the people involved.  </P> <P> The newspaper reported that Daniels, a 6-foot-8 swingman who was considered one  of the best players to come out of New York, received a variety of special  privileges -- including cash, a car and a motorcycle -- from UNLV coaches,  boosters and other representatives of the school while attempting to become  eligible to play for the Rebels.  </P> <P> Daniels, who signed a letter of intent to play at UNLV in April 1986 despite  failing to complete the 11th grade at Andrew Jackson High in Queens, spent the  fall of '86 at Mt. San Antonio College and enrolled at UNLV as a full-time  student for the '87 spring semester. He was banned by Tarkanian from playing at  UNLV, however, after being arrested on drug charges in Las Vegas in February  '87.  </P> <P> The NCAA began a preliminary inquiry into the Daniels affair after an in-house  investigating committee, appointed by Maxson after the Newsday series,  concluded that it could neither prove nor disprove the allegations in the  newspaper.  </P> <P> Many of the allegations focused on Mark Warkentien, UNLV's basketball  recruiting coordinator at the time, who became Daniels' legal guardian in  October '86.  </P> <P> In its letter of inquiry, the NCAA alleges that UNLV athletic staff members did  not exercise appropriate institutional control when they allowed Warkentien to  become Daniels' legal guardian without following up on the advice of the  Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. -- now the Big West Conference -- office to seek  an official interpretation from the NCAA.  </P> <P> As a result, the NCAA alleges Warkentien violated NCAA rules in becoming  Daniels' legal guardian, a relationship that, according to the letter, allowed  Warkentien to pay numerous improper living, travel and educational expenses for  Daniels.  </P> <P> Among the improper benefits provided Daniels by Warkentien, the NCAA alleges,  are a motor scooter, a motorcycle, a used car, clothing and a cash allowance.  </P> <P> Although no longer coaching, Warkentien remains a member of the UNLV athletic  department staff.  </P> <P> The NCAA also alleges that, in the summer of 1986, Daniels was improperly  employed by UNLV booster Sig Rogich, owner of a Las Vegas advertising firm, and  allowed to use a Dodge Aries leased by Rogich's firm during both working and  non-working hours.  </P> <P> A former UNLV regent, Rogich served as advertising director for George Bush's  1988 Presidential campaign and is currently an assistant to President Bush for  activities and initiatives.  </P> <P> In a statement released Wednesday through his company, R&amp;R Advertising,  Rogich acknowledged that he had been named in the charges but maintained that  his agency had not broken NCAA rules.  </P> <P> The letter also lists four instances in which UNLV staff members and players  allegedly provided false and misleading information to NCAA investigators, and  it describes a scenario in which a UNLV booster allegedly paid a former UNLV  player $200 in return for signing an affidavit recanting allegations published  in Newsday and promising to lie to the university's in-house investigating  committee.  </P> <P> According to a source familiar with the inquiry, who asked not to be  identified, the owner of a Las Vegas hotel-casino with ties to the UNLV  basketball program made the $200 offer to former UNLV guard Ricky Collier of  Riverside, who had described a series of rules violations involving himself and  Daniels in Newsday.  </P> <P> Collier accepted the money and signed the affidavit, according to the source,  but later, in dramatic testimony before the school's in-house investigating  committee, described how he had been pressured to recant the information he had  given Newsday.  </P> <P> The NCAA has also charged that UNLV altered an NCAA certificate of compliance  form in 1986 by deleting the name of an athletic department staff member who  refused to sign the form because of her knowledge of possible rules violations  in the program.  </P> <P> The Times has reported that in 1986, Brad Rothermel, then UNLV's athletic  director, altered a compliance form to eliminate the name of Ann Mayo, the  school's academic adviser for basketball at the time, after Mayo told  Rothermel's secretary that she could not sign the form because of her knowledge  of improper activities in the basketball program. Rothermel, who resigned his  position last June, declined comment Thursday night.  </P></p>

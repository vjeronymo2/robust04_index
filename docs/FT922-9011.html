			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Channel 5 pledge by TV-am TV-AM, the commercial breakfast television broadcaster, agreed in the High Court yesterday that, before concluding any agreement to invest in a bid for Channel 5, it would give the independent company Five TV notice to enable it to obtain an injunction. Channel 5 is the commercial television station due to begin operations by 1995. Five TV is seeking injunctions to prevent TV-am, with which it discussed co-operation in a bid for the fifth channel, from concluding any agreement to invest in an opposing bid. Five TV is backed by Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto. TV-am is negotiating to form a consortium, The Entertainment Channel, with Time Warner, the world's largest media group, and Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group. Five TV took its legal action on the grounds that it understood it had reached a confidentiality and exclusivity agreement with TV-am which would have led to them making a joint bid for Channel 5.</p>

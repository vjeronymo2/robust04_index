			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Craxi to lose immunity in bribes case THE pugnacious battle fought by Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, to avoid facing charges of alleged corruption suffered a serious blow yesterday. The special parliamentary commission dealing with magistrates' petitions for waiving immunity yesterday decided there was sufficient grounds for Mr Craxi to face the allegations on three counts. A final decision will be taken by the full house; but in the past it has been rare for the recommendation of the commission to be ignored. The decision to waive his immunity is the first time parliament has decided such an action in the case of a former party secretary. Immunity has already been waived in the case of Mr Gianni de Michelis, the former foreign minister and deputy Socialist leader, who is facing corruption charges over alleged bribes linked to construction contracts in Venice. Milan magistrates have sent a dossier to parliament listing more than 40 incidents in which Mr Craxi is alleged to have received illicit funds for his party to the tune of L36bn (Pounds 16.4m). They asked parliament to allow them to proceed with charges on separate counts of corruption, illicit party funding and receiving stolen funds. The Socialist members of the commission sought to limit the waiving of immunity on the two lesser counts of corruption and illicit party funding. But the commission accepted all three. More than 50 deputies and senators have so far received notice they are under investigation in Italy's wave of corruption scandals; and yesterday two more were caught in the net, including Mr Francesco Cafarelli, the Christian Democrat deputy who is currently secretary of parliament's anti-Mafia commission. But at the beginning of this month documentation for only 45 requests to have immunity waived to face corruption charges had been received. Mr Craxi was not present at yesterday's hearing but sent a letter repeating earlier allegations that Milan magistrates were waging a deliberate campaign to discredit him and the Socialist party. Mr Craxi was first served notice he was under investigation for alleged corruption on December 15. Since then he has received 11 other cautions. Hearings have not covered investigations into the transfer of funds to a Swiss bank account for the Socialist party by the late Mr Roberto Calvi, head of Banco Ambrosiano.</p>

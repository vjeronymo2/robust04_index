			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Austria presidential campaign tiptoes past the issue: All parties agree the race for Waldheim's replacement should be a dignified one IT IS no doubt a coincidence that a few cells of heavily-armed neo-Nazis have been uncovered in Austria in recent weeks just as the long-awaited campaign to elect someone to replace the embarrassing Mr Kurt Waldheim as the country's president gets under way. But it is an ironic reminder - if one were necessary - that the last presidential campaign in 1986 turned sour after disclosures that Mr Waldheim had concealed his service in a German Wehrmacht unit that was implicated in war crimes in Yugoslavia and Greece during the Second World War. The disclosures made Mr Waldheim a lame duck president from the day he took office, leaving him largely unable to fulfil the one specific responsibility given to him under the constitution - to represent his country abroad. But the always delicate relations between the Social Democratic Party (SPO) and the Austrian Peoples Party (OVP) that have ruled in a 'grand coalition' since 1986 meant the OVP-backed Mr Waldheim could no be removed - and he himself saw no reason to leave. Indeed, it is said in Vienna that the ageing former United Nations secretary general would have been delighted to stand for a second term. However, all agreed that he should not, and that this presidential campaign should, above all, be a dignified one, aimed at restoring some prestige to this ceremonial office. 'There will be no mudslinging,' assures a campaign manager for one of the candidates. Certainly, none of the candidates looks like a mudslinger. The favourite, Mr Rudolf Streicher, backed by the SPO, is an amiable tool-maker by trade who rose to head one of Austria's largest engineering companies, Steyr-Daimler-Puch, in 1986. Following the Waldheim election debacle, Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor and SPO party leader, shuffled his cabinet and brought in Mr Streicher to restore financial order as minister for the nationalised industries. The industrialist was then handed the equally prickly transport portfolio and somehow managed to make friends in Tyrol while negotiating an Alpine transit treaty with the European Community. The OVP has put forward Mr Thomas Klestil, a former ambassador to the US who, as head of the country's diplomatic service, won high praise for drafting the government's response to the Gulf crisis. Even the controversial Freedom Party (FPO), led by the right-wing populist Jorg Haider, has found a candidate who would be widely acceptable in Ms Heide Schmidt, a widely respected lawyer. And the Green Party has nominated Mr Robert Yungk, a distinguished pacifist intellectual. Opinion polls put Mr Streicher well ahead with more than 40 per cent of the vote, followed by Mr Klestil with about a third. They are thus likely to make it into the run-off after the first ballot on April 26. By all accounts, the campaign battle will be subdued, although there is the danger, according to some observers, that Mr Haider will get impatient with the realisation that his candidate may not get over 10 per cent of the vote, and so he will try to arouse passions. Mr Haider has on a roll doing well in the past few months with his intoxicating rhetorical cocktail of right-wing ideas and xenophobic nationalism. The FPO piled up ever bigger scores in three regional elections last autumn, culminating in Vienna in November where it took 23 per cent of the vote and displaced the OVP as the runner up. But this year does not look so bright for Mr Haider. Revelations in a weekly magazine last month of his attempt to bribe a rival into resigning have tarnished his image. Apart from the presidential election, the only other poll will be in the autumn in Lower Austria. There the OVP is still very much in control, and the FPO cannot hope to sustain the momentum it built up last autumn. It would be rash to suggest that the extreme right-wing movement in Austria has peaked or that Austrian politics will slip back into the cosy compact among the two main parties and various vested interest groups that has prevailed for most of the post-war period. For the moment, the SPO-OVP coalition looks secure, but only because the OVP has become so demoralised. It has been unable to find a way to reverse a long slide in its popularity despite three changes of leader in five years. Last November it slumped into third place in the Vienna city elections. Part of its problem is that the natty Mr Vranitzky, who heads a calm and business-like government, has become extremely popular in his own right, and his SPO would probably improve its standing if the OVP quit the coalition and provoked an early election. In the past, the OVP might have joined forces with the FPO but this is no longer a credible option because everyone knows it could not get along with Mr Haider. If the OVP's muddle continues, the long-mooted realignment in Austrian politics could begin to take shape before the next general elections in 1994. Last month, Mr Martin Zumtobel, a little-known businessman from the far western province of Vorarlberg, launched the Economic Party, promoting deregulation and privatisation. No one in Vienna seems to take Mr Zumtobel, a supermarket chain owner, too seriously but, as one political observer noted, he could be a stalking horse for others. The Austrian Parliament has approved the first amendment to Austria's anti-Nazi legislation since 1945, reducing the minimum sentence for offences from five years to one. It is designed to increase the number of successful prosecutions. Juries have been reluctant to convict because of the severe penalties. Since 1980, only 14 people have been convicted of Nazi-related offences. The amendment has the support of all political parties as well as the international anti-Nazi organisations.</p>

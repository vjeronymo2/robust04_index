			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] At 2000 today, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz  left Beirut for Amman to attend the conference of the Economic  and Social Commission of West Asia, ESCWA, which will be held in  the Jordanian capital between 29 and 31 May.    Speaking at the airport, Buwayz noted that before the  events,  Lebanon was the seat of ESCWA, which deals with economic  development and construction. [passage omitted]    Asked about the latest developments in the contacts to call  a  UN Security Council [UNSC] session on Lebanon's complaint  against Israeli acts of aggression and piracy, Buwayz replied:  The Lebanese decision, of course, is geared toward convening a  Security Council session to discuss the Lebanese complaint that  was filed last week. We summoned the ambassadors of the  permanent Security Council members yesterday to inform them of  this decision and to find out their positions toward it.    He added: We know that the Security Council is facing some  difficulties--let us call them difficulties. But in effect, we  have to lay the responsibility on the shoulders of the Security  Council, in any case.    Minister Buwayz was then asked: What are these difficulties?  He replied: You know that heavy pressure may prevent the  Security Council from holding a session immediately and  automatically, as should have happened when we filed the  complaint last week and asked for a session so that an  appropriate resolution can be adopted.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI Yesterday's 2 per cent drop in Thorn EMI's share price was an exaggerated response to a solid set of interim figures. There were some modest disappointments - for example continuing problems at Rumbelows and evidence of intensifying competition in the US rentals market - but these were slight in the context of the robust 15 per cent growth in core operating profits and the 8.3 per cent increase in the interim dividend. The higher than expected payout is an expression of the group's confidence in the future. Investors should share this. The management will soon be able to take the strategic tidying-up exercise a stage further with Thorn EMI's expected withdrawal from its defence interests. Meanwhile the margin enhancement targets it has set for both music and rentals seem achievable. Even if return on sales in the music division did not improve in the first half, the full-year figures should show progress towards the medium-term aim of 16 per cent. As for rentals, the improvement in margins in the first six months was impressive given difficult market conditions. Assuming pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 400m for the full year, the shares are on a deserved, if not generous, premium to the market. The near 5 per cent prospective yield provides support. But sustained outperformance is likely only when and if the management revives the demerger plans, now shelved, which so delighted the market earlier this year.</p>

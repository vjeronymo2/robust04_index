			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah in Amman] </F>   [Text] Gathered by Land Day and dispersed by the peace  process. A rally organized by the intifadah committee of the  engineers association at the al-Rashid hall in the professional  unions' complex last night to celebrate the 18th anniversary of  Land Day had to end prematurely because of differences between  those who supported and those who opposed a peace march among  attendees.    Only 30 minutes into the rally, and with only two of the  five  scheduled speakers heard, a row broke out between those who  support and those who opposed the peace process. The  altercation began with the raising of slogans and shouts and  ended with a fistfight and the throwing of chairs. The fight  ended after a few minutes and there were no casualties.    The master of ceremonies, Muhammad Abu-Taha, exerted great  but unsuccessful efforts to continue the rally but the audience  started leaving the hall through doors and windows.    The rally was addressed by Muhammad Nayil 'Ubaydat, doyen of  the dentists association, and Muhammad al-A'raj, known also as  Abu-al-Ra'id, one of the founders of the Fatah Movement. Taysir  Khalid, member of the PLO Executive committee and a Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine official; Muhammad Nazzal,  Hamas representative in Jordan; and Ahmad Nawfal, a professor at  the University of Jordan, had no chance to deliver their  speeches at this important annual event.    This is the first time the intifadah anniversary celebration  has failed since the beginning of these celebrations 18 years  ago.</p>

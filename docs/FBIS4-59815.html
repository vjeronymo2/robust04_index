			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Masud Nizami] </F>   [Text] Despite the liberal and flexible stand which the  Bangladesh Government has taken to bring about a solution to the  Chittagong Hill Tracts [CHTs] problem, the leaders of the CHTs  and the bloodthirsty Shanti Bahini [tribal insurgents] are  treating this government policy as weakness and have intensified  their violent and brutal activities. On April 10, a half-day  strike was observed in the three districts of CHTs under the  auspices of the Parbattya Gano Parishad [organization of Bengali  settlers in CHTs] in protest against the kidnapping of several  Bengali-speaking people from Naniarchar by the Shanti Bahini.  The Shanti Bahini also kidnapped one person from Manikchhari  last December and another person from Kutubchhari in January.  The kidnapping and killing of Bengalees by the Shanti Bahini  continues.    Perhaps, the members of the so-called Shanti Bahini and the  Pahari Chhatra Parishad [Hill Students Council] who are  followers of Upendra Lal Chakma and Santu Larma [both leaders of  the tribal insurgents] are carrying on these nefarious  activities to obstruct the repatriation of tribal refugees to  CHTs from India's Tripura State. Though the Pahari Chhatra  Parishad has appealed to the tribal population of CHTs not to  celebrate the Biju [religious festival of the tribals], the  tribals have not responded. The Shanti Bahini wanted to prove  to the world that religious minorities are being repressed in  Bangladesh by preventing the observance of this festival. In  the past, the Shanti Bahini had made several false propaganda in  this regard both at home and abroad.    At present, the Shanti Bahini has set up several bases  inside  the CHTs. They have this opportunity as the security forces  have been withdrawn from the border areas. Apart from Tripura,  the Shanti Bahini has recently opened new camps in Haryana [a  state of India] for training newly-recruited youths. These  terrortist elements have the opportunity to organize themselves  due to the general amnesty declared by the Bangladesh Government  and the closure of several army camps in the region. It is  learnt that arrangements are being made to withdraw more army  camps from the CHTs. This is a matter of grave concern. After  visiting the CHTs, the governor of Tripura, Romesh Bhandari,  said he believed that the situation in the region is very  favorable for repatriation. Despite this, the Shanti Bahini  which is responsible for killing over 25,000 people in the CHTs  is making efforts to foil the repatriation of the second batch  of tribal refugees from Tripura to the CHTs. The Shanti Bahini  has become desperate to launch massive destruction in the region  to foil the peace initiative under any pretext. It may be  mentioned that at least 25 percent of the women of Bangipara  [village of CHTs] have become widows due to the activities of  the Shanti Bahini.    After the peace talks held last November, the killer Shanti  Bahini launched a series of attacks and killed a large number of  the members of the security forces, the police, the Bangladesh  Rifles [paramilitary force], and Bengalees living in the region.  So far, it has not been possible to record all their  activities. Reliable sources, however, said such incidents  exceed 200. They said the aim of the Shanti Bahini is to foil  the peace process and complicate the situation. The reason is  that the leaders of the Shanti Bahini and the Jana Sanghati  Samity [political wing of Shanti Bahini] are gradually becoming  frustrated with India.    Recently, the Shanti Bahini has established links with the  secessionist forces in seven Indian states including Tripura,  Mizoram, Assam, Nagaland, and Meghalaya. Due to this, the  Shanti Bahini has become a problem for India. According to  observers, Indian leaders are therefore in favor of driving out  the Shanti Bahini from their country. They add that owing to  this the Shanti Bahini has become desperate to let loose  anarchy. The people of the CHTs have become fed up with the  large-scale extortion of the Shanti Bahini. Several protest  rallies against the activities of the Shanti Bahini have been  held in different parts of the region.    Severe discontent prevails among the Bengalees living in the  three districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts. They are fighting  against the demand of the tribals to curb their rights and  convert them to second-class citizens. The quota for the  representation of the Bengalees in the district councils of the  CHTs is very small. The opportunity for the education of their  children is also very limited. In contrast, there are special  quotas in educational institutions for the tribals. Bengalees  do not have the right to purchase land in the CHTs. On the  other hand, the government has surrendered to the demand of the  Shanti Bahini and is forcibly evicting thousands of Bengalees  from their homes. This is being widely criticized. A massive  rally was held last November in Rangamati town under the  auspices of the Parbattya Gano Parishad which clearly stated  that the people of the CHTs will not accept any talks with the  murderous Shanti Bahini. They added that if any talks are  necessary, then it should be held with the Parbattya Gano  Parishad, an organization of peace-loving people from the three  districts of the CHTs. In this regard, they also handed over a  memorandum to the government. In this memorandum, the Bengalees  have demanded the abolition of special tribal quotas and the  introduction of hill quotas.    On April 10, a half-day strike was observed peacefully in  the  three districts of the CHTs -- Rangamati, Bandarban, and  Khagrachhari -- at the call of the Parbattya Gano Parishad,  which demanded that the Bengalees kidnapped by the Shanti Bahini  be released. Addressing a rally held on the occasion, the Gano  Parishad leaders declared that a solution to the CHTs problem is  only possible through the implementation of the seven-point and  18-point proposals they have given. They added that the  repression of the Bengalees in the CHTs, which is also a  Bangladesh territory, will not be tolerated.    A rumor is being heard saying that the government has  recently decided to hand over to the district councils of the  CHTs the responsibility of dealing with land matters in the  region. If this is done, then this will be equal to giving the  Bengalees a death blow. It is learnt that the Bengalees are  preparing to resist this move. The Jatiyatabadi Landless  Organization, which has about 10,000 landless families living in  Khagrachhari, are planning to lay siege to the local district  council office to press the implementation of their five-point  demands.    The chairman of the Parbattya Gano Parishad, Jalaluddin  Ahmed, and the secretary general, Moniruzzaman Monir, in a joint  statement criticized the governor of Tripura, Romesh Bhandari,  for saying that he is unaware that secessionist training is  being given to the misled Chakma [tribals of CHTs] youths at the  (Maini) Mission Academy and other secret places in Agartala.  They alleged that the administration in Chittagong Hill Tracts  is being compelled to work in accordance with the prescription  of the local leftists and the so-called international human  rights organizations. They added that the MP from Khagrachhari,  Kalpa Ranjan Chakma, and Upendra Lal Chakma are playing a game  centering on the Chakma refugee issue. The Parbattya Gano  Parishad has evidence that these two people have links with the  Shanti Bahini. Hence, they cannot be friends of Bangladesh.  The leaders of the parishad in their statement has called on  the government to call a round-table conference at the national  level to resist the conspiracy and terrorism going on in the  CHTs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Electoral Commission has held a meeting  in Accra with all the registered political parties in connection  with the provision of identity cards for Ghanaian voters. The  political parties agreed that identity cards with thumbprint and  special security marks should be provided for all voters  throughout the country. However, in order to tackle the problem  of impersonation in the big towns, photo identities will be  provided in all the 10 regional capitals. The political parties  also agreed that failure to raise adequate funds to undertake  the exercise photo identities should be provided in only four  selected urban centers. [sentence as heard]</p>

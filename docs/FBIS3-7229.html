			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the morning of 24 March, a government source  noted acceptance of numerical targets is difficult even in the  government procurement sector.    Regarding the economic framework talks, the United States  recently urged Japan to accept numerical targets for government  procurement, one of the three priority negotiation fields at the  framework talks. Commenting on the U.S. demand, the source  said: "The U.S. demand probably means they think it is easier to  promise (numerical targets) in fields under control of the  public sector, but it is still difficult. Even under the market  opening policy, we cannot buy what we do not need."</p>

"The dead and injured in Sarajevo are not the victims of war  but the victims of war criminals. We all expect that these  criminals to be found in the very near future and put on trial  for the crime they have committed."    "The revulsion felt by the Yugoslav and international public  is justified, and I sincerely hope that no political reasons  will hamper the rapid discovery of the criminals and diminish  their responsibility," said Slobodan Milosevic, president of the  Republic of Serbia.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Economic hopes hit by jobless and earnings data THE GOVERNMENT'S economic strategy suffered a double setback yesterday with news that unemployment jumped by 42,600 in April and average earnings rose by 7.5 per cent in February and March. The seasonally adjusted rise in unemployment in April - the 24th consecutive monthly rise - brought the jobless total to 2.7m, the highest since August 1987. It followed the exceptionally low rise in March of just under 8,000 and pushed the unemployment rate in April to 9.5 per cent. Although the increase was bigger than City forecasts of a 29,000 rise, the overall trend measured on a three-monthly basis continued to improve. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, described the rise as 'clearly disappointing', but said the average rate of increase in unemployment in the three months to April was the lowest since the three months to September 1990. Over the past six months, unemployment has risen on average by 36,400 a month. The Department of Employment said the underlying three-monthly rise in unemployment was around 30,000. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Although the monthly rise in unemployment exceeded that in previous months, trends suggest that the pace of increase in unemployment is still gradually easing.' A bigger shock came from March's 7.5 per cent year-on-year increase in average earnings, which fuelled worries about underlying inflationary pressures. The yearly rise in February was revised to 7.5 per cent from an initial estimate of 7.25 per cent. The growth in average earnings has consistently disappointed market expectations since it began to decline from 10.25 per cent in July 1990. The Department of Employment described the March figure as a 'blip'. This probably reflected bonus payments made before the general election on April 9 because of fears that a Labour government would have imposed higher taxes, it said. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said April's jobless rise 'shattered' the hope that the increase in unemployment was about to cease. 'It is now clear that the trend is firmly upwards and will carry on rising for some time with all the waste and human misery it brings,' he said. The bad news on unemployment and higher average earnings came the day after Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said there was little prospect of any early move to lower interest rates.

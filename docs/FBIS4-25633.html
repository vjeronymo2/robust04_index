			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Queenie Wang and Ron Gluckman] </F>   [Text] A top Chinese official angrily denounced Executive  Councillor Professor Edward Chen Kwan-yiu yesterday, saying he  talked "nonsense" when claiming it was better for Hong Kong if  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping died "earlier rather than later".  XINHUA (NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) deputy director, Zhang Junsheng,  said he was furious about remarks made by Professor Chen during  a visit to Japan last week. "It's nonsense for Mr Chen, as an  Executive Councillor, to make such frivolous remarks about a man  who is highly respected by people all over the world," Mr Zhang  said. "Personally, I am really quite angry. Mr Deng's health is  very good. But, regardless of that, I do not think Mr Chen  should make such remarks about a respectable old man."    Professor Chen was supposed to have told foreign  correspondents in Tokyo: "From the point of view of Hong Kong  people, it's better for Deng to go earlier than later." But  yesterday he refused to apologise, insisting he had been  misquoted, and that even a child should have understood what he  meant. "I never said that Deng should die," he said while  attending the opening of a Consumer Council exhibition in  Pacific Place. "I wasn't wishing for Deng Xiaoping's death,  only an end to the uncertainty. There are clearly only three  options: he will either pass away before 1997, during 1997, or  after 1997. I merely pointed out that the timing is critical to  Hong Kong. What I said was in no way remarkable. It's only  common sense. A child would have understood it."    He railed at the local media for "blowing out of proportion"  one minor comment from a 45-minute luncheon address to the  Foreign Correspondents' Club in Tokyo. He said he had been  explaining how Hong Kong suffered from uncertainty generated by  worries over Mr Deng's deteriorating health and speculation  about his successor.    On Friday, the latest rumours concerning the death of Mr  Deng  sent the Hang Seng Index into a 263-point dive.    "I'm not happy about the way it was reported and I'm not  apologising," he said. "I don't mind if they report what I  said, because I made wonderful speech about China and its future  direction. But they take this one thing and report it out of  context."    Professor Chen also accused local press and academics of  self-censorship. "There is so much self-censorship, among the  media and the academic community," he said. "That's what's sad.  It's not coming from Beijing, but here. We're beginning to  think 10 times before we say something, about what the reaction  might be in Beijing. We compromise ourselves."    Mr Zhang said it was unlikely China would file a formal  complaint with the Hong Kong Government.</p>

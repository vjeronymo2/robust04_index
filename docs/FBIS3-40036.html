Fredriksson reviewed a study commissioned by the state of  Schleswig-Holstein on future opportunities for the Baltic region.    Fredriksson, speaking at a symposium held in Kiel in  January,  pointed out that the Baltic sphere of influence encompasses 10  countries with a population of 50 million. This region  represents a purchasing power greater than China's and  approximately the same as that of France, Italy, or Britain.    The study was carried out by the EuroFutures Institute,  headed by Fredriksson. It reviews the basic factors for future  opportunities in the Baltic region in terms of population,  buying power, number of large enterprises, volume of internal  trade, level of university education, research and development,  infrastructure, and airline services. The study also reviews  the number of investments and investment growth in the Baltic  region.    But hard work is required if the opportunities in the Baltic  region are not to remain mere projects. The coastal states must  therefore begin to act and commit themselves to the exploitation  of existing opportunities and the development of new ones.    EuroFutures points out that the profile of the region must  be  strengthened. The Baltic region must become better known to the  economic and political decisionmakers in order to attract  foreign investment. The infrastructure must be reinforced and  the results from research and development work and innovations  must be converted to growth-positive enterpreneurial activities.    Fredriksson thinks that the activities of universities and  research institutes should be coordinated with the prospect of  creating a couple of dozen internationally recognized know-how  centers.  <H5>  Schleswig-Holstein Is Active </H5>   The government of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein  has,  since the late 1980's, been very active in promoting the Baltic  region as a future growth area in Europe.    Schleswig-Holstein has, among other things, taken the  initiative of creating a "Baltic program" for the European Union.    Heide Simonis, Schleswig-Holstein's prime minister, who  addressed the symposium, said that the Baltic region will become  a European fringe area unless we take concrete steps and join  forces to consolidate its development.    Simonis pointed out that the region stands up well to  comparison. The levels of education, technology, and research  are high. The Baltic has a lively commercial traffic and plays  an active part in world trade. Internal trade alone represents  6 percent of world trade.    Schleswig-Holstein is a federal state with a population of  2.6 million, which has succeeded extremely well in making use of  the various support programs of the European Union. A study,  completed last year by the Satakunta-Liitto, indicates how well  Schleswig-Holstein has handled this opportunity.    The province of Vaasa has kept active contact with  Schleswig-Holstein. Cooperation began thanks to contacts  between Vaasa and its twin city Kiel.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand, Laos, and China will set up a committee  to study the construction of highways from Chiang Rai Province  through Laos to China's border in Yunnan Province, Deputy  Communications Minister Charat Phuachuai disclosed after holding  talks with Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang.    Charat said that a tripartite committee including highways  authorities in Thailand, Laos, and China will be set up soon to  study the project.    The Asian Development Bank held a meeting two weeks ago to  survey the road route through Laos. The study will be completed  in September. Charat said that the committee will help the  Asian Development Bank to summarize the survey faster.    Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang said he is interested in jointly  building a road from Thailand into Xishuangbanna. The governor  said that there are two possible routes. One is from Chiang  Khong of Chiang Rai Province in Thailand through Bokeo Province,  Luang Namtha Province, and Boten district in Laos to the border  of China. Another one is from Mae Sai of Chiang Rai Province  through Tachilek, Kengtung in Burma to Daluo in China.    Deputy Communications Minister Charat said that Thailand is  more interested in the route through Laos because Thailand just  signed a memorandum of understanding with Laos last week  agreeing to support Lao transport and communications business.  He also said that the second route through Burma is not so safe  because it would face problems with Burmese minorities.    Regarding waterway transport along the Mekong River from  Chiang Rai to Xishuangbanna, the Thai deputy communications  minister said that the Thai Government has approved the  construction of permanent piers at Chiang Khong and Chiang Saen  to be international customs posts. The government will provide  20 million baht for each pier.</p>

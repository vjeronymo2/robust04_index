			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] An article in the 12 June Athens daily I  KATHIMERINI by the newspaper's correspondent in Berlin, Tasos  Telloglou, contended that the Greek European Union [EU]  presidency is considered "successful" by Germany, Greece's  successor. Despite the Greek embargo against The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and Greece's referral to the  European Court of Justice, it is expected that German Minister  of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel will express his satisfaction to  Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos during  the two men's meeting on 14 June. Relations between them have  been characterized by "special cordiality," according to  Telloglou, following the successful negotiations on EU  enlargement last February and the Ioannina meeting that resulted  in a successful compromise on minority blocking. This "dramatic  change," which comes after the German EU representatives stopped  communicating with Greek officials because of Pangalos'  well-known "importune" statements, contributed to an  intervention by Bonn in the FYROM and Albanian issues that was  more favorable to Greek interests. According to Telloglou, it  proves that Germany considers its relations with Greece more  important than its relationship with these two Balkan countries.  Kinkel "contributed to a more realistic" appraisal of the  problem of the embargo by adopting the view that this issue  should not define the entire Greek relationship with the EU.  Telloglou asserted that Kinkel also perceived that the Greek  Government would not compromise unless FYROM shows flexibility.  Germany's understanding would have been impossible had not  Greece shown the availability and imagination to solve some of  the problems faced by the EU, Telloglou concluded.</p>

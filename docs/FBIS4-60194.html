			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Ministry of Defense of the </F> "Democratic Republic of Yemen" on 21 May; place not given]    [Text] Our heroic armed forces were surprised at 0600 this  morning, 21 May 1994, the first day of the blessed 'Id al-Adha,  by the continuing, barbaric shelling of the forces of the war  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih along the battlefronts, Abyan,  Karish and Kharaz, in spite of the propaganda issued by the war  general that he had given his instructions to cease fire  effective noon Friday, 20 May, in response to the appeals  addressed to him by a number of national figures, Arab leaders,  and friendly countries. It is regrettable that the announcement  was no more than empty (?words) to mislead the public. It also  mislead those Arab leaders and some friendly countries who  called for the cease-fire out of respect for these sacred days  and to prevent further bloodshed of our innocent sons and brave  armed forces who found themselves in a position where they had  to defend themselves, the homeland, and the citizens on  battlefields. They are now resisting with rare courage the  forces of the war general 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih which direct  blows against them and inflict on them horrible loss of life and  equipment. These forces have begun to be defeated and are now  fleeing in different directions leaving behind them hundreds of  corpses and considerable war materiel, some pieces destroyed but  others still serviceable. The Ministry of Defense and the  armed forces wish to confirm their support for our people's sons  in the southern and eastern governorates on the declaration of  the Democratic Republic of Yemen announced by the militant  patriotic leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid. They are ready to make  sacrifices and protect the sacred land of this dear homeland  with all that is precious against anyone who conceives of  trifling with its security and stability. God give us success,  he is our best friend and supporter.</p>

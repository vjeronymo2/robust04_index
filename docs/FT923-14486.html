			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Fares rise deferred by American AMERICAN Airlines, one of the big three US carriers, yesterday postponed its planned increase in domestic fares until July 10, writes Nikki Tait. Earlier in the day, shares in most US airline stocks had climbed, in the hope that some measure of price stability was finally returning to domestic market. Fare increases were due to take effect from today. During the spring, American led the way with a pricing initiative designed to reduce dramatically the number of discount fares on offer. But this was quickly overtaken by a vicious bout of domestic 'fare wars'. The US airline industry has lost over Dollars 5bn in the past two years, and only last week Braniff, one of the smaller carriers, grounded its fleet.</p>

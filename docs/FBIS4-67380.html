			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Prof. Kirill Pavlovich Stayev, conducted by </F> Mikhail Dmitruk: "The Poor Little Princess Bit the Poisoned  Apple"    [Text] And why? Because the beauty in Pushkin's  famous fairy tale had never had "ecological literacy" training.  Incidentally, that subject, one pertaining to environmental  protection, may soon be studied by Russia's school children and  vocational students.    Adults keep on polluting the environment as if they had  no children, and as if they themselves would live forever.  Clearly the next generation will have to save itself. And adults  are already prepared to give it that chance. Recently a joint  board meeting of two Russian ministries -- education and  environmental protection -- approved a draft resolution on  recruitment of school children in ecological studies. Our  science correspondent discussed this new and extremely important  undertaking with Professor Kirill Pavlovich Stayev, State Prize  laureate, who helped prepare the resolution.    Stayev: One of the main reasons for the  thoughtless attitude toward nature is the lack of ecological  culture in Russia. It needs to be taught in school, or else it  will be too late. But ecology should not be a separate subject,  but rather a leitmotiv for all disciplines, because the most  important issue facing humanity today is the struggle for  survival in a poisoned environment.    Dmitruk: Why frighten school children with the  "environmental ulcers" that have been uncovered virtually  everywhere in Russia? If they learn of these things at a tender  age they might be psychologically traumatized, and children's  health has been undermined by environmental pollution as it is.    Stayev: The mass media are no longer concealing  the scale of environmental disaster in Russia -- and children  are aware of it, too. But in the hunt for sensational material  many journalists like to spend their time uncovering  environmental crimes and talk very little about how to deal with  their consequences. Most often children are psychologically  traumatized because they do not know how they are going to  survive in a poisoned environment. By teaching them that, we  eliminate both destructive factors, both the psychological and  the physical.    Dmitruk: Is that really possible in today's Russia?    Stayev: It is becoming possible. By a joint  decision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources and the Ministry of Education, ecology lessons are  being introduced in secondary schools and vocational schools.  These lessons are to be taught by instructors in biology,  physics, chemistry and other subjects. Through practical  exercises the children will learn about hazards to the  environment so they will be aware of how to subsequently clean  up various pollutants.    Dmitruk: But should that not be done by the  adults who work for Ministry of Environmental Protection  agencies and the public health service?    Stayev: Even school children know how well they  are coping with their jobs. Those agencies are chronically short  of people and money. Therefore even Russia's "environmental  ulcers" -- places like Norilsk, Chelyabinsk, Plesetsk and many  other "environmental disaster areas" -- have not been thoroughly  studied, much less cleaned up. But things that underpowered  organizations are not capable of doing can be accomplished by  millions of Russian school children and vocational school  students.    Dmitruk: That tremendous force can be utilized  free of charge under the banner of struggle for survival. But  lots of money will be needed for instruments, reagents and  cleaning agents for laboratory studies. Where will that money  come from?    Stayev: By decision of the two ministries it has  been recommended that regional environmental organs and  ecological funds allocate up to five percent of their total  annual funding to support environmental education.    Dmitruk: Excuse me, but in Russia not even laws  are always complied with, so mere recommendations from two  impoverished ministries can simple be ignored if it is not  advantageous to comply. What advantages can there be from  environmental education?    Stayev: Very major ones, because environmental  protection organs' funding is derived mainly from fines imposed  on enterprises that pollute the environment. The more polluters  the kids expose, the more fines professional defenders of nature  will collect. The benefit will probably be several times greater  than the five percent of funding that we recommend be allocated  for environmental education.    Dmitruk: But if this idea takes off, the mafia  structures that are now pocketing the money allocated by the  state for environmental protection are not likely to be too  happy about it. And might not the heads of enterprises that are  violating environmental protection law, to put it mildly, drop  students a "hint" that they should stop any studies that might  bring on scandals and fines?    Stayev: Today there is nothing more important for  the next generation than environmental protection. If young  people do not protect the environment, soon irreversible  processes in the biosphere capable of destroying every living  thing could begin. There can be no compromise on this point:  either we die out, or we save nature and ourselves.    We cannot sit idly by while every living thing dies. It is  not possible to halt this extinction without heroism and  self-sacrifice, and we must prepare young people for that.    Right now they are being taught to take really pointless  risks. For example, Western movies are cultivating extreme  individualism, depravity and cruelty -- that is about how to  kill, not save. A majority of children and teenagers get no  other training: the Pioneer organization is gone for good, and  the Boy Scout movement is in its infancy. Kids cannot find a  larger positive cause to unite them. The struggle to save their  Fatherland from ecological disaster could be that cause. That  struggle would fill teenagers' lives with profound meaning, a  spirit of collectivism and noble romanticism.    Dmitruk: It is not likely that pretty words will  inspire today's teenagers to undertake selfless labor, even for  the sake of saving everyone, because in recent years they have  been taught to seek instant material gratification in all things.    Stayev: And that is what we are offering kids.  Through ecology lessons they would find out about the extent of  pollution and method of decontaminating the food products they  buy in stores with their parents, buy at markets or grow in  their own garden plots. They would test sites to determine soil  acidity, water hardness and background radiation, and then bring  them down to normal levels. The knowledge and skills learned by  students could be passed on to their parents and to their  grandparents. The older generation should have a keen interest  in their kids getting environmental training.    I am referring not only to parents, but also to the heads of  enterprises. A majority of enterprises are going to be  privatized, and a good manager is always interested in the  health of his employees.    Dmitruk: In the West it has long been calculated  like this: one dollar invested in environmental protection  yields an eightfold profit.    Stayev: Yes, and therefore it will be very much to  an enterprise manager's benefit to hire graduates who have  environmental training: they will look out for their health and  for the environment. Even now owners of enterprises should be  interested in environmental training at the schools and  vocational schools from which they get new personnel. A  farsighted manager could sponsor that effort, with benefit for  himself as well.    Enterprises used to become patrons of local educational  institutions on orders from above. But prudent enterprise owners  will voluntarily be patrons of economic [sic] education in  general schools and vocational schools that will in the future  yield for them greater savings in fines paid to environmental  protection agencies and in sick days for their employees.</p>

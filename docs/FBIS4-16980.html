			<p>BFN     [Text] The point stipulating that "the sides shall call for  avoiding assessments of the events which occurred in August 1991  and October 1993 as a pretext for deepening confrontation" must  be left out of the agreement on civic accord in Russia because  it is unacceptable, according to a statement of the coordinating  council of Democratic Russia published in Moscow Wednesday.    The council supported Boris Yeltsin's initiative to develop  an agreement between the major political forces and his declared  course towards social consensus. At the same time, Democratic  Russia listed a number of conditions which, in its opinion, must  be met while developing and signing the agreement.    According to Democratic Russia, the Russian government can  be  allowed to sign the agreement only if it fulfills all its  promises to pay salaries to state workers such as servicemen,  medical and culture workers and policemen. Democratic Russia  believes that persons and political forces whose actions  violated Russian laws, who triggered and deliberately organized  mass disorders, fanned ethnic differences and called for war and  violence must not be allowed to sign the agreement.    The agreement must impose a responsibility before society  upon everyone who signs it, Democratic Russia maintained. The  movement's political council believes that the agreement should  clearly outline the obligations of all sides, including the  president, the government, the Federal Assembly, political  parties, trade unions and other social organizations.</p>

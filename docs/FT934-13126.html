			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): I'm tempted to convert the lot into cash / With political uncertainties and record p/e ratios, the past two years' progress cannot be sustained. But interest rates offer a poor alternative THE PORTFOLIO is now two years old. It was started with Pounds 10,000 in October 1991, when I was given instructions to 'aim for capital growth, without being too speculative'. That aim seems to have been achieved. But I feel it will be difficult (if not impossible) to maintain a similar rate of growth over the next two years. With continuing uncertainties in Russia and elsewhere in the world, and with price/earnings ratios of UK and US companies approaching record levels, I am very tempted to convert the entire share portfolio into cash. However, bank interest rates are currently at very low levels, so the portfolio would not derive much growth from being purely in cash. There are, no doubt, short-term gains to be made from foreign currency speculation, but this has to be ruled out, due to the modest size of the portfolio and the need to avoid the highly speculative risks that will be required to make any really significant profits. The portfolio will therefore protect itself from any sharp drop in the market by setting revised stop-loss levels for all its equity holdings. It will also seek to take advantage of any buying opportunities that might arise in the event of a general market downturn. The portfolio originally bought 8,000 Burlington shares in October last year when they were only 11.5p each. It then sold 4,000 shares in March when the shares reached 27p. Thus, the initial Pounds 920 invested in Burlington has already produced cash of Pounds 1,080. The portfolio's remaining 4,000 Burlington shares can therefore be regarded as a purely speculative holding, in the hope that a takeover approach might be made for this small company. Even at 22.5p, the company is only capitalised at Pounds 3.33m. In its interim report for the six months to the end of June, the company revealed net assets per share of 18.78p. These were mainly a portfolio of equities, gilt-edged stock, convertibles and cash. The portfolio will therefore retain its earlier stop-loss level for Burlington of 20p. Although the shares would be sold if they fell to that level, consideration will be given to buying up to 20,000 Burlington shares if they fall to around 12-14p, in the hope that, one day, a takeover may happen. (My personal pension scheme has been buying and selling Burlington shares since 1989). Norcros, too, were originally purchased on takeover hopes. When MB-Caradon sold its stake in Carnaud Metalbox for Pounds 473m in April this year, I had hoped it would use some of the proceeds to launch a bid for Norcros, because the two companies had many interests in common. Instead, Caradon paid Pounds 800m to purchase RTZ's Pillar subsidiary. I feel Caradon is unlikely to pay much (if any) attention to Norcros until it has digested Pillar. Although Norcros still has much to recommend it, I feel the takeover potential has faded, and the shares will be sold if they fall to 168-170p which, in current market conditions, seems highly likely. It is this anticipated sale that will realise cash for future purchases of shares in other companies. Pentland's performance has been rather better than the table would appear to indicate  - since, in April, the company paid its shareholders a special 12p per share dividend in order to distribute to them the majority of the Pounds 47.3m exceptional profit which it made from currency gains associated with its aborted bid for Adidas. I still regard Pentland as a good long-term hold, although if the shares fell to 80-85p they would be sold in the hope of being able to buy them back at lower levels. My personal pension scheme has a holding in Pentland. It also has a holding in William Ransom, which I still regard as a well-run company with excellent long-term prospects. But, for the portfolio, I will set a stop-loss level of 50-53p  - again in the hope of being able to buy back at lower levels. I remain equally impressed with chemicals group Allied Colloids and engineering group EIS, despite tough trading conditions. However, the portfolio would sell its holding in Allied Colloids if the shares fell to 205-210p and its holding in EIS if the shares fell to 365-370p. What would the portfolio buy? Nothing, at current levels. The portfolio has benefited in the past by being patient and waiting for shares in certain companies to fall within its desired buying range, and it hopes to repeat that process. In earlier articles, I have mentioned Meggitt, an engineering company which I feel still has many attractions, desite its rather disappointing recent results. Although the shares have not yet fallen within the earlier target range of 75-80p, I feel a general market downturn could eventually push them to that level, at which point the portfolio would consider purchasing 2,000 shares. In the spring issue, I mentioned Renishaw, a manufacturer of precision metrology and inspection equipment, as a potential buy if the shares fell to 240-250p. Again, they have not fallen to that level, despite recent results showing a 21 per cent drop in pre-tax profit and difficult trading conditions. Bear in mind that the shares were only 208p earlier this year. The portfolio will therefore consider buying 1,000 Renishaw shares if they fall to around the 205-210p level. I particularly like OIS International Inspection, and was fortunate in that a friendly stockbroker recommended them to me when the shares were placed on the stockmarket last year at 50p each, and my personal pension scheme acquired a modest holding. OIS provides technical inspection services to industrial clients to assist them in meeting regulatory requirements regarding safety, environmental risk, and component and systems failure. This seems to me to be a major area for growth, and the shares have already reached 79p this year. Despite such a rise in price, I feel OIS still has further potential, and the portfolio will consider purchasing 3,000 shares if the price falls to 60-65p. OIS might also have takeover attractions to a company like Inchcape, which operates the world's second largest testing and inspection service. There are many other companies in the UK and abroad that have considerable appeal, from Dole Food Company of the US and Hi-Tec (sports footwear and leisurewear) to a number of small, relatively unknown companies. But I feel the time is not yet ripe for further purchases, and it will be the next issue of the Review before I feel able to offer a more detailed strategy for the portfolio. The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of the Quarterly Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative. The opinions expressed are his own.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          HOW THE POUNDS 10,000 PORTFOLIO STANDS AFTER TWO YEARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Number of  Purchase    Cost     Oct 1     Oct 1 value Company            shares    price (p) (Pounds) Price (p)     (Pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Colloids    1,000        215      2,150     245        2,450 Burlington Group   4,000       11.5        460    22.5          900 EIS                  750        375      2,813     410        3,075 Norcros            3,000        158      4,740     173        5,190 Pentland           3,500         99      3,465      89        3,115 William Ransom     3,000         52      1,560      62        1,860 Cash*                                                           431 Total                                                        17,021  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Cash figure allows for interest and dividends  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: No allowance made for dealing costs.

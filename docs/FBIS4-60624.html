			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 26 May (MENA) -- PLO Executive Committee  Member Dr. Samir Ghawshah has stated that Palestinian leader  Yasir 'Arafat is currently making contacts with some members of  the Hamas Islamic movement to discuss the prospects of their  participation in the Palestinian National Authority Council.    In a statement today, Ghawshah said that the council  discussed at its preliminary meeting last night the working  program of the authority and the basics of its responsibilities.    Ghawshah added that the council also discussed the progress  made so far in Gaza and Jericho and the tasks the council should  undertake quickly in the autonomy area.    Ghawshah said that Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, member of the  Palestinian National Authority Council, submitted a working  paper on the formation of the authority and its tasks, although  she had earlier announced her refusal to take part in the  council.    Dr. Ghawshah said that 'Arafat has decided to appoint Dr.  'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, an independent democrat from Hebron in  the occupied West Bank, as a member of the council. He will be  the 19th member in the 25-member council.    Once the working program is discussed, the remaining six  members of the council will be appointed, the ministerial  portfolios distributed, and the council members will take the  constitutional oath, Ghawshah said.    He expects 'Arafat and the Palestinian leaders to enter  Jericho before 5 June, unless unexpected developments occur. He  added that the council will hold its first official meeting  today after the members residing abroad arrive.    Last night's meeting was attended by Faruq Qaddumi, head of  the PLO Political Department; Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], PLO  Executive Committee member; and Salim al-Za'nun, alias  Abu-al-Adib, acting chairman of the Palestine National Council.  These three are not members of the Palestinian National  Authority Council.</p>

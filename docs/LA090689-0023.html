			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> KCET Channel 28 has quietly canceled its gala 25th anniversary party at the  Hollywood Bowl on Sept. 28. A spokesman for Los Angeles' public TV station  cited the "inability to get the name performers that we needed on that date." A  public announcement was not made, the spokesman added, because "the show never  officially went on sale." It was, however, promoted in the September issue of  KCET Magazine featuring Rita Moreno, Robert Merrill and Big Bird. Tickets  ranged from $75-$4. "A lot of performers we hoped to get were simply not  available," the spokesman added. So the station cancelled "rather than invite  people to a second-class show." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

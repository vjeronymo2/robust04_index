			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Settlers are defiant but anxious JEWISH SETTLERS in the occupied territories, who for the past two years enjoyed unprecedented government support, reacted with a mixture of shock, defiance and disquiet to the crushing general election victory by Labour and its strongly anti-settler allies, Hugh Carnegy writes. 'People are disappointed. They are subdued and there is some anxiety,' said Ms Sondra Baras, a resident of Karnei Shomron in the northern West Bank. 'But no one is packing their bags, that's for sure. We are not going to be taken out of here and nothing is going to be dismantled.' There was no escaping the fact that the settlers, scattered in their fortress-like townships in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, were among the principal losers in the election as Israeli voters turned their backs on the right-wing ideology that fuels the drive to people all of Eretz Israel - the biblical Land of Israel - with Jews. The settlers had grown accustomed to material and political support from the Likud party since it came to power in 1977. Since mid-1990, when Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed a coalition with small far-right and religious parties, the patronage increased dramatically, led by Mr Ariel Sharon, the pro-settlement housing minister. Settler numbers in the West Bank and Gaza grew by around 20 per cent to 100,000 - excluding a further 120,000 in Arab East Jerusalem. Construction began on more than 20,000 new apartments. Overall, the government was estimated to be spending around Shk3bn (Pounds 660m) a year on settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. Now the settlers are facing a very different outlook. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour leader, supports settlement in East Jerusalem and other areas he deems important to maintaining Israel's security. But he has signalled a willingness to freeze what he calls 'political settlements' and promises to channel government funds away from them to investment within 'Israel proper'. He will face strong resistance. 'If Labour wants to freeze the settlements and conduct negotiations on a Palestinian state, the Likud and the whole nationalist camp must stop it, not necessarily in parliament but with settlements,' said Ms Geula Cohen of the Tehiya party, which lost all its three Knesset seats in the election. Ms Baras pointed out another problem for Mr Rabin. The government is pledged to buy back at state expense any of the 9,000 vacant apartments in the territories which cannot be sold by their builders.</p>

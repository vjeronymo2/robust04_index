			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Taiwan food group ahead at half-time President Enterprises, Taiwan's biggest integrated food processing and retailing conglomerate, posted preliminary pre-tax profit of TDollars 1.65bn (USDollars 62m) in the six months to June 30, up 53 per cent from TDollars 1.07bn in 1993. The increase was attributed to the TDollars 525m sale of a south Taiwan pig farm to be converted into a condominium development. Pre-tax profits in core operations, minus the land sale gain, rose 4.9 per cent on the year. Total first-half revenues edged up 2.6 per cent to TDollars 11.8bn from TDollars 11.5bn in the first half of last year. United Micro Electronics, one of Taiwan's leading integrated circuits and semiconductor manufacturers, saw preliminary pre-tax profit more than double in the six months to June 30 to TDollars 2.71bn (USDollars 101m) from TDollars 818.9m a year earlier. First-half revenues rose 65 per cent to TDollars 6.64bn.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Avoiding an IHT bill WHAT IS the inheritance tax position if a mother and a daughter have joint holdings in a property and the mother dies? I am referring here to joint holdings, not tenants-in-common. What, also, is the position of the daughter's future children? The transfer of the property interest by the mother to the daughter would attract IHT subject to an available nil rate band of up to Pounds 150,000. For property law, the property would pass to the other joint owner; but for IHT purposes, this would still be a chargeable transfer. It would be sensible to 'skip' a generation by ensuring that the property passes to the children of the daughter so that no IHT is payable on her death. Obviously, the other commercial ramifications would need to be considered for such an action. This answer was provided by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

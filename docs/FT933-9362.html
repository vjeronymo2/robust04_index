			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Tokyo stock prices rise as LDP defectors dominate new cabinet JAPAN'S new prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the head of a seven party-coalition, yesterday unveiled a conservative cabinet which promised to maintain foreign and economic policies generally in line with those of the outgoing Liberal Democratic party. Mr Hosokawa insisted his 20-person cabinet reflected a 'new era' in politics, citing the appointment of three women, one more than the previous record, two people without party political affiliations, and representatives from a range of parties, including the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party. 'We should continue what should be continued and renew what should be renewed,' Mr Hosokawa said. 'We have promised to reform Japanese politics, and we want to fulfil the people's expectations for change.' However, the influence of LDP defectors, who took the leading posts of finance, trade and industry, agriculture, defence and foreign affairs, prompted Japanese newspapers to dub the selection the 'Ozawa cabinet' in honour of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP powerbroker, now pulling strings inside the coalition. Tokyo stock prices rose after the announcement of the cabinet, which allayed fears that the new government would confront the powerful bureaucracy over economic policy. The new finance minister, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, is a former Finance Ministry official. Mr Fujii, 61, who has worked for the ministry's budget bureau, said the government would consider new stimulatory measures for a still slowing economy, but would not embark on a spending spree. 'We have no intention of using deficit-covering bonds to increase spending,' he said. The new opposition leader, Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president, complained that he could see little difference between the new government's policies and those of the LDP, which had ruled for 38 years until last week. 'I noticed that some of the new ministers appeared to be reading from notes prepared by bureaucrats. I think the public would have preferred them to do some things differently,' he said. The choice of Mr Tsutomu Hata, 57, as deputy prime minister and foreign minister completes a circle for the man who turned down the foreign minister's post not long before defecting from the LDP this year, saying his priority was political reform. The cabinet's stated policy priority is to change the electoral system within a year. Details of new Cabinet Likely policy changes assessed Hata: the lone elder statesman, Page 3</p>

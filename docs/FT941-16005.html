			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: US economy Several new highs for Wall Street in recent days support the idea that the long uptrend in equities is still intact. Still, investors in the US were rather left behind in 1993, when the S&amp;P composite index rose by only 7.1 per cent. Other markets where interest rates were falling, or growth was strong, fared much better. Now that the US recovery is gathering pace, and the output gap is being closed, the threat of higher interest rates looms. The potential for liquidity flows out of shares and back into cash is the most serious threat from rising short rates. Mutual fund flows of individuals' savings have offset the heavy supply of new issues over the past two years as companies have re-financed the leveraged buy-outs of the 1980s. Recently, however, there have been signs that the new issue market is beginning to weaken. American individuals also now hold the highest proportion of their financial assets in equities since 1972. While the secular trend towards lower inflation may have changed the basis for asset allocation, these are signs of a maturing bull market. Besides, if rising soft commodity prices are any guide, it is too early to declare inflation dead. Further rises in equities will have to be driven by strong earnings increases, particularly if modestly higher inflation and bond yields reduce the sustainable rating of equities. Higher earnings are in prospect, but with export markets still weak and US markets fiercely competitive, the potential for pleasant surprises, and thus strong performance, is strictly limited.</p>

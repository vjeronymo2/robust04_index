			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: The flamboyant tendency breaks cover - Alison Smith catches Euro-sceptic MP and author Teresa Gorman in conciliatory mood . . . almost THE LAUNCH of Mrs Teresa Gorman's book about the 'dirty tricks' endured by Tory Euro-rebels, coincided almost to the minute with the insistence from Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, that it was time to draw a line under the troubles and divisions of the past year. But while Mrs Gorman publicised her book The Bastards, by re-opening Maastricht wounds there was some evidence in what she said to support Sir Norman's assertion. The paper being carefully pasted over the cracks may just be strong enough to last the week. Mrs Gorman maintained a severely Euro-sceptic line, but said only that it was 'still an open matter' whether she would vote against the government the next time the vexed question of value added tax on domestic fuel came before the Commons. She appeared to accept that VAT on fuel would be implemented, and that the point of continuing to exert pressure was to make ministers think carefully before extending VAT further - in which she would probably be in the mainstream of party opinion. Her tone on Mr John Major's leadership has also been tempered since the summer. In August there were dark hints that unless the prime minister changed his policies then the party would change him. Yesterday Mrs Gorman said: 'I believe at the moment it would be completely inappropriate to change the leader.' While her remarks remained somewhat barbed, she said that her purpose was 'to support John Major but to try and change his mind'. Mrs Gorman's role as standard-bearer for the flamboyant tendency among the persistent rebels, makes her softening of tone especially good news for party managers, in spite of the minor controversy over whether the conference bookstall would stock her book. But her words echoed the views of one party official that although Maastricht was a real battle, VAT on fuel is not an issue over which the party will tear itself apart. Certainly the first representatives arriving at the Imperial, the conference hotel, seemed keen to avoid a public fight with the party leadership. In the bar and lounge they expressed irritation and dismay at the way in which the VAT issue had been handled, but sounded similarly disenchanted at the way some former ministers were adding to the government's difficulties. Some also believe that distaste for the media will serve the party well, with many representatives determined to deny the press a week of fireworks in the conference hall. 'There'll be headbangers on the fringe, and the representatives will give us a kicking in private,' one party worker said, 'but they'll want a good conference'. An MP with a large enough majority to be relatively detached expressed a similar view. 'You won't get a true and fair picture this week,' he said, 'what happens over the next few months is going to be much more important.'</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Finland unveils cuts in spending THE Finnish government yesterday announced plans to cut spending by FM54.2bn (Pounds 6.8bn) over the next three years. The austerity programme is designed to calm the markets following the floating of the markka on September 8 and to enable the government to restore a fixed exchange rate as soon as possible. Spending cuts of FM5.2bn are planned for next year on top of the FM13bn cuts already agreed. This is to be followed by FM16bn reductions in 1994 and FM20bn the subsequent year. This will mean an estimated fall of 3 per cent in GDP in 1994 and a further 4 per cent the following year. The government also plans to raise an extra FM3.2bn in taxes next year. It said the measures would reduce the budget deficit by FM8.4bn in 1993 to FM50bn. Black Thursday for Finnish banks, Page 26</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Food and Wine: 1,000 free dinners, or lunches, for two - No such thing as a free lunch? Oh yes there is, says former restaurateur and FT food writer Last January I persuaded 130 restaurants to offer lunch for a fiver during a fortnight at the end of the month. It was a tremendous success with our readers, and more surprisingly, with most of the restaurateurs. This year we are planning something even better. We are offering 1,000 free lunches (or dinners) for two. And all you have to do to qualify is accept a free card which entitles you to a 25 per cent discount on food and wine for any meals in any restaurant in our scheme for six months. Too good to be true? Is there really such a thing as a free lunch? In this case there are no concealed costs, conditions or strings attached for the six months. Thereafter, if you find the card useful and want to keep it, an annual fee of Pounds 35 will be charged by Transmedia, the company which is operating the scheme. Even if you have paid this fee, you may cancel your membership and get your money back at any time within the first year. The Financial Times decided to become involved in the launch of the scheme in the UK because we are convinced it offers an excellent deal for our readers, especially as I have been involved in the initial selection of restaurants. So how, exactly, does it work? The full details and application forms for the Financial Times/Transmedia restaurant card, will be published in the next Weekend FT on January 8 with the names of all the UK restaurants which have joined the scheme (more than 100 so far). No coupons will be required. The free lunches will be offered in the form of 1,000 credits worth Pounds 50. We will ballot all those who use the card between Monday January 24 to Friday February 11. Every time you use the card your name goes into the hat, so if you eat out a lot and are lucky you could win more than one free lunch. There is no limit on how many Pounds 50 credits any one reader may win. And there will be no losers, for everyone who uses the card will receive the 25 per cent discount. You use the card just like any other credit or charge card, but you must have an Access or Visa card in order to be able to apply for the Financial Times/Transmedia card. After the application is processed (up to 14 days), you will receive a directory of all the 2,200 American restaurants which accept the card and a separate listing of all the UK restaurants which have joined our promotional scheme. As more British restaurants join we will publish their names. How does it work? Very simply. The FT/Transmedia charge card will be active from the moment you receive it and can be used to sign for the full cost of any meal at any participating restaurant. This amount will then appear on your next Access or Visa statement, together with a credit for 25 per cent of the amount you have spent on food and beverages. Service and VAT charges do not attract a discount. What type of restaurants will be on the list? The full range, from those for business entertaining to those to take the family to at the weekend, including wine bars and hotel dining rooms. There will be no fast food outlets. The majority of restaurants will be in London but there are already 25 restaurants on the list outside London in Bath, Bristol, Edinburgh, Exeter, Manchester and Southampton. And, most importantly, the FT/Transmedia card will become an integral and valuable tool for anyone travelling on business or pleasure. You can apply for the FT/Transmedia card from anywhere outside the UK and use it within the next six months on your next business trip to London. Or to Boston, New York, Chicago, Palm Beach, Florida, Los Angeles or San Francisco. Is that all? Almost. Find out the full details from next Saturday's Weekend FT.</p>

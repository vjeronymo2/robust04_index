			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at S Daniels S Daniels, supplier to food manufacturing and baking industries, continued its recovery in 1993 with profits of Pounds 63,000 pre-tax compared with losses of Pounds 64,000. Mr Paul Daniels, chairman, said although the profit was modest and 'far from our future aspirations' the year saw a big investment in people and projects designed to improve future results. Sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 32.3m). Earnings per share were 0.6p (0.9p losses). The proposed single final dividend is 0.3p (0.25p). The balance sheet remained ungeared for most of the year and showed net bank balances and cash at a seasonal peak of Pounds 1.1m at the year end.</p>

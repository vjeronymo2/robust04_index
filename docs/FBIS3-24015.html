			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tetyana Khomych: "The Counselor of Rutskyy </F> Teaches Us To Live"]    [Text] Eastern Ukraine has succeeded in winning economic  independence from Kiev. As we know, Ukraine's President, in  response to the insistence of the oblast council officials and  executive authorities of four oblasts, recently signed an edict  granting regional self-government status to Dnepropetrovsk,  Donetsk, Zaporozhye, and Lugansk oblasts. To put it more  plainly, it is not yet a federative system. Politics abstracted,  the new division of Ukraine into the "potato west" and the "iron  east" is comparable to the story of the man who has a horse and  puts a high fence around his farm so that his relative who  doesn't have a horse won't be coming around to be jealous of his  prosperity.    There hasn't been much prosperity in the east yet, though,  and some might be inclined to predict that the isolation of the  technological and raw materials-rich region will make its life  harder--in which, as during the era of intensive industrial  exploitation of it to meet the needs of the former USSR  (especially metal needs), priority will go to the interests of  industry and its magnates rather than to the people.    The recent Russian media report of rolled metal sent from  Dnepropetrovsk to someone who doesn't need it in the Russian  boondocks is just one episode of this kind of "management."  Consuming the lion's share of costly energy imported from  Russia, local plants are hoarding goods for export or for  barter; and just as the ordinary local citizen got nothing from  that little contribution to the state budget, now again he'll  get the same from the contribution the regional authorities take  from Kiev. Certain officials' assurances that "the metal will  enable the region to supply itself with gasoline" are not making  many people optimistic. The opulent life of owners of official  cars running on fuel at state prices has long been a sore point.  Meanwhile, it doesn't solve others' problems.    This serves to confirm people's belief that the "economic  self-government" is beneficial only to the numerous corps of  local "party authorities," solving problems of ambition rather  than real ones. And although the authorities, as usual, answer  with annoyance that economic self-government has nothing to do  with territorial problems, the speech of officials in the  Dnieper region has been increasingly tinged with the accents of  Donetsians, who haven't concealed their intention to bring all  of eastern Ukraine into their sphere of influence. But as to who  wants to bring Donetsk into it there is no doubt.    A logical segment in this chain of events of Ukraine's new  economic reality is the invitation of a group of Russian  methodologists to Dnepropetrovsk to "formulate an optimal  conception of regional "life support." It is reported that the  group is headed by Yanovskyy, the eminent Russian economist and  former counselor of Rutskyy; the consultants also include a  number of champions from Yavlynskyy's team.    It should be added that the day before, the local press was  pushing the notion of the almost complete lack of economists in  Ukraine itself--promoted in an interview, incidentally, by none  other than former Prime Minister Kuchma. The latest collapse of  inferiority, which was in fact fostered by Kuchma's Cabinet and  "reforms," impelled the seekers of economic independence from  Dnepropetrovsk to seek rescuers for their independence in Moscow  this time, not Kiev. All for the best, of course--yet many are  afraid the lesson will follow the old programs....</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Skanska predicts profits increase Skanska, the Swedish construction and real estate group, yesterday predicted higher profits for 1994 and said it planned to increase its international operations. Mr Melker Schorling, chief executive, said the company's pre-tax profit in 1994 should be higher than the SKr1.18bn (Dollars 149.4m) level achieved last year. This was in spite of strong pressure on margins caused by the depressed Swedish construction market. The group plans to continue international expansion to reduce dependence on Sweden. 'Our aim is to continue sharply increasing our international business until it accounts for 35 per cent to 40 per cent of group revenues,' said Mr Schorling. 'By continuing our internationalisation, we will reduce Skanska's exposure to fluctuations in the Swedish construction market, while taking advantage of the growth potential that exists in many foreign markets.' Last year, non-Swedish business accounted for 23 per cent of group sales of SKr28.9bn, while in 1992 it amounted to 14 per cent of sales of SKr31.9bn. The company, Scandinavia's biggest construction group, operates in more than 30 countries and has 25 per cent of its employees working outside Sweden.</p>

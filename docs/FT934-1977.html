			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Major goes extra mile for peace The nub of the deal - British recognition that Irish unity is a legitimate aspiration in return for Irish recognition that Northern Ireland's future should be decided by a majority of its people - may have been expected. But Mr Major seems to have travelled further along the extra mile for peace than his Irish counterpart. In terms of tone and choice of language some passages of the seven-page document were genuinely startling. Sinn Fein will have to think long and hard before turning away from the open door to the democratic process the two leaders have put before it. The British government's language on the Protestant majority's veto over any change in the province's status stands out when compared with past statements. The message yesterday was that Mr Major would 'uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they prefer to support the union or a sovereign united Ireland'. Two weeks ago the words he chose in Commons exchanges were: 'There is for us one fundamental point: Northern Ireland's status as part of the United Kingdom will not change without the freely expressed consent of the people of Northern Ireland.' Three years ago Mr Peter Brooke, then Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'The Union is affirmed by the first section of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act of 1973 which declares that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part of it cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. We stand firmly by that solemn declaration and assurance.' Mr Major's 'fundamental point' has not been conceded. But the language used to convey it has been transformed. Yesterday's declaration brings the government perilously close to joining the 'persuaders' - those intent on pushing Ulster's people towards a particular solution - as ministers recently indicated they would not do. Britain's role will now be to 'encourage, facilitate and enable' an agreement 'among all the people who inhabit the island' embracing 'the totality of relationships'. The declaration amplifies Mr Brooke's ground-breaking assertion in 1990 that Britain had no 'selfish or strategic or economic' interest in the province. The government's 'primary interest', it says, is to see 'peace, stability and reconciliation'. The passages on aspirations to a united Ireland are exceptionally tortuous. But their meaning will be clear enough to set alarm bells ringing in the minds of some union-ists. The government now accepts that an agreement 'may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the island as a whole, including a united Ireland achieved by peaceful means'. In view of the suspicion with which many unionists regard the development of cross-border institutions, they may be particularly concerned about the vaguely worded commitment by the two leaders to promote co-operation between north and south 'at all levels'. Early indications were that they viewed Dublin's intention to establish a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, involving democratic parties on the island, with deep unease. Nationalists will welcome London's acknowledgement of a 'binding obligation' to pass legislation changing Northern Ireland's constitutional status if a majority of the province's people so wish. From the Irish perspective, the declaration acknowledges that imposing a united Ireland in the absence of the consent of a majority of the province's people would be 'wrong'. But it avoids any direct reference to articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution, which formalise its territorial claim, referring only to 'elements which are deeply resented by northern unionists'. Dublin's hand may also be detected both in the gentle reminder that the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement in any case recognised the need for majority consent to any change in the province's status and in the near impenetrability of some of the language recognising Northern Ireland's right of self-determination. But unionists will note that Dublin has pledged that it 'will' put forward 'and support' proposals for constitutional change in the event of an overall settlement. Such proposals would 'fully reflect' the principle of consent.</p>

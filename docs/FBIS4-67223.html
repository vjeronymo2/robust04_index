The computer data base will hold intelligence on container  cargoes, shipping and trading companies and smuggling trends. It  will enable Customs officers to identify potential targets and  alert search teams to be ready as ships dock.    Due to begin within four years, the computer would link  British ports including Southampton, Felixstowe, Liverpool and  London with Rotterdam, Antwerp, Le Havre, Hamburg and Bremen.    The link is an extension of an electronic mailing system  with  more than 200 terminals round Europe, and a container profile  scheme being used in Britain and mainland Europe. The system is  so successful that Dutch officials say they have a 50-75 per  cent success rate with every container they search.</p>

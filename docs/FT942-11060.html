			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Clinton sued over Arkansas sex claim President Bill Clinton was yesterday sued for damages by a former Arkansas state employee who alleged that three years ago tomorrow he pressed her to engage in sexual relations. The suit by Ms Paula Corbin Jones, now 29, seeks an apology and Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 514,000) in damages from Mr Clinton and from an Arkansas state trooper who, she alleges, summoned her to the then governor's hotel room in Little Rock.

Two columnists - William Safire of the New York Times and Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal - were suspicious of the suit and said Mr Clinton must be 'presumed innocent'. Mr Safire wrote: 'I mistrust sudden memories and late hits and lucrative victimhood.'</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY THEY WILL STORM THE CITADEL;  </P> <P> SHOPPING: WITH NAMES LIKE PERRY ELLIS, EDDIE BAUER, LEON MAX, BENETTON AND  OTHERS, THE CITADEL COLLECTION IN COMMERCE MAY CHANGE THE IMAGE OF OUTLET  SHOPPING.  </P> <P> Outlet stores, those no-frills operations where prices can be slashed to less  than half of retail but decor can be tackier than a garage sale, are in for an  image-enhancer.  </P> <P> Today the Citadel Outlet Collection in Commerce officially opens. This is  outlet shopping in a castle-like structure with fairy-tale turrets. And the  setting is a beautifully landscaped courtyard, flanked by palm trees and plenty  of free parking. You'd never know by looking at the colorful, imposing facade  that this is a converted Uniroyal tire plant.  </P> <P> Impressive as the outside of the center is, the main attraction is inside,  where the deals abound. Of the stores currently open (half of the total planned  42), the best include the Gap Outlet, Perry Ellis Shoes, L. Bates Contemporary  Clothing for women's sportswear by Los Angeles designer LaVonne Bates, Harve  Benard for classic women's sportswear with some large sizes, the Eddie Bauer  Outlet Store for outdoors people, and a Leon Max outlet that carries the L.A  women's wear designer's Max Studio separates.  </P> <P> There is also Prestige Fragrance for cosmetics and scents. The store carries  Orlane and Revlon, among others.  </P> <P> Future months will see the opening of such stores as Benetton, Gitano for denim  and casual sportswear, and Politix, a moderate price Euro-style menswear store.  The center is scheduled to be complete some time in the new year.  </P> <P> In most stores, merchandise is priced 30% to 70% below retail. Some carry goods  available right now at full price in department stores. Others include a mix of  current and past seasons' goods.  </P> <P> At a pre-grand opening perusal of the stores, deals abounded at the huge  13,000-square-foot Gap Outlet, the largest shop currently open in the center.  Printed pinwale corduroy Gilligan-style hats were marked down to $1.99.  Single-pocket short-sleeve T-shirts in a variety of colors were selling for  $10.50. Canvas backpacks went for $14.99, down from $32. And racks of  irregular, or imperfectly made pants, were priced at $3.99  </P> <P> The Eddie Bauer outlet was overflowing with values. Heavyweight cotton flannel  hunting shirts for men were marked down to $12.99. Women's crew-neck wool  sweaters featuring a Christmas-tree motif were priced at $39.99 each. Mens'  long-sleeve cotton T-shirts were marked at $12.99.  </P> <P> At the Leon Max outlet, one of the most beautifully designed interiors in the  shopping center, a scarf-tied rayon blouse by Max Studio, one of several of the  designer's labels, sold for $51. An ice-blue rayon jumpsuit with a tie-front  bolero was marked at $75.  </P> <P> At the Perry Ellis Shoes store, women with size 7 and 7 1/2 have the best  selection because the line features that sample size, but a wide range of sizes  is available. Flats dominate and prices aren't cheap, although shoes are marked  30% to 50% off the full price. A mock crocodile, two-toned flat was $99 and a  brown leather Grace Kelly-style handbag was $94.99, down from $135.  </P> <P> Plan on lunching elsewhere (the Citadel's food court isn't open yet) unless a  hot dog or Dove Bar will do. Most of the shops take credit cards, and return  policies on merchandise are posted inside the stores. Many offer store credit  only, so consider purchases carefully.  </P> <P> Citadel Outlet Collection, 5675 E. Telegraph Road, City of Commerce. Hours: 9  a.m. to 9 p.m., Monday through Saturday. 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday.  </P></p>

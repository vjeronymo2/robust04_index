			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFICARE, MAXICARE BREAK OFF TALKS  </P> <P> A bid by Cypress-based PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., to expand in Southern  California by acquiring bankrupt Maxicare Health Plans Inc. of Los Angeles ran  aground Wednesday after negotiations broke off.  </P> <P> In separate statements, both health maintenance organizations confirmed that  the talks ended abruptly and that no further discussions are contemplated on  PacifiCare's preliminary offer.  </P> <P> Neither company would disclose details of the offer, which was made public last  Thursday.  </P> <P> A merger would have increased PacifiCare's membership to 956,000 by adding  Maxicare's approximately 320,000 members. More important, it would have boosted  PacifiCare's already large presence in Southern California.  </P></p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / A growing interest in Islamic banking: Western banks are becoming more involved in a Dollars 50bn sector Islamic banks have been springing up all over the Middle East in the past decade, quietly collecting deposits from Moslems who like to consult the Koran before deciding where to put their money. So why is the Gulf buzzing with talk of the imminent arrival of a new Islamic bank in Bahrain? Because the bank is Citibank, which has confirmed plans to open the first full-fledged western Islamic bank next year and subscribe to the Koran's prohibition on dealing in interest. Often dismissed by the west as a fad riding on the back of Islamic fundamentalism, Islamic banking was judged by western bankers as a phenomenon confined to Islamic regions. With Citibank now in the game, the estimated Dollars 50bn (Pounds 31.6bn) industry may at last start to integrate with the world financial system. Citibank is already an expert in Islamic finance. It is among the handful of western banks that have been availing themselves of cheap Islamic deposits for more than a decade. When the Islamic banks were born in the early 1980s depositors were happy to leave their mountains of savings in current accounts. But the banks had to invest this liquidity in conservative and short-term instruments while at the same time circumventing interest. Lacking contacts and experience, Islamic bankers turned to western institutions such as Citibank to find homes for their money. It went mostly into commodity trades and trade finance deals where, in return for a fee, Citibank, for example, arranged for a trader to buy goods on Islamic banks' behalf and resell them at a mark-up. More and more western banks went hunting for Islamic money, and an estimated 10 per cent is channelled through western banks, mainly Citibank, Kleinwort Benson, ANZ Grindlays and Goldman Sachs. At the same time, spurred by the swelling of deposits at Islamic banks - Islamic funds of this kind, mostly spread through the Middle East and south-east Asia, are estimated to be growing by 10 to 15 per cent a year - commercial banks in the Gulf have opened their own 'Islamic windows' to attract religious clients. Saudi Arabia, for example, has resisted granting licences to Islamic institutions lest this highlight the fact that the kingdom's banks deal in interest. The only Islamic bank with a licence to operate is Al Rajhi Banking &amp; Investment, which for years had a monopoly on Islamic money and now boasts Dollars 6bn in deposits. But all other Saudi banks today offer Islamic products, such as commodity or trade finance funds. Faced with more choices, depositors have become more demanding. Instead of gladly leaving all their savings in current accounts, they have asked to share in the bank's profits. While interest is shunned in the Koran, profit is permitted. This has forced banks to enhance their yields, in turn squeezing the margins provided to western banks. But Islamic banks have a problem: while they continue to have plenty of liquidity, they suffer from a dearth of products that can pass muster with their religious boards which clear every transaction. Thus they will continue to seek the product innovations western banks can offer. 'What we provide is access to markets and structuring capabilities,' explains Mr Richard Duncan, director of Islamic finance at ANZ International Merchant Banking. 'We bring our expertise in the Far East to our relationships in the Gulf.' With the help of banks such as ANZ, Gulf Islamic banks have managed in the past two years to branch out of trade finance and into longer term and more profitable asset-based transactions. Leasing is at the top of acceptable Islamic products - Islamic banks can buy the equipment and sell it in instalments. Three years ago, 0.4 per cent of Al Rajhi's assets were invested over five years, compared with 10 per cent in 1993. ANZ last year arranged for Al Rajhi to lend Dollars 92m in bridge finance to Pakistan's Dollars 1.9bn Hub Power project, one of the largest privately owned power projects implemented on a build-own-operate basis in the developing world. Al Rajhi bought equipment on Hub Power's behalf and resold it on a deferred payment basis. ANZ also tapped Islamic money recently to arrange a Dollars 300m three-year finance of raw material purchases for a New Zealand company. Since 1989 ANZ has arranged for 10 deals each worth Dollars 100m, says Mr Duncan. Islamic institutions are slowly acquiring expertise of their own, by recruiting western trained professionals and offering them handsome pay packages. The most vibrant of newcomers is Kuwait's The International Investor, an Islamic merchant bank set up in 1992 with Saudi and Kuwaiti institutional shareholdings. TII, which has Dollars 900m under management, will be looking to OECD-country banks to source deals in the west and the Far East but it can do without them in the Middle East. Last year TII raised Dollars 450m in Islamic money to finance leases for seven Kuwait Airways aircraft. The bank is now helping Merrill Group of the US raise Dollars 50m to build a wind power generation plant in Egypt. Faced with increased competition for Islamic money, but secure in the knowledge that there is plenty more to tap, Citibank, say Islamic bankers, is hoping to gain an edge by going directly to itors. It is unlikely that small religious depositors will flock to the doors of a western bank, however Islamic it claims to be. Perhaps with this in mind, Citibank says it will target private individuals and institutions who want to follow the Koran's teachings but are interested in making some money. Though returns offered by Islamic institutions have improved in recent years, they often remain below those offered by commercial counterparts. Kuwait Finance House, which claims a 15 per cent share of all deposits in Kuwait, has been paying a 5.6 per cent return this year on deposits of more than 30 days compared with commercial Kuwaiti banks' 7 per cent rate, according to Cyprus-based Capital Intelligence, a research group. (Though quoted as an interest rate, Kuwait Finance House's 5.6 per cent rate is based on profit sharing). 'If you make a living without having to fight for it, why go into tougher business?' Mr Adnan Al Bahar, chairman of TII, said. 'As Islamic banks become more competitive and offer competitive yields, the industry will grow.' The growth of Islamic finance, however, also requires the establishment of Islamic capital markets, where long-term assets on banks' books are turned into tradeable securities and where banks can find daily liquidity. Malaysia has made strides towards this goal. The government has promoted the establishment of Islamic banks alongside commercial ones and has set up an Islamic interbank market. This is unlikely to happen in the Gulf, where banks are spread across borders and a product deemed Islamic by one bank is heresy for another. As one expert in Islamic banking put it: 'The problem is that there is no standard interpretation of the sharia (Islamic law). How can you have a market if not everybody agrees which products are Islamic?'</p>

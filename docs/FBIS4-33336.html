			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Cordoba Governor] Eduardo Angeloz began an  obstacle race against the clock on 1 June. At the UCR [Radical  Civic Union] executive committee offices on 1 June, he was  installed as head of the brand new Political Action Committee.  The committee is made up of 25 men who represent a variety of  UCR internal factions.    Angeloz announced that "he is willing to accept" an  electoral  alliance for the 1995 presidential election based "on common  principles" with other political parties that "share our concern  over our country's social situation." Nevertheless, he said he  would decide on his possible presidential candidacy after the  UCR is reorganized.    The Political Action Committee will be responsible for  presenting within 90 days an ambitious project aimed at turning  the UCR "upside down" and totally reorganizing it in order to  overcome the deep crisis prompted by various electoral defeats  and the storm provoked by the Olivos Pact [between UCR President  Raul Alfonsin and President Carlos Menem on constitutional  reform].    Yesterday was a key day for the Cordoba governor. His  presidential candidacy largely depends on his success in this  effort. At the UCR executive committee offices, Angeloz managed  to gather the representatives of almost all UCR internal  factions. San Isidro Mayor Melchor Posse smartly encouraged the  cheerful participation of a large number of party members who  constantly applauded and cheered Angeloz.    [Senator] Fernando de la Rua was the only one absent. He is  convinced that the Political Action Committee, devised by  Angeloz and approved by Alfonsin, conceals an agreement between  Angeloz and Alfonsin since no deadline has been established for  Alfonsin's early departure as UCR head. De la Rua refused to  participate [in the committee]. In the eyes of other UCR  people, he seems to be the only one hoping to become the  anti-Alfonsin opposition leader. [passage omitted]</p>

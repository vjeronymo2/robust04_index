			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> RAINBOW WARRIORS HOPE FOR LOW SCORE  </P> <P> Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner figures he knows what it will take to beat the Aztecs  Saturday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> "I think for us to win, it has to be a fairly low-scoring game," Wagner said  Tuesday in a conference call.  </P> <P> "We're not going to win if the score is in the mid-30s or higher, I don't  think."  </P> <P> The Rainbow Warriors are ranked first in the WAC in total defense, allowing an  average of 306 yards a game.  </P> <P> SDSU, though, is ranked second in the WAC in total offense, averaging 490 yards  a game. And on the heels of a 66-14 pounding of Utah, the Aztecs are feeling  particularly confident this week.  </P> <P> "Offensively, we might be close to Brigham Young or Houston, where the balance  in our offense is difficult to defend," Luginbill said. "It doesn't matter who  we're playing." SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Electronics in the dock - Singapore's courtroom of the future Perry Mason probably would not approve. Rumpole of the Bailey would hate it. Singapore recently unveiled its latest high technology creation - the so called court of the future, dominated by computers and video conferencing, rather than files and shuffling clerks. Singapore is trying to computerise most aspects of government business. Now its technicians from the state controlled National Computer Board (NCB) have moved into the court room. Though Singapore no longer has a jury system, its justice system still resembles the old colonial British model, with judges taking endless notes in longhand, lawyers shuffling mountainous files, assistants carrying weighty legal tomes. 'The first thing we want to try and do is use technology to organise paperwork and procedures in court,' says Joseph Teo of the NCB. 'Everything would be digitised and fed on to the judge's computer. The court system would become paperless and there would be instantaneous transcription of proceedings.' Teo is one of a handful of NCB technicians behind a scheme called Court Vision 21, billed as the most ambitious court computerisation plan under way in Asia. 'In time we want to try and move into virtual courts - which would allow people the freedom to transact court matters from offices and homes.' says Teo. Though this sounds futuristic, similar experiments are already under way in the US, Canada and Australia. Teo and his technicians feel they have an advantage in implementing such systems in Singapore. The island state is small, with a population of under 3m. Singapore has a high degree of computer literacy: about 30 per cent of households have computers. Ten years ago Singapore had only about a thousand computer professionals. Now it has 14,000. The NCB plans to have fibre optic cables connected to every home and office by early next century. Teo demonstrates how a robbery trial might take place in years to come. The prosecution would be able to present its case on a large television screen through using a series of icons describing how and when the robbery took place. The icons could be animated and there would be sound. And, for example, a witness could give his or her statement via a video conferencing link with Hong Kong. IBM and other companies have helped NCB come up with the equipment to make the court of the future work. A range of 'litigation support software' is used to allow the judge - who need not necessarily be in court - to call up on his personal computer both evidence and exhibits through a variety of multimedia tools. The court has access to other computer aids: 'SING' - Sentencing Information Guide System' - allows instant storage and retrieval of documents in the form of text, video, image and voice. In a jury system, members could, while making their decision, have instant access to voice testimony, exhibits or specific areas of the prosecution or defence cases presented. Lawyers and judges can also call up Lawnet, a database containing Singapore's laws. All past court decisions will also be available through the computer network. The system has several advantages: it would be likely to speed up court proceedings dramatically. Juveniles would no longer have to go through the trauma of going to court - they could give evidence from their homes. Singapore is already implementing computer-based systems for hearing applications for bail, eliminating the time and money it takes to bring a prisoner to court. But there are also some serious reservations about the system. For one thing delivery of testimony via video is not now admissible in Singapore's courts. The NCB says that the Singapore Chief Justice and other figures in the judiciary have been very supportive and it is hopeful that handicaps to the implementation of interactive courts can be overcome. The system, however, asks a great deal of lawyers and judges. They would not only have to be experts on the law, they would have to become computer technicians as well. The clash between one of the world's oldest professions and one of the most modern could be a painful one. The court of the future might speed up the legal system. But digital justice could make the judicial system seem very inhuman and distant. It could also make going to court more expensive. In many countries the judiciary worries that the person with the most expensive lawyer has too many advantages. In the court of the future a defendant might find he or she not only needs a good lawyer, but also that a good multimedia presenter could be a great asset. Singapore's aim is to have everyone plugged in to the information superhighway. The NCB says that Singaporeans will increasingly use computer technology to carry out a wide range of chores, like shopping or banking. They will then have more 'discretionary time' to do other things. Singaporeans are having to accept computer technology in many areas of activity. In 1996 Singapore plans to introduce the world's first electronic road pricing system, with motorists being automatically charged, through an electronic card fixed to their vehicles, for driving on certain roads 'People in Singapore are very technology orientated,' says Teo. 'That is in our favour as we try to introduce multimedia into the courts. The changes are bound to bring problems. It is a question of taking one trench at a time.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Avinash Singh] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, 19 April -- Further trials of the  indigenously-developed intermediate range missile, Agni, have  been postponed indefinitely. The temporary capping of the Agni  missile programme is being attributed to a financial crunch.    The Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) had  sought Rs. [rupees] 50 crore to conduct three more test launches  in the near future, but the Government has not responded to the  request. The postponement of the Agni programme is being  interpreted as a concession to American concern about India's  missile programme.    The Clinton Administration has demanded that India's  short-range missile, Prithvi, which is ready for induction in  the armed forces, should also not be deployed. Army sources,  however, say that they do not have any specific instructions  about Prithvi as yet.    Defence sources further claimed that India was not going to  abandon its strategic missile programme under American pressure,  but admitted that some delays would now be inevitable. Agni has  been successfully test-launched thrice between 1989 and 1994.  But at least six more tests are needed before it can be  considered for deployment.    Meanwhile, India is learnt to have finalised purchase of 30  fourth generation MiG-29M fighter aircraft from Russia. These  highly sophisticated, look-down-and-shoot-down planes are  equipped with the Doppler radar system which function in all  weather conditions.    The finalisation of the MiG-29M deal is evidently India's  response to the proposed sale of 38 F-16 deep-penetration  aircraft to Pakistan by the U.S. The MiG-29's will be acquired  in two batches, with a score of planes joining the Indian Air  Force over a three-month period starting in May.    Known for their extreme manoeuvrability and high visibility  range, the fly-by-wire Tumansky R-33D turbo engine-fitted  MiG-29M's are rated to be better than the F-16's in most  respects, except for their armament load capacity. The Russian  planes, however, cost a fraction of their American counterpart,  and the price of the MiG deal is estimated at Rs. 270 crores.    There is every possibility that India may start getting the  MiG-29M even before the U.S. Senate gives the nod for supply of  F-16's to Pakistan.    Highly placed sources confirmed that the purchase order for  MiG-29M's was placed during the visit of Army Chief General B.C.  Joshi to Moscow in March this year. However, officials in South  Block said the Chief of the Army Staff had gone to Moscow to  hold talks on spares that have not been forthcoming since the  disintegration of the former USSR.    But the officials did not rule out the possibility of buying  MiG-29M's to augment the MiG-29 fleet. The Mikoyan series  aircraft are comparable to the American F/A-18 Hornets. They  are very effective against low-flying targets because of the  shoot-down facility.    The MiG-29's have a combat radius of 1,150 km (620 nautical  miles) in a single sortie as compared to the F-16's 845 km. The  Russian aircraft has a maximum speed level of mach 2.23, which  is equal to 2,335 kmph or 1,260 knots.    The F-16's, however, have nine external pylons and can carry  an armament load of up to 4,700 kg. This is more than the  MiG-29's capacity of 3,600 kg, which are loaded on to six pylons.    But the MiG-29's are fitted with AA-10 and AA-11 air-to-air  missiles and also have additional cavities to carry bombs and  rockets. The Doppler radar and a six-barrel 30 mm Gattling-type  guns are the other distinct features of the MiG-29.    Meanwhile, it is understood that India has sorted out the  problem of spares for the armed forces. Sources disclosed that  India okayed the MiG-29M deal only after an assurance that the  Bangalore-based Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) would serve  as the service outlet for all types of MiG's for the entire  South and South-East Asia region.    Sources in the South Block said India was in the process of  selling a particular series of the aircraft to Malaysia, whose  Air Force personnel were trained in Pathankot recently.    India is also in the process of negotiating with the  Malayasian Government on the sale of Russian Mi-25 attack  helicopters. These helicopters are used for anti-armour warfare  and can provide an airborne platform to achieve tactical battle  area supremacy. The Mi-25 is believed to be an answer to the  American Cobra helicopter.    Meanwhile, Agni, successfully test-launched twice, has  signalled India's emergence as a growing power in the entire  Asian region. The 1,800-2,500 km range missile can cover a large  part of China, West Asia and South Asia.    Even if the Americans are likely to use every means to make  India sign the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT),  ministerial sources said India would not under any circumstances  abandon its missile programme. But the sources did not rule out  a delay in the missile plans.    While the Agni continues to be India's best bargaining  block,  the Prithvi missiles are ready for induction in the Army.</p>

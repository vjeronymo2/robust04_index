			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Advance payment of fuel bills advised - Benefits Consumers are advised to pay fuel bills in advance, in spite of the measures introduced to offset April's rise in value added tax on domestic heating from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. The main beneficiaries of the measures appear to be pensioners, although they will also help people receiving benefit. Mr Kenneth Clarke, compromising after recent calls for the waiving of the second phase of the VAT increase, said the benefits would offset the tax for many people. The government has set aside Pounds 10m for home insulation grants and increased the cold-weather payment - the benefit payable after seven successive days of zero temperatures - from Pounds 6 to Pounds 8.50 a week. From next year retirement pensions will rise to help offset VAT on fuel. Single pensioners will get an extra Pounds 52 and couples Pounds 73. The element to offset VAT will rise to Pounds 68 and Pounds 96 respectively from 1996. Tax experts say consumers should still try to pay as much as possible of future fuel bills by March 31, before the 9.5 per cent rise comes into effect. The chancellor said that Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, would today announce changes in the benefits system designed to boost the public purse. Local authorities will be capped on the level of housing benefit they can pay tenants renting from private landlords. Authorities will not be fully reimbursed for benefit significantly above the average for the area and type of property. Mr Lilley will also announce more limits on income support for mortgages. Support will not be available for the first nine months on most mortgages taken out after October 1995. New mortgage holders of working age will be expected to insure mortgage interest payments against periods of sickness and unemployment. The Budget also made provisions to encourage the long-term unemployed back to work - and to encourage employers to take them on. From April 1996 employers will have a National Insurance contributions holiday, while the jobseekers will gain by the speeding of the payment of family credit to those moving into employment. The back-to-work bonus, announced by Mr Lilley in October, will be exempt from income tax.</p>

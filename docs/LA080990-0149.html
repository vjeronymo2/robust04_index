			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO DAMAGES FOR AIRPORT NOISE  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court has refused to overturn an appeal court decision  denying homeowners near Burbank Airport the right to collect damages for  emotional distress or property damage caused by aircraft noise, airport  officials announced this week.  </P> <P> The high court ruling leaves 600 plaintiffs from Burbank, North Hollywood and  Sunland with "no more avenues of appeal that we can see" in the 7-year-old  case, said Erich Luschei, attorney for the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport  Authority.  </P> <P> Supreme Court justices gave no reason for refusing to reopen the case, airport  spokesman Victor J. Gill said Monday.  </P> <P> In May, the plaintiffs' attorney, John J. Schimmenti, expressed little hope  that the state high court would take up the appeal but said that he would try  nonetheless.  </P> <P> He was not available for comment.  </P> <P> In the suit, plaintiffs contended that planes using the airport inflict noise  on their houses, lowering their property values.  </P> <P> They argued that this amounted to "inverse condemnation" -- the practical  equivalent of a government agency taking away property by condemning it -- and  that they should be compensated.  </P> <P> But attorneys for the airport convinced a trial judge in 1988 that noise from  the airport peaked in 1973 and has since declined as a result of the  introduction of quieter jets.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Robert I. Weil ruled that, under state law, homeowners  could not file suit after 1978, five years from the point at which noise  reached its highest level.  </P> <P> Most of the cases were filed in 1983, five years after the authority bought the  airport from Lockheed Corp. and a decade after the noise peaked.  </P> <P> Weil further ruled that, since the cases were not filed within the prescribed  time, the airport had acquired a "prescriptive avigation easement" -- a  permanent right to continue flying over the affected properties.  </P> <P> In May, a state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles upheld Weil's ruling that denied  property damages and also found for the airport on the lesser issue of  emotional damages.  </P> <P> Weil had ruled that the handful of plaintiffs who live close to the airport in  an area where noise levels exceed state standards could sue for personal  injury.  </P> <P> However, the appeal court ruled that, since the airport had acquired avigation  easements, it "cannot thereafter be required to compensate the plaintiffs for  its use of the easement."  </P> <P> Luschei said that the next step will be a hearing before Weil, probably in  October, at which the authority will request the dismissal of all claims.  </P> <P> He said the authority, as part of a cross-complaint, will ask Weil to order  that "a declaration of the airport's right to continue operating at its  historical, or highest known, noise level" be recorded on the title of each of  the nearly 300 properties owned by plaintiffs.  </P></p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Observer: IO Ewes Being fleeced by the bank is now a regular experience for farmers in south-west China. Formed in 1989, their state-financed bank in Sichuan province deals solely in sheep. It buys high-quality ewes to lend to the farmers, who then hand over wool as interest until they have bred enough of their own ewes to repay the loan in kind. The result, says the official Xinhua news agency, is a near halving of the local population living below the poverty line. If Premier Major wishes to set up a similar outfit to cushion the effects of recession in Britain, there's an obvious candidate to run it  - Baaclays.</p>

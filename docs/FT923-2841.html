			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / National commercial radio launch delayed THE RADIO Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, has decided to postpone the launch of Britain's third national commercial radio station until the spring of 1995. According to Lord Chalfont, the authority chairman, the delay is partly because of the recession but mainly to allow 'a kind of orderly progress in the development of the radio regime.' A spring 1995 launch will be about a year later than would be possible if the franchise - INR 3 - was advertised and licensed as quickly as possible. Mr Stuart Francis, chairman of the Association of Independent Radio Companies, yesterday attacked the Radio Authority decision to delay the launch of INR3 as 'sad and disappointing.' Mr Francis said the original hope was to use the launch of three national commercial stations to raise the profile of commercial radio and increase its share of national advertising revenue from its present 2 per cent. The decision means the BBC's 24-hour news station planned for 1994 will be on the air before the third independent national station joins Classic FM and Independent Music Radio, the pop music station. The Radio Authority said it was going ahead with advertising five new regional licences covering an audience of about 12m. There would also be two new licences for the Greater London area and other licences in Manchester, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Mr Francis said his association had wanted the national stations in place before the regional companies were launched. 'If you have a plan you should stick to it,' he said. The regional stations covering areas such as Central Scotland, the north-west and the west Midlands will compete with existing local stations. Mr Francis said: 'The national stations offer a chance of attracting genuine new money to radio.' The Radio Authority was influenced in its decision by market research suggesting it would take time for commercial radio to increase its slice of overall advertising revenue significantly. Lord Chalfont said one company could apply for and run all five regional stations and even employ a similar format for each, but such an operator could not also run a Greater London station, since this would amount to a national network by the back door. The Radio Authority also confirmed plans to re-advertise 130 existing commercial radio licences over the next three years, starting next month with Aberdeen.</p>

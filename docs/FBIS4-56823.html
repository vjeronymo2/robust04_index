			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Part I of two-part article by Alejandro E. Martinez Cuenca] </F> <H5>  [5 Apr p 7] </H5>   [Text] As the month of March drew to a close, we once again  saw the public agenda marked by debate on the economy.    Nevertheless, the most striking thing that happened all  month  long was a sinister and unnoticed circular that the recently  appointed board of directors of the National Development Bank  (BANADES) sent to all producers enjoying access to that  institution's services. The circular in question stated that  effective 31 March, two options were being presented for all  credits heretofore contracted for: either seek the protection of  clause on the maintenance of value at an annual rate of 14  percent or, if the producer did not respond in writing before  the fateful date in question, continuation of his credit without  any maintenance of value, but at a new rate of interest that  would no longer be 17 percent annually, but rather, 29 percent  and subject to quarterly review!    After doing a lot of addition, subtraction, multiplication,  and division, those who received the circular were surprised to  see that no matter which of the two options offered by BANADES  they chose, their individual situation would tend to get worse.  They naively wondered whether the bank had not perhaps made a  mistake because they were asking for help, not for their  situation to get worse!    If, with a rate of 17 percent they were already on the brink  of the abyss, either one of the two options now being presented  to them was actually only asking whether they preferred to  plunge to a valley a thousand meters below them or land in a  rocky river 2,000 meters down! In either case, they would fall  and be killed, no matter what!  <H5>  Borrow 100 and Give Back 200 </H5>   If the bank loaned a specific producer let us say 100,000  cordobas in 1992 to make some improvements in his plan of  production, a loan to be paid off in five years with a one-year  deferment, the fateful notice informed him that, effective 31  March, instead of repaying 167,997 cordobas for the 100,000 that  the bank had loaned him in 1992, he now had the option of paying  192,000 if he did not apply for the clause on the maintenance of  value, or 196,000 if he did, in which case the reward would be  that his interest would be lowered from 29 to 14 percent.    The lack of logic in the "logic" had peaked. The producer  had  merely to pick the type of terrain on which his dead body would  finally rest!    In the meantime, the government insisted there was no other  alternative because otherwise, it would have to grant subsidies  or report losses causing it to fail to meet its commitments.  Both government and private bankers backed the state's logic,  arguing that it had to build up its capital and could not absorb  losses incurred by keeping that body now on the brink of the  abyss alive.    After all, for the "efficient" government technocracy and a  few of those bankers, fate had decreed that death would indeed  occur and they thought this was just fine. After all, they do  not think the "productive" sector knows how to work, is  inefficient, and lives off the trough, having started to do so  long before 25 February! It has always done so, failing to pay  back debts or its taxes and diverting securities.  <H5>  Confidence? </H5>   The logic that arises out of an understanding of the  phenomenon of Nicaragua is that there are several reasons why  the productive sector is broke. The undeniable fact is that it  is broke and will require a great deal of effort and support if  it is to become a driving force of the Nicaraguan economy.    In addition, an atmosphere of confidence must be created in  the country in order to make it possible for the measures which  the government is taking to yield fruit within an as-yet  undetermined length of time.    And yet, what the circular did was to attack both premises,  officially confirming that not even the government or its  institutions have confidence in themselves.    If the producer in our example, which might be one of those  affected by the new provision, is involved more in domestic  production rather than in activities strictly aimed at exports,  his calculations are in cordobas rather than dollars. He takes  in and spends cordobas. Under the new BANADES policy, this same  producer is being asked--if he does not opt for maintenance of  value--to pay, rather than 67,997 cordobas in interest in six  years (which is already killing him!), the sum of 92,000  cordobas in six years, while also amortizing the 100,000 loaned  to him.    If this producer should opt for the 14-percent rate, his  interest payment will go from 67,997 to 69,354 cordobas.  However, the principal he has to amortize would go from 100,000  to 127,064, meaning that he would end up paying a total of  196,419 cordobas.    In both cases, the bank and the government deplete the  producer's capital!  <H5>  [6 Apr p 9] </H5>   [Text] In drawing up the table below, we based our figures  on the assumption that during the 1994-1998 period, the policy  of devaluation would continue as it has worked so far, with a  slip of 12 percent in the rate of exchange annually. This would  mean that, on 31 March of every year, the rate would be 7.28 per  dollar in 1995, 8.15 in 1996, 9.13 in 1997, and 10.23 in 1998.    If the government had confidence in the soundness of its  policies and we turned the payments into dollars based on the  previously mentioned rates, the bank could even lower the  17-percent interest rate without any maintenance of value and  still recover the entire loan of 100,000 cordobas granted  (equivalent to $20,000). This would be logical if what one  wanted to do were to recapitalize the productive sector. For  this precise purpose, the government takes in enormous amounts  of foreign aid in gifts and on extremely soft terms.    As a result of the BANADES board of director's circular, a  producer loaned the equivalent of $20,000 in 1992 is now being  asked to pay, instead of the $22,037 that he would have to pay  if the interest rate stayed at 17 percent and without any  maintenance of value, the sum of $25,000 without applying for  any maintenance value and nearly $25,200 with it.    In other words, there was no need to change the terms of the  credits since, as demonstrated here, neither the government nor  the bank lost anything based on the situation existing before  the circular.    By its own action, BANADES has made it clear that: either  they are not confident that the rate of exchange will behave in  this manner--in which case it would be introducing a factor of  great instability that attacks its own logic, by encouraging the  people to doubt the magnitude of future devaluations--or the  government and its institutions have truly not understood the  meaning of the need to capitalize the sector called upon to be  the driving force of the Nicaraguan economy.    If the priority is to save the productive sector, no one is  asking who will pay for the medicine. After all, if we seek such  a reply, we might come to the tragic conclusion that if this  government cannot, then the best thing for it would be for the  patient to die and get it over with! Which is unacceptable and  demonstrates an absolute lack of logic.    If our producers have no capital left, the government must  make a commitment to contribute to their capitalization. This  cannot be done based on short-term planning or within the  framework of an account-based, strictly commercial vision in  which everything must come together simultaneously and without  giving time a chance to do its work. It may be that today,  applying medicine implies having to leave an account receivable  for a later date in exchange for curing the patient.    This would be the most logical thing of all and yet they are  asking precisely the opposite. What the notorious BANADES  circular does is merely give them a choice of what type of bed  their falling body will finally come to rest in, rather than the  prospect of life and progress!  <H5>  Finally, Some Advice </H5>   Before choosing your final resting place, dear producer, I  would advise you to consider the following:    1--The credits that you have received do not necessarily  have  the same makeup and structure. Consequently, analyze every  credit individually before choosing a single option from those  offered to you by the bank. You will find that no single rule is  the best for all cases, except the rule telling you to get out  of all the credits you can as soon as possible.    2--If your credit has at least five more years to run and  amortization is set up to be accelerated in the final years, it  will then be to your advantage to choose the option of not  maintaining value even if you have to pay 29 percent in interest  annually. However, if your amortization schedule is uniformly  prorated, it may be more advantageous to choose the option of  maintaining the value at 13 percent as your final resting place.    In either case, neither of the options is a good one, but  one  can at least choose the lesser evil!

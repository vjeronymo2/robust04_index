			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / BIL selling 30% stake in Mount Charlotte BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment group, is selling 30 per cent of Mount Charlotte Investments, Britain's second largest hotel chain, for Pounds 227.5m. BIL took control of Mount Charlotte last year following a takeover bid for the 14,000-room hotel chain. It is selling the 30 per cent stake to two Singapore government agencies responsible for foreign investment. The two groups, Temasek Holding and Government of Singapore Investment, will also subscribe to new BIL shares, providing the New Zealand group with about NZDollars 126m of additional funds. BIL chief executive Mr Paul Collins said the links were with 'canny' Singaporean investors planning a long-term relationship which would help correct BIL's debt position. BIL is selling the Mount Charlotte shares at 85p each compared with last year's takeover price of 73p. Its new share issue represents around 4.7 per cent of the company. Mr Collins said a group of 10 Singaporean investors had toured the UK assessing the merits of each hotel. He said that BIL might eventually dispose of a further 20 per cent of Mount Charlotte. Talks had not been held on selling further Mount Charlotte shares to the Singaporeans, although the Mount Charlotte management was delighted with their involvement. The Singaporeans planned to increase their shareholding in BIL to 10 per cent, as market conditions permitted. A Singaporean representative would be appointed to the BIL board.</p>

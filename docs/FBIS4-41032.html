			<p>BFN     [Text] On 16 June, Leonid Kuchma, one of the candidates  for Ukraine's president, visited Kharkov. At the news  conference he pointed out that the Interregional Bloc of Reforms  had been a declaratory structure and attempts had failed to form  a party on its basis.    Speaking about the election of Vitaliy Masol to the post of  Ukraine's prime minister, Kuchma voiced his discontent, saying  that "in economic terms this was a step back."    Leonid Kuchma stated that he was not sure whether he would  be  able to win the elections and suggested that Leonid Kravchuk  might become the winner.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dangerous Anti-DPRK Outbursts of U.S. Warmaniacs" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The U.S. defense  secretary, Perry, said recently that the United States was  examining steps to shorten the time needed for the preparation  of the dispatch of U.S. aircraft carriers to the Korean  peninsula and increase the stockpile of ammunition of the U.S.  Forces stationed in South Korea and Japan, reported THE  WASHINGTON POST May 12.    Perry and other U.S. brasshats cried that "a war must be  imagined", threatening "sanctions" against the DPRK, the paper  said.    On the 14th of May, Woolsey, director of the U.S. Central  Intelligence Agency, at a meeting held in Boston openly argued  that the U.S. intelligence agents should be "infiltrated" into  the DPRK "in the disguise of forwarding agents or seamen" over  the "nuclear issue".    U.S. President Clinton in his recent interview with the U.S.  CNN TV, taking issue with the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the  DPRK, declared that "a decisive stand" would be taken in the  U.S.- led international moves for a solution to it.    These facts prove that the United States is bringing the  situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war,  invariably pursuing the policy of stifling the DPRK.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Letter: County of Cleveland enjoys favourable profile among electors Sir, May I take issue with one point in John Authers' otherwise accurate summary of the current difficulties in local government re-organisation ('Council reformer meets resistance', 26 July). The County of Cleveland is not unpopular with its electors. The Mori opinion poll commissioned by the Local Government Commission established that Cleveland has one of the highest levels of county identity in all of the nine areas so far reviewed. County identity in Cleveland is comparable, for example, with North Yorkshire and a little higher than other traditional counties such as Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire and Derbyshire. Incidentally, it is twice as high as county identity in Avon, created at the same time as Cleveland in 1974. In another equally independent study, the University of Birmingham examined satisfaction with county council services. Although precise comparisons were impossible, given differences in purpose, timing and wording of different surveys, it did become clear that satisfaction with county services in Cleveland is among the highest recorded in England. May I make it clear that we are nevertheless not arguing for the survival of the county council despite much misinformed comment to that effect. We wish to put right the mistakes of 1974. That is why we are supporting the creation of a new local authority to reflect the identity of Teesside, which was lost in 1974, and a second authority based on the present borough of Hartlepool, which also lost its general powers as a result of the 1974 re-organisation. It is interesting that, in the same Local Government Commission survey, levels of identity with Teesside were in fact even greater than those of the county council. This is a proposition which strikes the right balance between cost and community identity. The proposition now has support from every large business organisation in the area, including the Confederation of British Industry, as well as hundreds of individual companies. It is supported by many community organisations including parish councils, senior health professions, organisations representing people with disabilities and thousands of individual Teessiders.

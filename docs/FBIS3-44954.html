China's advisory body on transitional matters--the Preliminary  Working Committee (PWC)--put forward the radical proposal  yesterday, to counter a potential legal vacuum which members say  could cripple Hong Kong for between three to six months.    The proposal resolved to ask the National People's Congress  to authorise the Preparatory Committee to make laws until a  permanent legislature is established. China has said it will  dissolve the Legislative Council in 1997, leaving the territory  without a law- making body.    It is believed it will take China between three to six  months  to set up a new government after 30 June 1997. But a  legislative vacuum will only exist if China decides to change or  abolish existing Hong Kong laws. If no changes are made there  will be a parliamentary recess until the new Legislative Council  is formed. The PWC's legal group will conduct a review of Hong  Kong laws and recommend if any need to be changed under Chinese  rule.    In a heated debate during the PWC's meeting yesterday  members  also planned to grant the chief executive power to proclaim  interim legislation. Some members argued that under the Basic  Law the Preparatory Committee did not have the power to take on  the role of the legislature. But others said the committee's  task was to deal with issues concerning the formation of the  first government.    China threatened to abolish the through train principle and  dissolve the Legislative Council following the breakdown of  Sino- British talks on Hong Kong's political future.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. SUES TV STATION FOR SEX BIAS  </P> <P> The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed a sex discrimination  lawsuit against a Baltimore TV station accused of firing an anchorwoman because  she demanded the same pay as her male counterparts.  </P> <P> Officials said the lawsuit Monday against WBAL and parent company Hearst Corp.  is the first such action by the federal agency against a TV station.  </P> <P> EEOC Chairman Evan Kemp Jr. said the agency found that former anchorwoman Ruth  Ann Miller was paid less than her male counterparts for similar duties and  fired in 1989 because she demanded equal pay.  </P> <P> Miller earned $141,000 a year when fired, compared to $170,000 and $180,000 for  two male colleagues, the EEOC said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed in federal court, also claims Miller was given different  assignments and faced increased scrutiny of her clothes and hairstyle because  she is a woman. The lawsuit seeks back wages and an equal amount in damages.  </P></p>

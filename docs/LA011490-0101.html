			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA FINDS PACE TO ITS LIKING;  </P> <P> LIONS: SAN DIEGO TRIES TO RUN, BUT IT CAN'T KEEP UP WITH GATHERS AND KIMBLE IN  119-112 VICTORY.  </P> <P> What, Paul Westhead worry?  </P> <P> Nah.  </P> <P> The man has seen a lot of baskets in his five years at Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> So there was little cause for concern when an exuberant University of San Diego  team began pressing his 23rd-ranked Lions Saturday night in front of a  standing-room-only crowd listed at 2,500 in the USD Sports Center.  </P> <P> As long as the pace was furious and the score was high, Westhead was happy.  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount usually wins these games, and Saturday was no different. The  final: Loyola Marymount 119, USD 112.  </P> <P> It was the Lions' fourth consecutive victory, their second in the West Coast  Conference. Loyola Marymount's 11-3 start equals its best ever. In 1987-88, the  Lions started 10-3 and also defeated USD in the 14th game. They did not lose  again until the second round of the NCAA Tournament and finished 28-4.  </P> <P> USD, which lost its second in a row after a three-game winning streak, fell to  6-9, 1-2.  </P> <P> "I like that pace," Westhead said. "I knew we were all right because the score  was so high."  </P> <P> "Sub-par," Lion forward Bo Kimble said of his team's performance. "I know we  can play a lot better, but we've got to hand it to San Diego. They played well.  They had us scouted well. They were prepared."  </P> <P> USD lost to the Lions for the fifth consecutive time. In each, Loyola has  scored more than 100 points. The Lions, second in the nation in offense with a  117.6 average going in, hit the 100-point mark for the 12th time in 14 games  this season.  </P> <P> "They're so unique that they make it hard for you to adjust," USD Coach Hank  Egan said.  </P> <P> Hank Gathers led all scorers with 32 points, the first time he has led the  Lions in scoring since a fainting incident Dec. 9 against UC Santa Barbara.  Kimble, the nation's leading scorer, was nine under his season average with 28  points. Jeff Fryer added 19.  </P> <P> Dondi Bell had a career-high 20 points for USD. Craig Cottrell had 18, and John  Jerome and Wayman Strickland added 17 apiece.  </P> <P> USD scored the first six points as Loyola missed its first four shots. The  Toreros held the advantage until Per Stumer made a three-point basket with  12:20 left, giving the Lions their first lead, 19-16.  </P> <P> Loyola took a 34-27 lead with 8:45 remaining in the half, but two layups by  Cottrell, a five-footer by Bell and a layup byKelvin Woods, around a basket by  Kimble, pulled USD to within 36-35.  </P> <P> Strickland's free throws tied the score, 41-41, but Kimble quickly answered  with a three-point basket to put Loyola back on top.  </P> <P> Late in the half, the Lions rallied for nine consecutive points and took their  biggest lead before halftime, 56-45, with 2:30 left.  </P></p>

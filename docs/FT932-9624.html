			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Administrators call on Nadir to help strike deal on assets: Stalled efforts to sell Polly Peck businesses THE ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck yesterday called on Mr Asil Nadir to co-operate with their efforts to realise assets for creditors and shareholders of the group. Mr Richard Stone, one of the joint administrators from accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'We would hope that he would facilitate negotiations currently under way to ensure a good deal goes through. Before Mr Nadir can ever regain his credibility he has got to give some pretty good explanations. We have been waiting three years for those.' His comments came as negotiations continued for the stalled sales of Polly Peck's Cyprus and Turkish assets. The plan is to concentrate their marketing efforts on Turks and Turkish Cypriots in the region and in the UK and US. Discussions with the northern Cypriot finance minister were well advanced for permission to sell the businesses, before they were put on hold by Mr Nadir's decision to break his bail conditions and leave the UK. The book value of the local assets has been put at about Dollars 40m (Pounds 25.9m). But disputes over ownership and control are likely to frustrate sales at least in the short-term. A brochure distributed before PPI entered administration in October 1990 from Nadir Sirkeler Grubu - the Nadir Group of companies - shows properties, including the Nicosia print works of AN Graphics, in which Mr Nadir is the 75 per cent shareholder, and the Olive Tree Holiday Village company, owned by Mrs Bilge Nevsat, Mr Nadir's sister. There are three hotels and the Sunzest fruit business, which records show are all owned by PPI through Voyager UK. But in the self-declared state of northern Cyprus, only recognised by Turkey, PPI is not registered as a company. Only the group's logo is authorised - by the local trademark office. PPI's accounts list three subsidiaries in Cyprus: Sunzest Trading, Unipac Packaging Industries, the cardboard box plant in the Famagusta freeport, and Voyager Kibris, the hotel holding company. But records of incorporation at the finance ministry show Voyager Kibris is owned 99 per cent owned by Voyager Mediterranean, a mainland Turkish company. Sunzest is owned 99 per cent by Unipac, while Unipac is owned by PPI through Voyager Ltd, an intermediary company on the Isle of Man. The administrators have also laid claim to ICP, owned by Inter Channel Pharmaceuticals, believed to be held through Jersey. Mr Nadir has said publicly that the companies are owned by PPI. But the company's lawyers have obstructed all efforts by the administrators to gain control of the assets through a series of court injunctions. As a result the administrators have not been able to change the board of directors, a first step before any decision can be made on disposal. The authorities have also not registered the companies in PPI's name. Mr Nadir is still a director of the northern Cyprus companies. The only PPI asset in new hands, the Kyrenia View Hotel, was requisitioned by the government in lieu of social security payments owed by the Nadir companies. It was subsequently sold to the Turkish Metal Workers Union as a recreation centre. Because of PPI's failure to pay about TL35bn to TL40bn (Pounds 2.28m-Pounds 2.61m) in debts, the government has placed a general lien on all the PPI and Nadir assets. Local bankers say even with the injunctions lifted, it will not be easy to be find a buyer, given the likely Greek claims if there is a settlement of the island dispute. The fruit business is dependent on orchards which once belonged to Greek families. Three of the four PPI hotels are former Greek properties, leased under 49-year arrangements from the government. The leases are not transferable without government permission. One banker in Nicosia said: 'The perspective in Cyprus is that he was making his money in London and bringing it to Cyprus, while the City always assumed he was making huge sums in Cyprus and bringing it to London.'</p>

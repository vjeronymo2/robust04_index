			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Pilkington brings issue of sterling warrant bonds PILKINGTON, the UK glass group, yesterday brought the first sterling warrant bond issue in six years, raising Pounds 95m to refinance its purchase last month of the glass processing and distribution business of Heywood Williams. The decision to issue bonds with equity warrants attached rather than convertible bonds owed much to the high yield on Pilkington's shares, which yesterday stood at around 6.4 per cent. To attract investors into convertibles, issuers of the recent spate of sterling convertible bonds have generally to offer a yield 3 per cent or more higher than their equity yield. That would have made the financing costs to Pilkington unattractive, according to one person close to the issue. The five-year bonds issued yesterday carry a coupon of 7 1/2 per cent and were priced to yield 175 basis points over gilts. The warrants attached to the bonds were issued with an exercise price of 120p - close to yesterday's close of 116p - and can be converted into 78.2m Pilkington shares, equivalent to around 10 per cent of the outstanding equity. The high level of volatility in Pilkington's shares in recent months has boosted the implied volatility levels used to value the equity warrants, making them more valuable to investors. As a result, the premium associated with the warrants amounted to Pounds 18.5m. Under new UK accounting rules due to be introduced soon, such a premium can be taken into shareholders funds. According to one analyst yesterday, this would reduce Pilkington's gearing from 90 per cent to 74 per cent. The bonds and warrants, which will be traded separately or as a package, were said by banks not involved in the deal to have met strong demand, particularly from continental European investors. Partly as a result of switching by investors, Pilkington's share price fell back to 116p yesterday, from 125p at the beginning of the day.</p>

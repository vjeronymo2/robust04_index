			<p>BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] Russia will face new  ordeals in forthcoming months, announced the Russian president  adviser and politologist Andranik Migranyan, appearing at a  meeting with professorial staff of the Yerevan University. As  reports the "HAYASTAN" newspaper today, Migranyan has grounded  such a perspective on a fact that Russia experiences now an  economic instability, so that important and cardinal decisions  are expected in the nearest two months to lead the country out  of crisis. He told that emergency measures introduction in  economy and industry is being discussed already for some time in  the government circles.    Migranyan estimated as nearly 40 percent the democrats'  votes  in Russian Duma, while there is no yet unity among the rights,  he said. The politologist negatively characterized the  Nazarbayev's idea of Eurasian Union, calling this initiative a  "political bluff".    Speaking of the Karabakh problem, Migranyan expressed an  opinion that the consistent policy of Russia will ultimately  result in a settlement of conflict. However to reach this  objective the involved parties shall not assume delirious ideas  as their starting point, but show instead the readiness for  compromise.</p>

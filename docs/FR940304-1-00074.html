			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Significance of Savings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Under section 325(l)(3)(B) of the Act, the Department is prohibited from adopting a standard for a product if that standard would not result in ``significant'' energy savings. While the term ``significant'' has never been defined in the Act, the U.S. Court of Appeals, in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Herrington <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 768 F.2d 1355, 1406 (DC Cir. 1985), concluded that Congressional intent in using the word ``significant'' was to mean ``non-trivial.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . at 1373.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> e. Rebuttable Presumption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act established new criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for determining whether a standard level is economically justified. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 325(l)(2)(B)(iii) states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ``If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level will be less than three times the value of the energy savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a rebuttable presumption that such standard level is economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justified. A determination by the Secretary that such criterion is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met shall not be taken into consideration in the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of whether a standard is economically justified.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the increase in initial price of an appliance due to a conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard would repay itself to the consumer in energy savings in less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three years, then it is presumed that such standard is economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justified. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  This presumption of economic justification can be rebutted upon a proper showing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For this calculation, the Department calculated cost-of-operation based on the DOE test procedures. Therefore, the consumer is assumed to be an ``average'' consumer as defined by the DOE test procedures. Consumers that use the products less than the test procedure assumes will experience a longer payback while those that use them more than the test procedure assumes will have a shorter payback. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> f. Economic Justification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted earlier, Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides seven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors to be evaluated in determining whether a conservation standard is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The engineering analysis identified improvements in efficiency along with the associated costs to manufacturers for each class of product. For each design option, these costs constitute the increased per-unit cost to manufacturers to achieve the indicated energy efficiency levels. Manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer markups will result in a consumer purchase price higher than the manufacturer cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assess the likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the effects of standards on different-sized firms, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used a computer model that simulated hypothetical firms in the eight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industries under consideration. This model, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturer Impact Model, is explained in the Technical Support Document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Technical Support Document, Appendix C. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Manufacturer Impact Model provides a broad array of outputs, including shipments, price, revenue, net income, and short- and long-run returns on equity. An ``Output Table'' lists values for all these outputs in the base case and in each of the standards cases under consideration. It also gives a range for each of these estimates. A ``Sensitivity Chart'' shows how returns on equity would be affected by a change in any one of the model's nine control variables.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For consumers, measures of economic impact are the changes in purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price and annual energy expense. The purchase price and annual energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense, i.e., life-cycle cost, of each standard level are presented in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chapter 6 of the Technical Support Document. Under section 325 of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the life-cycle cost analysis is a separate factor to be considered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining economic justification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Life-cycle Costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One measure of the effect of proposed standards on consumers is the change in operating expense as compared to the change in purchase price, both resulting from standards. This is quantified by the difference in the life-cycle costs between the base and standards cases for the appliance classes analyzed. The life-cycle cost is the sum of the purchase price and the operating expense, including installation and maintenance expenditures, discounted over the lifetime of the appliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

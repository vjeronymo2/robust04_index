			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu by reporter </F> Kim Cha-su on 8 February -- place not given]    [Text] [Kim Cha-su] People in the United States generally  believe that the strategy to resolve the North Korean nuclear  issue through dialogue and negotiations has reached its limit.    [Han Sung-chu] The U.S. Government has not officially  stated that the possibility of resolving the North Korean  nuclear issue is remote. Only the mass media have expressed  hardline views. The ROK and United States hold that they will  continue their efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through  dialogue and that if they fail in their efforts, they will  examine the possibility of imposing sanctions on North Korea  through the UN Security Council and other means.    [Kim] How will you hold consultations with the United  States?    [Han] The two countries will examine and analyze the  development of the situation so far. They will also discuss the  principle on resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue.  Conditions permitting, they will discuss ways to foster  cooperation with China, Japan, and other countries concerned.    [Kim] Is it possible that the North Korean nuclear issue  will  be presented to the UN Security Council? How will our  government respond then?    [Han] It seems inevitable that it will be presented to the  UN Security Council if no progress were made in the negotiations  on nuclear inspections before the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting. However, even if the  issue is presented to the UN Security Council, no decision on  economic sanctions [kyongjejejae] or other measures will be made  right away. The government will honor any decision by the UN  Security Council and positively participate in its  implementation.    [Kim] Do you predict how the international community will  react if North Korea promises to accept nuclear inspections  right before the IAEA Board of Governors meeting?    [Han] The problem at present is to confirm whether the  continuity of nuclear safeguards is ensured. Deciding on  whether the continuity of nuclear safeguards is ensured or not  is the IAEA's own right, and I think the international community  will honor the IAEA's decision on this matter.    [Kim] It is rumored that North Korean President Kim Il-song  has failed to correctly perceive the reality concerning the  nuclear issue.    [Han] There is such a rumor or analysis. However, I  cannot correctly comment because I have had no direct dialogue  with North Korean policymakers. However, if this were true, it  is truly worrisome.    [Kim] At New York contacts, the United States promised to  North Korea that it would discontinue the Team Spirit exercise  and decide on the timing of the third round of North Korea-U.S.  talks if North Korea accepts nuclear inspections. Is the  promise still valid?    [Han] The agreement at the New York contacts will be valid  until the IAEA declares the discontinuation of nuclear  safeguards.</p>

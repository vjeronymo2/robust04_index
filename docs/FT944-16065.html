			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Genscher summons up the old euphoria The audience was small but the applause was loud and long when Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher walked into the concert hall of Cottbus's music conservatory in the eastern German state of Brandenburg. With two days to go before a federal election that could see it wiped out, the FDP had brought Mr Genscher - the veteran former foreign minister and still one of the most popular German politicians - out of retirement to recapture some of the support of the 1990 election, when the FDP won over 10 per cent of the vote in eastern Germany. The FDP has failed to win any seats in the last seven German state elections. Mr Genscher, who was born in east Germany, took one look at his audience, many of them over 50, and then glanced at his notes. 'Don't forget what was happening this time five years ago,' he said. 'Hungary had just let the east Germans out to freedom. More east Germans were in the German embassy in Prague.' The audience was clearly transported back to those euphoric days. 'I am so excited about listening to Mr Genscher,' said 67-year-old Mrs Olga Ziekart. 'He did so much for us east Germans back in 1989. He helped us get our freedom. He helped us become united. But people forget very quickly.' Mrs Ziekart, expelled from the former Czechoslovakia in 1945 because she was a Sudeten German, said she had no doubt how she would vote tomorrow. 'The first vote is for Helmut (Chancellor Kohl). The second for the FDP - because of Genscher.' Mr Genscher continued to tap in to the crowd's memory. 'I was sitting at my desk on the morning of November 9 in 1989. That evening the wall was torn down. We must not forget that event,' he said. And then, to more applause, he said united Germany needed a new beginning. 'East and west Germans must work together for a fresh start. We must have inner unity.' Looking at Mr Jurgen Turk, the FDP's candidate for Cottbus, Mr Genscher appealed to his audience to cast their two votes for the local man. If Mr Turk wins, it will be a near miracle. The Social Democrats won a landslide victory in last September's state elections and the FDP failed to enter parliament. 'But the collapse of the Berlin Wall was a miracle as well,' said Mrs Ziekart.

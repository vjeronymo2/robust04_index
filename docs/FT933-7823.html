			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Taxman - stay thy grasping hand If there is one figure about the British economy which every schoolboy knows, it is that the public sector expects to borrow Pounds 50bn in 1993-94. Since the start of the financial year there have been good and bad months; and the new estimate of Pounds 46bn of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research lies within the same ballpark. Bill Robinson, former special adviser to Norman Lamont, the ex-chancellor, has explained, in a fascinating series of articles in the FT, the origins of the deficit problem; but I am much less sure of his conclusion that tax rates need to be raised further and interest rates reduced. We may have to come round to this combination if other countries cut interest rates so much that sterling threatens to rise to uncompetitive levels. This has not happened yet; and sterling has retained some four-fifths of its effective devaluation since its departure from the exchange rate mechanism last September. There was never a realistic chance of retaining the whole of it indefinitely anyway. But as the new August NIESR Review points out, the independent fiscal case for tax increases has been much exaggerated. It is almost forgotten that Mr Lamont has already left behind some Pounds 10bn of tax increases, nearly all of them to be phased in over the next two financial years. The NIESR assumes for forecasting purposes that the chancellor announces another Pounds 2 1/2 bn of tax increases in his November Budget to show he is taking the fiscal balance seriously. It is human nature to project the present indefinitely, and to disbelieve that the public sector borrowing requirement will ever come down without drastic hair-shirt measures. The NIESR does not dispute that the present level of the PSBR, which corresponds to 7 per cent of gross domestic product, is unsustainably high. The main NIESR point, however, is that on the basis of tax and spending measures already taken or announced, the PSBR will fall sharply and 'stabilise at below 2 1/2 per cent of GDP towards the end of the decade'. Most of the improvement is expected in the next couple of years. Whatever financial and economic writers may say, the financial markets, judging by the rise in gilts, do not share the scepticism of these commentators. According to the last Budget Red Book, taxes (including National Insurance Contributions) are expected to climb from a recession low of 34 1/2 per cent of GDP this year to 37 per cent in 1997-98. This would not be quite as high as the 38 per cent reached in the mid-1980s; but it would be much higher than anything achieved, except fleetingly, under any previous government, Labour or Conservative. There was no such rise in the tax-take during recovery periods in earlier cycles. On this basis the public sector debt ratio (gross debt as a proportion of GDP), should stabilise around next year at a little below 50 per cent of GDP. This ratio, which is sometimes called the solvency ratio, is within the Maastricht guidelines, comparable to that of the early 1980s and much lower than anything experienced in earlier decades. Do we then really need to ratchet up the tax-take even further? The moral I draw is the need to stick to present plans against pressures from the spending lobbies rather than for draconian new measures out of a misplaced desire for the government to show 'leadership'. The NIESR Review contains an analysis by Nigel Pain and others, which represents a more sophisticated attempt to put UK public sector borrowing into perspective than any I have yet seen. One of the most interesting of his charts compares the PSBR with the net capital spending of the public sector (net of receipts, not net of depreciation). In every year until 1991 the PSBR was less than net capital outlays, as the new current and capital breakdown promised for the next Budget will doubtless confirm. So the public sector obeyed what is sometimes called the 'golden rule': only borrow to finance capital outlays. Admittedly the present borrowing requirement of 7 per cent of GDP is now so high that the 'golden rule' has been well broken. But on NIESR projections it will be observed again from about 1995 onwards. Of course, if even the modest recovery now generally foreseen fails to take place, all bets are off and that includes all golden rules. The main aim of policy would then be to get the economy back on something as near to a normal growth trend as possible; and monetary and fiscal policy would have to be subordinated to that end. The most uncomfortable aspect of the public finances in the NIESR analysis is shown by yet another ratio: that of public sector debt to public sector capital, which the authors call 'gearing'. This is expected to level off in the mid-1990s at a higher level than it has been at any time since the 1960s. The change reflects mostly developments on the assets side, such as the fall in value of North Sea reserves, privatisation and council house sales. If one tries to work with too many ratios at the same time, however, the result will be giddiness. It is best to concentrate on the PSBR ratio and the solvency ratio. The high gearing of the public sector should be taken as a hint to improve the public sector's balance when an opportunity occurs rather than as an imperative for immediate action. Admittedly, the advocate of fiscal stringency can point not only to the gearing ratio, but also to the uncertainty of all PSBR projections and, above all, the lack of any room for absorbing a shock, as arguments for the chancellor to have a margin in hand. One opposing argument is that the recovery is not yet so certain and so strong that the government can take risks with measures which reduce taxpayers' spending power. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that measures already announced in the last Budget will cost householders some 2 per cent of annual income by the time they are fully implemented in 1995. The measures have probably been already taken into rough account in people's spending plans. To go beyond these would risk denting confidence at a sensitive time; and it would be folly to reckon in advance on offsetting fiscal tightening by monetary relaxation or sterling falling. Moreover, the most widely canvassed tax increases, in value added and other consumer taxes, would have a knock-on effect on the headline inflation rate  -which will in in any case be tending to rise in the coming months and thus risk destroying the new, and still very fragile, non-inflationary psychology. But above all, the reason why I would part company from many in the economic fraternity is the relentless rise in the tax-take in successive decades from the 1950s onwards. The 1980s were the first decade in which this ratio stabilised, although it did not decline. It would be better to wait for an opportunity to act on the public spending side in the review now taking place for the later years of the decade, rather than rush into ill-considered tax increases which may have adverse supply side effects, nonetheless real even though difficult to quantify in forecasting models.</p>

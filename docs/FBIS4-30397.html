			<p>BFN     [Text] The two-day insurance-field meeting held in Tokyo  as part of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks ended 22  June. In the 22 June meeting, setting of objective criteria and  such issues as postponing deregulation on the "third sector"  like disease and damage insurance were discussed, but no  agreement was made as "there was considerable distance in  positions between the two parties" (according to the Finance  Ministry).    Another meeting is expected to be held in Washington next  week. The United States is beginning to show the possibility of  making concessions in some issues, and the next meeting is  likely to be a final round as both nations are seeking to  finalize negotiations by the time of the industrialized nations'  summit in July (the Naples Summit).    At the latest meeting, both parties began drafting a  document  on what has been agreed on so far, and discussed pending issues,  including setting objective criteria. In the criteria to  measure the degree of market liberalization (according to the  Finance Ministry), there was a proposal from qualitative and  quantitative perspectives, but the Japanese delegation was not  responsive to it. No progress appears to have been made in the  issue of the third- sector or the question of correcting  keiretsu-tied business practices either. The U.S. concession  plan proposes preparing a uniform model in determining criteria  for issuing permits for insurance businesses and urging all U.S.  state governments to adopt this model. At present, the states  have independent permit systems, and this has been pointed out  by Japan as a barrier in the U.S. market. Both countries agreed  to include this plan in the agreement document, and are now  working on the details.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE (GGD): "GATT: Brussels and Paris Do </F> Not Forget Social and Environmental Questions"; as released by  Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 7 Mar (BELGA) -- On Monday [7 March],  Belgium and France urged their partners in the European Union  (EU) to go to Marrakech, where the final agreement concluding  the Uruguay Round is to be signed in April, armed with a draft  joint declaration stressing the importance of the environment  and social protection within the future WTC [World Trade  Organization].    "France and Belgium are thinking along the same lines on  this  matter," a Belgian diplomatic source stated.    The question of a ministerial declaration to be added to the  final document establishing the agreement of the 117 GATT  members on greater liberalization of world trade has yet to be  settled.    Several signatory countries are opposed to it and the  European Trade Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, who negotiated on  behalf of the Twelve, is reportedly in favor of a general  declaration which they would all support.    "The EU must submit a text offering a broader vision of  links  between trade and the environment, and between trade and social  protection," a Belgian source indicated.    These questions "received too little attention during the  Uruguay Round," Robert Urbain, the Belgian European affairs  minister, told his colleagues at the Council of Ministers.    "We must make the most of the Marrakech conference to make  up  for this shortcoming, and in sufficiently broad terms to lay  down genuine avenues for future thought rather than simply  listing the most flagrant excesses such as slavery or forced  labor," he added.    Belgium therefore recommends the drawing up of "an agenda  for  the future" in order to strengthen "the link between social  rights, the environment and trade," Mr. Urbain stated.    France and Belgium head the "maximalists" who favor a  declaration by the Twelve "making it clearly known that the EU  intends to see the World Trade Organization launch a global  debate on the environment and the social question," explained a  senior Belgian civil servant.    The Twelve have unanimously condemned the American decision  to reintroduce the so-called super 301 procedure which allows  the United States to take retaliatory measures against countries  which fail to sufficiently open up their markets to U.S.  products.    "This measure does not directly affect us for the moment,  but  the Twelve believe that the use of this section sends out a bad  signal just before the signing of an agreement that is supposed  to commit everyone to a multilateral settlement of trade  differences," stressed a Belgian source.</p>

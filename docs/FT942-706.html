			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Arts: An exalted 'Tristan' - David Murray hails the operatic inauguration performance in the new Edinburgh Festival Theatre In what are still difficult times, it is extraordinary that the two premier festivals of Great Britain, Glyndebourne and Edinburgh, should have realised their matching, long-standing dreams only weeks apart - and not just successfully, but triumphantly. A month ago Glyndebourne reopened in its superb new house, with half again as many seats and a real acoustic at last. On Saturday the new Edinburgh Festival Theatre, half again larger than that, had its operatic inauguration with Wagner's Tristan und Isolde: a stern test for any house, but passed here with resounding credit and a truly memorable performance to boot. The gods must have smiled upon the project, for few new opera houses since Bayreuth can have had gala openings of this exalted musical standard. Not all the gods, as it happened: that afternoon, a large parade in favour of Jesus disrupted traffic so severely that many Tristan patrons - at Pounds 175 a head - arrived only in time to view Act 1 on the cafe-bar monitor. But there was no further divine intervention; and to the unlucky latecomers I can say that nothing in Act 1, admirable though it was, rose to the wrenching splendours of the later acts. The EFT is not exactly 'new', for it has retained and refurbished the entirely satisfactory auditorium of the old Empire (1928, designed by the Milburn brothers of Sunderland after the previous Frank Matcham theatre burned down) - broad and unshowily handsome, excellent sight-lines, no seat much further than 30 yards from the lofty stage. The latter is quite new, like all the backstage facilities too; it is now the largest in Europe. Equally the flashy front-of-house, which displays the expansive new foyers on all three levels through a gigantic glass wall to the world outside. Nor, despite its name, is the EFT a creature of the Edinburgh Festival; it is a self-christened 'lyric theatre' which will have to sell itself all year round, not only as the second home of Scottish Opera and the Scottish Ballet, but as a showcase for practically anything that will draw a sufficient audience. For the annual Festival, nonetheless, it will be a boon, a huge asset and a blessed rescue. It is no secret - indeed, it is a kind of scandal - that Edinburgh's lack of an adequate opera-venue has been an unstaunched Tristan- or Amfortas-wound in the flesh of the Festival these many years, with repeated promises regularly scotched by civic parsimony and argy-bargy. Very late in the day, dogged thrift had its unexpected reward when the Moss organisation decided to give up the Empire, run as a bingo-hall since 1962, for a bargain price. For a mere Pounds 21m more, much of that private and corporate money, Edinburgh has made itself an opera-house that should transform the Festival and the yearly season over a long time to come. This Scottish Opera Tristan, staged by Yannis Kokkos, is a co-production with Welsh National Opera. First seen at Cardiff 16 months ago and roundly acclaimed, it has been partly re-cast (for the better, by all accounts), and Richard Armstrong now finds himself conducting an orchestra which must be every bit as musically attentive as its Welsh counterpart. He took most of Act 1, and especially the great Prelude, at tempi so intensely slow as to tempt fate, but the players sustained them bravely. The effect was imposing, if measurably self-conscious: even the young-middle-aged Armstrong, devoted as he is, cannot just slip into the clothes of old Furtwangler or Goodall. Tristan's stately declamations exposed the heavy beat in Jeffrey Lawton's warm, dignified tenor, and Isolde's simmering fury is not a natural vein for Anne Evans. With the descent of Romantic rapture, however, the earth moved. In Act 2 Armstrong paced Isolde's impatient longings and the subsequent love-duet marvellously, with a wealth of fresh, tingling orchestral detail. With his speaking pianissimi no less than his urgent explosions, the EFT acoustic seemed to accommodate voices and orchestra alike, with perfect transparency and balance. Lawton rose to a throaty, Jon Vickers-ish intimacy that tore at one's heart, and Evans was luminous with elevated passion. As Brangaene, Kathryn Harries issued her anxious warnings in haunting depth. Isolde's husband King Marke, the Norwegian bass Carsten Stabell, capped it all with a reproachful monologue of sterling moral weight, enough to re-cast all the erotic action in a new light - as it should do, but rarely does. As for Act 3, I hardly know whether to praise Lawton's desolate agonies more, or Armstrong's knife-edge quickness in capturing every turn of his epic self-searchings. We were gripped and scathed. Kokkos's spare direction, as plain and economical as his near-abstract sets, let every moment stab cleanly home. James Johnson's fine Kurwenal came into his own, wracked by loyal desperation. Iain Paton represented the Shepherd in uncommon sympathetic depth (abetted by a fine cor anglais), like John Harris's angry Melot. Miss Evans was visionary and nobly persuasive in the Liebestod - but it was a mistake to let the lights fade slowly on her statuesque pose after the music had stopped: Tristan must end with its soft, absolutely final note.</p>

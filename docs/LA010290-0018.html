			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> After-Christmas Present: The La Jolla Playhouse is facing a cheerier new year,  thanks to a $400,000 gift from the Joan B. Kroc Foundation. Kroc is the widow  of Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald's. The grant, which enabled the Playhouse to  balance its 1989 operations budget, is separate from the theater's current  financial stabilization campaign, which is lobbying to raise $1 million by June  30.

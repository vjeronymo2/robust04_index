			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Mobile phones April will be Orange. The quirkily-named mobile phone service from Hutchison Telecom will be launched this month, and it poses a strong competitive threat to Mercury's One-2-One network. The latter has set itself up as a cheap mass market phone in the south-east, but Orange may be similarly priced and offer much wider coverage. A national system would also challenge the more expensive mobile operators Cellnet and Vodafone. Much depends on Orange being able to deliver on its claims of wide coverage, high quality and enough capacity on the system to meet demands. Assuming that it can, however, the existing three networks will have to respond. Mercury has a strong brand name, but limiting its initial investment to London now looks too timid. Even though One-2-One is not now constrained on capital expenditure, it will not reach Orange's opening coverage for at least 18 months. If the two services are similar in other respects, Mercury will be at a significant disadvantage in attracting consumers. Vodafone and Cellnet will also have difficulty defending their current prices on the basis of national coverage. The slimming of mobile's fat margins will accelerate. But the established operators want to make hay while the sun shines, so tariff cuts will be as slow as possible. The rise in connections may also help. Vodafone and Cellnet's cheap handsets and One-2-One's cheap calls have increased the market substantially in recent months. Another competitor may well do the same. Mercury, however, must hurry if it does not want to be last.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 9 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The rebel Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) today said it has no  objections to meeting the Guatemalan Government negotiating  commission in Oslo, Norway in May. Luis Becker of the URNG  Political-Diplomatic Commission confirmed that government and  guerrilla delegations are studying the Norwegian Government's  invitation to meet in that European nation.    Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Jan Egelan said yesterday  that the two parties would meet under UN mediation at a  residence in the forest near Oslo, the same site where  Palestinians and Israelis met secretly in 1993.    "In principle, the URNG does not have any objections to  meeting in Oslo at the invitation of the Norwegian Government,"  Becker stated.    According to the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, the  purpose of the round of talks in Norway would be to discuss the  mechanisms for forming the so-called Truth Commission.    On another topic, the guerrillas accused Guatemalan soldiers  of killing a peasant in a village in Peten Department in  northern Guatemala. They said the man was killed in the  presence of townspeople, whom the soldiers threatened to kill if  they cooperated with the URNG. In a communique issued in Mexico  City, the rebels said the crime was committed by government  troops a few days after the signing of the comprehensive  agreement on human rights on 29 March "to prevent the  fulfillment of that agreement." The guerrillas demanded that  the document signed in Mexico City be "totally honored without  reservations."    "We again urge the United Nations to send a verification  mission as soon as possible before the crisis of ungovernability  worsens and opens the door for even more repression," the URNG  stated.    There was an increase in attacks on politicians, judges,  legislators, reporters, and foreigners in Guatemala last week, a  situation that created a climate of violence and insecurity.    The guerrillas stated that "there is no respect for human  rights and there is no justification for the reemergence of  genocidal practices by the Army in our country. Guatemala needs  peace and respect for human rights, especially the sacred right  to life."    Guatemalan Government and URNG delegations have been  negotiating since April 1991 to end an internal armed conflict,  the only ongoing one in Central America. The conflict has  claimed approximately 175,000 lives in 33 years.</p>

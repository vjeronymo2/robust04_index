			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK bank admits infringements: Standard Chartered says it knew of irregularities in India STANDARD Chartered Bank, the UK-based international banking group, admitted yesterday that it was aware that its Indian banking operations could be infringing regulations 18 months before India's Rs35bn (Pounds 717m) securities scandal erupted in May this year. Mr Barry Northrop, special representative for India, said senior managers in London had believed the problems had been corrected after an internal investigation: 'To our obvious embarrassment, we discovered we were wrong.' Standard Chartered has provided Pounds 100m for possible losses incurred trading in the Bombay securities markets. It says it was defrauded and is looking to get money back through the courts. In 1990, the bank's inspectors were alerted to possible irregularities in a department handling corporate clients' funds for investment. An executive in Bombay filed a report alleging that funds were invested in commercial loans and securities markets, contravening central bank rules and internal guidelines. The bank's inspectors confirmed the suspicions and said in a report the merchant banking division in Bombay had 'aggressively pursued business for the group's benefit and deliberately or mistakenly circumvented proper avenues of control'. It said:'This may lead to short-term profit . . . but it is probably a recipe for eventual loss and possibly action that could affect the bank as a whole and not just the merchant banking division.' The report was supplied by the bank to a parliamentary committee investigating the affair. Mr Northrop confirmed its contents. Mr Northrop said that executives in the merchant banking division had disputed the 1990 inspection report, arguing that the business did not infringe guidelines and producing a legal opinion to this effect. A compromise was reached under which the division was permitted to continue portfolio management under strict guidelines. However, said Mr Northrop, when the scandal broke, it emerged that the guidelines had been infringed. He said the bank's controls had been weak. A manager has been sacked and the bank has virtually stopped portfolio management. Mr Northrop said the bank had done nothing which other banks were not doing. Inquiries by the central bank and by the parliamentary committee have established that various banks infringed guidelines on securities trading. Bombay market scandal, Page 6</p>

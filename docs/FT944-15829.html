			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Business 'minnows' in call to Clarke Small businesses today urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to use next month's Budget to 'help the minnows'. The Federation of Small Businesses said its members were starved of cash badly needed to expand. Mr John Harris, federation chairman, said: 'Easing their capital block can only be done by allowing businesses to retain their profits and taxed only when the money is drawn for non-business purposes.' In its pre-Budget submission the federation says Mr Clarke should ease the regulatory burden by cutting red tape and abolishing value added tax on inter-company trading. Dr Bernard Juby, federation financial affairs chairman, said: 'It has long been a bone of contention that all VAT collected at the various interim stages is ultimately claimed back at no gain to the Exchequer. Last year alone Pounds 25bn was locked up in the VAT system of payments and repayments and the abolition of VAT on inter-company trading is now long overdue.' Other proposals include two-tier base rates with a lower rate for business borrowers, and extending Tessas to businesses.</p>

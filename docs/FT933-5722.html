			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / France may alter asylum controls THE French constitution may have to be amended to strengthen controls against political asylum-seekers, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, said yesterday. But in an attempt to defuse a potentially damaging dispute with Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist president, Mr Balladur, a conservative, said he favoured a minor revision of the constitution through parliament, rather than a national referendum on the issue. He said a final decision would be taken following further talks with Mr Mitterrand. Pressure to revise the constitution was triggered by a ruling last month from France's constitutional council. The council struck out elements of a tough new anti-immigration law drawn up by Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, and said that asylum-seekers had to be guaranteed the right to apply for refuge in France and to appeal against rejections from other European Community states. Mr Pasqua, who argues the freedom of movement in the EC would prompt a flood of asylum-seekers into France, has called for a revision of the constitution to prevent such an outcome. But President Mitterrand, seeking to protect the rights of political refugees, has resisted constitutional reform. Mr Balladur, faced with a serious challenge to the harmonious 'cohabitation' he has enjoyed with Mr Mitterrand since taking office in March, has sought a compromise solution, There are currently about 4m legal immigrants in France and an estimated 1m illegal immigrants. Economic recession and the influx of emigres from eastern Europe have heightened concerns on the issue.</p>

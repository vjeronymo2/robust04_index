			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> PETITIONS SUBMITTED ON TAX INITIATIVE  </P> <P> Voter Revolt says it has submitted 842,119 signatures in an attempt to qualify  its multibillion-dollar property tax "split roll' initiative for the 1990  statewide election ballot. Under the measure, business and residential  properties would be placed on separate, or "split," tax rolls and the levy on  businesses more than doubled, from 1% to 2.2%. County officials will verify the  petitions to determine if there are the required 595,485 valid registered  voters' signatures to earn the proposal a spot on the June ballot. Voter Revolt  is the group that sponsored the 1988 insurance rate measure, Proposition 103.  Business groups have long opposed efforts to tax their property at higher rates  and have already begun organizing an opposition campaign.  </P></p>

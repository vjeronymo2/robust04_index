			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Danish Referendum: Danish Yes is no panacea for EC's fundamental ailments / Lowering expectations for today's vote THERE is always an element of Russian roulette in a referendum, and the Danes have always liked to live dangerously. But if the opinion polls are to be believed, the Danes will today approve the Maastricht treaty which they narrowly rejected almost a year ago. A Danish Yes, however grudging, would allow the EC to resume its halting progress toward political and monetary union. It would give a fillip to Mr John Major, British prime minister, as he pushes the Maastricht bill through final ratification in parliament. Barring an upset in the UK courts (and the German constitutional court), Maastricht seems set for the greatest comeback since Lazarus. Yet a positive vote in Denmark will not have any impact on the fundamental problems facing the EC: rising unemployment, low investment, a public spending crisis in most member states, and continuing monetary instability. Nor will it resolve the central Maastricht dilemma: how to bridge the gap between what the Twelve were able to agree in December 1991 and what European public opinion has since been willing to accept. This holds true not only for 'semi-detached' EC member states such as Denmark and Britain, but also for the traditionally integrationist countries such as France and Germany, where today a majority of Germans would probably vote against giving up the D-Mark in return for a single European currency. Nor will Danish approval of Maastricht dispel the impression of double-dealing which has permeated the treaty ratification process ever since the Danes first threw it out. As one of the European Commission's senior legal advisers inadvertently confirmed recently, the Danes are voting on the same treaty, whatever the extravagant claims made about the legally binding opt-outs obtained by the Danish government at last December's Edinburgh summit. Those opt-outs detail Danish exemptions from the third phase of monetary union, when the Twelve are supposed to move to fixed exchange rates by 1999 at the latest; a common EC defence policy; common citizenship; and co-operation on justice and immigration matters at a Community rather than an inter-governmental level. The Danes won these exemptions in the original treaty negotiations; but they have since undertaken to bind themselves, not just now but in the future, to withdraw from these parts of the European union foreseen under Maastricht. The Danish deal which was deemed necessary to salvage the treaty looks very much like turning the EC Community into a Community a la carte. Yet there is a precedent: 18 months ago, the UK rejected the Maastricht social chapter and reserved its right to take part in a single currency or European monetary union. The question is whether countries wishing to join the EC club will now demand similar preferential treatment, creating a new, multi-speed Community. The official line in Brussels is that Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden cannot expect the Danish treatment; privately, senior EC officials say none of these applicant countries has the muscle to secure such exemptions. Indeed, some predict that at least one, possibly two applicant countries will prove unable to persuade their public to support the Maastricht terms. Norway, which rejected EC membership in 1972, is put in the riskiest category; but officials say the slow pace of enlargement talks with Austria reflects the weakness of the coalition government and concern about how EC membership may affect next year's general election. One senior Commission official offered the blunt assessment that a partial failure of the enlargement talks could be useful in that it would deflate the aspirations of eastern Europe's emerging democracies. Such views underline how Maastricht has failed to resolve the tensions between those in the Commission and the federalist-minded EC states such as Belgium and the Netherlands who want to 'deepen' EC institutions at the expense of national sovereignty, and countries like Britain and Denmark who wish to 'widen' membership and focus more on its economic aspects, notably its ability to expand eastwards as a free trade area. Sir Leon Brittan, EC Commissioner for external economic relations, argues that it is time the Community focused on pressing matters at hand, such as concluding the Uruguay Round in the Gatt trade talks and meeting the historic challenge of integrating eastern Europe into the west, both politically and economically. On institutional change, he says: 'I don't think it's the right time. This is not Maoist China, I don't believe in perpetual revolution.' A Danish No would challenge these assumptions, if only because it would force member states to re-examine the limits of their co-operation, perhaps encouraging some to venture beyond what was agreed at Maastricht. The most obvious parallel is 1963, when President Charles de Gaulle vetoed British membership (encouraging Denmark to stay out, too). Within weeks, de Gaulle and Chancellor Adnenauer signed the Elysee treaty, the foundation of Franco-German co-operation which has underpinned the EC in the 30 years since, with the UK all too often left on the sidelines.</p>

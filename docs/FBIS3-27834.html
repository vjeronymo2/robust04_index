The officials said the idea was dropped after it was  discovered that the used chemical tanker under consideration  might not be able to withstand the severe cold of the Russian  Far East.    They said the two sides have subsequently begun considering  the idea of Japan providing financial assistance for emergency  disposal facilities.    Russia asked Japan in talks last December to help find a  chemical tanker with a storage capacity of between 5,000 tons  and 25,000 tons. Japan had introduced a 10,000-ton class  Panamanian-registered tanker docked in Singapore.    But Russian inspectors determined that the tanker might not  be able to withstand severe cold weather conditions and that its  deck may not be thick enough to prevent adverse effects on the  environment and on the health of the crew.    A 100 million dollar fund pledged by Tokyo to Moscow to help  it scrap its obsolete nuclear weapons is expected to be utilized  toward the alternative facilities.    Russia last dumped 900 tons of low-level radioactive waste  into the Sea of Japan on October 17. It suspended a planned  second dumping following international protests, particularly  from Japan and South Korea.</p>

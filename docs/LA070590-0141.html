			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: OZ MEETS OJAI  </P> <P> Tornadoes, wicked witches and a yellow brick road are not part of the everyday  scenery in Ojai, but come Saturday they will be. The Illusions Theatre will  bring "The Wizard of Oz" to the Libbey Bowl.  </P> <P> A cast of 45 will adapt L. Frank Baum's fantasy as Dorothy and friends attempt  to walk the yellow brick road and dodge the wrath of the Wicked Witch of the  West. Director Elizabeth Ridenour said the play will hold true to the original  story line.  </P> <P> "We tell the story as it was written, pretty much. There are a couple  variations. We have two lions, but the Scarecrow and Tin Man will be there, of  course." Ridenour said the audiences will enjoy the production's special  effects.  </P> <P> Performances begin at 5 and 7 p.m. Saturdays and 5 p.m. Sundays, continuing  through July 22.  </P> <P> Tickets are $6; $3.50 for senior citizens and children 12 and under.  </P> <P> The park is at Ojai Avenue between South Signal and South Montgomery streets.  For information, call 646-3533 or 646-6387.  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Brierley to sell 28% holding in publishing group Brierley Investments, the New Zealand-based hotels and investment company, says it will sell its 28 per cent stake in newspaper publisher Wilson and Horton. However, it wants Wilson and Horton to find a buyer willing to pay the right price, writes Terry Hall in Wellington and AP-DJ. Brierley said yesterday it bought the 28 per cent stake in November, with the intention of becoming a 'long-term, supportive shareholder' of Wilson and Horton. However, 'the board of Wilson and Horton considers it would be in the best interests of the company to have a media industry participant as a strategic shareholder'.</p>

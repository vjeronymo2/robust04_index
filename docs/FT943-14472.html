			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK telecoms Mr Don Cruickshank, the UK telecoms regulator, yesterday ticked Mercury Communications off for being shrill. He is right. The company's latest campaign about unfair regulatory treatment sounds like special pleading. Mercury has been cossetted during its 10 years of existence by paying artificially low prices for use of BT's network. That may have been appropriate to give the company an initial leg-up. Some assistance to the latest batch of telecoms players is also reasonable. But, at some point, the subsidy has to stop. The snag is that Mercury has not used the seven years when it was BT's only licensed competitor wisely. Instead of differentiating its services from BT's and building a sustainable competitive advantage, it offered a slightly cheaper but similar service. It exploits the wide gap between the wholesale prices it has paid for using BT's network and BT's high long-distance charges. Mercury is now facing a two-way squeeze. BT is cutting its long-distance charges, while the network usage fees are going up. This is not to say that the ungainly regime which governs network fees is perfect. The system exists because BT is not allowed for political reasons to charge customers the full cost of having a telephone line. If the government had political courage, it would scrap that restriction. But so long as it exists, Mercury does itself no favours by moaning. It would do better, even late in the day, to try to build a sustainable competitive advantage.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): When the mortgage exceeds income - The Plowshares / Alison is worried about a friend whose husband is redundant, and there seems no easy solution IT'S HALF past three in the morning, and John has awoken to discover that Alison is not sound asleep as he would have expected, but sitting downstairs in the kitchen, disconsolately drinking a cup of tea. Insomnia has never been a feature of the Plowshares' lives: all pride themselves on the ability to sleep eight hours, regardless of mental or physical discomfort. So John knows that all is not well. 'What's on your mind?' he asks, as he refills the tea-pot. 'I'm really sorry to have disturbed you as well,' says Alison. 'I know it's ridiculous, but I'm worrying about Carol at work.' As John pours himself a cup of tea and settles down, the story comes out. Carol, like Alison, is a part-time receptionist at the local GP's surgery. Although, on the whole, this is, a fulfilling and enjoyable job, it does not pay terribly well. In fact it pays rather badly - roughly Pounds 5,000 a year for 20 hours a week. Despite this, all was well until two months ago when Carol's husband George lost his much better-paid job as an accountant with a small building company that had hit hard times. During the more affluent days of the late 1980s, Carol and George had expanded their lifestyle rather ambitiously, taking on a large house and a correspondingly large mortgage. With George's redundancy, Carol has found herself the sole breadwinner, and with the loss of his salary, they have inevitably not been able to keep up their mortgage payments. Carol arrived at work one morning the previous week, clearly upset. She confessed to Alison that she had not been opening the letters that were beginning to arrive from the couple's mortgage lenders; while George had become extremely depressed and was apparently unable to deal with the situation. 'I just feel so ill-equipped to help,' Alison tells John, mournfully. 'There's that awful feeling of 'there but for the grace of God go I', and I would like to do something practical to help, but Lord knows what.' John is certain that something can be done, but equally certain that it cannot be done at four o'clock in the morning. He suggests that, during the day, Alison encourage Carol to visit either the Citizen's Advice Bureau or some sort of independent debt counsellor or money adviser. Several days later, Alison greets John, as he arrives home from work, with the details of her visit with Carol to an independent money adviser, Patricia Cook, at the local town hall. 'We may not have helped sort out Carol and George's problems completely, but we have reduced them to manageable piles, which can then be sorted out,' explains Alison. 'According to Patricia, the first thing to do if you find that you can't pay your mortgage is to talk to the mortgage lender.' In a glorious mix of metaphors, Alison explains that you can't sweep debt problems under the carpet, play ostrich and expect them to go away: 'You must face up to them,' she adds, explaining that mortgage lenders, confronted with the growing problem of people having difficulties meeting repayments, are keen to help their borrowers who are in difficulties. 'These days, mortgage lenders are as sympathetic as they can commercially afford to be,' says Alison. The next thing to do is to analyse what money is coming in and, based upon that, determine what entitlement to state benefits there may be, and whether a tax rebate may be due following the redundancy itself. Unfortunately, even though Carol's earnings are so low, she works more than 16 hours a week - 20, like Alison - so that the family is not eligible for income support. 'Do you realise that Carol falls into the 'poverty trap' and could actually be better off not working?' says Alison, as she starts to prepare supper. 'If she worked less than 16 hours a week, the state would contribute towards the interest on her and George's mortgage.' There is also a big question-mark over whether Carol and George may be eligible for one of the new types of mortgage-to-rent scheme. There is no national scheme, Carol has discovered, only schemes set up by individual lenders. These range from simple systems where you pay what you can afford, in the hope of finding more income or being able to sell the property, to a scheme where the lender, working through a housing association, takes over your property and then lets it back to you. This turns the former owner into a tenant, which can make him more eligible for state benefits. The problem with this type of scheme is that the eligibility criteria are very tight. And again, the fact that Carol is still working may make the couple unsuitable. But another sound piece of advice from Patricia Cook is to prioritise debts. 'Did you know,' asks Alison, 'that if you don't pay your mortgage, you could lose your home, which is bad enough. But if you don't pay your poll tax, you could go to prison. So you need to be certain which debts have the greatest priority for payment and pay them in that order.' Alison reports that, at the end of a rather trying meeting, Carol had felt reassured that positive steps could be taken to sort out her family's problems before they got more out of hand. George was now applying for a tax rebate, and he and Carol were trying to decide whether it would be better for her to give up her job over the short-term and get state aid towards the mortgage, or to wait in expectation of George's finding work soon. Having done something constructive to help her friend, Alison looks forward to a good night's sleep. If you have problems with your mortgage repayments, or know someone who does, you can get copies of the leaflet 'Assistance with Mortgage Repayments', free of charge, by sending a stamped addressed envelope to the Building Societies Association/Council of Mortgage Lenders Bookshop, 3 Savile Row, London WlX 1AF WHO'S WHO: The Plowshares live in one of the smarter bits of North London. John, who is 50, is a partner in an architectural practice and earned Pounds 50,000 last year. His wife Alison, in her late forties, has a part-time job as a receptionist for the local GP. The Plowshares have two children: Lucy, who is 21 and at university in the Midlands; and Toby, 18, who has just left school. Following the deaths of John's parents and his subsequent inheritance, the Plowshares have a portfolio of unit trusts, a personal equity plan each and some rainy-day money in a building society.</p>

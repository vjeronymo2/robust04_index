			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / No to D-day flags: The anniversary should not be a selective event inspired by nostalgia Next Monday, certain western governments will be celebrating the anniversary of the D-day landings 50 years ago. The invasion of Normandy by American, British and other allied forces was, of course, an extraordinary military exploit; a great achievement of strategic organisation, a scene of heroism, and a turning point in the war against Hitler's Nazi regime. But with the perspective of all that has happened since, it is hard to understand why this particular military event is being given this kind of public emphasis by today's political leaders. First, it is obviously inappropriate to embark on any kind of simplistic military triumphalism. This was an achievement only bought with immense human suffering, on both sides. There are veterans who lost comrades, and families that lost fathers, husbands or brothers; it is they who can claim an inalienable part of the truth about this campaign. If D-day is to be remembered, it should surely be in a solemn commemoration in church or by a graveside, not with the nationalistic waving of flags. The significance of the Normandy invasion surely should not be reduced to the public rhetoric of patriotic glory. In any case, the D-day celebrations seem designed to convey a misleading interpretation of history. The flag-waving tacitly suggests that it was the western allies who defeated Hitler, single-handed. We know that the former Soviet Union played at least as big a part, and suffered much bigger loss of life; but do we celebrate the seige of Leningrad, or the battle of Stalingrad, or the reconquest of Ukraine? We do not. The reluctance of western propagandists at the time to publicise the heroism of the Russians was subsequently reinforced by the cold war. But, in addition, the western celebrations of the Normandy landings have been kept alive as part of a hidden agenda; or rather, two hidden agendas, one French, one British. The French have promoted the D-day commemorations for reasons of national mythology, the British for national nostalgia. For the French, it is a way of sustaining the legend that, in the liberation of France, they played an equal part with the Americans, the British and the other allies. This is a partial view of history. General de Gaulle was a great man, and the Resistance made an important contribution; but the French role in winning the war in the west was marginal compared with the overwhelming part played by the Americans. The Gaullist legend became a vital part of the mythology, to exorcise the painful memory of France's humiliating collapse in 1940 and the long and willing collaboration of the Petain regime with Hitler's Germany. The exorcism and the mythology were necessary, in turn, to justify France's role, from 1944 on, as one of the big four postwar powers, with a share in the occupation of Germany and a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Since France's great-power eminence is now challenged by the rise of united Germany, it is all the more important to keep alive the memory of D-day. For Britain, the commemoration of D-day has been made a central feature of the national nostalgia for the days of military glory, when Britain was great and victorious. Above all, those were the days when Britain was allied, on what seemed like almost equal terms, with the Americans. The British have never quite got over the excitement of the association. The habits and principles of military co-operation developed for D-day became the indelible and sacred template for the later military integration of Nato; and the British are still playing the role of high priests of Nato, as if history and American policy had not moved on. In political terms, the memory of the Anglo-American line-up against the continental Axis established a distorting prism which is still reflected today in the knee-jerk anti-Europeanism of Britain's ruling Conservative party. For the purposes of its campaign for the European parliament election on June 9 and 12, the Conservative party appears to be trying to idealise D-day as the epitome of a lost 'golden age'. The reality is that it was one important turning point in a world war which only a minority can now remember; it was not the end of history. In the meantime, the kaleidoscope has shifted several times in spectacular fashion. The Russians, who were then our allies, became our enemies for 45 years, but are now friends with us again, or at least precarious partners. The Germans who were then the anathema of the civilised world, soon became our allies, and central protagonists in the long process of building a peaceful, democratic and integrated Europe. If we were celebrating D-day as a symbol of the defeat of Nazism, it would be more broad-minded if we included the Russians; and it should be easier to do so now that we have defeated the aggressive pretensions of Soviet communism, especially since we did so, not through war, but through the peaceful strategy of deterrence exerted by the North Atlantic alliance. But we could also celebrate the Normandy invasion as a symbol of the banishment for the subsequent four decades of war from the continent of Europe; in which case we should include the Germans. Instead, we are to have a selective celebration, inspired by an atavistic nostalgia, which seems designed to deny everything that has been learned in Europe over the past 50 years. It seems a great pity.</p>

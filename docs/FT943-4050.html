			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Inside the world of the money hunters - If divorce looks inevitable, some people call for their lawyers first - and a forensic accountant next. Barbara Ellis examines their role Lawyers are usually the first professionals to be called in by a divorcing couple but, in some instances, forensic accountants - who carry out specialised work for court cases - may be consulted almost as quickly. Indeed, clients - particularly those involved in divorce actions - often put lawyers under pressure to bring in a forensic accountant, according to Pauline Walker, a family law specialist with London solicitor Baileys, Shaw &amp; Gillett. 'It was awfully fashionable in the late '80s,' she says, 'but not so much now, though. This is partly because the courts have come down heavily on spending large sums of money on investigations.' Walker adds that most wives and husbands with business interests will always accuse the other partner of having money secretly tucked away. She cautions, however: 'Little chunks of Pounds 3,000 or Pounds 4,000 don't matter. With forensic accountants on the same rates as central London lawyers, you need to be finding Pounds 50,000 or Pounds 100,000 to make an investigation worthwhile.' Accountants see their main work in divorce cases as injecting some detached financial objectivity into what can be an emotional minefield. In practical terms, this usually means running a check on the affidavit of means sworn by each party in the divorce (these are used as the basis of the financial settlement). Chartered accountant Peter Lobbenberg, a specialist in the forensic side, says about 75 per cent of the divorce cases with which he deals involve women tracking down a husband's money, and 25 per cent men defending themselves - 'probably because a man usually has his own accountant and financial set-up'. Among the typical questions the accountant is asked, Lobbenberg cites: How much is my husband worth? Where has he hidden it? How can he raise the money? How much does my wife really need? Checking past life-style against declared income is routine. Lobbenberg says it is probably easier for a sole trader or individual to hide assets than for someone owning a company, but easiest for someone in a cash business. 'Sometimes,' he adds, 'part of my responsibility is having to tell over-optimistic clients either that the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow doesn't exist or that the chances of finding it won't justify the cost.' Lobbenberg charges Pounds 200 an hour plus value added tax, and says his cases are typically in the Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 3,000 fee range (although some end up in five figures while others are much lower). In common with other accountants in this field, he has a computer programme and a standard charge of Pounds 400 plus VAT for so-called Duxbury calculations. These are based on the 1987 case of Duxbury v Duxbury when the former wife of a millionaire was awarded sufficient income to satisfy her reasonable requirements, but also take into account the amount of income to be received each year, inflation, tax rates and allowances. Many City accountants charge around Pounds 200 an hour for their services. At Touche Ross, Mike Barford estimates that divorce makes up about 5 or 10 per cent of the work of the forensic department. He says many divorce cases would involve total accounting costs of between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 5,000, although the bill would be greater for a case that was large or complicated. Touche Ross charges Pounds 300 for its Duxbury programme, but Barford points out that this is used less often now that lawyers have access to handbooks detailing the same information. Barford says divorce candidates sometimes overlook the importance of taking care over the affidavit of means. 'People are feeling very bitter and emotional and, if one party misses things out, there is often a tendency for the other to assume it is deliberate.' Another aspect of divorce cases often misunderstood is what a court can award. 'Matrimonial cases are different from other litigation because the judge can split only the assets there are,' says Barford. 'A judge will never say the husband has behaved appallingly so he has to find the money.' Costs run up by each side will deplete the amount available to be split. Barford recalls a case where one party was convinced that the other was extremely wealthy. 'By the time it was discovered he was not, over half the joint assets had been spent on the investigation.' Barford adds: 'If the husband is hugely wealthy, the award to the wife will broadly be based on her life-style. If she has been used to spending Pounds 100,000 and that is well within his capacity, then, broadly speaking, that is what she will get. 'If he declares Pounds 10m and the wife says he is lying and that he has Pounds 20m, it doesn't matter. If there are more assets than are needed to pay the wife, you don't need to investigate.' On the other hand, Barford stresses there is no point in spending money to prove that someone is used to a certain life-style if there are no assets left to maintain it. As he explains: 'A typical situation might be the wife of a Lloyd's Name who has led an expansive life-style and might feel entitled to it. But circumstances have changed. He is about to go bust and there is simply not the money available. You can only have what there is.'</p>

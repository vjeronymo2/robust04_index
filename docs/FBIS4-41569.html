			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business SNARK" file] </F>   [Text] Yerevan [dateline as received] -- Iranian market has  become the principal consumer of Armenian machinery. Last year,  over 90 percent of machine export went to Iran, for a sum  totalling nearly half-million dollars. As told the head of  machine-production Administration in the Armenian Industrial  Ministry, Vardgues Majaryan, appearance at the Iranian market  has saved many machine- building plants in Armenia from  bankruptcy, since the CIS market, due to blockade and transport  problems, has become inaccessible. During the whole last year  only 70 machines were exported to CIS countries. However, as  thinks Majaryan, the relatively high demand for Armenian  machines in Iran is not an escape from the hard situation in  which the industry has found itself. The thing is that Iranian  market has purely consumptional and mediatory character, rather  than industrial purposes. Thus the milling engine, which costs  4 to 5 thousand dollars, is sold to Iran at a half-price. As  thinks the head administrator, the production of heavy machines  in Armenia is not justified, since their sale is difficult. The  machine building industry passes today to the output of small  universal machines, the demand for which is rather high.</p>

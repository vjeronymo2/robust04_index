The Secret of Esteemed Frau Kopel's Success Lies in the  Millions"]]    [Text] Volgograd--They pleaded: do not harm us. If Germany  refuses us help, we will have nothing else to put our hopes in.  Our children have no native tongue. Our adults are the most  uneducated nation in the country. There are no churches left for  our believers. But who today wants to have anything to do with  these trivial problems? If Germany, too, refuses help, we will  have no future in Russia.    They pleaded: tell the truth. For it is even worse to live  in  a lie than it is to live in poverty. And with the consent of the  people who trusted me, I am choosing the honest truth.    Throughout the past four years the question of Russian  Germans as a repressed and not entirely rehabilitated people was  a stumbling block for the two countries' politicians, for the  public and for individual citizens. Passions seethed, dozens of  conferences were held, and journalists engaged in furious  debate. A separate republic. An autonomous national cultural  entity. Renaissance. The desert lands of Elton. Practically  everything imaginable was proposed to solve these problems. And  the Soviet Germans quietly gathered their belongings and left  for the West.    Two hundred and fifty years ago their ancestors had fled  Germany to Russia. Because things were bad there and good here.  Now things are good there and bad here. And people always are  pulled to where things are better. In 1989 100,000 Germans left  the Soviet homeland. In 1993, about 200,000 left. As a rule,  these are skilled workers and the most industrious peasants.  There are few members of the intelligentsia among them. That is  because as of the beginning of the 1990s only about four Soviet  Germans in 100 had a higher education.    Today no one speaks any longer about an autonomous entity.  The explosion of ethnic conflicts has cooled the hottest heads.    Today on the intergovernmental level projects of ordinary  socioeconomic and cultural development of the territories where  there are concentrations of Russian Germans are being proposed  and carried out. Germany is giving special attention to the  Volga region. Equipment for schools, hospitals and mini plants  is being sent there, along with equipment for private farmers  and humanitarian aid. We spoke with those to whom this aid is  directed and heard: "No one needs us--neither Russia nor  Germany." These attitudes are especially strong in Volgograd  Oblast.    "Our taxpayers' money is being spent uselessly in Russia." A  scandal over this matter, after gradually ripening, suddenly  burst into the open, stirring up not only the upper echelons of  power but also Germany's public opinion. The most popular  publications started talking about Germany's having gotten  bogged down in Russian problems.    Investigators from the Federal Accounting House, analyzing  reports on aid to Russian Germans, discovered that the financial  investments did not accord with existing expenditures. Millions  of deutsche marks had disappeared altogether, and no one knew  where. The state prosecutor got involved in the case.    And everything had started in 1990, when, under the pressure  of the fourth wave of emigration from the Soviet Union and the  problem of determining the status of the eastern lands,  Germany's government reached the conclusion that it was better  to aid Russian Germans within Russia itself than to help them  migrate to the FRG. All that needed to be done was to create the  necessary conditions for the development of their own culture  and education and provide them with economic support, and  everything would be fine.    A Mr. Waffenschmidt, the German Ministry of the Interior's  official in charge of immigrant affairs, was assigned the job of  preparing the project and carrying it out with the help of  Soviet Germans. However, not having any concept of his own on  this account, the civil servant shifted the burden of the  problems onto the Association for Germans Abroad (VDA), turning  it into his money courier. Today Karsten Slamelcher, VDA's  federal secretary, has been sent on an indefinite leave that  looks very much like a permanent separation. His further fate  depends on the results of an investigation. However, Germany's  prosecutor will hardly succeed in finding the ends of all the  German money lost in Russia without help from Russia itself. In  any case, our attempt to conduct our own journalistic  investigation in Volgograd, where a VDA bureau has been  operating for two years, led to the surprising conclusion: the  truth about the money has no place whatsoever among the  interests of the local civil servants.    The VDA bureau was set up in the spring of 1992 in  Volgograd.  A certain citizen from Ulyanovsk who calls herself Frau Kopel,  became the head of it. The history of the frau's appearance and  activities in Volgograd is mysterious. While spending a  half-year in VDA courses in Germany, the Russian citizen  Svetlana Kopel gained the support and trust of Mr. Slamelcher.  After returning to Russia, she became acquainted with yet  another influential "comrade," Anatoliy Yegin, Volgograd  Oblast's deputy governor for ethnic questions. By mutual  agreement of the two men, Svetlana moved to Volgograd, where she  opened and became head of the VDA bureau, which is supposed to  implement the program of aid to Russian Germans on behalf of the  German government.    For reasons known only to her, the Frau did not register the  bureau, did not open a bank account, and herself obtained no  residence permit in Volgograd, remaining officially employed in  the Saratov Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Under Russian  laws, this means that the VDA company in Volgograd does not  exist, and the frau herself is not a resident and taxpayer of  that city.    Through unknown means, but most likely not without the help  of Yegin, she managed to obtain permission and have a seal of  the Volgograd VDA bureau made. The firm does not exist, but its  seal does. So she could get to work.    In accordance with an intergovernmental agreement, Germany  pledged to finance the construction in eight Volgograd villages  of 800 cottages for immigrants from the former USSR. Naturally,  the homes were intended primarily for Russian Germans. The  overall expenditures required investments of more than 8 million  DM. Our country assumed obligations to build the infrastructure  for the revived villages. The total expenditures are unknown.  Volgograd Oblast's Deputy Governor Yegin was in charge of the  project on Russia's behalf. Frau Kopel was in charge of it on  Germany's behalf.    In the summer of 1992, Yegin, who knows nothing about  construction, singlehandedly distributed the most profitable  contracts, for which foreign exchange had been allocated, among  local companies. "Who has what proposals?"    There were proposals. In certain cases the cost of houses  grew to more than one and one-half times what had been planned.  Once again, the reasons are unknown.    The participants in this highly unique "competition"  included  the owner of the VEST Individual Private Enterprise, a  well-known former knitwear factory shop chief named Karapetyan.  He got a contract to build 65 houses in the village of Umet for  a total cost of 3.2 million marks. Yegin's decision to enlist  Karapetyan in the German project is yet another riddle, since  prior to June 1993 VEST had no license for construction work,  and the deadline for fulfilling the contract expired in  November. But Kopel approved the contract, paying an advance of  620,000 marks--part of it in cash.    When a German government delegation visited the village of  Umet in November 1993, it was horrified: foundation pits that  had been dug for 17 houses and foundations that had been laid  were filled with ground water. There was hardened cement. Here  and there stacks of broken brick had been laid with the mastery  of primordial man. And this was 190,000 marks' worth. The  Germans dissolved the contract and demanded that the advance of  620,000 marks be returned. No one has returned the money to them.    Incidentally, seven out of the eight contracts handed out by  the generous hand of Yegin have still not been carried out.  Although the deadline for their fulfillment has long since  passed.    In 18 months of life in Volgograd, Frau Kopel's wealth  increased with cosmic speed. It is possible that not only the  German government's lack of oversight over the expenditure of  funds in Russia, but also the VDA Volgograd bureau's lack of a  bank account contributed to this.    The frau brought hundreds of thousands of marks from Germany  to Volgograd in nothing more than a suitcase. Out of this truly  golden suitcase, she withdrew personally for herself tax-free  wages of 4,600 marks. Incidentally, not a single one of the  executives of Russia's other VDA agencies earns so much. The  suitcase also produced a bonus of 8,000 marks and then 30,000  marks for the purchase of the apartment where Svetlana's mama  now lives. This, incidentally, is also a unique phenomenon--none  of the executives of the other Russian bureaus has received  money for the acquisition of housing.    Money from the same suitcase was used to acquire four motor  vehicles for the needs of the Volgograd VDA bureau. Only they  were registered, with Slamelcher's permission, in the name of  Frau Kopel and are kept in her personal garage. This four-car  garage is attached to the two-story home that Svetlana has also  managed to acquire in 18 months of living in Volgograd. And the  more the frau's property grew, the more incomprehensible events  occurred in the VDA bureau.    First a very valuable computer disappeared, and then a fax  machine, and then certain other small items. On the other hand,  the firm's rolls include people whom no one has ever seen. The  bureau's employees have dubbed them "dead souls." However, the  "dead" contrived to get their pay in foreign exchange. They  included, for example, the director of the Saratov Chamber of  Commerce and Industry and certain other interesting citizens.  Only suddenly something unforeseen happened: part of the report  documents disappeared from the VDA office. This was connected  with a scandal in Germany, which broke out at the end of 1993.    The FRG Federal Accounting House demanded a report on the  budget-financed money that had been spent in Russia. And  delegations from the German Ministry of the Interior became  frequent visitors in Volgograd. They did not want to hear any  more of Mr. Yegin's eloquent discussion, and they demanded that  they be taken to visit the construction projects and the schools  and enterprises where German equipment had been installed.    Slamelcher's position became shaky. Yegin's was not yet.    The frightened Slamelcher sent a telex to Volgograd: "The  contract with Kopel is dissolved. She is not to be allowed to  work with documents until the new bureau director arrives and  affairs are turned over to him." This was on 23 December 1993.  And on 24 December Kopel appeared in the firm's office in the  accompaniment of a man. He showed VDA employees his credentials:  "Maj Shcherbak, chief of the Ninth Division of the Central Rayon  Department of Internal Affairs." Together they opened sealed  doors of the director's office, put something in a suitcase, and  left. The raid, covered by the officer's epaulets, was repeated  two more times. And once again, a suitcase was carried off.  During all this time the major was officially on leave. After  the second visit of Kopel and Shcherbak, the VDA employees wrote  a complaint to the militia. It disappeared. During the third  visit they called the OMON special militia. In the presence of  armed officers, the "raiders" laid the valuables they had taken  on the table. They turned out to be contracts for the lease of  tractors that Germany had turned over to Volgograd farmers,  certain contracts with "dead souls," and reports on the  allocation of humanitarian aid and medical equipment. They were  all confiscated as evidence by the Central Rayon Department of  Internal Affairs "in the interest of the investigation," and the  bank packages of currency--70,000 DM, about $2,000, and several  million rubles--were also sent to the same place.    A couple of weeks later Mr. Tsilke, the new director of the  Volgograd VDA, demanded that the militia return the firm's  property. The money was returned. Not to the VDA, however, but  to citizen Kopel. The investigator's explanation was murderous  in its logic: "The lady said that the money belonged to her."  And the "lady said" also that as soon as she left the militia  office she was robbed immediately, so she no longer has  possession of either the marks or the dollars.    One could tell something else about the humanitarian aid  from  Germany that was sold through the rayon trading organization,  with the money earned subsequently being loaned at interest. And  about how that aid was selectively unloaded at Lebyazhye Field  from Boeings into the cars of civil servants from Yegin's  department. One could also tell a lot about the exchange of  delegations of schoolchildren, who for some reason were  accompanied to Germany by those same civil servants and their  wives. But all that is small potatoes, and all in the past.    Our task--to show the scale of the abuses connected with the  provision of aid to Russian Germans living on the territory of  Volgograd--has proved impossible to accomplish. It is already  virtually impossible to find the German money that has been lost  in Russia.    The Russian Germans still have draft programs for the  revival  of their own culture and for the social and economic development  of the territories in which concentrations of them reside. The  programs, however, are based not on humanitarian assistance but  on the establishment of joint ventures. But local civil servants  do not want to hear of these proposals. It is more interesting  for them to tackle the problems of Russian Germans without the  Russian Germans themselves, so that they can satisfy their own  personal requirements in the course of the business. And in the  broader sense, both sides are to blame for this. Germany--for  the fact that it was too trusting of its own and another  country's civil servants. Russia--for the fact that it shifted  the problems of its own citizens onto the shoulders of Germany.  The color photos spread out on the VDA desk show a smiling and  embracing Yegin and Kopel, who is not a frau at all but citizen  Smirnova, who kept the name of her former husband--a Russian  German. As for Maj Shcherbak, he is living peaceably under the  same roof with the former frau. It's such a close-knit  collective.  <H5>  The Story Continues </H5>   At a session of a Russian-German intergovernmental  commission  that just began the other day in Bonn, one of the most urgent  questions will be that of implementing the Russian Federation  president's 21 February 1992 edict "On Urgent Measures for the  Rehabilitation of the Russian Germans." In many respects,  relations between the governments of Russia and Germany will  depend on the extent to which progress is made in creating the  German national territorial formations provided for by the  edict. As will the nature of the economic assistance in settling  Russian Germans in Volgograd Oblast. The government delegation  will include Anatoliy Yegin, deputy governor of Volgograd Oblast.</p>

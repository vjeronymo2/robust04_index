			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAGLES GET HOME DATE IN PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> NFC: PHILADELPHIA BEATS CARDINALS, 23-21, AND WILL PLAY HOST TO REDSKINS IN  WILD-CARD GAME.  </P> <P> Randall Cunningham didn't get his rushing record, but the Philadelphia Eagles  got what they wanted.  </P> <P> Cunningham threw three touchdown passes, two to Fred Barnett, as the Eagles  beat the Phoenix Cardinals, 23-21, Saturday to clinch the home-field advantage  for their first-round playoff game.  </P> <P> The Eagles (10-6) will play host to the Washington Redskins in an NFC wild-card  game next weekend.  </P> <P> "We got what we wanted and what we needed and that's the home-field advantage,"  Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan said. "We know Washington well and they know us  well. It'll be another tough game, like the other two this year."  </P> <P> Phoenix ended its season with its third consecutive loss and finished 5-11 for  the second year in a row.  </P> <P> "We're not proud of our record, but we've grown," said first-year Cardinal  Coach Joe Bugel. "The Eagles are one of the beasts of the East. We beat them  earlier this season and we almost beat them again here."  </P> <P> Phoenix trailed, 23-7, early in the fourth quarter and closed to 23-21 on two  touchdown passes by Timm Rosenbach -- a 38-yard play to rookie Ricky Proehl  with 5:56 remaining and a 45-yarder to J.T. Smith with 1:51 left.  </P> <P> Al Del Greco's first on-sides kick attempt went out of bounds and his second  was recovered by Philadelphia's William Frizzell at the Phoenix 45. The Eagles  then ran out the clock.  </P> <P> "A typical Cardinal-Eagle game," Ryan said. "They always seem to come down to  the end."  </P> <P> Cunningham completed 13 of 19 passes for 172 yards and rushed four times for 60  yards before being replaced by Jim McMahon late in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Cunningham entered the game needing 87 yards to break the NFL's single-season  record for most yards rushing by a quarterback -- 968, set by Chicago's Bobby  Douglass in 1972.  </P> <P> "I didn't think about bringing Randall back in," Ryan said. "Jim was doing a  good job. I also didn't think about getting him the record. But I did give a  game ball to Randall."  </P> <P> Said Cunningham: "I'm not disappointed at all about not breaking the record.  I'm just happy we won. Buddy told me to get it done within a quarter or two  because I was coming out. Throwing a few touchdowns and having the home-field  advantage is good enough for me."  </P></p>

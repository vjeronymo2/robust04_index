For it was a veritable roll-call of Italy's industrial, judicial, religious and political potentates who gathered on Wednesday evening for the launch of his book, Crossing the Threshold of Hope.

Sitting humbly in the front row was Cesare Romiti, chief executive of Fiat, flanked either side by archbishops; Gherardo Colombo, one of Milan's anti-corruption magistrates, was placed just behind. Most prominent absentee - apart from the pontiff himself - was Silvio Berlusconi, who was otherwise engaged in Rome. His actress wife Veronica was present, however - as was the Italian prime minister in spirit, by dint of the vast reach of his commercial empire. Rushing to the aid of Mrs Berlusconi, whose arrival nearly caused a bout of fisticuffs between greedy hacks and photographers, were Berlusconi staff from Mondadori, publishers of the book, assiduously shielding her from the attentions of employees from another part of the group, Fininvest's three television channels.</p>

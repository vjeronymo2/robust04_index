			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Police Friday [1 April]  arrested two rightists and rescued two people who had been held  hostage for nearly six hours inside the ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper  headquarters in Tokyo. Police identified the rightists as  Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41, and Toshikazu Furusawa, 29, both from the  Taihikai right-wing group.    The two were arrested at around 7:10 P.M. Uchiyama was  carrying a sword at the time of the arrest and police said they  recovered four sticks of dynamite. The two men had held Kei  Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge of the company's public  relations department, and Mikinori Yoshida, 51, the head of the  secretarial department, in an executive reception room on the  15th floor, police said.    Before breaking into the building, the two rightists,  carrying a sword, a handgun and what they said were two sticks  of dynamite, threatened a security guard with the handgun,  police said.    Pamphlets distributed by the two men described the mass  media  as a "Class A war criminal" and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to  "amend the tone of its news coverage." The pamphlets also  criticized Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for his failure to  retract a statement apologizing for Japan's wartime activities  in Asia which he said were "a war of aggression."    Police said the rightists entered the building at about 1:30  P.M., told the security guard the gun they had was not a fake  and they wanted to meet the company's president. Police said  one of the men fired a shot when another security guard  approached but no one was injured.    They then rode an elevator to the 15th floor where they used  desks and potted plants to barricade themselves inside the  executive reception room with the hostages.    Friday's hostage situation was the second violent incident  in  five months at the headquarters of the mass-circulation ASAHI  SHIMBUN involving the Taihikai. On October 20, Shusuke Nomura,  58, the leader of the group, entered the building and committed  suicide during a meeting with the company's executives in  protest over the use of a cartoon parodying his group in a  weekly magazine affiliated with the company.    Police said the two men arrested Friday told the security  guard they are "disciples" of Nomura. Furusawa was Nomura's  secretary and chauffeur. He was present in the same room with  Nomura and other ASAHI SHIMBUN executives when Nomura shot  himself, police said.    On November 12, 1991, police arrested Uchiyama after he set  off a fire bomb in his own car outside the Tokyo residence of  former Liberal Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru.</p>

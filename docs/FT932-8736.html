			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Uzbekistan cuts vital links Kyrgyzstan said yesterday that neighbouring Uzbekistan had cut vital energy supplies and communication links, raising tension between the two former Soviet republics in central Asia, Reuter reports from Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Telephone links were cut, the land border was closed and gas supplies were sharply reduced in an Uzbek protest over a new currency which Kyrgyzstan has issued to replace the rouble which Uzbekistan still uses.</p>

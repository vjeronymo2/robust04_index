			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] RAROTONGA, March 24 (AFP) -- The ruling Cook  Islands Party (CIP) won general elections in the South Pacific  tax haven Thursday, after a bruising campaign marked by  allegations of fiscal fraud and wild spending on an  Italian-funded hotel project. With 21 of the 25 seats declared  in the Legislative Assembly, CIP, led by Prime Minister Sir  Geoffrey Henry, held 16, a decline of one compared with the  outgoing parliament, while the Democratic Party had three seats  and the Alliance two.    The Cooks is one of the world's smallest nations, with  18,500  people spread over one of the largest sea areas in the world.  The election was coloured by claims in the New Zealand  parliament that the Cook Island's status as a tax haven had been  abused, to defraud taxpayers and banks internationally.    The allegations, strongly denied, were made by New Zealand  MP  Winston Peters, who also charged that some Cooks politicians had  received money in secret bank accounts "to encourage (them)...to  sell their sovereignty". A hundred million dollars had been  defrauded, he said.    For the first time the Cooks had a television station to air  the claims and counter-claims, giving the election an air of  tension. However veteran local observers said this election was  just child's play compared with polls of the 1970s when CIP  founder Albert Henry, an uncle of Geoffrey, used money from a US  millionaire who had the Cooks' stamp printing franchise, to fly  in voters from New Zealand to stuff ballot boxes. Henry won  several doubtful elections but was eventually ejected from  office in 1978 when found guilty of corruption.    Democratic Party leader Sir Tom Davis, a former doctor with  the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),  took over until 1983 when Geoffrey Henry came to power. Henry,  53, has stamped his personal style on the Cook Islands, and  pushed ahead with developing the country's tourist industry with  a major airport and building a hotel under the Sheraton badge on  Rarotonga, the archipelago's main island. The project has been  sharply criticised for gigantic cost overruns and changes of  management, as well as a possibly destructive effect on the  local environment, threatening a beautiful lagoon.    Elections in the Cooks are for a term of five years,  conducted on a first past the post basis. Running with the  elections were referenda on the length of parliamentary office,  whether the country should have a native Maori name, which flag  to fly and which national anthem to play.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Collector to chase penalised businesses BUSINESSES that incur penalties for failing to file their accounts on time with Companies House will be rapidly referred to a private debt collection agency if they do not pay, it emerged yesterday. From July 1 companies will be fined up to Pounds 5,000 if they do not file accounts within the statutory period - seven months after the financial year end for public companies and 10 months for private ones. The Lewis Group beat Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Trade Indemnity for the contract as collection agency to Companies House, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry. The contract comes as part of a clampdown on late-filing companies. Companies House has set a target of increasing the proportion of companies that file on time from 80 per cent now to 91 per cent by 1995. It will invoice late-filing companies for the penalties and forward outstanding bills to Lewis after 30 days.</p>

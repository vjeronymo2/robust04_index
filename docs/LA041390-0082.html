			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI TO INVESTIGATE DEATHS THAT MAY BE WORK OF SERIAL KILLER  </P> <P> The FBI has entered the investigation of the murders of three young women in  the same San Diego neighborhood, which authorities believe might be the work of  a serial killer.  </P> <P> "They (San Diego police) submitted the case to us for analysis after the second  murder in February," said John Douglas, chief of the Behavioral Science Support  Unit at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va.  </P> <P> He said the agency has intensified its efforts since the third murder, the  April 3 slaying of a Michigan teen-ager.  </P> <P> "In a case like this, we pull out all the stops," Police Sgt. Dorothy Powell  said in confirming that the FBI has been called in.  </P> <P> Police theorize the slayings in the Clairemont area might be the work of one  killer because the victims were young women who were stabbed; the murders all  were committed at midday in apartments with no sign of forced entry; the  victims were found semi-nude, and the crimes took place within four months.  </P></p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (5): Last year's gains prove hard to repeat - John McManus finds that the Dublin stock exchange is experiencing a mediocre start to the year Dublin was one of the best performing stock markets in Europe last year. It has had a mediocre 1994 so far. The ISEQ index of Irish shares is down about 2 per cent on the year to date, compared with a 51 per cent rise last year in the prolonged bull run triggered by the devaluation of the Irish pound. Last year's spectacular gains involved significant catching up by the Dublin market after two years of under-performing London (which it traditionally shadows). The market's performance was exaggerated by the low valuations to which Irish stocks had sunk during 1991 and 1992 - relative to UK stocks - because of the difference in the interest rates prevailing in Ireland and the UK. The valuation differential between the two markets has largely been eliminated, according to Mr John Conroy, head analyst at Dublin's largest independent stockbroker, NCR. He predicts that further gains will be dictated by the performance of London and New York, the two markets which traditionally give a lead to Dublin. Mr Conroy believes Irish stocks are still attractive in valuation terms, on a stock by stock basis, as the outlook for domestic earnings is positive. Ireland is forecast to have one of the highest growth rates in the EU next year and government and independent forecasters predict that the Irish gross national product will grow by more than 4 per cent. But as in the other European markets, sustained progress will only take place in Dublin if international equity markets decouple from the bond markets which have been exerting a negative influence on them for much of this year. Last year saw big changes in the investor profile of the Irish stock market. Turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in 1992 and 1993, and the subsequent post-devaluation bull run, raised awareness of the Irish market. The market's increased visibility and the inclusion of 10 of the largest Irish stocks in the Morgan Stanley Capital Index, has raised the level of overseas investment in Irish stocks, particularly by US funds. Although the flow of US investment funds into Europe has been drying up as US interest rates tick upwards, most Irish analysts believe that US and overseas investors in the Irish market have taken a medium to long term view. 'It is a good time to buy Irish stocks, but only if international markets move ahead - we are not going to move on our own,' Mr Conroy says. The two big Irish banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, have both attracted international attention in recent months. They are seen as cheap, relative to the European sector. Both have strong domestic retail operations, controlling about 70 per cent of the market between them and can expect to benefit, in earnings terms, from the anticipated growth in the Irish economy. One of the biggest disadvantages for overseas investors in the Irish market is lack of stock diversity. AIB, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life, the state's largest life assurance company, and two industrial stocks, Smurfit and CRH, account for 54 per cent of the market's total capitalisation of IPounds 12bn. The top 10 listed companies have a total capitalisation of IPounds 9bn. Despite the expected arrival of two new companies on the exchange this year, Dublin will continue to suffer from a scarcity of listed large industrial and retail stocks. The country's largest supermarket chain, the IPounds 900m Dunne's Store empire, is privately owned. Quinnsworth, the second biggest retail chain, with a turnover in excess of IPounds 500m, is owned by Associated British Foods. The dominance of the market by financial stocks will be increased when Ireland's largest building society, the Irish Permanent, is floated in the middle of this year. The other new entrant to the market is DCC, which is seeking a listing, having successfully completed the transition from venture capital fund to industrial holding company over the past 10 years. Both floats are small in terms of the overall size of the market. DCC is expected to raise between about IPounds 10m and IPounds 20m through its flotation. The Irish Permanent may raise up to IPounds 70m. The biggest challenge facing the Irish stock exchange is the break with the London stock exchange scheduled for this year. The split is necessary to comply with the EU investment services directive, which specifies that each member state must regulate its own securities markets. (Since 1973 the Dublin stock exchange has been merged with the London stock exchange, which has effectively regulated the Irish market.) The Irish government is preparing legislation, the Stock Exchange Act, which will make the central Bank of Ireland the ultimate regulator of the Irish market. The Irish stock exchange's handling of two highly publicised incidents last year is being taken into account in the framing of the new laws. Davy, Ireland's largest stockbroker, was reprimanded and fined IPounds 150,000 by the London stock exchange last March for its role in the placing of the Irish government's 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the food company, in April 1994. The brokers initially told the government they had succeeded in placing the shares, but later admitted they had been unable to sell all the stock and had bought a proportion themselves to avoid embarrassment. The reasons for the reprimand were not made public - which led to a written request from the Irish government to Davy for an explanation. The result was an indication from the Irish government that the new Stock Exchange Act will insist on greater transparency in the Irish exchange's regulatory procedures. The Dublin exchange has also been criticised for failing to protect the interests of shareholders in the small listed property company CountyGlen, now the subject of an inquiry by an inspector appointed by the High Court. The inspector is looking at transactions which involved the expenditure of almost half of the company's assets of IPounds 2m without the approval of the company's 1,100 small shareholders. The stock exchange has yet to take any public disciplinary action. The new rules for the independent Dublin exchange will provide for more information about regulatory issues to made public. But they will be modelled on the London stock exchange's rule book which, according to Mr Tom Healy, manager of the Irish stock exchange, is being revised.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Amaury Halna du Fretay, President of the </F> GIFAS [French Aerospace Industries Group] Equipment Group, by  Jean Dupont; place and date not given: "`The Year 1994 Will Be  Still More Difficult Than Last Year'"]    [Text]    [Dupont] Your branch seems to have been relatively spared in  the 1994 defense budget. Would you say that it will help you  maintain employment at equipment manufacturers?    [Halna du Fretay] As you just said, the 1994 budget shows a  slight upturn. Unfortunately, it comes after several years when  it was reduced in current francs. It is a good sign; it shows  that the government is aware that the situation of our industry  had become tragically inadequate. For all that, this budget will  not enable us to solve all employment problems. Our current  activity also depends on previous years' budget commitments. Our  feeling is that the year 1994 will be still more difficult than  last year. There will be still more layoffs, more employment  adjustment plans, and probably more companies filing for  bankruptcy. I would like to add that the difficulties raised  against our prime contractors concerning the implementation of  employment adjustment plans constitute an incentive for them to  take back some activities and subcontracting. In other words,  you prevent layoffs in one place and you create them in another.  All we can say is that things will not get as much worse in  1994, with a defense equipment budget of 130 billion francs  [Fr], as would have been the case if the budget had remained at  Fr97 billion like last year.    [Dupont] Each new program increases self-financing by  manufacturers, in particular equipment manufacturers. Do you  feel that you are in a position to make the effort required?    [Halna du Fretay] For many French equipment manufacturers,  the need to provide additional co-financing while sales and  series production are decreasing and margins getting smaller  forces them to operate in the red or on the verge of it. For the  NH-90 program, the financing required of equipment manufacturers  represents 40 to 100 percent of design and engineering costs.  All equipment manufacturers are eager to compete for this  program, especially because there are not that many new  programs. But some will be unable to keep up with the  self-financing levels currently considered. In addition, with  NH-90 we have the quite abnormal situation of a military program  which may or may not go on to series production. On the other  hand, the U.S. government pays for 100 percent of military  research and development!    [Dupont] With declining deliveries of new aircraft, fleets  throughout the world are aging. What are French equipment  manufacturers doing to seize the opportunities that may arise in  customer service and modernization?    [Halna du Fretay] We can say today that French equipment  manufacturers have reached the level of their U.S. competitors  as far as customer service quality is concerned. Besides, since  the beginning of this decade, the Airbus inventory represents a  significant part of the world fleet, which now provides us with  a solid base for customer service.    As far as spare parts for older aircraft are concerned, our  competitors are the "brokers" and we must be at least as good as  they are; which means that we must offer airlines close-by  servicing facilities, just as they do. For new-generation  aircraft, we must increasingly be able to offer overall service  in the form of maintenance agreements based on flight-time, the  goal being to free airlines from the burden of maintaining spare  parts inventories. The same trend can also be observed on export  military markets, where equipment manufacturers are increasingly  required to provide these services. That is an additional effort  that we must make.    In another respect, fleet aging does create an emerging  market among airlines, to improve the operational capacities, in  particular landing, and the operating costs of their older  aircraft. As for the modernization of military aircraft, the  French are already quite well represented on these markets. But  this will never amount to much and it will not replace domestic  original-equipment markets.    [Dupont] The crisis in the aircraft manufacturing industry  hit equipment manufacturers before it hit prime contractors.  Will the recovery also be felt first at equipment manufacturers?    [Halna du Fretay] The crisis hit equipment manufacturers  before prime contractors because spare part markets collapsed  and original-equipment inventories were reduced, or because  prime contractors took back some activities. It is very  difficult to make a forecast as to the recovery of spare parts  markets. But if prime contractors have actually depleted their  intermediate product inventories, then I agree that recovery  might be stronger for us and pose rather difficult problems. In  some cases, we may even find that suppliers cannot cope because  they have reduced their activities so much that it will take  them a very long time to bring back their capacities to  pre-crisis levels.</p>

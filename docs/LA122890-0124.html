			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hong Kong Millionaires Advised on Immigration: The U.S. Consulate began  advising impatient Hong Kong millionaires on how to get in line for immigrant  visas to the United States in return for $1-million investments in U.S.  ventures. Under immigration law effective last month, visas will be granted to  aliens able to invest at least $1 million in a venture that employs 10 or more  Americans. Similar laws in Canada, Australia and Britain have caused tens of  thousands of Hong Kong Chinese to seek immigration papers.  </P></p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Growth of derivatives 'could hinder Fed' Rapid growth in the derivatives market could undermine the central bank's ability to contain a future financial crisis, a senior official of the US Federal Reserve warned yesterday. The warning from Fed governor Ms Susan Phillips came a day after the government of Orange County, a prosperous region in Southern California, admitted that it had incurred paper losses of around Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 957m) on a portfolio of investments that included a large number of derivatives - financial instruments whose value is based in part on some underlying market factor such as an interest rate or stock. The losses were prompted by the sharp declines in the US bond market this year. The impact of falling bond prices on Orange County's portfolio were exaggerated by the leveraged nature of the derivatives instruments which made up 25 per cent of the municipality's investment holdings. Although Ms Phillips was not commenting directly on the Orange County case yesterday, her remarks at a conference in Washington were clearly intended as a warning to the banks and securities firms which create and sell the derivatives, and the companies which buy them, to tread more carefully. The Fed governor said the central bank's normal system for providing funding to institutions during a crisis 'may not be well-suited' to deal with credit quality concerns, because growth in derivatives meant financial disturbances could now be rapidly transmitted from one part of the world's financial system to another. Ms Phillips also called for banks and securities firms to disclose more information on their derivatives activities. In California, meanwhile, the fallout from the revelation of Orange County's losses spread. Although treasurers of several cities in the region said they would not withdraw their funds from the troubled investment portfolio, the Standard &amp; Poor's ratings agency in New York - which is considering downgrading Orange County's debt - said it was concerned that publicity surrounding the losses might prompt some withdrawals, triggering a liquidity crisis.</p>

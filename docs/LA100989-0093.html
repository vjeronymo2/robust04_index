Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BRITISH SECURITY BLASTS ERRANT VAN  </P> <P> A Mexican trapeze artist today was the first victim of a massive security  operation at the Conservative Party conference in Blackpool after his van was  blown up by British troops.  </P> <P> Gerardo Rodogel, late for his act at a circus Sunday night, left the  Dutch-licensed van in a no-parking zone just yards from the site of the party's  annual meeting in this northern English seaside resort. Minutes later police  sealed off roads and called in army bomb disposal experts to carry out a  "controlled explosion."  </P> <P> Security has been very tight at Conservative Party conferences since their 1984  meeting when a bomb planted by Irish republican guerrillas almost killed Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher.  </P></p>

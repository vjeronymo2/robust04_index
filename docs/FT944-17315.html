			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No pay slips from employer I have been in my first job for 2 1/2 years and I am paid weekly by cheque with no supporting documentation. I have recently become aware that my employer should provide pay slips showing gross pay, deductions and net pay. My employer says I am not on pay-as-you-earn, so no deductions have been made for income tax or National Insurance and I have, unwittingly, become liable for arrears. What steps should I take to regularise my position? It could be that your pay is below the National Insurance and Paye thresholds, in which case you have nothing to worry about. But we suggest you talk things over with, say, someone at a Citizens Advice Bureau. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

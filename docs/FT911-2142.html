			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Learning the lessons of local democracy - Voters go to the polls against a backdrop of greater centralisation MALCOLM BRADBURY's 'History Man' in his eponymous 1970s novel was an unattractive, radical academic, spouting Trotsky, acting like Stalin and voting with Labour's hard left. Mr Simon Sedgwick-Jell, a real-life history lecturer and Labour leader of Cambridge city council, is an altogether different political animal and exemplary evidence of the party's new-found maturity. A proponent of 'radical realism', he says Labour has successfully sold its progressive policies only by serving its consumers high quality services under a strict financial regime. The outcome has been 11 years of Labour control in a seat that regularly returns a Tory MP. In this respect at least, the Cambridge leader's message is a model of modern Labourism. In others, though, he is arguably at odds with a party leadership that, while advocating devolved power, is regarded by many of its supporters as almost as didactically centralist as its Tory opponents. For the unspoken subtext behind tomorrow's local government elections is deep concern among all parties' local politicians at the systematic loss of power to Westminster. Like his Liberal Democrat opponents and, indeed, some Tories, Mr Sedgwick-Jell passionately supports local proportional representation, wants more powers for local government and disparages much of the party posturing dominating this week's elections. 'There is a needless level of confrontation in local government,' he says. 'Eleven months of the year we have a constructive debate, then in April everyone goes bonkers - it is unhealthy.' A whistlestop tour of six council elections confirms that this viewpoint is commonplace among local politicians. With more than 12,000 metropolitan, city and shire district council seats being contested, canvassers are having their ears burnt on the doorsteps about the sterility of party political rhetoric and the need for more action at local level. Excuses that the poll tax, capping and other restraints on local authorities' freedom of manoeuvre all come from Westminster only deepen public cynicism, already fuelled by recession and high mortgage rates. Moreover, a random sample of opinion taken from Nottingham, Milton Keynes, Bath, Plymouth, Cumbria and Cambridge revealed that a generally grumpy electorate is prone to those most dangerous of moods - both apathy and volatility. All this is rebounding on local politicians as a whole. Undoubtedly, the chief beneficiary of the poll tax saga must, as last year, be Labour, fighting in many areas from its low electoral base of 1987. While a few hung councils like Nottingham will be captured, party officials agree that the real measure of Labour's success rest on its progress in the Tory dominated south. A decline in the Liberal Democrat vote should be offset by gains in specially targetted areas. Looking beyond the national issues of poll tax reform and the economy, however, local politicians are now far more preoccupied with the 'softness' of their votes, a consequence, they assume, of their perceived powerlessness. The changes presented in Mr Norman Lamont's budget last month mean that councils' self-financed expenditure will now drop by Pounds 5.6bn to Pounds 9.1bn in 1991-92 at a time when government support has risen by Pounds 10bn to Pounds 52.5bn. Elsewhere, even some Tories are now expressing private disquiet at the creeping intrusion of Whitehall through such measures as opt-out schemes for schools. Parties may dispute the details of resource allocation, planning decisions or of housing schemes, but they are wholly united in their wishes for more local economic development, increased resources, planning autonomy and more housing. Tory Warwickshire is as spitting furious with the Department of the Environment's spending restraints as is Labour-controlled Milton Keynes. In both Plymouth and Penrith, politicians talk openly of getting a more sympathetic hearing in Brussels than in Westminster. Plymouth, with all-party agreement, is now an enthusiastic participant in Atlantic Arc, a political link up with other 'remote' coastal regions such as San Sebastian in Spain and Roscoff in Brittany. In Penrith, Mrs Joan Robinson, a Liberal Democrat councillor at both district and Cumbria county level, complained that perceptions of local government are based on an erroneous 'south-east' view that councils are necessarily spendthrift and, if Labour-led, inevitably 'loony' too. This hostility to London is by no means new, but it is mounting. Moreover, it now has a catalyst in the forthcoming debate over the reorganisation of boundaries. Most local politicians and chief executives agree that unitary authorities are the right way of governing local affairs. Achieving the critical mass needed to get real economies of scale, however, will reopen a debate about powers and resources almost certainly well beyond party control. How, they ask, can the voguish concept of 'citizen power' be reconciled with ever-diminishing local autonomy? On Friday, psephologists will pour over the election results for clues as to national trends for the general election to come. Local government analysts, however, will look at the turnout - down to 45 per cent in the last comparable vote in 1987 - fearing more evidence of voter alienation. 'People are perplexed by the condition of local government, of appalling traffic and poor transport,' says Mr Andrew Duff, former leader of Cambridge's Liberal Democrats. 'They are extremely cynical and sceptical about the claims of all politicians to build homes and improve education. 'The first party that can back out of this ghetto will reap the whirlwind.' Mr Sedgwick-Jell, his longtime opponent, would be the first to agree.</p>

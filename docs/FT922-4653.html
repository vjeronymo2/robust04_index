			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / EC vows to ratify Maastricht: Shocked leaders search for solution to crisis after Danes reject treaty EUROPEAN Community leaders vowed to press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty yesterday, in shocked but determined response to the 'No' vote in the Danish referendum on Tuesday. Although heads of government expressed their determination to see the process of ratification completed by the end of the year, they were still trying to fathom the legal implication for a treaty which requires ratification by all 12 member states. 'We are in big trouble,' a senior German official said. 'It will take very careful and skilful management to get Maastricht adopted,' added a Commission offical. The next steps will become clearer today when Nato foreign ministers meet in Oslo where they will hear Denmark's proposals on how to break the impasse. President Francois Mitterrand announced that France would continue with the ratification process but would submit it to popular referendum. The announcement was evidently precipitated by the Danish vote, although most observers have long expected Mr Mitterrand to hold a referendum in the autumn. Mr John Major also pledged to press ahead with ratification, but ruled a referendum. Other EC leaders took a tough position on the Danish vote. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the foreign minister of Portugal which currently holds the EC presidency, said: 'There is strong unanimity that the Eleven should go ahead, without any hesitation, to fulfil the (Maastricht) obligations.' He insisted that there was 'no room for renegotiating' the treaty which took over a year to finalise. He added: 'One cannot imagine that a country which does not share the fundamental objectives of the Community can continue to be a member state.' Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, speaking after an emergency session of the European Commission, called for other member states to ratify Maastricht by the end of this year. The Danish vote, Mr Delors warned, would have 'consequences, not only for the Community itself, but for Denmark and the Danes, and also for the prospects of enlarging the Community'. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said the Danish vote might delay the movement towards economic and monetary union, but that 'we will probably get there'. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of Banque de France, said the outcome meant that EC members had to 'go more quickly to ratification of Emu'. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, said work on moving towards monetary union by the central bank governors would continue. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said renegotiation of the treaty was out of the question, and insisted that Germany and the rest of the EC should pursue ratification. In a joint statement, he and Mr Mitterrand declared their determination to press ahead towards European union. Senior German officials admitted, however, that they could see no way to pass the treaty into EC law without the approval of all 12 member states. 'This amounts to an amendment of the Treaty of Rome, and it is bound by Article 236. That means unanimity,' one diplomat said. 'There is no way round it. We need to work out something which will allow the Danes to go back to their parliament, and if need be, to the Danish people. 'We cannot play around with the text of Maastricht. If we do that, we open up a Pandora's box. If we don't, we still have to try to accommodate Denmark, which seems impossible without a thorough re-examination of the text. It is Catch 22.' Germany's ratification process is bogged down in negotiations between the central government and the 16 federal states, which are demanding an equal say on any further transfer of sovereignty to the EC. Denmark called for an extraordinary meeting of EC foreign ministers to consider the consequences of the Danish rejection. Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, will fly to Lisbon today to explain Denmark's position to the Portuguese government. Mr Schluter said that, in spite of the vote against Maastricht, an overwhelming majority of the people wanted to continue EC membership. In addition to today's emergency session of EC foreign ministers, it is also possible that the Lisbon summit, scheduled for June 26-27, will be held earlier. The overriding challenge for EC leaders is to seek a legal framework which can both keep Denmark in the Community and save the Maastricht treaty. One extraordinary option being mooted is for the Twelve formally to renounce the Treaty of Rome, whose substance Denmark's 11 partners would convert into a new treaty amended by Maastricht. This would leave Denmark sharing most of this new European union constitution with the others, but leave it - strictly speaking - as the only remaining member of the EC.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [R.T., B.S., I.A. report: "Two Leaderships, Two Parties"] </F>   [Text] Tetovo, Feb [dateline as published] -- The second  early congress of the Party of Democratic Prosperity [PDP] was  held in the hall of the Tetovo House of Culture. There were  arguments and disagreements at the start of the meeting over the  status of the congress delegates. One side demanded that only  those elected by branches and subbranches during the recent  elections should be delegates. The other side demanded that all  those falling under the definition of Article 37 of the PDP  Statute could be delegates. According to this article, delegates  elected by the branches and subbranches, members of the PDP  Presidium, members of the PDP Central Assembly, members of the  PDP Supvervisory Council, and deputies and ministers  representing the PDP in the parliament and Macedonian Government  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] can be  congress delegates with full voting rights. After the congress  participants voted for a working presidium and also to override  the PDP Statute, thus denying votes to deputies, the members of  the government and a section of the delegates demonstratively  left the meeting. The delegation of the Kosovo Democratic  alliance, consisting of Dr. Ali Aliu, Dr. Rexhep Gjergji, and  Edita Tahiri, also left the meeting. The congress continued its  proceedings with those remaining in the hall, which, according  to the new rules, were only delegates elected by branches and  subbranches and the chairmen of branches in Macedonia and in the  diaspora, but who formed a quorum.  <H5>  The Party's Degeneration </H5>   After the congress's working groups and commissions were  elected, the greetings telegram to the congress from Kosova  Prime Minister Bujar Bukoshi was read out. Dritan Shehu,  general secretary of the Albanian Democratic Party, greeted the  congress, calling it very important for the Albanians in  Macedonia and a contribution to realizing human rights on the  basis of the Helsinki Charter and the documents of the CSCE and  to maintaining peace and stability in Macedonia, the Balkans,  and the world. Dritan Shehu said in his speech, among other  things, that a free vote is one that decides who is elected and  where. Aleksander Xinho greeted the congress for the Albanian  Republican Party, and said that it is important for the party to  emerge strengthened from this congress and that he felt himself  obliged to help the congress to proceed smoothly.    Muhamet Bicaj, Kosova education minister, said that the only  people to emerge disappointed from this congress will be those  who want the PDP's destruction. There are no Albanians who want  this party weaker. On the contrary, they want it to be  strengthened. The Albanians must cultivate pluralism and broad  hearts, because narrowmindedness is a damaging handicap. Milaim  Fejziu, chairman of the Council for the Defense of Human Rights  and Freedoms; Erdogan Sarac, chairman of the Turkish Democratic  Party, the cardiologist Jusuf Rexhepi, and the actor Xhevat  Limani also greeted the congress.    Menduh Thaci, chairman of the PDP's Tetovo branch, presented  the report on the party's work between the two congresses, and  said among other things that the PDP was formed as part of a  campaign of many years' resistance to inequality, assimilation,  and repression, and as part of the successful efforts of  patriots to raise the national and political awareness of the  Albanians of these parts. By confronting the challenge of the  rites of passage of the political system, despite all the  visible and invisible traps, the PDP has passed the first test  of democracy. I congratulate it on its success in the  multiparty elections, in which it won 22 parliamentary seats in  the Macedonian parliament, creating the opportunity for  institutionalized political activity on the basis of its  program. It is possible for a political party to reduce the  scope of its interests to a ridiculous and absurd minimum,  because of dogmatism, organization, ignorance, nepotism,  careerism, personal or group interests, or mistaken judgments  and alliances. The work of a political party is assessed by  results, in other words by the maximilization of the interests  of the people, social stratum, or nation that it represents.  One might ask whether the PDP has done this. If we analyze the  internal situation, the Albanians today cannot influence  organizational matters of the state structure and their own  position in the system. The communes exercise ceremonial  functions, while the albanians have the status of a minority  under the Constitutions. Their position in the parliament cannot  be considered to be independent, because they are an appendix to  another political party, with which they entered a coalition  without a platform, something which is considered a strategic  mistake.    In Macedonian foreign policy, the Albanians do not even  figure as a factor requiring consultation. The Albanian  language media are a mixture of official reports, kitsch, and  disinformation. The situation is similar in other fields of  life: in the economy, security, culture, sport, entertainment,  etc. The degeneration of a project, a movement, or a party  begins when general interests are seen as personal or group  interests. There are many who assert that the PDP has fallen  victim to such a decline.    The PDP has called an early congress to demonstrate the  moral  and political strength of the PDP and the Albanians for speedy  regeneration. We hope this will be a congress of fast renewal,  Menduh Thaci said in conclusion.    A debate lasting many hours then followed, offering  different  comments and proposals about the PDP's future policy. The  congress elected a 55-member Central Assembly, and this Central  Assembly, in a closed session, elected a 14-member presidium  from among its ranks. Arber Xhaferi was elected PDP chairman,  Nexhibe Delloshi, Menduh Thaci, and Shazim Mehmeti were elected  deputy chairmen, and Sefedin Duka was elected secretary. The  Assembly elected a nine- member Supervisory Council.    The congress ended its proceedings after midnight, at 0220.  <H5>  The Other Congress </H5>   The members of the congress who demanded respect for the  statute as the PDP's basic document, after leaving the hall  where the congress was being held, organized their own early PDP  congress in the hall of the Tetovo Communal Assembly. After  verifying the status of participants and electing a presidium  and working groups, Ilir Luma, member of the Central Assembly,  presented the report on the work of the PDP between the two  congresses. Among other things, the report stressed the  successes achieved by the party in the period under review and  the realization of the Albanians' demands for sovereignty and  equality. The report emphasized the successes in the  parliamentary elections, in building the coalition government,  in cooperation with other Albanian parties in the former  Yugoslavia, in building a common strategy for action, and in  affirming the Albanian cause in the international arena. The  report also stressed the weaknesses that have harmed the party  and led to a loss of influence among the people. These involved  shortcomings of organization and coordination, and failures to  harmonize standpoints between the party and the parliamentary  group, to always present a united front on the international  scene, and to respect agreements, program documents, etc. For  this reason, it became necessary to hold this early congress, so  that we my achieve our programmed goals with new people who  enjoy the trust of the membership.    On the basis of a vote, the congress confirmed the mandates  of the PDP Central Assembly, 37 of whose 55 members were  present. The congress elected eleven members of a 15-member  presidium (two seats were left for Gostivar, one for Kumanovo,  and one for Struga, which will send delegates later). The  Central Assembly elected Dr. Xheladin Murati, deputy chairman of  the Macedonian parliament, as PDP chairman, and Naser Zymberi as  secretary, while two deputy chairmen are to be elected later.    The congress ended its proceedings at 2300. This congress  did not approve a new program and statute, because those used  hitherto remain in force.    Despite all the hopes and wishes that the PDP's crisis would  be overcome and that this party would remain united as the main  force defending the sovereignty, identity, and political will of  the Albanians in Macedonia, this did not happen, and the PDP  Second Congress will go down in history as a congress of  division. The PDP split definitively into two currents, into  two large sections, and a bitter struggle between the two is  expected over which will represent the continuity and inherit  the legality and legitimacy of the PDP. It is certain that this  will weaken the political strength of the Albanians as a people  in Macedonia, that the Albanians will not be able to produce  joint candidates in the local and Macedonian parties will  exploit this disarray.</p>

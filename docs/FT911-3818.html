			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Recession and war cut into profits at Capital Cities/ABC THE IMPACT of recession on advertising demand and the cost of covering the Gulf war has cut into the profitability of Capital Cities/ABC, one of the three biggest US television networks. It yesterday unveiled a 38 per cent slump in first-quarter operating income to Dollars 120.2m and warned of a possible further decline in second-quarter earnings. The company owns the ABC radio and television national networks, local television and radio stations and weekly newspapers, including the Fairchild fashion trade publications. It said first-quarter net income plunged about 45 per cent to Dollars 58.6m or Dollars 3.50 a share from Dollars 106.3m or Dollars 6.08 a year earlier on revenues which were essentially unchanged at Dollars 1.26bn. Operating income in the first three months of 1991 was Dollars 130.3m, against Dollars 211.5m a year ago, while income before taxes dropped 44 per cent to Dollars 103.4m from Dollars 186.2m. Capital Cities/ABC's weak first-quarter performance comes on the heels of poor results from CBS and General Electric's NBC broadcasting business, which were also hurt by higher news costs and the very weak advertising market. Capital Cities/ABC said yesterday there had been a return to more normal business patterns since the end of the Gulf war. However, the company said levels of advertising demand might not be sufficient to prevent earnings from declining in the second quarter of this year. Capital Cities/ABC said the operating profits from its television network in the first quarter of 1991 represented a significant decline from the previous year's results. In the three months ended March 31, revenues from the company's broadcasting operating advanced to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 992.5m, thanks to gains from the telecast of the Super Bowl and two National Football League (NFL) Wild Card playoff games. Capital Cities/ABC's publishing operations brought in revenues of Dollars 250.6m in the latest quarter, down about 7 per cent from the previous year. Operating income from publishing dropped 24 per cent to Dollars 18.4m from Dollars 24.3m, with declines in all operating groups.</p>

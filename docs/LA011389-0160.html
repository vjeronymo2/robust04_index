			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL DATE SET FOR TELEDYNE IN FRAUD SCANDAL  </P> <P> A federal judge today set March 27 for the trial of Southern California defense  contractor Teledyne and six individuals after they pleaded innocent to bribery  and conspiracy charges in the Pentagon fraud scandal.  </P> <P> After the hearing, one defendant tried to dodge reporters by putting on a false  beard and baseball cap.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Richard Williams denied a motion by Teledyne Industries, a  division of Teledyne Inc., and the six individuals to delay the trial to give  them more time to examine 250 hours of government wiretaps.  </P> <P> Also pleading innocent in connection with the alleged sale of military contract  data were Navy procurement official Stuart Berlin, business consultants William  Parkin and Fred Lackner and Teledyne officials George Kaub, Eugene Sullivan and  Dale Schnittjer.  </P> <P> The judge released each of the defendants on $10,000 bond.  </P> <P> The March trial would be the first in a major two-year investigation of defense  procurement which federal officials have said could involve up to 50 defense  consultants, 20 Pentagon employees and more than a dozen major contractors.  </P> <P> After the hearing, Parkin donned a fake beard and a baseball cap and rushed  away.  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Cezanne still life animates market THE Dollars 28.6m (Pounds 18.6m) paid for a Paul Cezanne still life of apples at Sotheby's in New York on Tuesday night suggests confidence has returned at the highest levels of the art market, writes Antony Thorncroft. It was the first time in three years that any work of art had topped the Dollars 20m mark at auction. Prices are still well below the peaks of May 1990, when a Van Gogh portrait sold for Dollars 82.5m, but the sale proved that even in a nervous market good pictures can do well. Painted around 1890, Cezanne's 'Nature morte: les grosses pommes' has a celebrated history. It was included in the landmark sale of the Jakob Goldsmidt collection in 1958 when it sold for Dollars 252,000 to the Embiricos shipping family: it was the success of this auction that established salerooms as the leading traders in art works. The price paid on Tuesday was a record for Cezanne and far in excess of Sotheby's cautious Dollars 15m estimate. The buyer remains anonymous, but possibly a big collector has entered the field. In all, the 56 works of impressionist art on offer fetched Dollars 75.9m, with 12 per cent unsold by value. The other important lot on offer, 'Fatma, La Mulatresse', which is a large portrait of a young girl painted by Henri Matisse in 1912, also did well in selling for Dollars 14.3m. It is not such a 'chocolate box' painting as the Matisse which set a record Dollars 14.5m for the artist last November, but obviously it appealed to a connoisseur. Twenty of the 56 lots in the auction failed to sell, suggesting that serious  -and rich - collectors are prepared to bid for masterworks but that the secondary market, below Dollars 1m, is still weak. A dazzling Renoir - 'Femme dans un jardin' - almost doubled its estimate at Dollars 6.7m and one of Braque's eight views of his studio, painted in the early 1950s, went to a European dealer for a modest Dollars 3.85m. A Monet - 'La Debacle' - depicting the Seine in winter, also sold at the bottom of its estimate for Dollars 2.2m.</p>

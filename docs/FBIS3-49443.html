The first plane to land, an American C-130, touched down at  0645 GMT, an official for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,  Kris Janowski, said.    He said 21 flights were expected during the day.    Usually between 25 and 27 planes daily bring in food,  medicine and cold weather supplies, according to Captain Joel  Fouquet, who is in charge of the 250 UN troops controlling the  airport.    The UN Protection Force would like to up that to 40 a day,  but "the Serbs are opposed to it," Fouquet told a press  conference.    Nearly 90,000 tonnes of supplies have been unloaded from  more  than 8,000 flights into Sarajevo since the airlift started, he  said.</p>

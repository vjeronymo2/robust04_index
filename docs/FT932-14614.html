			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Markets: Steering a safe course offshore - Serious Money THE WORLD of the offshore fund is one which many UK investors choose not to explore. Certainly many funds are best suited to expatriates. But while the offshore market will not suit every domestic investor, it does have its peculiar attractions. It is a mistake to think that by investing offshore, you are escaping the UK tax system. Resident UK citizens are liable to pay tax on all their worldwide income. But offshore funds can pay income gross and this has a number of potential advantages. The first is that a non-taxpayer can receive a full income without the hassle of claiming back tax from the Inland Revenue. Of course, for cash investors, this facility is now available onshore from banks and building societies. But onshore bond funds cannot pay gross income. Given that long term interest rates are now above short term returns, income-seeking non-taxpayers may well be attracted to offshore bond funds, which can. These funds frequently invest in Eurobonds, which pay interest gross. The second potential advantage is that of cashflow. An investor who receives gross will have to declare income at the end of the tax year and may not have to pay tax for several months. A so-called 'roll-up' fund allows the investor to postpone this tax payment for even longer. These are deposit-based funds which accumulate interest; tax is not paid until the income is repatriated. So the income compounds at a gross, rather than a net, rate; and investors could wait to repatriate their income until they fall into a lower tax band. This could benefit those about to retire. But Graham Barker of Fidelity points out there are many other potential uses. A non-working spouse could earn exactly as much as their personal allowance; or children could accumulate income until they reach adulthood, and become entitled to their own personal allowance. There is no tax reason for a UK investor to invest in an offshore equity funds, and in the case of UK equities, it can prove a disadvantage. It is a golden investment rule that one should not invest purely for tax reasons: and two other factors are important, security and performance. The term 'offshore' may conjure up the image of the scandals created by Barlow Clowes, or for those with longer memories, Bernie Cornfeld. But it would be wrong to assume that 'offshore' is the equivalent of 'shady'. There is an increasing tendency for funds which want to attract international investors to move offshore, often to Luxembourg or Dublin. One reason is that UK tax laws do not allow onshore unit trusts to pay income gross. International investors do not want to receive income net of UK tax which must later be reclaimed. As a consequence, many offshore funds are run by the same perfectly respectable names, such as Fidelity and GT, that sell unit trusts in the UK. One of the consequences of European integration is the creation of UCITS (Undertaking on Collective Investments in Transferable Securities) - funds authorised in one state which can be sold across the European Community. Many such funds appear in the back of the Financial Times under the heading Managed Funds. If a fund appears under the heading 'SIB-recognised' that means the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's leading financial services regulator, has accepted that regulation in that centre is of an equivalent standard to that in the UK. Examples include Bermuda and Guernsey. The funds also have to satisfy the SIB that they are run in a proper manner. If a fund comes under the 'regulated' heading, that can mean one of two things. The centre may have its own system of regulation, but SIB does not consider it equivalent to UK standard; or the fund managers have not gone through the rigmarole of getting UK approval (perhaps because they are not interested in the UK market). Such funds cannot be promoted in the UK. The upshot is that if the fund is run by a well-known name, and is SIB-recognised, the investor has no cause to worry. As for performance, there is no intrinsic reason why a fund should be better run offshore than onshore. Our sister publication Money Management lists rankings for these funds every month. It is important to note that some funds have a bid-offer spread (as in the UK); others have a single price, but add on an initial charge. As a result, funds are ranked on a offer-to-offer basis, and thus the performance shown is slightly better than the investor has actually achieved. Offshore funds can offer a slightly wider range of investments. Martin Harrison of GT points out that onshore trusts are prevented from investing more than 10 per cent in 'emerging markets', not recognised by SIB. An offshore fund does not have this restriction. And many of the offshore currency funds represent a cost-effective way of getting exposure to a foreign currency. But this is definitely a field where care and professional advice is needed. There are plenty of funds to choose from. As of April 1, Finstat listed some 1,762 funds under the offshore heading.</p>

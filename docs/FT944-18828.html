			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Eerie parallels as Dow moves into October - Frank McGurty is struck by similarities with 1987 With the seventh anniversary of Black Monday less a month away, at least one influential Wall Street pundit is struck by the similarities between the autumn investment environments of 1987 and 1994. Throughout the late summer, when the bull market appeared to have regained its vigour, Mr David Shulman was steadfast in his prediction that stocks would complete a 10 to 12 per cent correction which began in February. The Salomon Brothers analyst now is more convinced than ever, with the spectre of higher interest rates pulling share prices off their September highs. The parallels he draws are eerie. The economy is strong; the dollar weak. After a springtime plunge, the Treasury market slumped anew last month. With bond yields climbing, dividend yields are still well below their historical levels. Meanwhile, mergers and acquisitions are propping up share prices in a range of sectors. These forces are as evident this autumn as they were leading up to October 19, 1987, that fateful Monday when panic selling scythed 508 points, or 22.6 per cent, off the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Mr Shulman observes that seven years ago 'there was insufficient capital simultaneously to fund a global bull market and an economic expansion. The tension was resolved by a capitulation in the financial markets.' Any capitulation this year is likely to be much less devastating, the New York analyst concedes. 'A somewhat less-extended market should help temper the potential downside risk.' Still, he predicts that the bellwether blue chip index will revisit the 3,500 level before it again sees the likes of its September 15 close at 3,953. Not every analyst on Wall Street shares this view. Ms Gail Dudack at SG Warburg is standing by her rosy prediction that the Dow will hit 4,200 by the year-end. But even Ms Dudack, whose optimism runs deeper than most of her colleagues, admits to feeling cautious as the fourth quarter gets under way. Interest rates are the key, most observers agree. 'Should the erosion of bond prices continue, yields (on the benchmark 30-year government issue) will soon approach the 8 per cent level, a big hurdle for equities since asset allocation models will begin to favour bonds over stocks,' Ms Dudack writes in a recent Warburg briefing. In essence, the appeal of equity investments has waned in comparison with the competition since January 31, when the Dow peaked at 3,978. The reason is the steady rise in rates. Individual investors, who have put the zip into the market since early 1991, began to react to this gradual shift last month, taking refuge again in the relative safety of money-market funds. They were turning tail just as the first tangible evidence of a cyclical upturn in inflation surfaced in the economy. Two weeks ago, it was revealed that prices at the producer level had jumped by 0.6 per cent in August, the biggest jump since 1990. Meanwhile, American factories and mines were working closer to full capacity than any time in past five years. As surplus materials and labour grow scarer, economists fear prices for both could escalate quickly. Fidelity Investments, the country's largest mutual fund group, said its stock sales were halved last month, while its money-market business was three times greater than in August. Why did the little guy start to shy away from equities? 'The year-long rise in interest rates, both long and short-term, has changed the valuation backdrop substantially,' explains Mr William Dodge, chief strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds. The spread between bond yields - which determine the return on money market funds - and the expected return on stocks has simply grown too wide, he argues. Bond yields have surged over the past nine months, while stock values have stalled, at best. The average retiree can no longer bank on a steady rise in share prices to offset dividend yields which remain stubbornly below 3 per cent. In all likelihood, the gulf will get worse before it gets better, making stocks even less attractive. Bond yields are driven by monetary policy, and by all accounts the Federal Reserve is poised to tighten credit conditions as soon as its chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, sees a few more signs that the economy is growing at an unmanageable pace. That was the message which Wall Street gleaned last Tuesday from the elliptical statement which was issued after the Fed's policy-making arm adjourned its regular meeting without sanctioning an immediate rate hike. Most analysts had expected the central bank to hold its fire, perhaps until after the November congressional elections. Still, in the fortnight before the meeting, the Dow industrial index back pedalled about 100 points on the growing sense that rates would have to go a lot higher more before they could come down again. 'The only way out is for the economy to slow,' says Mr Dodge. October is traditionally a volatile month on Wall Street, as investors react to the torrent of third-quarter results released by US companies. This year, the ride is likely to be even bumpier than usual.</p>

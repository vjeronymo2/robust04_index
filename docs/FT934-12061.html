			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Tory auditor may be in breach of professional guidelines THE AUDITOR of the company which controls most of the Conservative party's assets is also a shareholder in that company, in possible breach of the accountancy industry's professional guidelines. Official records show that Mr Lewis Fialko, a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, owns two shares in Bourne Association, the company which holds the leasehold on 22 Smith Square, the Conservative party's headquarters in London. Accounts filed at Companies House show that Mr Fialko's firm, Fialko, Burns &amp; Co, based in Cricklewood, north-west London, is auditor to Bourne Association. Bourne was shown as a 'quasi-subsidiary' of the Conservative party for the first time in its 1993 accounts. The guide to professional ethics used by the institute warns that 'a member's objectivity may be threatened or appear to be threatened where he or she holds a beneficial interest in the shares . . . in a company on which the practice reports'. The revelation follows recent criticism of the Conservative party for failing to disclose political donations. Mr Fialko said yesterday that he did not hold a beneficial interest in the company because he was not entitled to receive any dividends and held just two shares. He said that he had been connected with the 'tax and financial affairs' of the Conservative party since 1938 and became auditor and received his shares in 1964. The institute will not comment on individual cases. Speaking in general terms, Mr Julian Osborne, secretary to its professional ethics committee, said: 'The holding of shares (in a client company) is a severe area of risk.' The Conservative party said last night that it did not believe there was any conflict of interest because Bourne was 'a slightly unusual company', Mr Fialko was not entitled to dividends, and he had been auditor to the company for many years.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]According to a study of atomic energy related  industries for 1992 compiled by the Japan Atomic Industrial  Forum, atomic energy related sales in mining and manufacturing  have reached the two trillion yen mark for the first time. Since  first topping the one trillion yen mark in 1981, sales have  doubled in just eleven years. Among expenditures in the electric  power industry, the increase in repair costs was especially high  because Kansai Electric Power began replacement of its steam  generators.    The study covered 520 companies in atomic energy related  industries and is based on the data they supplied. Atomic energy  related sales in the mining industry totaled  &yen;2,241,000,000,000, an increase of 22% over 1991. The  increase in reactor equipment was 24% over 1991, and fuel  cycle  related sales also increased 11%, reflecting a rise in  sales  overall.    Among the 326 companies responding, 40 had sales greater  than  ten billion yen, and the top 50 companies occupied 83% of  total  sales. When we break down domestic power generation by BWRs and  PWRs, each format has about the same number of operating power  plants, but when we look at plants under construction and in the  planning stages, BWRs outnumber PWRs five to one for an  overwhelming advantage.    Atomic energy related expenditures by the electric power  industry came to &yen;1,834,190,000,000 for an increase of  0.5%  over 1991. This breaks down to 41.2% for operating and  maintenance costs, 39.1% for construction, 15% for  fuel, 3.6%  for setup costs and 1.1% for miscellaneous expenses.  Operating  and maintenance costs came to &yen;755,300,000,000, a new high.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-008LC-42A>           Key: 1. Breakdown of Atomic Energy Related Sales; 2. </FIG>       If we let the expenditures by the electric power industry  for  1992 equal 100, the expenditures for 1993-1997 are expected to  range from 86 to 92. Construction costs of more than seven  hundred billion yen in 1992 are expected to drop to the three  hundred billion yen range by 1997. However, Electric Power  Development Coordination Council plans call for eleven new NPPs  in the next two years with an output of about 12,000,000 kW, and  we can expect mid- and long-range construction costs to make a  comeback.</p>

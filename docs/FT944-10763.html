			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / M&amp;S sees sales in Europe rise 20%: UK retailer plans continental expansion as pre-tax profits rise 15% to Pounds 354m Marks and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer, has lifted continental European sales by 20 per cent since exporting its Outstanding Value Campaign from the UK. The campaign, run in the UK for the past couple of years, passes on to customers cost savings made through improvements in efficiency and information technology without damaging operating margins. It is operated jointly with suppliers, who benefit from higher production runs. Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman, yesterday stressed that it was a long-term project to improve and sharpen the products on sale. Sales in Europe rose from Pounds 134.5m to Pounds 152.3m in the six months to October 1, the group said yesterday. Operating profits were down from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 5m after charging Pounds 3.8m for the opening of new stores. Sir Richard said Europe had been through 'a very, very tough period, with the consumer in the trenches. But if we can keep sales going at 20 per cent, it will come through strongly in the second half.' Total group pre-tax profits were 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 354.2m on the back of a 6.9 per cent sales rise to Pounds 3.07bn. M&amp;S is accelerating its expansion plans, and is lifting capital expenditure to a record Pounds 400m this year. While most of this will be spent in the UK, Sir Richard says there are few high streets and out-of-town sites where the group has no store. In contrast, there are only 25 stores on continental Europe. M&amp;S has already identified a further 45 to 50 sites across France, Holland and Spain, but Sir Richard stressed that the group would proceed with caution. It had taken four years to find and negotiate an appropriate site before opening the Valencia store last year. 'Our continued expansion is geared to the right sites and the speed at which we can get them,' said Sir Richard. 'It's a marathon, not a sprint.' The group is also looking at Japan and China following the success of its Hong Kong operations, which are yielding better returns than anywhere else. Operating profits in the Far East rose from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 8m in the half, while sales were up from Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 32.1m. Sir Richard said a decision on whether to go ahead with its first store in Japan would be taken within the next 12 months. Lex, Page 24; Details, Page 28</p>

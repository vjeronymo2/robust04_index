The program was initiated by City Controller Rick Tuttle, who  acknowledged he borrowed the idea from "America's Most Wanted," the weekly Fox  Television series.  </P> <P> Police Lt. Barbara Guarino said the city program has generated several leads  from employees and other members of the public.  </P> <P> The first arrest stemming from the program occurred recently when authorities  located Abdulmalik Abdullahi Kurtu, a former parking lot attendant at Los  Angeles International Airport who was wanted for embezzling receipts.  </P></p>

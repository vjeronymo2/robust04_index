			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Partco reveals three year expansion plan Mr Peter Redfern, managing director of Partco, said yesterday he wanted the group to double in size within the next two to three years, both by acquisition and organic growth. His statement came as the independent distributor of automotive parts and equipment reported a 46 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 2.93m for the six months to June 30. The advance prompted a 13p climb in the share price to 246p. Turnover at Partco, which raised Pounds 20.7m at its flotation in March, rose 3.2 per cent to Pounds 65.6m (Pounds 63.5m), about 1 per cent of the total UK market, according to Mr Redfern. He added that inflation had a minimal effect in its market place. Mr Chris Scott, finance director, said that sales had only risen 7 per cent in three years, but that the operating margin rose 17.1 points to 4.8 per cent. The group ascribed this to improved productivity and cost control. Partco completes tomorrow the Pounds 2.41m acquisition of the 32-branch Woodhead RSR, which broadens the group's scope beyond cars and light commercial vehicles into trucks and buses. Mr Scott thought Woodhead, which along with Partco's greenfield expansion increases the number of branches to 244, should be earnings enhancing in 1995. In the year to March 1994, Woodhead had operating profits of Pounds 629,000 on turnover of Pounds 19.5m. He added that there were still a further 200 locations into which the group could expand. The group has Pounds 5.1m cash in hand. After a tax charge which Mr Scott expects to remain at 20 per cent for two more years, earnings grew 33 per cent to 8.4p (6.3p) per share. A maiden interim dividend of 2p is declared.</p>

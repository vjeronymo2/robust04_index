			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: King &amp; Shaxson declines 17% to Pounds 2.6m An initial Pounds 2.46m from Greig Middleton Holdings, the recently-acquired stockbroking firm, contributed the bulk of pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.6m at King &amp; Shaxson Holdings for the year ended April 30. The result, however, was 17 per cent lower than the previous year's restated Pounds 3.15m. After-tax profits of the financial services group slipped 10 per cent to Pounds 1.7m, and earnings per share came to 9.8p (11p). A recommended final dividend of 5p makes an unchanged total of 9p. Mr David Pearce, chairman, said the discount house had an unsatisfactory year with operating losses of Pounds 113,000 against an 'exceptional' profit of Pounds 2.59m. Profits from money broking dropped from Pounds 971,000 to Pounds 781,000 while there was a Pounds 152,000 loss from futures management.</p>

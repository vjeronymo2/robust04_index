			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / MP protests over lottery reports Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, is to lodge a formal complaint with the Press Complaints Commission after three Sunday newspapers yesterday identified the previous weekend's Pounds 17.8m National Lottery winner. The winner's name was published in the News of the World, the Yorkshire on Sunday and Birmingham's Sunday Mercury. Mr Straw is the MP for Blackburn where the winner lived. He was one of several politicians who suggested that unless the commission acted it would hasten the arrival of privacy laws.</p>

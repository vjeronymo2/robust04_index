			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hamburg -- In connection with the debate on  banning the right-wing extremist Republikaner, Hesse's  Minister-President Hans Eichel (Social Democratic Party) has  accused Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian  Democratic Union) of "making the Republikaner acceptable."  Unless Kanther lists the Republikaner as right-wing extremist  party in the next Office for the Protection of the Constitution  report, he will work directly into the hands of the enemies of  democracy, Eichel said in Wiesbaden on Friday [8 April]. In  Eichel's view, there is sufficient evidence of Republikaner  members participating in violent acts against foreigners.  [passage omitted]</p>

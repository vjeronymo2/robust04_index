			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / People: Iveson quits dairy sector to head Teesside Tec Alan Iveson, managing director of the Milk Marketing Board until its abolition on November 1, has become chief executive of Teesside Training and Enterprise Council. Iveson, 43, spent 21 years with the MMB; as md of the 61-year-old business was responsible for a Pounds 2bn annual turnover. He says he could have remained within the dairy sector but decided to opt for a change by moving to the Tec. 'It's an opportunity to make a direct contribution to the improvement of the local community,' he says. He has come into Teesside Tec as it gears up for a new challenge, thanks to Samsung, the Korean industrial group which last month announced its choice of Teesside for a Pounds 450m electronics complex. Middlesbrough-based Teesside Tec, which is providing Pounds 5m towards the project, is to set up a special training centre for Samsung. 'Teesside must be doing something right if it can get a big player like that,' says Iveson, who sees scope for promoting a greater team approach between the area's employers, local authorities, educational establishments and economic regeneration bodies. He believes his MMB experience of negotiating with UK government departments and the European Community, representing the UK dairy industry, will be of use in his new role. 'I understand how we might get these relationships working for Teesside,' he says. Originally from Derbyshire but based in Surrey for the MMB, Iveson welcomes the chance to move back to the north of England. Ironically, his predecessor as the Tec chief executive, John Howell, has gone in the reverse direction: originally from south London, last month he became chief executive of Solotec, covering Bexley, Bromley, Croydon and Sutton.</p>

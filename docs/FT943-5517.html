New house prices, in contrast to overall figures, rose by 2.2 per cent last month compared with July and by 2.6 per cent in the previous 12 months.

The general weakness in the housing market was also reflected in lower than expected levels of mortgage lending and numbers of house purchases. Nationwide, the country's second-largest building society, reported on Thursday that prices rose 0.6 per cent last month compared with July, taking the year-on-year increase to 2.6 per cent, only slightly ahead of general inflation.

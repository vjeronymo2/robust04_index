			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] AL-DUSTUR has learned from official sources that  competent agencies have made efforts regarding the excavations  Israel is making in search of antiquities in the border areas,  which encroach on the antiquities of the Jordanian territories.    The sources said Jordanian efforts in this regard came about  following Western news reports of Israeli excavations searching  for antiquities in the Qumran area north of the Dead Sea. The  Qumran area is believed to be the home of important historical  scrolls that date back to the first century A.D.    The sources indicated the Qumran area is Jordanian territory  that Israel occupied in the aftermath of the 1967 war. The  Israeli occupation of this territory is believed to be listed on  the agenda of the Jordanian-Israeli peace negotiations, in order  to ensure its return to Jordanian sovereignty.</p>

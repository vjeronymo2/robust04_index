			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARADE LEADS OLD MAGNOLIA TO NEW HOME  </P> <P> In one of the more unlikely parades ever seen in these parts, a tree was moved  in San Bernardino on Saturday.  </P> <P> Led by a junior high school marching band, two huge cranes, a bulldozer and a  police escort, a 6-story-tall, 100-year-old southern magnolia tree was  transported 1 1/2 miles along downtown streets from a lot cleared for  development to a new home in Seccombe Lake Park.  </P> <P> "It looks like King Kong coming down the street," said Woody Wood, a volunteer  who helped guide the vehicles on their 1-m.p.h. journey along a route  calculated to avoid power lines and building overhangs.  </P> <P> Although heavily publicized, this particular parade came as a shock to many in  town.  </P> <P> "I was working on my day off and my son came in yelling, 'Dad, there's a parade  outside and this big tree!' " said Dennis McGrath, 37, an account executive. "I  said, 'On April 22? ' "  </P> <P> Once outside, McGrath could scarcely believe his eyes.  </P> <P> "What is this? Where'd this tree come from? Who's paying for this?" he asked  incredulously as the spectacle lumbered past City Hall. "I guess San Bernardino  has finally made the big time."  </P> <P> McGrath was one of more than 1,000 residents, elected officials and volunteers  who witnessed the relocation of the 130-ton tree that for some has come to  symbolize the cultural heritage of this rapidly changing community where few  things more than 100 years old remain. But for others, including a mayoral  hopeful, the whole thing was a big waste of money.  </P> <P> "This magnificent tree has survived earthquakes, a severe flood, years of  scorching summers and the smoke of a (nearby) foundry," said state Sen. Ruben  Ayala (D-Chino), who helped organize the $25,000 project that was largely  funded through donations ranging from the nickels and dimes of schoolchildren  to a $10,000 grant from the Mervyn's department store chain. "Way back, it even  shaded a Wells Fargo stage coach station."  </P> <P> City officials plan to submit the effort to the Guinness Book of World Records  as the heaviest tree ever moved. "Originally, the U.S. Air Force agreed to lend  us a missile carrier to transport it, but the missile carrier could not handle  a 130-ton load," said Sam Catalano, president of a group called the More  Attractive Community Foundation. "So we went to the U.S. Marine Corps to borrow  a tank carrier but they said the biggest tanks are only 20 to 80 tons."  </P> <P> What they settled on was a specially outfitted flatbed trailer rig with 128  wheels and two cranes, one of which was a 250-ton monster brought in from Long  Beach by the Bragg Crane Service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Garage-Sized Planter  </P> <P> In preparation for the move, the tree was pruned and skirted with a planter box  the size of a two-car garage and built with $12,000 worth of lumber donated by  the John C. Morgan Production Framing Co. of San Bernardino.  </P> <P> The event culminated a year-long struggle to spare the tree from the chain saws  of developer Ken Bussey, who is building an industrial park. In a telephone  interview, Bussey said although he is not personally attached to the tree, he  agreed to delay demolition a year ago this week until others could find a way  of saving it.  </P> <P> Bussey said it is one of the ugliest trees he has ever seen.  </P> <P> For Dennis Mansfield, co-owner of Hydro-Gro Hydro-Seeding of San Bernardino,  however, saving the tree became an obsession.  </P> <P> "A year ago, my partner (Woody Wood) and I made a personal crusade out of  calling people and knocking on doors asking for funds to save it," Mansfield  said. "Suddenly, we had arborists calling us wanting to help."  </P> <P> One of these experts was Todd Head, who along with a tree pathologist, examined  the old magnolia a year ago and determined it was healthy and fit to move.  </P> <P> "It was full of foliage and had nice new feeder roots," Head said. "But the key  to the tree's health is that it sat directly on top of a water table 16 feet  below the surface."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Up to 80 Feet Tall  </P> <P> The southern magnolia, which bears the botanical name Magnolia grandiflora, is  native to the southeastern swamplands of the United States. Under ideal  conditions, the tree, which is characterized by its broad green leaves and  fragrant flowers up to nine inches in diameter, grows 25 to 80 feet tall.  </P> <P> At 9:15 a.m., the two cranes shuddered and creaked as they lifted the tree with  3-inch-thick cables attached to steel beams placed beneath the planter box.  Moments later, the tree was carefully lowered onto the flatbed rig.  </P> <P> "We have lift-off!" cried Mansfield as hundreds of others applauded, cheered  and whistled.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, political hopefuls facing primary elections worked the crowd.  </P> <P> "This symbolizes that San Bernardino, for the first time in a long time, is  interested in saving some of its history, " said San Bernardino Mayor Evlyn  Wilcox.  </P> <P> Her opponent, former mayor Bob Holcomb, strongly disagreed.  </P> <P> "There's some talk that there ought to be a society for the prevention of  cruelty to trees," Holcomb said. "This is a political extravaganza at the  taxpayers' expense."  </P></p>

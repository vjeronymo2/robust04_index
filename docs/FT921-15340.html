			<p>920110 FT  10 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): LCD heads for the big screen A LIQUID crystal display big enough for the screen of a portable television set, has been developed by Sharp Corporation in Japan. The 16.5-inch screen uses thin film transistor technology in which each of the pixels (picture elements) that make up the screen is controlled by three transistors - one for each primary colour. The latest Sharp picture has more than 1.2m pixels and can handle wide-screen television broadcasts. Sharp says the screen is also the first LCD one which can be used with personal computers for multimedia applications, combining data, video and sound. Sharp: Japan, 06 825 3007.</p>

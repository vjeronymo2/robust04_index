			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Clinton, me and a question of draft-dodging: Amid the controversy over the Democratic candidate and the Vietnam war, US Editor Jurek Martin recalls his own experiences BILL Clinton was not the only young man in Britain at the end of the 1960s contemplating the prospect of military service and, worst of all, fighting in the Vietnam war. At least one was not even an American citizen. One Saturday morning in the autumn of 1968 a letter, with a California postmark, was delivered to a south London address. It summarily instructed the recipient to report for induction into the US Army at Fort Ord at a date which, on close inspection, turned out to be three weeks before the letter actually arrived. This was distressing, because the recipient had recently been told by his employer that he was about to be posted to its Washington office. The prospect of having to withdraw from what was then, and still is, one of the best jobs in journalism, led to a miserable weekend. The Monday mail brought miraculous relief, another letter with a California postmark one day later than the first. It acknowledged a 'clerical error' and confirmed that the recipient was indeed 'an alien not currently liable for military service'. Both letters had been sent surface mail and had taken the best part of six weeks to arrive. It may only be a minor part of Mr Clinton's explanations that his draft board communicated with him in Oxford by steam packet, but personal experience confirms that this is exactly what draft boards did in those days. Indeed, the controversy surrounding the Democratic presidential candidate revives a lot of half-buried memories of the fear of any communication from them. I had gone to live, and teach, in California in 1963. Before the changes in US immigration laws in 1967, it was easy for any Briton not a card-carrying communist and without a prison record to emigrate and acquire the coveted green card. You were obliged, however, after a six-month grace period, to register with your local draft board and were liable to be called up. Before the Vietnam war escalated, it was a small risk. In any case, educational, occupational and marriage deferments were available. Even after President Lyndon Johnson cancelled many of these in 1965, prompting a deadline-beating rush from California to the 'quickie' wedding chapels in Reno, Nevada, many of whom mysteriously stopped the clock in their records, there were always pullable strings with the local draft board. I was teaching at a new private school and was technically not qualified for an occupational deferment. But the school principal, who had served 30 years in the US Marines, was an intimate of my rural draft board and if he could not fix things the school owner, a big rancher, certainly could. It was common knowledge that the only young men that draft board did send to serve  - the lottery was not introduced until 1969  - were the offspring of parents without clout, such as resident Mexican farm labourers. It became more complicated after I left the school, and thus its protection, but stayed on doing other things in California. I was reclassified 1-A, a prime candidate for the draft. I appealed against this, in writing, a process which took some months, but was unsuccessful. Continued dissembling and prevarication with the draft board was possible, but the net was obviously closing and so was the fear that the bureaucracy would make connections. A tax return or a traffic violation, for example, might serve as a tip to a draft board. Another English friend in the same boat was arrested one night and left the country as soon as he was discharged the following day. I would never claim to have been vocal against US policy in Vietnam but the thought of fighting in a war which, like most young American friends, I strongly opposed did not exactly appeal. Unlike them, I had a way out, to 'go home', and duly did in 1966, advising the draft board of my London whereabouts and having my status re-classified; and that, excepting one awful weekend over two years later, was where it has all rested. This is just one tiny personal story. Many others have long since come out of the closet, none more effectively than James Fallows's 1975 magazine article about the contrasting experiences of his class at Harvard, less than 10 per cent of whom ever served, and the fate of the less privileged children of the Boston working class, who did, in droves. The point is that there is a whole generation of Americans to whom, for good reasons and bad, avoiding a system which had become institutionally corrupt was the most important thing in their young lives. Thousands went so far as to go into exile. The lottery did not render it pure again because there were still ways round it. Bill Clinton set out his reasons for seeking to avoid it in a 1969 letter that was painfully honest in its reasoning and remarkably frank in its confession that, even then, he was only registering because he harboured political ambitions. Is this the fatal flaw which will deny him the White House? The Bush campaign cleverly contends that it is not what he did then which is at issue, though it surely is a subtext, but how he recalls it, selectively, now. A more revealing comment this week from a Republican official was the promise to 'rip the skin off the guy'. Picking holes in his explanations of the events of 23 years ago seemed this week the biggest shot left in the president's re-election armoury and, in such a personalised political environment, it may still pack firepower. If so, then Dan Quayle, Dick Cheney and Phil Gramm, three Republicans with presidential ambitions but no military service, may wonder if they, too, will one day fall victim to the Vietnam syndrome. But it stretches credulity that it will make enough of a difference. Today's war is not Vietnam but the economy. If it were the other way round, the above true story would probably never have been told. Not being George, Page 11</p>

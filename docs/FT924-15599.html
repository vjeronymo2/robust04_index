			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / As They Say in Europe: Germany hits back Die Welt captured the spirit of the week in Anglo-German relations: 'The Bundesbank cannot allow British politicians to fabricate the myth that the pound was brought to its knees by a German throw of the dice . . .the Bundesbank spent billions to support the sickly pound. It was no use because the British economy was in too bad a state. In fact, it was the English themselves who sold their money for harder currency, because they were realists, unlike their government . . .' Until the FT published the Bundesbank's disrespectful comments on UK financial strategy, things seemed to be settling down in Europe. The British had friends: close ones, too. La Presse de la Manche (or Channel-Press) serves a region where most people voted No in the referendum and the clean, fresh wind blows in from England. It wrote: 'John Major, above all, does not want to break the thread that links him to the Continent; he knows the future of his country is in Europe. That is what the French people basically voted for on September 20. Yes to Europe but not to any old Europe, and a Europe where each state will feel at home . . . preserving its culture but open to all. It may be that John Major is right and that he is a good European.' So, for a brief moment, many were ready to accept the virtues of others. Too many, according to Alberto Recarte, 'a commercial official of the state' writing in El Pais. He argued against a view that is gaining ground in Madrid. ' . . . many Spanish politicians think the Italian model is not so bad. When all is said and done, Italy has only had to devalue, leave the ERM and become an example not to be followed. If that were the sole price to pay, I would be with the 'Italianisers' - any policy is better than importing the deflation of recent years.' But he decided the Italians had got away with it for so long because they had a trade surplus, unlike Spain. The Germans may have thought they were taking other people's arguments seriously when they cancelled the official celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the V-2 rocket. The press had been opposed to the project and Sudkurier welcomed the change of heart: 'The public outcry of indignation remains. That should alarm us all. 'However, what we saw was not a new nationalism but a brutal loss of memory, and of a sense of history which is seamlessly linked to the fire attacks on refugee asylums and even to justifications for the Third Reich. That is a picture of Germany nobody can be proud of.' The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung managed to pull a number of issues together and, unwittingly, foreshadowed the deepening crisis in writing about the V-2 affair. 'The circumstances in this case strike at Anglo-German relations which, in recent months, have suffered a number of blows. 'At present nothing works, one accident after another with both sides tumbling over themselves to upset the other. Everything in German foreign policy - and no less in British - can work only on the basis of close co-operation which also includes France and America . . . The restructuring of a defensive alliance into an alliance for reconstruction has not succeeded. The restoration of Germany and the return of the Germans as one of the great nations of Europe has led to a collapse of solidarity.' IT SEEMS you need nerves of steel to run local government in Spain. The Heraldo de Aragon reported on the municipal finances of the regional capital. The city of Zaragoza borrowed SFr160m three years ago, so that debt has now risen by Pta1.2bn as a result of the devaluation. But, the paper continued: 'This debt, according to city officials, is compensated by the profits obtained in previous years which had been made by changing assets into dollars and marks at favourable moments.' It also noted that the city authorities had made this year's debt payments a mere 10 days before the peseta was devalued. James Morgan is diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

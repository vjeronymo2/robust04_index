			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Buoyant economy keeps equities afloat - Wall Street / Patrick Harverson surveys a year in which bonds slumped but shares held their own This has been the year of the stock market crash that wasn't, and the bond market crash that was. Contrary to the popular belief that US equity investors had a miserable year, 1994 was pretty good to the stock market. True, the gains in the main indices were either modest or non-existent (the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just over 2 per cent while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 1 per cent), and share prices ended the year some way below their highs. Yet, it was quite an achievement for stocks to hold their own in a year in which a Federal Reserve, determined to prevent inflation from getting out of hand, raised interest rates six times (on the last occasion, by a hefty three-quarters of a point - the biggest increase in 13 years) and in which the bond market had its worst crash in living memory. There was a good reason, however, for investor resilience in the face of rapidly rising rates. Throughout the year, the economy displayed remarkable strength. In the first three quarters, gross domestic product grew by 3.3 per cent, 4.1 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively. Analysts are expecting fourth-quarter growth of between 3 and 4 per cent. The surprisingly strong economy led to corporate earnings remaining buoyant during 1994. The 900 US companies in Business Week's corporate scoreboard reported profits growth of 15 per cent in the first quarter, 45 per cent in the second, and 45 per cent again in the third. Although analysts expect profits growth to have slowed in the fourth quarter, it will not be by much. Thus, impressive earnings and economic growth sustained the market and investor confidence at a time when equities were under attack from rising interest rates and the fall-out from the crash in bond prices. And what a crash it was. This year, 30-year Treasury bonds lost 24 per cent of their value. An equivalent decline in the stock market would have lopped 900 points off the Dow. While the bond market's woes should be put in a longer-term context - this year's slump came at the end of a decade-long bull market - it is of little consolation to those who bought bonds at the start of the year in the hope that fixed-income investments would match the stellar returns of 1993. The slump in bond prices triggered a rush among investors to get out of bond market mutual funds in 1994. Since the Fed began raising rates in February, investors have withdrawn more money from bond funds than they have put in, and in increasingly large amounts. In November (the latest month for which data is available), bond fund outflows totalled Dollars 10.9bn, the highest figure on record. But flows into stock funds held up relatively well this year, which makes sense given the performance of equities. There was not a single month in 1994 in which sales of stock funds exceeded purchases, although sales in November were the lowest since August 1991. Sales are expected to have risen in December when the market staged a late, but quite effective, year-end rally. That money continued to pour into stock funds - to the tune of about Dollars 10bn a month - was not due just to strong economic and earnings growth. Demand for equity mutual funds remained healthy in part because of changing demographic and investing trends in the US. The number of Americans in their 40s and early 50s is growing as the 'baby boomers' of the 1950s and 1960s reach middle age. And they have been investing in stock funds over the long term to provide a future income stream to pay for educating their children and making provision for their own retirements. Fund managers believe that the billions of dollars which this generation has invested in stock mutual funds in the past few years will not be dislodged easily. A 1 per cent decline in the S&amp;P 500 was certainly not going to do it. This year also saw the return of the big corporate deal: Wall Street's mergers and acquisitions specialists had not been this busy since the boom days of the 1980s. Corporate titans as diverse as Bell Atlantic, American Home Products, Eli Lilly and Viacom all completed billion-dollar takeovers which made many investment bankers - and many shareholders - very happy. Yet, perhaps the most extraordinary statistic of 1994 emerged in the last few days of the year. This week, the New York Stock Exchange announced that, for the first time in its long history, more than 1bn shares of a listed company were traded in a year. And what was the name of that company? IBM? General Motors? AT&amp;T? No, it was Telmex, also known as Telefonos de Mexico, the giant Mexican telecommunications group. If ever proof was needed of how global the financial markets have become, this surely was it.</p>

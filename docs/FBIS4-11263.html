			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Rafael Huguet, a former member of the Alpha 66  terrorist organization who is taking part in The Nation and the  Emigrants Conference in Havana, said that the argument that  violence is necessary to resolve Cuban problems has been  irreversibly defeated.    Luis Tornes, who took part in the foiled Bay of Pigs  invasion  in 1961, admitted that the use of arms against Cuba is useless  and said that Washington must realize that Cuba is not a U.S.  territory.    Attorney Magda Montiel said the conference marks the  beginning of a stage that shows Washington that there are Cubans  willing to hold a dialogue, but it cannot be only one way.    Patricia Gutierrez told the press that regardless of  differences, it is clear that the welfare of the fatherland is  the objective. Patricia is the daughter of Eloy Gutierrez  Menoyo, who was imprisoned for 22 years in Cuba for his  counterrevolutionary activities. Gutierrez Menoyo later went to  the United States.    Manolo Hidalgo, the 24-year-old son of Cuban emigres who  left  the country in 1961, said that many Cuban-Americans his age  would like to help solve the Cuban crisis, regardless of any  intimidation intended to stop them.</p>

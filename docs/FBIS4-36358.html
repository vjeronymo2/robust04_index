			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["A Standpoint" column by Salah al-Mukhtar: "The Leadership </F> and the Requirements To End the Blockade"]    [Text] The most significant element in the joint reaction  from the Iraqi people's various sectors to leader President  Saddam Husayn's assumption of the post of prime minister is that  the people are now more optimistic about the future and that the  next months will see major positive changes in favor of the  Iraqi people.    A quick review of the events of the 17-30 July revolution in  1968 will show those who want to understand the course of events  that the leader president has emerged triumphant from all his  missions, enjoying the support of the Iraqi masses, who took  more pride in their jihad and their great accomplishments and  gains.    Today, as we enter the last 10 days of the blockade, it is  no  longer secret that after the enemy, regardless of its names and  colors, gave up all hope of succeeding in his conspiratorial and  hostile plans to divide Iraq and destroy its people, resorted to  its last card in this conflict, hoping that this card will  achieve what it had failed to achieve through the comprehensive  military aggression and barbaric blockade.    U.S. awareness that it has lost the logic and the argument,  that world public opinion, including that of the American  people, has begun to understand Iraq's positions; and that the  overwhelming majority of nations have begun to prepare  appropriate plans to deal with Iraq in the near future without  the economic blockade, whether or not the United States agrees,  has made the United States feel that it is inevitably about to  lose another strategic conflict in a world that has begun to  slip away from the grip of the United States. Therefore, the  United States has begun either to use additional destructive  means or to strengthen the old ones.    We will not exaggerate if we say that the principal aim of  the United States is to increase difficulties in the life of  Iraqi society by further weakening the Iraqi economy and making  the people unable to shoulder the extraordinary inflation that  resulted from the blockade and greed. Therefore, efforts over  the past months have focused on easing the negative economic  impact of the blockade so citizens do not despair.    But these efforts have clashed with the fact that the  current  challenge for the Iraqi people is unlike any other challenge  that has threatened any people in history. For the first time,  a four-year comprehensive blockade has been clamped on a nation,  and for the first time, all intellectual, psychological,  financial, and economic energies have been used to destroy the  potential of Iraqi society. Therefore, many solutions were  ineffective, despite good intentions.    As a result, it was extremely necessary for the leader  president to assume the direct responsibilities of the prime  minister. His unique leadership capabilities, his deep and  far-sighted strategic vision, and his comprehensive experience  in dealing with conflicts and solving complicated crises  constitute a strong basis for an effective solution to problems  in the daily life of the masses.    Yes, the leader's assumption of the responsibilities of the  prime minister will guarantee for the people a solution to  years-old outstanding problems and will constitute a natural  framework for state organizations to carry out their duties in a  different way based on resisting the blockade in untraditional  ways. This is a studied Iraqi reply to the current mobilization  of hostile energies to destroy Iraq.    The battle to break the blockade in the near future is no  longer a dream or hope, but has become a reality about which the  enemy -- ahead of the friend -- is talking.    The coming months will certainly be decisive. Therefore, the  blockade-breaking battle, which is considered the most serious  and the most honorable battle of the Arab fate, along with its  great changes, plans, and sides, should be defined and  engineered by the great leader, Saddam Husayn, who dispels  darkness and despair and creates hope. Let us stand behind the  leader more firmly, deriving lessons from the Mother of Battles,  foremost of which is sticking to the symbol of Iraq's unity,  Saddam Husayn.</p>

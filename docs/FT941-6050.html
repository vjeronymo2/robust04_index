			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pizzaland Scottish growth BrightReasons, the private company which owns the Pizzaland restaurant chain, yesterday announced an expansion plan which could pave the way for a flotation. The group, which operates 160 pizza and pasta restaurants around the UK, said it was acquiring a further six outlets in Scotland and one in England for an undisclosed sum. Mr Michael Guthrie, group chairman, said the acquisition from Edinburgh-based Pizza Gallery had been funded by loans from Samuel Montagu, Bank of Scotland and Banque Indosuez. Mr Guthrie, a former chairman and chief executive of Mecca Leisure, said yesterday: 'We are now considering a float, but it's not imminent.' The group was committed to further expansion, and intended to spend up to Pounds 4m developing operations in Scotland, where it now has 22 outlets.</p>

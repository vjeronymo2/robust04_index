			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAILER PARK PROPOSAL HITS OPPOSITION;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: SANTA MONICA CITY COUNCIL SIDES WITH RESIDENTS. THEY DON'T WANT  APARTMENTS AND CONDOMINIUMS BUILT ON ONE OF THE LAST MOBILE HOME PARKS.  </P> <P> Residents of one of the last trailer parks in Santa Monica were jubilant when  the City Council unanimously spoke out Tuesday against a developer's plans to  build condominiums and apartments on the five-acre park site.  </P> <P> About 50 residents of the Mountain View Mobile Inn trailer park picketed in  front of City Hall before the council meeting, carrying signs that read: "I  just say no to Watt (Industries)."  </P> <P> In a heated meeting two weeks ago, residents were stunned by the news that the  141-space park would make way for multifamily housing. The park is owned by  Ramona Treffinger, but Watt has taken an option to purchase the property.  </P> <P> Watt officials assured park residents that they would be offered new  apartments, but those attending the meeting were dissatisfied with answers that  one woman called "noncommittal and evasive."  </P> <P> Watt has a number of hurdles to negotiate before going forward with its plans.  Mountain View is zoned for mobile homes and would have to be rezoned to allow  condominiums and apartments to be built.  </P> <P> Last year, Mountain View residents, fearing changes such as those Watt has  proposed, persuaded the City Council to rezone the park from light industrial  to residential/mobile homes, a designation that allows only mobile homes,  trailers, yard sales and small family day-care centers.  </P> <P> In addition, the park is under rent control. If the city Rent Control Board  grants the developer a permit to change the park units, Watt would have to  replace the rent-controlled units and provide relocation costs.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's council meeting, Phyllis Goff, representing the residents, spoke  out against Watt's plans and asked the council to make its stand on the issue  known.  </P> <P> All the council members said they were against rezoning the park. Councilman  Herbert Katz said that when Watt representatives told him of their proposal, he  told them: "If you're into pain, go ahead and waste your time."  </P> <P> Rent Control Board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis said the developer made a  "fatal mistake" in setting eyes on rent-controlled property. She added that  approval would be granted "over our dead bodies" and accused Watt of misleading  residents by "claiming that (the project) was going to happen and the tenants  better make a deal."  </P> <P> Judy Maller, a spokeswoman and public relations consultant for Watt, said the  developer did not care to comment on the council's statements.  </P> <P> In an earlier interview, Maller said Watt had not applied for the necessary  zoning change. She said such a move would be premature until Watt had talked  with residents individually to determine how much rent they could afford and  their needs and ideas for new housing.  </P> <P> Maller said all the park's current residents would be able to afford the new  apartments.  </P> <P> "If we don't make it affordable, what's the point of doing it?" she said. "It  is our hope that we would be able to put condos and affordable housing that  would be superior to what's there now."  </P> <P> But most of the residents were not satisfied with those assurances.  </P> <P> "I moved out of an apartment because the rents were going up," said Barbara  Kessel, who lives in one of the park's 141 units with her daughter and  granddaughter.  </P> <P> Calling the mobile home "a place of my own," she said: "It was putting me into  a financial situation that could put me in an early retirement, which would be  totally impossible for me to do if they displace me. You're dealing with not  only tearing down rentals but taking away people's own homes."  </P> <P> Although Maller said the company will consider compensating residents for  losing the homes they own, park residents doubt that the compensation would  equal the values of their homes.  </P> <P> And despite Watt's promises that they would get superior housing, most are not  convinced that apartments would provide the quiet and almost crime-free  environment of the trailer park.  </P> <P> Resident Donna Satterfield said she and others are ready to fight a "David and  Goliath" battle.  </P> <P> Watt "wanted us to see this as an opportunity where everybody could benefit,"  Satterfield said. "But we don't see it that way. They acted as if there were  nothing more to be said. We felt like the steamroller was rolling over us, and  there wasn't anything we could do to stop it."  </P> <P> Kathryn Evans has lived in a trailer park for 42 years. She survived the Santa  Monica Freeway construction that slashed Mountain View to one-third its  original size. But now, Evans said, she may be facing life on the streets or in  an "old ladies' home" if Watt is allowed to go through with its plans.  </P> <P> Evans, like other longtime residents of Mountain View, is retired and lives  alone. Her only income is Social Security, from which she pays about $200 a  month for rent and utilities. In recent years, however, college students and  families have moved into the park, taking advantage of the low rent.  </P> <P> "There's an awful lot of people I know here who don't have anything compared  with what I have," Evans said. She added that her health -- she has bad legs --  would make getting around an apartment difficult.  </P></p>

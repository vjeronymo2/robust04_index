Yesterday morning, Jiang Qinglin expressed important views  on  the current work. He said: Ningde Prefecture has scaled new  heights in economic development this year and made breakthrough  progress in all aspects of work. This is the result of the  efforts of the prefecture's people under the leadership of the  prefectural party committee.    On behalf of the provincial party committee and government,  he expressed his thanks, regards, and Lunar New Year greetings  to the cadres and masses in the entire prefecture.    Jia Qinglin stressed the need to do more in this year's  reform, development, and stability. On development, he pointed  out: First, efforts for agricultural and rural work should not  be relaxed and rural work should be focused on increasing the  peasants' income. It is necessary to develop a high-yield,  high-quality, and highly efficient agriculture, to optimize the  agricultural structure, and to develop township and town  enterprises. Second, there is a need to resolve the problems of  funding and employment, to raise funds through various channels,  and to encourage the private and individual economic sectors to  develop further. Third, we should pay attention to economic  results. The manifestation of better economic results is an  increase in revenue. Fourth, we should bring the energy  industry and transportation into prominence, firmly carry out  the policy of five wheels rolling forward together in developing  the energy industry, and wage a large-scale people's war in  communications construction. Fifth, we should abide by the  principle of seeking truth from facts and arrange economic  development in light of our specific conditions.    On reform, Jia Qinglin requested all levels of party  committees and governments to carefully organize the  implementation of all reform measures, to subordinate local  interests to overall interests, to create a relaxed environment  for reform, and to promote development by means of reform, so as  to gain the people's understanding and support.    On stability, Jia Qinglin pointed out the need to strengthen  the unity of cadres and departments, to form great unity and a  great alliance, to remove factors causing instability and  disunity, to maintain the stability of the cadre contingent, and  to preserve social stability.    Subsequently Jia Qinglin stressed the need to carry out two  types of work simultaneously and lay equal stress on them, and  to resolutely carry out party building, ideological and  political work, and anticorruption work.    In conclusion, Jia Qinglin demanded that a good job be done  for Spring Festival activities. Help should be offered to the  masses so that they can resolve their actual problems.  Localities should do something practical for Armed Forces  units. In the meantime, leading cadres at all levels should  subject themselves to an anticorruption test during the Spring  Festival.</p>

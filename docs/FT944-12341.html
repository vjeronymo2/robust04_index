			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Finance sought for driverless bus network Britain's first guided bus system, using computer-controlled, driverless buses, could be in operation in Guildford, Surrey, by 2002 if private-sector finance can be raised. The four-mile guided bus network would be powered by electricity generated by a purpose-built power station burning domestic waste. Guildford Rapid Transit's buses would link the town centre with the university, a sports centre and industrial and commercial areas. Guided buses are cheaper to install and operate than light rail or 'supertram' systems but most British cities seeking to improve their public transport networks, including Sheffield and Manchester, have opted for trams. Guided bus systems are working in Germany and Australia. The Guildford project has won the backing of the government's private finance panel, which is attempting to encourage private-sector support for public infrastructure projects. The promoter, Listavia International, an engineering design consultancy, is seeking Pounds 500,000 to carry the project forward. The bus network would cost Pounds 103m to install with the power station costing a further Pounds 65m. The project is at the stage where it is ready to seek planning permission. It has been funded so far by Mr Warren Lister, managing director of Listavia, with Pounds 60,000 of his own money. The route would run on dedicated track, much of it elevated, with buses picking up power from cable buried under the track where there was no pedestrian access. At street level the buses would switch to power from on-board batteries. A light rail system would be 2 1/2 times as expensive to install and twice as costly to operate. In combination with the power station, which would sell surplus electricity to the national grid and pipe waste heat to customers through pipes in the bus trackway, the bus network would be profitable. The project is forecast to make a return on capital of between 12 per cent and 18 per cent a year. Although Guildford, with a catchment-area population of 125,000, would be the smallest UK city to have a dedicated transit system, it suffers from city centre congestion and important areas of activity, such as the university and commercial centres, are widely dispersed. The bus network could carry 3,000 people an hour at peak times and is forecast to carry 13,500 people a day. It could reduce car journeys by about 20 per cent and save about 350,000 gallons of petrol a year. A transport survey by Surrey County Council and Guildford Borough Council backed the idea of linking the centre of town with industrial areas and the research park. Construction of the network would reduce the need for city centre parking and allow the development of some of the city's parking sites which could become the public-sector contribution to the project.</p>

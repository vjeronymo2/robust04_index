The stores selling luxury goods, located mainly in  the area between Bonne Foi and Pavee Streets, adhered to the  strike, whereas most of the stores specializing in the sale of  electronic parts, fabrics, and shoes conducted business as  usual. For the informal businesses and open-air marketplaces  too, it was business as usual; the grocery stores and banks,  which adhered to the spirit of the movement, respected the new  work schedule that had been set.    One of the nation's principal employers associations, the  Haitian Manufacturers Association, ADIH, publicly dissociated  itself from the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's  movement, explaining that the movement did not have precise  objectives -- or alternatives in case of failure.    In Les Cayes, Haiti's third biggest city, stores conducted  business as usual. A Les Cayes businessman told the HAITI PRESS  AGENCY that he was not at all involved in the events that led to  the imposition of the strike.</p>

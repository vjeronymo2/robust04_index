			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOTEL OWNERS AGREE TO PAY U.S. $70,000 IN FINES;  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION: INS PENALTY AGAINST TWO MISSION BAY INNS IS LARGEST AGAINST SAN  DIEGO-AREA FIRMS FOR HIRING UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS.  </P> <P> The owners of two large Mission Bay hotels, accused of hiring undocumented  workers and committing numerous other violations of the 1986 immigration reform  law, have agreed to pay $70,000 in federal fines -- the largest ever levied  against a San Diego-area employer for such infractions.  </P> <P> The fines stem from heavily publicized U.S. immigration raids last May against  the two hotels, the Bahia and Catamaran Resort.  </P> <P> William Evans, managing director of the two hotels, which have 640 rooms and  about 600 employees, said the hotels have decided to pay the fines, which were  proposed by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service on March 14. The  hotels' attorneys have been negotiating with the INS for months.  </P> <P> "We basically want to get on with our primary business, which is  hotel-keeping," said Evans, who acknowledged a host of paper-work violations at  the time the immigration inspectors arrived.  </P> <P> In proposing the fines, the INS cited 362 separate counts, or violations,  against hotel management, said Rudy Murillo, INS spokesman in San Diego. Hotel  officials have 30 days to respond. Among the options are paying the fine or  contesting the assessments and requesting a hearing before an administrative  law judge.  </P> <P> Evans conceded that some illegal immigrants may have been working at the  hotels. He said the unauthorized workers had presented false documentation to  hotel management. He was now confident, he added, that the hotel's immigration  paper work is "pristine."  </P> <P> Apart from paying the fine, Evans said that his mother, Anne L. Evans, one of  two chiefs of protocol for the city of San Diego, had agreed to drop her  related claim against INS officials. Evans, in a federal lawsuit filed last  May, challenged the validity of the raids and sought a court injunction  preventing similar actions. A long-delayed hearing was scheduled for next month  in federal court in San Diego.  </P> <P> In court papers, hotel management charged that overzealous INS agents  conducting the raids attempted to create a "panic" among hotel employees, many  of whom are Latino. INS officials responded that the procedures used during the  raid were legal and that a proper warrant had been secured.  </P> <P> Of 30 people taken into custody during the raids, INS authorities determined  that 29 were Mexican citizens living in the United States illegally, said  Murillo, who added that the 29 were returned to Mexico. The other person  apprehended was found to be in the United States legally and was released from  custody, Murillo said.  </P> <P> In the notice announcing the fine, U.S. officials charged that hotel management  failed to maintain paper work as required by the Immigration Reform and Control  Act of 1986. Among other provisions, that sweeping law forbids employers from  knowingly hiring undocumented workers. The purpose is to cut off the job market  for illegal immigrants.  </P> <P> The statute set up an extensive set of documentation-keeping procedures that  U.S. employers must follow. Employers must now fill out forms for each worker,  attesting to workers' eligibility to be in the United States.  </P> <P> Anyone who continues to knowingly hire illegal aliens -- or employers who fail  to comply with the paper-work requirements -- are subject to a range of civil  and criminal penalties and fines, known as employer sanctions, that were also  created by the 1986 law.  </P> <P> The $70,000 proposed fine is by far the largest to date against an employer in  San Diego for violations of the 1986 law.  </P></p>

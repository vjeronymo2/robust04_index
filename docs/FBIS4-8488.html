			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] New York, April 13 (TANJUG)--Yugoslav Ambassador to  the United Nations Dragomir Djokic on Tuesday accused the United  Nations and NATO of getting involved in civil war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina on the side of the Moslems when they bombed  Bosnian Serb positions at Gorazde on Sunday and Monday.    Speaking at a press conference at U.N. headquarters,  Ambassador Djokic read out a statement by the Yugoslav  Government about the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb  positions around the Moslem enclave. The Yugoslav stands were  communicated also to Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    The Yugoslav Government strongly condemns the decision of  the  United Nations to engage the NATO air force, which represents  their direct involvement in the civil war in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina on the side of the Moslems, the statement  said.    Djokic told reporters that Bosnian Serbs had not tried to  seize Gorazde and that U.N. officials on the ground had  confirmed that the Moslems had provoked the fight. It is only  to be expected that those attacked should defend themselves,  there is not an army in the world that would react differently,  said Djokic.    He explained the Yugoslav position that there was absolutely  no reason to use force in this case and that, instead, the  Moslems should have been warned to stop their provocations.  However, now a very dangerous situation has been created, where  it is not clear who will take the next step and what it will be,  he said.    The air strikes have only encouraged the Moslems, who have  been trying to provoke a foreign intervention from the start.  The Serbs are committed to peace, but if the Moslems continue  to attack, the Serbs will be forced to respond, as they will  also in the case of possible new NATO air raids, said Djokic.    He added that Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) as well as the  Bosnian Serbs had from the start insisted that a solution should  be sought in peace talks, and not in the battlefield. However,  somebody came up with the idea that Bosnian Serbs should be  excluded from the talks, and they were not invited to  Moslem-Croat federation consultations in Washington in  mid-March, nor have they been told specifically what is expected  of them, stressed Djokic.    The Serbs cannot accept a solution agreed in their absence  by  the Moslems and Croats. If anybody should try to force it on  them, there is no doubt they will be repulsed. Serbs want  peaceful talks as equal partners, said Djokic.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Marzotto expects improvement MARZOTTO, Italy's largest textile and clothing group, which bought Hugo Boss of Germany in December 1991, expects an improvement in operating profit this year. The upturn should come in spite of the continuing slowdown in demand in most main markets and the relatively high production costs facing Italian manufacturers, said Mr Pietro Marzotto, chairman. He forecast that efficiency improvements and cost-savings undertaken in recent months would allow the group to improve its operating results, adjusted for recent acquisitions and disposals, and generate a free cash-flow which would 'certainly be better' than 1991. The improvement would come despite the sharp rise in net indebtedness caused by the Hugo Boss acquisition. However, Mr Marzotto was reluctant to give any indication on net profits for 1992 or whether the group would restore the dividend, which was cut by 20 per cent last year. The outlook for net earnings, which fell by 12 per cent at group level, to L39.8bn (Dollars 34m) last year was clouded by market factors, notably sales by Hugo Boss in the final quarter, the company's key period. Mr Marzotto revealed that the group was continuing its strategy of selling non-core activities.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Japanese Bonds: Lean times as investors discount the recovery THE Japanese bond market has been going through a lean time as investors begin to discount economic recovery. Compared with a low of 3.8 per cent in February, the yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark has been forced up by positive economic data to around 4.6 per cent in recent weeks. The rise in the Tokyo stock market this year, partly due to the government's price support operation, has undermined hopes of further monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. The Nikkei index of leading share prices rose 24 per cent over the first four months of this year, prompting a shift of funds from the bond market to stocks. Inflationary figures in the US, accompanied by a rise in Treasury bond yields, exacerbated jitters among investors. The ascent in the long-term bond yield triggered a rise in the five-year debenture yield, leading to a jump in the long-term prime rate, the leading benchmark for long-term lending, by 30 basis points to 5.4 per cent earlier this month. Investor doubts were reflected in volume levels. Bond turnover in May was Y29,296.7bn, a fall of 26 per cent from the previous month. However, with the overall wholesale price index for April falling 2.8 per cent after a 2.3 per cent fall in March, and the Nikkei's domestic commodity index down 16 per cent from last summer, worries over inflation are almost non-existent. Optimism over an imminent economic recovery, helped by a return of money supply growth and some consumption indicators, may have been overdone. Bank lending for April rose by a marginal 1.1 per cent from the previous year, the smallest gain ever, and industrial output for April fell 2.2 per cent from the month before, after two consecutive months of strong gains. Housing starts showed signs of topping out, rising a mere 1.1 per cent from a year earlier in April. Stories of middle-managers at large Japanese companies being discreetly ousted from their posts in leading business magazines suggest that a revival in consumer sentiment could still be far away. Poor news for the Japanese economy is good news for interest rates. Euroyen futures market last week saw a jump in activity, with the September three month contract closing the week at 96.79 from 96.66 at the start of the week. Meanwhile, the bond market still faces an over-supply problem as investors are bracing themselves for a new supply of government bonds and corporate issues. Corporate bonds issued last month rose to Y195bn, up sharply from Y11bn in April. More companies are expected to dip into the corporate bond market this month due to the rise in long-term bank lending rates, and according to the Bond Underwriters Association of Japan, at least Y400bn of domestic straight bonds are expected to be issued. Investors are willing to buy short-term issues, as seen in the Tokyo Electric Power's Y150bn three-year issue, the largest to be floated in the domestic bond market. However, many remain wary of long-term bonds after the recent plunge. The fall in yields may be limited due to investors wanting to take profits on positions taken earlier in the year, with a floor around the 4.5 per cent level. But with renewed speculation of a cut in the official discount rate, and the rise in the yen against the dollar, yields may have more room to fall. Mr Marshall Gittler, bond market analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, expects the yield on the No 145 benchmark to fall to 4 per cent during the third quarter of this year.</p>

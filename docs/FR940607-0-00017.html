			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Taxpayer B receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). B pays the amount of the proposed deficiency and files a claim for refund. B's claim is disallowed and a notice of proposed disallowance is issued by the District Director. B does not request an Appeals office conference and the District Director issues a notice of claim disallowance. B then files suit in a United States District Court. B cannot recover reasonable administrative costs because, although the District Director issued a notice of claim disallowance, the Internal Revenue Service did not issue either a notice of decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals or a notice of deficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Assume the same facts as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> except that after B files a claim for refund and receives the notice of proposed disallowance, B requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. No agreement is reached with Appeals and the Office of Appeals issues a notice of claim disallowance. B does not file suit in District Court but instead contacts the Appeals office to attempt to reverse the decision. B convinces the Appeals officer that the notice of claim disallowance is in error. The Appeals officer then abates the assessment. Because a notice of claim disallowance issued by Appeals is a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, B may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred on or after the receipt of the notice of claim disallowance (the administrative proceeding date), but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. B cannot recover the costs incurred prior to receipt of the notice of claim disallowance because they were incurred before the administrative proceeding date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Taxpayer C receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). C files a request for and is granted an Appeals office conference. At the Appeals conference no agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. The Office of Appeals then issues a notice of deficiency. Upon receiving the notice of deficiency C does not file a petition with the Tax Court. Instead, C pays the deficiency and files a claim for refund. The claim for refund is considered by the Internal Revenue Service and the District Director issues a notice of proposed disallowance. C requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. C convinces Appeals that C's claim is correct and Appeals allows C's claim. C may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred on or after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative proceeding date), but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Taxpayer D receives a District Director's Collection Division (Collection) proposed assessment of trust fund taxes (Trust Fund Recovery Penalty) pursuant to section 6672. D requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. Upon consideration, Appeals upholds D's position. D cannot recover reasonable administrative costs because the costs were not incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Taxpayer E files an individual income tax return showing a balance due. No payment is made with the return and the Internal Revenue Service assesses the amount shown on the return. The Internal Revenue Service issues a notice and demand for tax pursuant to section 6303. E contacts the Collection Division (Collection) regarding E's outstanding liability. No agreement is reached with respect to the timing of E's payment, and Collection issues a notice of intent to levy pursuant to section 6331(d). Prior to the levy, E enters into an installment agreement with Collection. The costs that E incurred in connection with the notice and demand were not incurred in an administrative proceeding, but rather in a collection action. Accordingly, E may not recover those costs as reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Taxpayer F receives a District Director's Collection Division (Collection) proposed assessment of trust fund taxes (Trust Fund Recovery Penalty) pursuant to section 6672. F requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. Appeals considers the issues and decides to uphold Collection's recommended assessment. Appeals notifies F of this decision in writing. Collection then assesses the tax. Pursuant to section 6672(b), within 30 days after the notice and demand is made, F pays the minimum amount required to commence a court proceeding, files a claim for refund, and furnishes the required bond. Collection then considers and disallows the claim. Appeals then reconsiders the claim and reverses its original position, thus upholding F's position. Appeals then abates the assessment. F may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred after the receipt of the original decision of Appeals (the administrative proceeding date) that Appeals was upholding Collection's recommended assessment, but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. F cannot recover costs that are attributable to any procedure or other action before Collection prior to filing F's administrative claim for refund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;301.7430&hyph;4  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Reasonable administrative costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, reasonable administrative costs are any costs described in paragraph (b) of this section that are incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding (as defined in &sect;301.7430&hyph;3(a)) and incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date (as defined in &sect;301.7430&hyph;3(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Costs described <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The costs described in this paragraph are the reasonable and necessary amount of costs incurred by the taxpayer to present the taxpayer's position with respect to the merits of the tax controversy or the recovery of reasonable administrative costs.

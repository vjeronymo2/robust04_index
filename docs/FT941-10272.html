			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / People: Hughes takes a shot at pots Susan Mary-Lorraine Hughes, a 42-year-old business school graduate, has been appointed chief executive (designate) of Portmeirion Potteries, which grew out of a small gift shop in a small North Wales tourist resort of the same name. Hughes, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles' Meridian clothing business, is being brought in to replace George Hesp, 60. She joins the company on March 7 and will take over in stages from Hesp, who has been group managing director since 1965. Brett Phillips, Portmeirion's finance director, says there were more than 300 applicants for the job and Hughes had been chosen because she came from a 'design-oriented company'. Portmeirion traces its roots back to the 1950s when Euan Cooper Willis and his wife, Susan Williams-Ellis - a designer who had studied under Henry Moore and Graham Sutherland - began selling pottery from a gift shop in Portmeirion, an architectural fantasy designed by Susan's father, Sir William Clough Williams-Ellis. When the couple couldn't find a pottery prepared to make their designs they bought their own pottery in Stoke-on-Trent. Susan still designs some of the production and her husband remains chairman. Although the family retains majority control, the company came to the the stock market in 1988 and has grown rapidly despite the recession. The company's turnover, more than half of which is exported, has more than doubled to Pounds 22.5m over the past five years and pre-tax profits have risen from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 3.7m.</p>

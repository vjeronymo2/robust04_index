			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Beskromnyy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 5 Mar -- There has been encouraging progress  recently in the Bosnian settlement in several directions. It is  important to build up on the positive impulse and try to  reaffirm, rather that lose it, noted Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev on summing up his almost two-hours long  discussion today with the Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina  Haris Silajdzic, who has arrived in Moscow. Russia's top  diplomat described the talks as fruitful.    This positive assessment was also shared by his Bosnian  counterpart. Saying that there are now prerequisites for  resolving the conflict, he added: This momentum should not be  lost.    We expect that the Russian Government will play a  constructive role in continuing the talks on Bosnia, stated  Silajdzic. Simultaneously, the prime minister spoke in favor of  a more balanced Russian policy in some aspects of the Yugoslav  crisis. We hope that the Russian battalion stationed around  Sarajevo will play a positive role and make it possible to  preserve the multi-ethnic nature of that city, he went on to say.    On the agreement to establish a Croat-Muslim federation,  which has been achieved, he said that this agreement excludes no  one. Obviously, its implementation is impossible without the  Serbs, he pointed out. We made it clear that our agreement will  also be offered to the Serb side. It is quite possible at the  same time that now it is not ready to accept it. In this  scenario, we will develop a new version, but it will still be  based on the main premise -- the territorial integrity and  sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

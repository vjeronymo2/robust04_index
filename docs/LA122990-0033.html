			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARTESIA TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> CLEVELAND FALLS TO LONG BEACH POLY IN OVERTIME, 75-72  </P> <P> Kenny Collins stared into the eyes of Cleveland High Coach Kevin Crider, who  dabbed at Collins' bleeding forehead with a white towel.  </P> <P> Carlos Vasquez stared at Brandon Martin, who, in turn, stared out at the  hardwood.  </P> <P> Not a lot of conversation, considering that the Cavaliers had possession of the  ball with the score tied and 1 minute 42 seconds left in regulation.  </P> <P> "We didn't say anything," said Vasquez, who finished with 17 points. "(Crider)  just said, 'Run the offense.' We all just wanted to make sure Kenny was alive."  </P> <P> Collins, who took a knee to the head, survived, but Cleveland didn't, dropping  a 75-72 overtime decision to Long Beach Poly in the semifinals of the Artesia  tournament Friday night.  </P> <P> After the timeout, Cleveland (10-3) blew its best chance to win when Vasquez  passed inside to forward Kayheed Murray with 53 seconds left. The ball glanced  off Murray's hands, and while Cleveland managed to regain possession, Murray  was able to attempt only an off-balance 22-foot shot at the buzzer that missed.  Then the Cavaliers fell flat in overtime.  </P> <P> Long Beach Poly (12-2) forward Yikeem Craddock scored six points in overtime  and finished with a game-high 26 points. Cleveland, which plays the loser of  Friday's late semifinal between Artesia and Westchester for third place tonight  at 6:20, never led in overtime and trailed by four with 30 seconds left.  </P> <P> Cleveland led, 39-30, at halftime, but the Jackrabbits came out smoking in the  second half, outscoring the Cavaliers, 13-4, to pull even at 43-43 with 4:17  left in the third quarter. Cleveland led, 53-52, entering the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "Let's just say that they made the adjustments and we didn't," Crider said.  "The kids still think they know what's best, and they still haven't completely  accepted the system."  </P> <P> The lead changed hands six times in the fourth quarter, but the Cavaliers  didn't do themselves any favors: Murray was called for a technical foul for  hanging on the rim and Vasquez was called for a lane violation that gave Poly  another free throw after a miss.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Part 4 of 4-part article on Nuclear Power White Paper's </F> focus on nuclear fuel recycling]    [Text] One of the unique features of this year's White  Paper is that it emphasizes openness of information in the  nuclear energy sector. With regard to information control, while  stating that ``cautious handling is needed'' from the viewpoint  of protection of nuclear materials, it advocates ``as much  openness as possible,'' and maintains that ``excessive  non-disclosure in the name of protecting information that is  sensitive for reasons of protection of nuclear materials,  nuclear non-proliferation, and protection of property rights  should be avoided.''    The immediate reason why the White Paper makes a big issue  of  information disclosure is because United Socialist Democratic  Party representative Satsuki Eda, who was appointed STA director  general with the changeover in government, favors openness of  information. The working level white paper draft did not cite  openness of information in great detail, but on instructions  from the director general, phrasing was changed substantially,  such as by the addition of an independent paragraph on this  issue.    A great debate arose over openness of information in the  nuclear energy field because the authorities declared that most  information relating to the transporting of plutonium from  France by the transport vessel Akatsuki-Maru, which took place  from November 1992 to January 1993, was secret due to the need  to protect nuclear materials.    Moreover, in connection with the safety of nuclear fuel  recycling facilities, anti-nuclear groups are vociferous about  openness of design information. Although Director General Eda  says, ``I have instructed working level authorities to study  what additional information can be disclosed,'' the propensity  to take a wary attitude about openness of information is  deep-rooted at the facilities themselves, and there are many  uncertainties about what the content of that additional  information will be.    With progress in the development of nuclear fuel recycling,  the need to provide information to other countries also will  increase. At the time of the plutonium transport by the  Akatsuki-Maru, there was marked increase in international  interest about Japan's plutonium use policy as well. The White  Paper states that ``Provision of information internationally is  extremely important'' in order to gain international  understanding and cooperation for Japan's policies.    STA leaders stress that ``Basically, the United States is  uncomfortable with the idea of commercial use of plutonium, and  Japan needs to send messages constantly about its nuclear  non-proliferation efforts.'' The idea of creating a new forum  for nuclear energy cooperation with Asian countries and to seek  their understanding for Japan's policies also is being studied.    There is criticism that the work of reviewing the long-term  plan for development and use of nuclear energy, which is in  full-swing, is being carried out mostly through studies by  nuclear experts and is not necessarily an open debate. These are  individual arguments about what information should be disclosed,  and this white paper may be the beginning of that process.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / People: Evans to take his own pension John Evans, 59, one of Britain's most successful pension fund managers, is stepping down as investment manager of the Pounds 1.2bn Courtaulds Pension fund. He hands over to his deputy, David Brief, 41, at the end of the year. Evans, who once taught finance at London Business School, is not as well known as his two predecessors, Alastair Ross Goobey, who runs PosTel and Matthew Oakeshott, who set up Olim, a money management firm. However, he has been around longer than both of them. He first managed Courtaulds' pension money in the mid-1970s before joining Oliver Marriott - author of The Property Boom - in the property business. He returned in 1986. During his 28 years with Courtaulds, Evans has done several jobs, including that of chief economist. However, he is best known for providing Courtaulds pensioners with above average investment returns. In an industry which worships the average, Courtaulds in-house pension fund has always been the odd man out. It has prospered by not following the herd and under Evans has outperformed its peer group by an average of 1 1/2 per cent per annum. Part of Evans' skill has lain in his knowledge of the property market. Evans will be 60 next month when he reaches Courtaulds' normal retirement age. However, he does not plan to quit the City completely. He is chairman of one of Foreign and Colonial's smaller investment trusts and also chairs Quintain, an unquoted property company which he hopes will come to the stock market at some stage. David Brief joined Courtaulds pension fund in 1991 from Citibank. (See Observer)</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / 'Pepsi-tampering' likely to be hoax THE Pepsi-tampering mystery began unravelling yesterday as several claims of objects found in cans were pronounced hoaxes, AP reports from New York. At least two people were arrested. Police said at least three other people had recanted. And some experts said it was likely that all the cases would turn out to be hoaxes, perpetrated by people who were out for money, attention or thrills. Pepsi-Cola has suggested as much itself, saying it is virtually impossible to tamper with soda cans at its bottling plants. 'This development reinforces what we've believed all along - that this is not a manufacturing problem and that consumers should not be alarmed about any alleged problems with Pepsi products,' President Craig Weatherup said in a statement. A man has been arrested and accused of taking a hypodermic needle out of the trash and claiming he found it in a Pepsi can. He could get up to five years in prison on federal charges of making of a false report. A 21-year-old man was also arrested after investigators with the Food and Drug Administration concluded his claim of finding a needle was false. A woman in California admitted she had broken a sewing needle into pieces and put two in a Pepsi can, police said. Police in Covina, California, said a woman there confessed that she had fabricated her story about finding a syringe in a Pepsi. 'It seems obvious that some of these tamperings are faked - and in the dumbest of ways. It won't be a surprise to me if all of them turn out to be faked,' said Dr Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist in Newport Beach, California. He is a consultant to the FBI in tampering cases. The first report came on June 9, when an 82-year-old man in Tacoma, Washington, said he looked into a can of Diet Pepsi to see if he had won a prize and found a syringe. Soon after, similar reports came pouring in. Local media accounts indicated that at least 52 reports of tampering in at least 23 states had been made by Wednesday night.</p>

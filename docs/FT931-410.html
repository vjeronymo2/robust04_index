			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: DTI gives approval to ITN restructuring deal THE LAST significant barrier to the restructuring of Independent Television News was crossed yesterday when the Department of Trade and Industry gave its approval to the deal. The seven member consortium which will in future own ITN has also reached agreement in principle to buy its central London headquarters from Stanhope Properties in a deal worth Pounds 74m. Losses of Pounds 5m a year on the lease triggered the restructuring. The offer for ITN is expected to go unconditional tomorrow. It will mean that in future there will be seven shareholders instead of 15. Carlton, Central, London Weekend Television, Granada and Reuters will each have 18 per cent and Scottish Television and Anglia 5 per cent apiece. The three outgoing ITV companies, Thames, TVS and Television South West, were each offered Pounds 14 a share and the continuing ITV companies such as HTV and Yorkshire will only get par for their Pounds 1 shares.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vitaliy </F> Makarchev and UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Trotsenko]    [Text] Kiev, 24 May (ITAR-TASS) -- At the talks taking  place in Kiev between delegations of the Ukrainian Supreme  Soviet and the Crimean parliament, the basis of a mechanism for  settlement of the Crimean conflict has been laid. This was said  today by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk when he received  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd who has arrived in  Ukraine on a one-day official visit.    "I must stress yet again," Leonid Kravchuk noted, "that  Crimea is an autonomous part of Ukraine." "We want to act  within the framework of the Ukrainian Constitution, not to  resort to force, and we are insisting that the authorities in  the Crimea also act within its framework," he stated, having  called on Russia to support Ukraine in this.</p>

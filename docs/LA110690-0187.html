			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PATRIOTS WAIVE PERRYMAN, CITE MEDIOCRE GAMES  </P> <P> The New England Patriots have waived Robert Perryman, saying that the fullback  had put in a mediocre performance in the seven games he played so far this  season.  </P> <P> Perryman didn't handle the ball once in Sunday's 48-20 loss to the Philadelphia  Eagles.  </P> <P> He has also blocked poorly, though he turned in 15 catches for 88 yards.  </P> <P> On the season, Perryman ran 32 times for 97 yards and one touchdown, a dramatic  slide from last year. The Patriots, meanwhile, have slipped to a 1-7 record,  worst in the league.  </P> <P> The third-round draft choice from Michigan gained 187 yards as a rookie, 448  yards in 16 starts in 1988 and 562 yards in 16 games, 14 of them starts, last  year. He started 38 of his 49 games with New England.  </P> <P> Perryman was rewarded with a four-year, $2.1-million contract worth $475,000  this season, making him one of the NFL's highest-paid fullbacks. Patriots  General Managar Patrick Sullivan said New England doesn't have to keep him on  the payroll for the next 3 1/2 seasons.  </P> <P> "It's not a money-saving issue (to cut Perryman). It's a performance issue," he  said.  </P></p>

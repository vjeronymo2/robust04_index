			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Observer: Genially put The boardroom row at Middlesex's Northwood Golf Club reminds Observer of the old tale of the husband whose wife was always beating him at golf. Having lost his ball in the rough, he trips over a lamp. A genie dutifully appears and offers our hero three wishes - the only condition is that the wife must get double. The golfer's first wish is to be the best player in the club. 'Fine,' says the genie, 'but you realise this means that your wife will be twice as good?' 'No problem,' says the golfer. 'My wife is in the ladies section, and that doesn't count.' His second wish is to be a millionaire. Once again the genie mentions the condition. The golfer explains that he loves his wife dearly so her extra wealth would be no obstacle. 'And your final wish?' asks the genie. 'A mild heart attack,' replies the golfer.</p>

He said the supplies are provided for by an agreement  between  the State Committee and the Russian TVEL corporation signed at  the end of last year. Ukraine paid 6.79 Bn rubles for the fuel  immediately.    According to Stovbun, at the end of last year the capacity  of  the Chernobyl nuclear power station had to be cut down due to  fuel shortages, but at the end of February the State Committee  purchased Russian fuel for a quarter of a year. At the  beginning of 1994 Ukraine received the first batch of nuclear  fuel.    At the same time Kiev has drawn attention to the fact that  Russia has not signed an agreement on fuel supplies to Ukraine  in exchange for the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its  territory which is provided for by the treaty between Russia,  Ukraine and the USA. The Ukrainian vice-premier Valeriy Shmarov  has told INTERFAX that they only received a letter from Viktor  Chernomyrdin in which the Russian side pledged to begin  shipments this month.    The State Committee believes that as Ukraine has a  sufficient  number of nuclear installations, it would be more profitable to  develop the production of nuclear fuel in the country itself  than import it. In this connection the State Committee is  preparing for an international tender of technology for the  production of nuclear fuel.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that North Korea had trouble  with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection  team from the beginning of the inspection because it did not  comply with the agreement to allow IAEA's full-scope inspection  [chonmyon sachal] but only allowed limited inspection, including  the replacement of surveillance devices.    It has been learned that the IAEA will closely review the  inspection results as soon as the inspection team returns early  this week in order to decide whether or not to call a special  Board of Governors meeting.    According to information from a well-informed IAEA source  obtained today, during the 10-day inspection, which began on 3  March, North Korea did not allow the checking of the points for  the full-scope inspection required by the IAEA and only allowed  limited inspections, including the replacement of surveillance  devices.    The source said North Korea only allowed limited  inspections,  including the replacement of surveillance devices, and that  inspections on North Korean facilities did not go smoothly from  the beginning. It seemed that the inspection team and the North  Korean authorities had considerable disagreement regarding the  broken seals in the radioactive chemical laboratory, in  particular.    The source said the inspection team considered returning  earlier than the original two-week schedule because North Korea  did not immediately allow follow-up steps for the confirmation  of the contents due to the broken seals in the radioactive  chemical laboratory.    The inspection team finished their preparations to leave on  11 and 12 March and will return early this week. The IAEA  established a policy to call an emergency special Board of  Governors meeting if it concludes that the inspections required  by the IAEA were not conducted after receiving a more accurate  inspection report from the inspection team.</p>

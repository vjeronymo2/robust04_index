			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: MFI confirms reflotation in light of better trading MFI FURNITURE Group, the kitchen and bedroom furniture manufacturer and retailer, said yesterday that it was going ahead with a reflotation this summer. The group was the subject of a Pounds 718m management buy-out in 1987 and aimed to return to the stock market within three years. However, the float was delayed by the recession which put pressure on its trading. Yesterday, MFI said it was planning the flotation 'in the light of much improved trading in the first few months of 1992 and the stock market's encouraging reaction to the general election result'. The joint stockbrokers to the issue - Rowe &amp; Pitman and Smith New Court - both published research on the group yesterday. They estimate that the group will have made a trading profit of Pounds 70m in the financial year which ended last Saturday. They point out that, despite the recession, the group continued to trade profitably before interest charges, with the lowest year producing a trading profit of more than Pounds 50m. They say that MFI is the leading UK furniture retailer with 13 per cent of the market. About 60 per cent of sales are accounted for by products it manufactures itself. The value of the group will depend on the amount of debt which will be repaid from the proceeds of the float, but a figure in excess of Pounds 750m is expected. The group has about Pounds 500m of debt at present. Mr Derek Hunt, chairman, said yesterday that the group would be comfortable with up to Pounds 100m of borrowings. It has yet to decide how much to raise in the float and shareholders who backed the buy-out may use it to sell their shares. Asda, the food retail group which previously owned MFI, and which has 25 per cent of the shares, has said it is not a long-term holder of MFI. Mr Hunt said the group, which has 174 stores in the UK, aimed to roll out its new trading format in the UK over the next three years and has targeted 40 towns where it would like to open stores. It also aims to expand its profitable 30 store chain in France and possibly to expand into Spain and Portugal later. It is also considering expanding its manufacturing business to cover electrical kitchen appliances such as ovens, fridges and dishwashers.</p>

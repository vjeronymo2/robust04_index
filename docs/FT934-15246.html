			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Time to square the Quad for the Round - A need to clarify the Tokyo deal between the big four traders WHEN the world's four biggest trading nations struck an unexpected deal on tariffs last July in Tokyo, there was an almost audible sigh of relief from the other participants in the 116-nation Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. The apparent resolution of disagreements related to industrial goods between the so-called Quad nations - the US, the European Community, Japan and Canada - was seen as paving the way for an ambitious tariff-cutting package going well beyond the Round's one-third target reduction. However, with just more than two months to go to the December 15 deadline for concluding the seven-year-old Round, the negotiations to improve market access for imports are still being held up by the Quad's failure to agree how precisely the Tokyo accord should be applied, tariff line by tariff line. Under the most-favoured-nation principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, tariff concessions agreed by the leading traders are extended to all, providing a basic platform for bargaining by others. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director-general, said at the end of September that the Quad's 'unfinished agenda' was putting 'clear obstacles' in the way of the Geneva talks. The meeting in Brussels today between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, is thus seen as crucial in breaking the logjam. 'If this meeting is unproductive, the Uruguay Round will be in a very difficult situation,' says a senior official from another Quad country. Senior Quad negotiators will meet in Geneva tomorrow to review progress in the market access negotiations before an important stocktaking meeting of all Uruguay Round participants on Friday. The basic problem appears to be a difference between the EC and its Quad partners on how the Tokyo accord should be interpreted. EC negotiators say it provides an agreed 'formula' for tariff cuts across the board: zero tariffs for some categories of goods, harmonised low tariffs for others, peak tariffs (15 per cent and over) to be halved, and other tariffs to be cut by a third. The US, Japan and Canada say the accord sets out objectives, to be hardened up through the normal bargaining process. Community officials argue that the 'request and offer' approach - which the EC has always opposed - is simply impracticable at this late stage of the negotiations. The EC is particularly annoyed because it thought it had won agreement from the US in Tokyo to halve most tariff peaks on textiles, a key objective for the Community. Instead, Washington has offered 50 per cent cuts on only half the textile tariff peaks the EC has identified, and the reductions on the rest amount to less than a fifth. In the tariff category targeted for a one-third reduction, the US has chosen to meet the goal by offering extra zero-tariff sectors, notably electronics, rather than lowering duties across the range. For its part, Japan has offered 50 per cent reductions on fewer than half its tariff peaks. High tariffs on leather goods, where both the EC and the US are pushing for reductions, have barely been touched. Community negotiators say they cannot agree to more than the eight zero-tariff categories already accepted unless the US and Japan make further concessions. Apart from electronics, the EC's Quad partners want Brussels to scrap duties on paper and pulp and scientific instruments, and to reduce or eliminate tariffs on glass, ceramics, toys, wood and non-ferrous metals. The other Quad nations are laying blame for the impasse in the negotiations at the EC's door. 'It's Brussels that needs to move,' says one senior trade diplomat, pointing out that the Community's tariff offer is by far the worst of the four and falls well below the one-third Uruguay Round target. According to one estimate, Japan's offer on industrial goods amounts to an average tariff reduction of about 60 per cent, Canada's 50 per cent, the US's 37 per cent and the EC's 26 per cent, though EC officials say their offer was pitched low deliberately to put pressure on trading partners. US negotiators are hoping that, in the textiles area at least, a settlement may be in sight after signs that the American and European textiles industries are close to a tariff-cutting agreement on products of bilateral interest, mostly wool. Similar industry accords, on zero tariffs for pharmaceuticals and low harmonised tariffs for chemicals, were taken on board in the July Quad deal. As for the rest, according to one sanguine insider, 'there are few issues left and the trade-offs are clear. Mr Kantor and Sir Leon should be able to close in on a deal.'</p>

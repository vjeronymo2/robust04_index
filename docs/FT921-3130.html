			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Labour fails to win business hearts - FT/Mori Poll Of Leading Company Executives LABOUR'S intense campaign to win the hearts and minds of British industry and finance appears to have failed. A survey of board-level executives at leading British companies carried out by MORI for the Financial Times in the days after the general election was called shows that overwhelmingly they believe a Conservative victory on April 9 would be better for Britain and for their business. Nearly four fifths say a Labour victory would be bad for the country and industry, and five sixths say it would hurt their business. The single bright note for the Opposition is that for all their distrust of Labour, business leaders would prefer Mr John Smith to Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor of the exchequer. Otherwise they predict that Mr Neil Kinnock's arrival in Downing Street would be the signal for a fall in the pound's value, higher interest rates and lower investment. The 235 executives canvassed by MORI - drawn from the banking, finance, insurance as well manufacturing and construction industries - are self-admitted partisans. Nine in 10 say they intend to vote for Mr John Major against the 1 per cent who support Mr Neil Kinnock, and the 7 per cent who back Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats. Understandably in view of their incomes, 94 per cent preferred the Conservatives' personal tax policies against the 3 per cent apparently willing to pay more under Labour. Business leaders are not convinced that a Tory victory on April 9 will signal the end of the present economic recession - two thirds say it will make little difference. Nor do they give an overwhelming vote of confidence to the Conservatives' management of the country. Fractionally under half (49 per cent) are satisfied with Mr Major's government while 45 per cent are dissatisfied and 6 per cent offer no view. Mr Kinnock and Mr Smith are likely to be disheartened by just how few have been convinced by Labour's drive for economic respectability. Nearly nine out of 10 (87 per cent) believe the Conservatives have the best policies to manage the economy, while just 3 per cent back Labour. Only when the executives are asked about technology and innovation, or education and training, does Labour come any where near closing the gap. The Conservative approach to those issues wins the support of 36 per cent and 49 per cent respectively, against the 22 per cent and 28 per cent preferring Labour's alternatives. More worryingly for the Labour leadership, the executives appear to believe that a Tory defeat would signal a flight of capital, leading to a devaluation of the pound and higher interest rates. Seventy-one per cent predict that he would devalue. The survey, carried out by Mori exclusively for the FT, was conducted among executive directors drawn from the FT UK Top 500. In total 235 interviews were carried out by telephone between March 11 and 13 1992. The response rate was 69 per cent. A second wave of the survey is due to take place immediately prior to the election. Copyright: Mori/Financial Times.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Immigrants worry Australians Australia's federal government is being urged to step up pressure on China in an effort to halt a sudden influx of illegal refugees reaching Australia by boat from the southern Chinese city of Beihai. On Wednesday, a vessel with more than 70 people on board entered Darwin, the fourth in six days believed to be from the Chinese port town. This brought the number of boat people, predominantly Chinese, arriving in northern Australia this year to about 950, the highest annual total since the Vietnam war. More than two-thirds of the arrivals have occurred in the last six weeks.</p>

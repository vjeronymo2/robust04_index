			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Observer: Crossed wires Always thought that Eurotunnel chairman Sir Alastair Morton was a bit of a loose cannon. No sooner has the government given him the chairmanship of its Private Finance Working group, than up he pops telling the other side how to do it. Morton, who stepped down as chief executive of Eurotunnel last month, has been given star billing in Labour's press release on its new public/private sector partnership. Morton, headed the state-owned British National Oil Corporation the last time Labour was in power, but promises that he's not contributing to the opposition's new initiative. He has only agreed to speak at its conference on February 24 in order to get his views across to a wider audience. He's doing the same for the Tory's Bow Group in March. Even so, Morton's political dexterity is bound to increase the sense in some government quarters that the sooner he gets given a proper job to do again, the better. Then, perhaps, the chairmanship of the Treasury working group can be turned over to a more government-friendly type like former BP chairman Bob Horton, now running Railtrack.</p>

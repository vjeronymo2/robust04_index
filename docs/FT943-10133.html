			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The general in his strawberry field - James Buxton meets an old soldier with green fingers and a seasonal business Before John and Belinda MacMillan set up their little commercial fruit farm, they invited a horticultural expert to come out to see them. He approved of the site, gave them some tips and could not seriously fault their plans. However his encouragement was somewhat restrained. 'I take it you've got another source of income?' he inquired before he drove off. That was in 1990. Lieutenant-General Sir John MacMillan was shortly to retire on his 59th birthday as commander of the Army in Scotland. He felt it was rather late to start a conventional business career and 'I didn't want to become a city gent'. He and his wife wanted to live in the country. But, he says, 'if you live in the country you've got to have something to do'. They chose soft-fruit growing because, as his wife Belinda says, 'John has always had a knack for making things grow'. They bought Boghall Farm with its 33 acres in Stirlingshire. It faces south over the upper Forth valley with views to the mountains of the Trossachs. That year they planted their first acre with strawberries and raspberries. They now cultivate eight acres and grow currants and gooseberries and an acre of vegetables. Soft fruit is the ultimate seasonal business. The fruit needs to be sold as soon as it ripens during a season which in Scotland begins in mid-June and ends in September. Having a market to hand is crucial because the MacMillans had been advised that soft fruit-growing was only economic if you ran a pick-your-own operation, with people helping themselves from the rows and paying by the punnet, weighed on the scales. Offering a few vegetables as well - 'everything you would expect to find in a Victorian kitchen garden like spinach, courgettes, leeks and potatoes' - gives the business an edge over other fruit farms. Boghall is ideal for pick-your-own because it is near tourist areas such as Stirling and the Trossachs, and not far from several caravan and camping sites. The MacMillans started by putting 250 green cards with a sketch map of their location under windscreens in Tesco's car park in Stirling, and pinning them up at the tourist sites. 'The most successful one was outside the ladies' loo at the Blair Drummond caravan park,' Belinda says. Pick-your-own took the MacMillans into a new world. Local customers came to buy fresh fruit or to make jam for their grandchildren. The MacMillans encountered people who drove from England for their holidays every year and went back with their car boots full of fruit to stock up their freezers. People even make jam in their caravans, they discovered. They found that far from considering picking hard work, people came because it was fun. Once a coach-load of Belgians descended on the farm. 'It was like scavengers on the field of Bannockburn,' says the general. 'Their courier told me they had absolutely insisted she stop the bus when they saw the farm.' But there are snags about pick-your-own. A woman let loose on the spinaches uprooted most of the crop: the MacMillans now insist on picking the vegetables themselves. Although the picking zones are fenced off, the pickers invariably stray. A more important snag, John says, is that 'the pick-your-owners are like butterflies. They only come out in the sun.' It was therefore essential to supplement pick-your-own with pick to order, not just for busy or elderly customers, but for shops and hotels. That business, accounting for about 20 per cent of turnover, is a less arcadian affair. While pick-your-own may keep the MacMillans or their three helpers, on duty weighing punnets until about 10pm in the long northern summer evenings, some shops require fruit to be picked that morning and delivered by 10.30am. Part of the key to success, MacMillan says, is maintaining quality. That, he says, depends more on following the rules than on having green fingers. But for the shops and hotels it also means keeping up a high standard of picking. Sensible pricing is another requirement. Pick-to-order is affected, but not dictated, by the price of imported Spanish or east European fruit. Pick-your-own prices are determined by what rivals within 20 miles are asking. 'We try to have a consistent price for the season, otherwise some people will hold off till the end, hoping it will drop,' says Belinda. Even though the business is highly seasonal, soft-fruit farming is a long-term business. 'It requires time and money. It takes 18 months from planting to getting your first crop of strawberries, and after four to five crops you have to let the land lie fallow for four or five years,' says John. They had to invest in plants, a small tractor, fertiliser and sprays, and at one point the overdraft reached Pounds 40,000. Although pickers arrived from the start, revenue grew slowly. It started at Pounds 8,000 in 1991 and reached Pounds 26,000 last year. That produced a surplus of Pounds 9,000 after paying for labour and inputs. John expects turnover to rise sharply this season before reaching a plateau next year and is optimistic about profits. Rotation is bringing some better land into use and yields from the fruit bushes increase steadily for a time as they grow bigger. Above all, far more people have been coming to pick this year, attracted by better advertising, word-of-mouth and sunny weather. In mid-July almost no fruit went to waste. As the adviser warned, the MacMillans could not live comfortably off their fruit farm and still need their general's pension. But, at the end of a warm day, on which takings had approached Pounds 1,000, John was beginning to wish he had land on which to expand. And there is no suggestion that he does not enjoy biting autumn days in the fields cutting down the old raspberry canes. Boghall Farm, Thornhill, Stirling, FK8 3QD. Tel: 0786-850692</p>

Income from continuing operations totalled Dollars 111m, or 63 cents a share, against Dollars 50m, or 32 cents, in the same period of last year, on sales of Dollars 3.48bn, compared with Dollars 3.43bn. Net income totalled Dollars 88m, or 50 cents, after a Dollars 23m, or 13 cents, extraordinary loss. That was down from Dollars 123m, or 84 cents, in the same period last year, while operating income was slightly ahead at Dollars 303m, compared with Dollars 296m. The J I Case agricultural and construction equipment unit reported operating income of Dollars 59m, up Dollars 48m from the same period last year, while revenues dipped slightly to Dollars 1.1bn.

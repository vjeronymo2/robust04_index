			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Treasury windfall found in Bank The Treasury has been handed a pre-Budget crock of gold with news that for the past 18 years it has been sitting on a pile of banknotes which could modestly contribute to cutting the UK's expected Pounds 32bn budget deficit this financial year. Notes worth Pounds 300,000 have been booked in the Treasury's name in a secure deposit in the vaults of the Bank of England deep under Threadneedle Street since 1976. Customs &amp; Excise officers seized the money while enforcing foreign currency controls designed to stop large sums of cash being channelled in and out of Britain. The controls were dropped in 1979. A Treasury official welcomed the Financial Times's discovery of the existence of the cash, and said it would look into the matter. 'Every little bit helps,' the official said, referring to the assumption that the money could be used to fund public spending. The cash was seized from a Swiss-based 'middle man', who had a business allegedly spiriting money from UK individuals out of the country. The Swiss agent was arrested in London by Customs, acting on behalf of the Treasury, and a suitcase containing the notes was confiscated for use as evidence in court proceedings. But the suspect later fled to continental Europe and has never stood trial, with the Treasury later abandoning interest. Because the seizure took place in the City of London - and the Bank seemed the obvious place to store the money - it was handed over to Threadneedle Street for safe keeping. Although legally the cash would appear to belong to the UK citizens who entrusted it to the Swiss agent, no one has come forward to claim it. Property seized by Customs can be sold, with any proceeds handed to the Treasury's consolidated fund used for public spending. So assuming the Treasury can sort out the paperwork in time, Mr Clarke may be able to announce in his Budget next week that an extra Pounds 300,000 will be available to be spent on public projects or used for a modest tax reduction. The Treasury's lack of knowledge of the Pounds 300,000 worth of notes will do little to boost its reputation for sound control of the nation's finances.</p>

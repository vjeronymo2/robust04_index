			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / US sees new force needed for Haiti The White House yesterday denied reports that it had already decided to remove the military junta in Haiti by force, if tougher sanctions agreed last week by the United Nations do not work. But US officials said some kind of UN security force, including a significant US component, would be needed, even if the sanctions succeed in forcing out General Raoul Cedras and his colleagues. President Bill Clinton has been careful in recent statements not to rule out the use of US military force to remove the junta that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. However, US officials are anxious to give sanctions some time to work. 'There has been no decision to send in a small force to purge the military,' said Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN. The sanctions are to go into effect if Gen Cedras and his colleagues have not left Haiti by May 21. US officials declined to say how long they planned to wait to see whether the sanctions work. Under the Governor's Island agreement reached in New York last year, the US, with other countries, was to provide military trainers and civil engineers to help a return to civilian rule in Haiti. The ship carrying those trainers turned away when a small mob organised by the military prevented it from docking. Officials insist a new force would have a similar role to that envisaged in the accord but the trainers are likely to be more heavily armed. Haitian legislators have named Supreme Court Justice Emile Joanaissaint as interim president. This is likely to be seen as further defiance of UN efforts to restore Father Aristide to power.</p>

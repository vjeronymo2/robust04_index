			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCMAHON STILL FEELS SORE ABOUT HEALTH QUESTION  </P> <P> Maybe what the Chargers really need is a damage control coach.  </P> <P> Their head coach, Dan Henning, continues to confuse. Monday, he was guilty on  three different fronts.  </P> <P> Their special-teams coach momentarily lost his cool. And a player they waived  Saturday practiced with them the day after their 40-14 season-opening loss to  the Raiders. He was unsigned when he did so. As if that wasn't enough, Jim  McMahon, the quarterback who was supposed to turn the franchise around, sounded  healthy but unhappy, upon reflection, when asked about Henning's decision to  remove him in the third quarter Sunday.  </P> <P> Asked Monday why he came out of the game, McMahon said, "Because the coach made  the decision."  </P> <P> Asked upon what that decision was based, McMahon said, "I don't know. He's the  coach."  </P> <P> Asked for his opinion of Henning's decision, McMahon said, "I'm very  unopinionated."  </P> <P> McMahon, who completed seven of 18 passes for 91 yards but no touchdowns, also  said his ribs were still sore but he expected to be able to play next Sunday in  the Chargers' home opener against Houston. Henning said McMahon would start.  </P> <P> But Henning also said Darryl Usher, the wide receiver he waived Saturday,  didn't practice Monday. Usher said he did.  </P> <P> "As far as I know, I'm part of the team," Usher said. "But I'm still talking  with my agent."  </P> <P> Later in the day, the Chargers decided to sign Usher. The player who will  probably be released to make room for him is defensive end Gerald Robinson.  </P> <P> Henning also said cornerback Sam Seale, burned badly against the Raiders, had a  leg injury. Seale said he was fine.  </P> <P> And, Henning said, the Chargers' substitutions at center against the Raiders  were spontaneous and not "orchestrated." Which was one more explanation that  flew in the face of information from one of his players. After the loss, rookie  center Courtney Hall said the coaches had told him before the game he would  play the first half and the fourth period against the Raiders.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive week, Henning said he will close practice to the  media. Prior to last week, no Charger coach had ever closed practices for a  full week.  </P> <P> Special teams coach Joe Madden got downright testy when quizzed about the high  number of breakdowns by his players Sunday and said he would make "whatever  changes necessary" to remedy the situation.  </P> <P> But he wouldn't get specific. Henning said the Chargers would look at two free  agent punters today because Lewis Colbert averaged 34.3 yards on six punts and  didn't always kick the ball where he was ordered to kick it.  </P> <P> Last year, wide receivers Jamie Holland and Anthony Miller were second and  third in AFC kick returns. Miller is no longer returning kicks. Asked why,  Henning said, "Because the other two are in there."  </P> <P> He was referring to Holland and rookie Victor Floyd. Floyd mishandled one  kickoff against the Raiders and compounded his error by running backwards into  the end zone, where he was tackled for a safety.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, rookie Dana Brinson, the Chargers' leading punt returner in the  exhibition season, is still waiting for an explanation of why he isn't  returning punts anymore. He has been replaced by rookie Wayne Walker, who erred  by fielding a punt inside the 10 against the Raiders.  </P> <P> "It was never clear to me why they stopped using me on punt returns," Brinson  said. "They haven't said anything, but probably tomorrow . . . you never know."  </P> <P> Somehow the subject kept coming back to McMahon. And the explanations kept  changing.  </P> <P> What is known is this: Early in the third period, McMahon directed a touchdown  drive that ended in a one-yard run by Marion Butts. It cut the Raider lead to  28-14. But on the play before the touchdown, McMahon bruised the area around  his ribs on a three-yard keeper.  </P> <P> On the next Charger possession, Walker's poor decision on the punt return and a  three-yard penalty backed the Chargers to their three. Henning inserted David  Archer for McMahon.  </P> <P> From here it starts getting fuzzy.  </P> <P> After the game, Henning said he wanted to get McMahon "out of the line of  fire." But Archer said McMahon was the one who asked out.  </P> <P> Monday, Henning said the poor field position factored into his decision to  remove McMahon. Henning also said he would have put McMahon back in the game if  the Chargers had pulled to within seven points.  </P> <P> By the end of the day, Henning found himself answering questions about whether  or not he had "given up" by replacing McMahon, whom team doctors had cleared to  go back in the game.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it made a great deal of difference at that point," Henning said  of the switch. "Jim had gotten jolted on the previous series. Field position is  why I decided to finally go with David."  </P> <P> When did Henning think the Chargers were out of the game?  </P> <P> "When I started to substitute defensive players in the final three minutes," he  said. By then the Chargers trailed, 40-14.  </P> <P> "I don't think he (Henning) gave up," Charger rookie Burt Grossman said. "I was  under the impression he (McMahon) got hurt."  </P> <P> Charger tackle Brett Miller said, "People are always going to second-guess. I  personally don't think there's anybody out there with the experience or  knowledge to second-guess Dan Henning."  </P> <P> Said defensive end Leslie O'Neal: "The coach has his reasons. I doubt he gave  up."  </P></p>

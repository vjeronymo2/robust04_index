			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Political fears hit Italian currency The lira fell to a new low against the D-Mark yesterday, as confidence in the Italian currency was shaken by concerns about the country's public finances and increasing political instability. There was uncertainty about the outcome of the Milan magistrates' interrogation, due today, of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, in an atmosphere of heightened tension between government and judiciary. The questioning concerns the alleged payment of bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, while Mr Berlusconi was running his Fininvest business empire. Mr Berlusconi said last night he was convinced the questioning would establish his innocence and that he had no intention of resigning. Financial markets were also concerned that the weak and divided rightwing coalition was increasingly unlikely to pass a convincing 1995 budget through parliament. The International Monetary Fund, which last week concluded a routine review, is understood to have reached the same conclusion. The lira fell to L1,040 against the D-Mark, from a midday Bank of Italy fixing of L1,036, and L1,032 on Friday. Share prices on the Milan bourse fell more than 3 per cent and Italian government bonds also weakened. In recent days, government ministers have admitted that the 1995 budget objectives have been rendered impossible by higher than expected interest rates and unforeseen costs. But the government's calculations have also been undermined by removing pensions reform measures from the budget to head off a general strike. The coalition has failed to hold together on pensions and last week the populist Northern League pushed through further amendments which will burden the treasury. Parliament is due to approve the 1995 budget by the end of the year. But prominent commentators like Professor Mario Monti, due to become an EU commissioner in January, have warned that immediate corrective measures will be necessary. To keep the public deficit close to the planned 8 per cent of gross domestic product, a minimum of L20,000bn (Pounds 7.8bn) will have to raised, almost certainly through fresh taxes. A new twist in the confrontation between Mr Berlusconi and the judiciary came yesterday with the resignation of Mr Arnaldo Valente, a senior judge heading a division of the Italian appeals court. He resigned in protest at the public criticism directed at him following his ruling that an inquiry by Milan magistrates into corruption in the Guardia di Finanza must be moved to nearby Brescia to avoid a potential miscarriage of justice. The Guardia inquiry centred on a widespread practice of the police receiving bribes from companies in return for benign tax assessments and favourable inspections of balance sheets. When announced on November 30, the decision was seen as an attempt to slow the inquiry, as Brescia lacked the personnel to take on the investigation. The transfer contributed to the resignation last week of Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the country's best known magistrate. Mr Valente claimed he had been victimised by political commentators for a normal judicial decision. But over the weekend, press reports said the judge had a son working in the Guardia di Finanza and that he should not have handled the case.</p>

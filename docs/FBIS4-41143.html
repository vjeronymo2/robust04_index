			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva report under the "Boycott" rubric: </F> "Ivan Rybkin Shouts at Absentees. The Upper Chamber Does Not  Want To, the Lower One Cannot Approve the Budget"]    [Text] At yesterday's plenary meeting Ivan Rybkin, speaker  of the lower chamber, raised his voice to a shout and ordered  that deputies on trips be recalled, the scheduled State Duma  visit to The Hague be canceled, and all deputies except for the  sick come to work by 0900 hours on Friday. The speaker's fury  stemmed from parliament's failure to adopt the 1995 [as  published] federal budget at the third reading. Deputies voted  three times, and in the second vote the budget had every chance  of being approved -- it fell short by only four votes, which  could admittedly have been supplied by the  deputies-cum-government members currently out of town.    Nothing seemed to foreshadow such an outcome. After a fairly  sluggish discussion of the agenda (the deputies did not even  react to an enticing proposal to dismiss Andrey Kozyrev, who  signed the treaty on partnership with NATO yesterday), the State  Duma proceeded to approve the budget it had already given its  second reading. Things were taking their normal course, but  somehow lethargically as if in a slow-motion picture: Budget  Committee Chairman Zadornov had the floor, Deputy Finance  Minister Petrov followed him, a vote was held -- and there you  go, the budget was rejected by a margin of 31 votes. The  deputies voted once again -- another failure. During the break  the factions left for a conference, the State Duma Council met,  and acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin was summoned.  However, his arguments that the Central Bank cannot give credits  and that there will be no money to pay for deliveries to  northern areas, the harvest, and so forth did not convince the  people's representatives -- the budget fell 43 votes short of  approval. It was then that Ivan Rybkin delivered a fiery  diatribe and demanded that those "stuck in the smoking room,  giving interviews, and so forth" be brought back. However, the  only person to respond -- and even he only responded by  telephone -- was Anatoliy Sliva, chairman of local  self-government committee, who said that, though he was sick, he  would come to the Friday meeting to attend the fourth vote on  the budget.    It is doubtful, however, that all deputies will follow  Anatoliy Sliva's noble impulse -- on Friday the next match of  the Russian soccer team at the World Cup will be aired on  television during the daytime.</p>

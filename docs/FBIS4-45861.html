			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(km)"-signed report: "An Order Was Issued To Destroy the </F> Smallpox Virus; However, It Was Probably Never Carried Out"]    [Text] Prague -- Despite the fact that Vladimir Kotlar,  the former senior employee at the research laboratory where the  smallpox virus was tested in the 1970's, claims that he issued  instructions that it be destroyed, another employee at the same  institute has cast doubts on its destruction. According to this  source, who does not wish to be named because he fears a  negative reaction from the public, the virus was not destroyed  out of the sheer indolence of the staff involved in the  research. "The scientific recommendation from the World Health  Organization that supplies of the smallpox virus be destroyed  were ignored by us out of laziness, not out of any evil  intentions," he declared.    The ministerial commission that is now looking into the fate  of the dangerous virus has -- to date -- only Kotlar's statement  at its disposal. He has admitted that, although he ordered the  virus's destruction, he was not personally present for it.  Moreover, according to the findings so far, there are no  records of this.    Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry rejects the possibility that  the smallpox virus was unknowingly preserved in the Czech  Republic until this February, that is, until the entire bank of  viral strains was completely destroyed.    According to some employees from the military institute, a  test tube with this virus could -- of course -- have been  deposited along with the other viruses in a special container  with liquid nitrogen and did not have to be registered in the  official record of the bank of viral strains.    Doctors recorded the last case of smallpox in Czechoslovakia  in 1976 when a Czechoslovak Airlines pilot was diagnosed as  having the disease after he returned from Bombay, India. The  Czechoslovak Health Service stopped inoculating the population  against smallpox in 1980 after the World Health Organization had  ascertained that mankind was no longer at risk from a smallpox  epidemic.</p>

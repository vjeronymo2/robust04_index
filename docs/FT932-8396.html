			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Letter: Transfer role of Tecs to further education Sir, Many of us will endorse the headline to your leader 'Tecs in a tangle' (May 10), but not with your conclusion that the 1,220 directors of Training and Enterprise Councils are 'generally satisfied with the progress'. The report on which you are commenting is not based on the responses of the 1,220 members, but on only 506 of them, or 41 per cent. Furthermore, only 17 per cent of the directors were very satisfied with overall progress, compared with 26 per cent in last year's survey. While last year 7 per cent thought progress was very unsatisfactory, that figure has increased to 10 per cent. We should not be surprised that over the four years since the launch of Tecs their goals have become diffused, the problems of training and retraining more urgent and the climate for enterprise colder. The temptation is yet another repackaged initiative and Mr Heseltine, the trade secretary, with his one-stop shops, has fallen for that temptation. The most urgent need is for technical and vocational education. In the years concurrent with the Tecs' confused, faltering steps, the capacity of our further education colleges, with their more dedicated and motivated staffs, has transformed what was once called 'that neglected sector'. I believe, having in the last 10 years served both as the chairman of an enterprise trust and as the chairman of governors of colleges of further education, that the latter, directed by professionals, assisted now by dedicated nominees from the private sector, can provide the vehicle most likely to deliver what the economy requires. I urge perhaps not vainly - for the government is constantly tinkering with its training initiatives - that the Tecs be closed down. Their training role should be put where it belongs, in the further education sector, the (lesser) enterprise role into the one-stop shops. As an additional benefit some of the Pounds 2bn Tec budget would be saved. Ansel Harris, 23 Ferncroft Avenue, Hampstead London NW3 7PG</p>

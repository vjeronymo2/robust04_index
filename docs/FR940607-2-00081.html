Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filling with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule filing is to amend various Exchange Rules which, collectively, define members' rights and obligations more precisely and give the Exchange more flexibility and protection in dealing with violations of Exchange Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, with respect to short sales, currently if a member enters into a contract to sell stock, as a general matter he must believe at that time that he will be able to perform. If he has no intention of performing ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  delivering stock on settlement date), then entering into the contract is both fraudulent and a violation of just and equitable principles of trade. In furtherance of this, the Exchange's proposed rule requires that prior to effecting a short sale, members make arrangements to borrow the security or obtain other assurances that delivery can be made on settlement date. Consistent with other exchanges' short sale rules, the new rule provides an exception for bona fide market making activities. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  However, in order to use the exception, the burden is on the specialist, market maker or odd-lot dealer to show that the sale was indeed part of bona fide market making activities. In addition, as a monitoring tool, the new short sale rule requires a specialist, market maker or odd-lot dealer to notify the Exchange whenever he accumulates a position (long or short) in a security that is greater than or equal to 5% of the outstanding public float of the security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, e.g., New York Stock Exchange Rule 440C.10, Interpretation 01 (Short Sales). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange also proposes to add new rules under Article VII to give the President of the Exchange greater flexibility and a greater ability to take summary action against a member if the President has reasonable grounds to believe that the member is in violation of, and will continue to violate Exchange Rules. This expands the President's ability to take summary action, which currently applies primarily to situations where the member has financial or operational difficulties. Under the proposed rules, the summary action could include a suspension, or a limitation on the member's activities or a limitation on the member's access to Exchange services. Because of the summary nature of the action that will be permitted by the proposed rules, the Exchange's proposed rules also contain provisions for an expedited appeal, requiring, among other things, that the appeal be heard within ten (10) days. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule provides that the President, within two business days of taking summary action, furnish the member with a written statement setting forth the reasons and specific grounds that constitute the basis for the action. The proposed rule also provides that the member affected may make a request for an appeal by filing a written notice of appeal with the Secretary of the Exchange within five days after notification of the President's action. Appeals filed under the proposed rule must be considered and decided by a panel appointed by the Board, composed of three members of the Board, within ten days. After consideration of the appeal, the panel, by majority vote, affirms, reverses, or modifies the action upon which the appeal was made. All decisions of the panel are final. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

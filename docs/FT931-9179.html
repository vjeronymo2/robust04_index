			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Shanghai sees new company 'every 11 minutes' IN Shanghai, China's most populous city and home to a remarkable economic boom, a new company is being established every 11 minutes, according to local press reports. Beijing is also a hive of new activity with an average of 106 companies being registered each day in 1992, the Beijing Daily reports. These registrations are mainly for small home-grown enterprises with limited foreign involvement, but the figures reveal, nevertheless, an astonishing overall trend. In 1992, according to official statistics, foreign investment in China quadrupled. The number of new foreign investment projects last year exceeded 40,000, equivalent to the total of the previous 13 years. The contracted value in 1992 of newly approved foreign direct investment was Dollars 57.51bn (Pounds 40bn), up 380 per cent on 1991. The realised amount of foreign investment was Dollars 11.16bn, up 160 per cent, with Hong Kong supplying about two-thirds of the funds. Chinese investment overseas also increased last year. Some 2,500 enterprises were set up in more than 120 countries with Chinese investment of Dollars 1.94bn. According to a World Bank report, Reform and the role of the Plan in the 1990s, China is the 'destination for about 15 per cent of all direct foreign investment in low and middle-income countries, and is exceeded in Asia only by Singapore'. Fixed asset investment grew by about 30 per cent in China in 1992.</p>

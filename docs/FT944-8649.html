			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Daihatsu Motor up strongly to Y2bn Daihatsu Motor, Japan's second biggest manufacturer of minicars, posted a 280 per cent rise in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax  -for the first half of the current fiscal year. It attributed the surge to a cost-cutting drive, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Daihatsu, owned 16 per cent by Toyota Motor, announced a recurring profit of Y2.09bn (Dollars 21.2m) to end-September, compared with Y551m a year earlier. The profit jump marked the second straight year-on-year gain for Daihatsu, and was achieved in spite of a dip in sales to Y345.02bn from Y362.87bn a year ago. Daihatsu's operating profit rose by Y1.26bn. The company described this as the difference between a Y5.6bn loss due to poor sales and a saving of Y6.8bn through cost-cutting measures. Domestic sales fell 1.1 per cent from a year earlier to 182,620 vehicles in the first half, with demand subdued ahead of the launch of a completely remodelled Mira - Daihatsu's mainstay model - in September. Exports fell 50.1 per cent to 44,383 as shipments of assembled cars to China were replaced by exports of car components. Daihatsu raised its forecast of recurring profit to Y5bn in the full year from an earlier Y4bn.</p>

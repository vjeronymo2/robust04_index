			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Rights issue by Conti seen as turning point in Pirelli saga THE BATTLE of wills between Pirelli and Continental may reach a turning point following Continental's decision yesterday to propose a DM150m (Dollars 90m) rights issue. Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, still owns 5 per cent of Continental's shares and has call options over 34 per cent more after last year's unsuccessful takeover attempt. Senior executives at Pirelli, which is headed by Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, said they were waiting to see the terms of Continental's proposed capital increase before deciding their own strategy. The German company's plan must be approved by shareholders on July 3 before going ahead. A top executive said Pirelli did not consider the move, which has been rumoured for some time, as hostile. Relations between the two companies 'were neither positive nor negative' at present. 'I don't think it's against us,' he said. Analysts have suggested that Continental's capital increase may be part of a plan to buy some of Pirelli's businesses which are now for sale. Continental is believed to be particularly interested in Pirelli's Munich-based Metzeler auto components arm. Using cash from a rights issue - part of it possibly coming from Pirelli itself - for the purchase would be a neat turning of the tables for Continental. In September 1990 it faced a takeover proposal by Pirelli which appeared to require it to issue large amounts of debt to finance Pirelli's own plans. Whatever the outcome of the capital increase, both companies are now concentrating on restructuring. Announcing audited net losses of L729bn (Dollars 586m) last year, or L622bn after minority interests, Pirelli said its tyre activities had broken even so far this year. The improvement came largely thanks to heavy cost cutting, which involved the loss of 6,000 jobs and closure of a number of factories. However, the Pirelli executive said earnings had also been helped by 'some slight improvement' in tyre prices. After three years of vicious price wars between manufacturers, 'we've reached a bottom from which we can start to rise', he noted. The company hopes that further cost-saving will return the tyres business to profit in 1992. Pirelli is also advancing with the disposal of its diversified products division, which accounts for around 17 per cent of turnover. Negotiations on selling four of the seven 'business units' into which the division has been split are reaching a second, conclusive, phase. The four business units, which together have turnover of L1,200bn, produce anti-vibration systems, automobile profiles, hoses and assemblies, and power transmissions. Numerous offers had been received for all the businesses by the end-April closing date, and Pirelli executives are now sifting through the bids. The offers will be reduced to a maximum of four for each business unit. Those selected will then be given access to detailed financial information, and be permitted factory visits. All the offers have included indicative prices. However, the Pirelli executive said it would still be some time before the first deal was announced, as the selection would be complex and further clarification was necessary in some cases.</p>

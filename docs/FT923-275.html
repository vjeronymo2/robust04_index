			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Letter: Insider dealing law shows the strain Sir, Robert Peston's article ('Tougher legislation on insider dealing planned', September 9) was fascinating. I always suspected that Treasury officials had different thought processes from mine and now I have proof. According to the official: 'If someone discovered that a company had closed down and then sold the shares of that company's competitor, that would be insider trading.' To me that response would be foolish. My reaction would have been to sell short the company that had closed down and buy shares of the competitor and I would define both of these actions as insider trading. However, I admit that I am a classic outsider, as I live in Toronto and resigned as a director in the 1970s, therefore the official may classify my trading as 'outsider trading'. I hope I am mistaken, as if I am not, there must be a lot of muddled thinking going on in official circles. That does not augur well for making an intelligible tough new law to act on insider dealing, especially in a market where insider dealing has been the normal business practice for centuries.

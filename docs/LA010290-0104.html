			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEATHS;  </P> <P> NEW ROMANIAN OFFICIAL DIES  </P> <P> Romania's new deputy foreign minister has died of a stroke, a government member  said today. He was 68.  </P> <P> Corneliu Bogdan died late Monday, said Sergiu Nicolaescu, a film director and  member of the National Salvation Front leadership that has sought to run the  country since the hated dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was deposed.  </P> <P> Bogdan served as Romanian ambassador to the United States from 1969 through  1977. He returned to Bucharest and was out of government for a time but later  was named to a post in the Foreign Ministry that gave him authority over  Western Hemisphere relations. Bogdan's stepdaughter, Svetlana Hoge, said there  was friction between her father and the government of Ceausescu and that he  again left the ministry and was placed under what amounted to house arrest. She  said he was allowed to travel to Washington in 1988 on a Woodrow Wilson  Fellowship and that he remained in the United States until a month ago.  </P></p>

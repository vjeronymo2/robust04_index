			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Record number to stand for Euro-elections A record total of 552 candidates will stand in the UK constituencies for the European parliament. The Greens and the three main parties are to fight all the constituencies in Great Britain. However, candidates of the Natural Law party, which represents followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, are standing in every UK constituency - making the party the first to fight every seat, either for Europe or Westminster. The Tories have just one candidate in Northern Ireland where three MEPs are elected by proportional representation. Boundary changes have created six more UK seats and left only 17 of the present seats in England and Wales unchanged. The eight in Scotland and three in Northern Ireland are unaffected. The Scottish National party is fighting all the Scottish seats and Plaid Cymru all five in Wales. The Liberal party, which includes those who chose not to join the Liberal Democrats, has 17 candidates. Well-known names nominated include former health minister Mrs Edwina Currie at Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes. Ms Pauline Green, who leads Labour's European parliament group, is fighting for her marginal London North seat on unchanged boundaries. But Tory leader Sir Christopher Prout has been favoured by alterations leaving him with an apparently safer Herefordshire and Shropshire seat. The election is on June 9, but counting will not start until the night of June 12 when polling ends in all European Union countries.</p>

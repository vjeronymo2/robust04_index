			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: IBM changes marketing tactics International Business Machines is offering potential customers in Europe up to Dollars 150,000 in services to move from competitors' systems, in a sharp departure from the its usual marketing practices. The move, which applies to IBM's mid-range computer families only, is a dramatic change for a company which has always assumed leadership of any market in which it chose to compete. The growing appeal of low-cost, industry standard systems based on common operating software is, however, forcing the giant to reconsider marketing tactics for its AS/400 and ES/9000 mid-range systems, which combine proprietary hardware and software. IBM worldwide has returned to profitability after losing money for three years as customers turned away from proprietary systems. Europe, however, remains a black spot. IBM has set up a competitive marketing unit headed by Mr Erwin Staudt, formerly with IBM Germany, to develop and implement marketing strategies to win customers from its competitors. A campaign to run until the end of June 1995 promises customers moving from competitors' equipment to IBM up to Dollars 150,000 of 'specialised transition support' to assist in the transfer. 'We are so sure about the success of this campaign that we will allow customers to return systems newly leased from IBM six months after installation without further obligation,' Mr Staudt said. Dr Jane Doorly, computer analyst with the market consultancy Dataquest, said it was a dramatic change for IBM. It could, however, be seen either as a mark of returning confidence or as an indication of desperation.</p>

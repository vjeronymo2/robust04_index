			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The civil war in Yemen: According to  the North Yemenis, Aden -- the southern economic capital -- is  about to fall into their hands. They claim that there is fierce  fighting around the gates of the town; in any case Sanaa's  military supremacy has been confirmed today by French military  sources based in Djibouti. They said that the situation was  turning to the advantage of the northern forces. A general  mobilization was decreed in Aden today.    There have been more evacuations of foreigners today, both  in  the north and south. There were three simultaneous operations.  [passage omitted]    Pierre-Xavier (Colinet), the commander of the Jules Verne,  was interviewed by our colleagues from France Inter:    [Begin (Colinet) recording] At the moment I am a few  kilometers south of Aden. I have just picked up nationals  belonging to a number of countries. There are 288 people --  men, women, and children -- who were picked by the Edic, a small  tank landing craft which is very suitable for this kind of  operation. They were picked up in the port of Aden. This was  overseen by the consul. I am taking them on to the Jules Verne,  which is a large ship, to give them food and beds, and I expect  to take them to Djibouti.    At the same time as the Edic and its crew, there was a squad  of naval commandos on board, accompanied by some other commandos  [sentence as heard].    According to the people on the quay, there are no visible  traces of fighting. But we did see a certain amount of shooting  in the distance, especially from the area of the airport, which  is to the east of the place where the people are embarking. [end  recording]    [Announcer] Let me add that Pierre-Xavier (Colinet), the  commander of the Jules Verne, said that another round trip by  the ship is planned for tomorrow: There are still 30 French  people to be evacuated from Aden.    In the east, in al-Mukalla, 80 foreigners were being  evacuated by French ships today. The UN World Food Program has  sent a plane to North Yemen, to Sanaa to repatriate its staff.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The South Korean Navy is to join RIMPAC '94, a  five-nation joint naval exercise scheduled for May 26 to July 16  in the western and central Pacific, the Defense Ministry  announced yesterday.    Two Korean frigates are to join the 52-day joint naval  maneuvers, in which over 60 warships including two U.S. carrier  battle groups, 200 aircraft and 25,000 officers and sailors from  the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan are participate.    RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific) drill, which began in 1971 under  the initiative of the U.S. Navy, is intended to secure the  safety of sea routes in the Pacific and enhance the joint  operational capability among navies of Pacific-rim countries.    The drill is held once every two years and the South Korean  Navy began to participate in 1990. In RIMPAC '92, the Korean  unit was awarded the Top Gun award thanks to its excellent naval  gunfire.    The joint naval maneuvers have nothing to do with the  international political situation including the impasse over the  North Korean nuclear program, said a Defense Ministry spokesman.</p>

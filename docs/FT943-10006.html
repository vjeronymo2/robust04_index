			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / People: Prime of life at Premier Oil / Roland Shaw on financial muscle, life - and his future The removers will be hard at work in Belgravia this week clearing out 25 years of detritus from the office of Roland Shaw, the freshly ousted chairman of Premier Consolidated Oilfields. Out will go the yellowing maps of oil pipelines, the photographs of the bulky ex-occupant shaking hands to clinch a deal, the boxes full of his angry correspondence with newspapers, the model of his great dane. The man himself left hastily last week, having been given a week to leave by the board. His belongings have been allowed an extra fortnight to vacate the building behind Victoria station they have occupied for so long. Among the memorabilia is a folder of letters received last week from fellow oil men lamenting the end of an era. Roland Shaw was always in a class of his own. Bigger, noisier, and brasher than everyone else, he stood out from the start in an industry composed of faceless individuals from the oil majors or bankers and accountants that used to run the oil independents. When he arrived in what he calls 'London comma England' from Dallas in the 1960s he fitted the stereotype of what an oil magnate ought to be. Shaw may have started life as a diplomat, but by the time he gravitated to the oil industry he was a loud-mouthed deal maker, with a whisky glass always to hand. On Shaw's last full day in the office, he sat behind his big desk quite his usual self. 'Come before lunch. I'll make more sense then,' he had promised. He greeted me with his normal reprimand about my supposedly misleading reporting in the Financial Times, and then waved a sheaf of yellow paper on which he had written down all the important points he wished to get across during the interview. He made it clear that he had been kicked out, yet for someone who has never minced a word in his life, was uncharacteristically short on explanation. Equally unspecific, Charles Jamieson, the chief executive, later talked in cliches about there 'coming a time when everyone feels it is time to move on'. What he meant, but was too gentlemanly to say, was that there comes a time when companies have to get rid of their domineering founders. The first break was in 1992 when the board stripped Shaw of his executive position. The new non-executive role suited neither him nor his colleagues: the man who had built up the company almost from scratch to a company that at the peak of the oil market was worth Pounds 500m, could not resist interfering. 'The thought of Roland Shaw as a non-executive was always a joke,' says a former colleague. 'He is one of those impossible characters in terms of having his own way. If you don't agree with him he threatens to take his ball home'. Shaw admits the arrangement did not work: 'I haven't found it easy over the last couple of years to sit back. I have kept the board advised over my views, but different people have different concepts of how it should be run, and the board asked me to step down.' Age was one reason for his departure. The City is increasingly opposed to senior citizens on the board, and was quite unmoved by Shaw's cheeky protests that at 72 he was nearly 20 years younger than the great Armand Hammer when he stepped aside as chief executive at Occidental. 'I don't like this ageism,' he says. 'I was 62 when I bought the stake in Wytch Farm (Britain's biggest onshore oilfield). I was 64 when I bought the Burmah stake. If you had knocked me out at 60 the company would still be worth Pounds 20m'. Even those people who found Shaw intolerable as a boss, agree that the company was built on his irresistable charm, and iron will. Premier has barely ever discovered any of the blackstuff itself, but had grown through the determination and shrewd dealmaking of its boss. According to Julian West, head of corporate development at Enterprise Oil, Shaw made the company by 'insisting there should be one'. It is his personality to which Premier owes its independence. When fellow independent Carless Capel Leonard bid for the company in 1984, shareholders decided overwhelmingly to stay with Shaw, and the company has been more or less left alone ever since. But in the past six years - since the fall in the oil price - there has been less place for the original oil man. Shaw still believes that the role of an exploration and production company is to live on its wits, getting licences and doing deals. But the market no longer agrees; indeed the few smaller independents that thrived recently have been financial vehicles rather than real oil companies of Shaw's variety. Shaw's individuality makes him a disaster as a corporate man. He speaks with longing of the early days when 'you didn't have to worry about gobbledegook of large companies'. With him gone, it can only be a matter of time before Premier hires its first 'human resources officer'  - Shaw can hardly bring himself to say the words - or starts a house magazine. Turning to his list of serious beefs, Shaw's first target was the City, and its tendency to look at independent oil companies as if they were building societies. 'People in the City are like children,' he says. 'They have a seven-year memory. When something goes wrong they flex their muscles and take a decision. After a while the muscles go flabby and they forget'. He handed me a copy of a recent speech given to oil analysts entitled: 'How with a little bit of help, I lost Pounds 350m in the Independent Oil Game'. It was vintage Shaw - an uproarious account of Premier's worst moments. 'When the whore-house burns down the pretty ones run out with the ugly,' was how Shaw explained that a precipitous plunge in the share price over the past few years was not unique to Premier. The analysts - whom Shaw dismissively describes as 'very young and have been to business school' - took notes throughout, mindlessly writing down even a bawdy joke about the refurbished urinals at the Garrick club. Shaw bemoans the new homogeneity of business and City folk. The problem, he says, is all the 'institutions, rules and regulations which are clogging the veins'. In particular he thinks the new corporate governance rules are a waste of time: 'Clever crooks will still run away with the money no matter what'. The business world has probably not heard the last of Roland Shaw, and neither have the Premier management. 'I am free to do other things.' Shaw remains chairman of Heritage Oil and Gas. 'I am also going to take a good look to see if there is anything to do to help other shareholders in this company.' Was that a veiled threat? He says no. It was 'a sincere indication that I have a large stake, and if I have any bright thoughts I will pass them on'. This was Roland Shaw talking big. He tirelessly refers to his millions of Premier shares and share options, but he does not mention that these amount to barely 1 per cent of the company. With his Premier days over, Shaw will have all the more time to get angry about what he reads in the papers. He claims he is not as irascible as he used to be. But the day when Roland Shaw stands up in public heartily approving of some new trend, then an era really will have come to an end.</p>

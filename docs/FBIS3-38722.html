The meeting was held in  camera. The foreign ministers of the three countries held a  joint news conference at the end of the meeting. A joint  communique on the tripartite consultative meeting has been  issued.    In a statement at the news conference, Cetin said that the  tripartite meeting in no way aims to interfere in the domestic  affairs of any country, adding that it aims to contribute to  regional peace and security. He noted that regional  developments and especially developments in Iraq were reviewed  at the meeting and views were exchanged on issues that might  threaten regional peace and stability. Cetin said that he  shares similar views with the Syrian and Iranian foreign  ministers on the issue of Iraq's territorial integrity, adding  that developments contrary to this principle will bring new  problems to the region as well as the world. Pointing out that  the stand adopted by the three countries against terrorism was  confirmed at the meeting, Cetin recalled that an agreement has  been reached especially with Syria at the highest level and  continued:    [Begin Cetin recording] We believe that developing our  relations in all fields with Syria will not only be in the  interests of the two countries and the two peoples, but will  also contribute to regional peace and stability. There is close  cooperation between the security organizations of the two  countries. This cooperation is gradually increasing. We have  agreed that the differences of views or conflicting information  that might arise from time to time will be taken up at that  level and resolved. We have reassessed these issues at this  meeting with Syrian Foreign Affairs Minister Faruq al-Shar'.  We also share the view that the terror issue should definitely  be solved and that our cooperation should continue and be  increased in the knowledge that Turkey, Syria, Iran, and other  regional countries have, at times, suffered as a result of  terror. [end recording]    Cetin concluded by saying that the three foreign ministers  will more closely follow the regional developments through  immediate and direct contacts and consultations. [passage  omitted]    Also addressing the news conference, Iranian Foreign Affairs  Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati expressed the view that the meeting  would yield concrete and positive results. He noted that they  strongly support Iraq's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  [passage omitted]    Velayati and al-Shar' later left Turkey. They were seen off  by Cetin at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport.</p>

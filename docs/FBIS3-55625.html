The usual methods are being employed to see  who can inflict the worst bite. An official spokesman for the  Moldovan president has issued a statement on the election  campaign, in the course of which M. Snegur's is being bandied  about in a variety of contexts and for a variety of reasons.  Opposition political forces are accusing him, in particular, of  not failing to give international publicity to the conflict in  the Dniester region and of bringing about economic disaster in  the republic. The president rejected all these charges as  absurd and unsubstantiated. Snegur promised to issue a  statement in the very near future "in response to irresponsible  accusations by those who have turned patriotism into a trade"  and to name those who are really to blame for the bloody  conflict on the Dniester. Snegur once again peremptorily  brushed aside suspicion of being involved in affairs connected  with a branch of the Seabeco firm, which is headed by his  son-in-law. Finally, he expressed confidence that the people  will make their choice and thereby dot all the "i's."</p>

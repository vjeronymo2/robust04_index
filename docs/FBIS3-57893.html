			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Developments in the Balkans have been  the subject of reporting and commentary in the Greek press.  <H5>  U.S. Role in Balkans Favored </H5>   In the 12 December Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, Nikos  Marakis reports on the views of the Greek Government and the  opposition regarding the role the United States and the European  Union (EU) should play in the Balkans. In a departure from past  policy, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou now believes that  Greek interests in the Balkans and elsewhere are served "almost  exclusively" by a complete harmonization of Greek and U.S.  foreign policy. This view, Marakis says, is shared by Minister  of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and Minister of Defense  Yerasimos Arsenis.    Marakis also writes about the discussion of the issue within  the opposition New Democracy (ND). Party luminary Andreas  Andrianopoulos believes that Washington, to establish "control"  over the southern Balkans, will promote the establishment of a  new Yugoslav federation under Serbian hegemony including the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). According to  Marakis, Andrianopoulos worries that aligning Greek policy too  closely with that of the United States might involve the country  in a potentially "explosive" contest for influence in the  Balkans, pitting France and Germany against the United States.  Another ND luminary, Yeoryios Souflias, argues that Greece  should follow its natural pro-European orientation and  simultaneously maintain good relations with the United States,  Marakis writes.    A contrasting view is held by ND official and former  Minister  of Defense Ioannis Varvitsiotis who, according to Marakis,  believes that the U.S. reaction to former Prime Minister  Konstandinos Mitsotakis' Balkans policy was so negative that  Washington succeeded in engineering the fall of the Mitsotakis  government. Varvitsiotis represents an "anti-Atlantic" faction  in the ND which includes almost all Eurodeputies and deputies  from areas favored by EU grants, Marakis writes.  <H5>  FYROM Recognition by European Countries Viewed </H5>   The decision by six European countries to establish  diplomatic relations with the FYROM stems from their disdain for  Greek demands, Thodhoros Rousopoulos writes in the 19 December  Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Even Sweden and Finland,  whose application for European Union membership will be reviewed  during the Greek EU presidency, were part of this initiative.  While a Greek veto on membership is unlikely, Rousopoulos cites  Ministry of Foreign Affairs sources as saying that Greece may  use delaying tactics to postpone entry of these countries in the  EU. According to Rousopoulos, however, Greece lacks leverage in  the EU, and other member countries are likely to grant  diplomatic recognition to the FYROM.  <H5>  `Macedonian Struggle' Lost </H5>   Rikhardhos Someritis writes in the 5 December TO VIMA TIS  KIRIAKIS that Greece has now lost the "Macedonian struggle."  Even should the FYROM disintegrate from internal pressures, as  some Greeks hope, the result would be a resort to extremist  organizations even more dangerous to Greece and to peace in the  Balkans, Someritis believes. Probable integration of FYROM  territory by Bulgaria, Serbia, or Albania would add to regional  instability. The Greek Government should focus on the huge  costs of prolonged "Skopje-mania," Someritis warns, noting the  courageous policy of reconciliation adopted by South Africa,  Israel and the PLO, and others. Dialogue and honest compromise  can never be considered "treason," Someritis concludes.  <H5>  Greek Economic Relations With FYROM </H5>   Stavros Tzimas reports on economic relations between Greece  and the FYROM in the 16 December Athens daily TA NEA. A large  quantity of goods such as aluminum sheeting, mineral ore,  phosphates, lumber, wheat, and oil transit the Greek port of  Salonica on the way to Skopje, and about 100 Greek companies  have been established in the FYROM. Many have ceased operations  due to the political crisis, but some Greek firms continue their  activities, Tzimas reports. About a dozen jointly-owned or  Greek-owned firms are located in the Monastir area and a Greek  entrepreneur is the majority shareholder of a private bank that  recently opened in that city. A large Greek clothing company and  an export-import firm are presently active in Skopje, while a  food-packaging company is said to be ready to start operations  again as soon as the crisis ends.  <H5>  Poll on FYROM </H5>   A brief article in the 19 December TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS  reports the results of an opinion poll on the "Skopje problem"  conducted by the MRB organization in Athens and Salonica between  2 and 12 December with 1,OOO respondents. Opinions were about  evenly divided between those (4O.1 percent) who said that the  situation has taken a "negative turn" for Greece since the  October elections won by PASOK, and those (42.8 percent) who  said that it has remained "unchanged."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] NEW DELHI, 8 April--The Russian Federation is of the  view that the American offer of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan in  return for a "verifiable" capping of the latter's fissile  material production programme could unleash an arms race in  South Asia.    This was stated at a Press conference here today by Mr.  Aleksandr Panov, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia. He said  Moscow favours international guarantees rather than "trade-offs"  of the nature being attempted by Washington to promote its  non-proliferation objectives.    That the U.S. has offered to Islamabad a one-time waiver of  the Pressler Law to facilitate the supply of the  deep-penetration jets, was confirmed by Mr. Strobe Talbott, the  U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, before leaving for the Pakistani  capital this afternoon following discussions in New Delhi.  Asked whether the American proposal made any sense to him, Mr.  Panov, who is leading his country's delegation at the ongoing  50th session of ESCAP, quipped "It makes sense for the U.S.  industry which is manufacturing the F-16 aircraft. The Russian  Minister's observations clearly indicated that Moscow's support  can no longer be taken for granted by Washington on crucial  international issues. Mr. Panov said though the U.S. was  contemplating similar trade-offs in the Korean Peninsula, the  resolution of the nuclear imbroglio there wouldn't be possible  without the involvement of the Russian Federation. "Our highest  priority is to strengthen the non-proliferation regimes," he  observed to add: "We are for international guarantees..."    The Minister remarked that in cases where the treaty (NPT)  or  regime was already in place, the emphasis should be on its  compliance. As for South Asia, he suggested that an  international conference with broad participation could be  convened. Various CBMs (Confidence Building Measures) and  procedures for transparency in military activities could also be  discussed under its umbrella besides non-proliferation.    "Your country stands for broader participation (in such a  conference). We support that," the Minister noted. He said the  exact number of participants at the conference can be determined  once there was agreement in principle to hold it. Commenting on  the U.S. proposal listing Germany, Japan, India and Pakistan  besides the five permanent members of the UN Security Council,  Mr. Panov mentioned that Kazakhstan has also evinced interest  and would like to be part of the exercise.    The efforts by the U.S. and the IAEA [International Atomic  Energy Agency] to resolve bilaterally the nuclear problem in the  Korean peninsula haven't shown results, the Minister said. He  offered as an option a multilateral conference with  representatives of the UN and the IAEA.    Mr. Panov disclosed that it has been agreed in principle  that  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao would visit Moscow in June,  possibly mid-June, though the exact dates were yet to be  finalised. Discussions are currently underway on the "substance"  of the visit and agreements to be signed.    Various possibilities to enhance militancy [as published]  cooperation between India and Russia were being explored. One  among them was the supply of MiG 29 aircraft though the parleys  are at the initial stage, Mr. Panov informed. He said  agreements on aviation transportation and cooperation in "Space  Development" were likely during Mr. Rao's visit.    Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev's visit to India  that was postponed due to sudden developments in West Asia, was  very much on the Indo-Russian agenda and could take place after  Mr. Rao has been to Moscow.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: NOW WAIT A MINUTE, MERRIL: WHAT ABOUT PLANTING POTATOES?  </P> <P> They had a Merril Hoge Day in Pocatello, Ida., to celebrate the exploits of the  former Idaho State running back who ran wild for the Pittsburgh Steelers in the  NFL playoffs. Even the governor showed up.  </P> <P> The whole thing was such a success, they decided to do it again, holding  another Merril Hoge Day.  </P> <P> Says Hoge: "We don't have a whole lot to do in Idaho, except ride snowmobiles  and tackle buffalo."  </P> <P> Armageddon: Miami Coach Ron Rothstein, on the last visit of Rony Seikaly and  the Heat to Detroit: "The Pistons were very hospitable to Rony. They welcomed  him with open arms and closed arms and forearms."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What college football team has produced three members of the Pro  Football Hall of Fame?  </P> <P> Joe knows basketball: From Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Press: "During Norm  Sloan's tenure as basketball coach at North Carolina State, he recruited a  promising guard from Western Pennsylvania but lost him to Notre Dame, which  offered him a football scholarship. Sloan still believes Joe Montana could have  played in the NBA had he not elected to fritter away his life winning Super  Bowls."  </P> <P> Ouch: Philadelphia guard Derek Smith, formerly of Sacramento, had this to say  when asked about the Kings' former coach and president, Bill Russell: "I don't  have a problem with Bill. He treated me the same way he treated everyone else  -- rude, obnoxious and uncaring."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: University of San Francisco, 1951 -- Ollie Matson, Gino  Marchetti and Bob St. Clair. The school's sports information director, Pete  Rozelle, also made it.  </P> <P> Add USF: The Dons, coached by Joe Kuharich, were undefeated in '51 but were  ranked only 14th. None of the players made the consensus All-American team,  although Matson led the nation in rushing and scoring.  </P> <P> Add 1951: Two other running backs who would make the Hall of Fame, Hugh  McElhenny of Washington and Frank Gifford of USC, also failed to make the  consensus All-American team that year. The backfield was composed of Babe  Parilli of Kentucky, Dick Kazmaier of Princeton, Hank Lauricella of Tennessee  and Johnny Karras of Illinois.  </P> <P> Add St. Clair: An offensive tackle standing 6 feet 9, he also played on special  teams for the San Francisco 49ers and one year blocked 10 field goal attempts.  </P> <P> He told Dwight Chapin of the San Francisco Examiner that he always accepted the  salary offers of owner Tony Morabito, but after that season, he said: "I told  Morabito I wanted the same amount of money Leo Nomellini made. Tony said, 'You  already make more money than Leo.' So much for that great strategy."  </P> <P> Quotebook: Central Iowa forward Matt Melvin, on venerable Penn Gymnasium, home  of archrival William Penn: "I love it. It's a cross between Boston Garden and  my garage." HARLEY TINKHAM  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Bosnian Serbs ease blockade on aid convoys United Nations aid convoys yesterday crossed front lines carrying emergency relief for central and eastern Bosnia while Serb leaders called for the lifting of punitive sanctions against Yugoslavia. Serb commanders in eastern Bosnia yesterday finally allowed the passage of three convoys carrying food for the Moslem enclaves of Tuzla, Zepa and Srebrenica, which have been designated UN 'safe areas', said Miss Lyndall Sachs of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). But Serb leaders continued to block the passage of food and winter supplies for another 'safe area', Gorazde, south-eastern Bosnia, as they apparently tried to push forward towards the Moslem enclave. UN military observers yesterday reported heavy Serb artillery fire on the enclave. At the same time, two convoys headed for UNHCR warehouses in Zenica, central Bosnia. Overland convoys were suspended to central Bosnia on October 26 after a Danish lorry driver was killed. The leaders of the three warring parties last week pledged to allow free access for relief. Serb leaders stepped up their campaign for the lifting of UN sanctions, imposed 19 months ago in response to the carve-up of Bosnia. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, called on the UN to suspend sanctions on what remains of Yugoslavia. 'We must not rely only on hints to suspend sanctions. If the international community wishes talks to succeed, it must suspend sanctions now and allow the Serb side to be fully equal in the talks,' reported Tanjug, the official news agency. But remarks by Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday cast doubt on new peace talks with the 12 European Union foreign ministers in Geneva next Monday. The Serbian side would apparently seek a postponement, although he added they would attend if necessary.</p>

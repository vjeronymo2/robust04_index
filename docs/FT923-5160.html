			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: GM plans to invest Dollars 20m in return to Argentina GENERAL MOTORS is to invest more than Dollars 20m in a new plant in Argentina, 13 years after it withdrew from the country. It will invest about Dollars 20m in cash and an unspecified am-ount in industrial equipment for the new facility which is to be set up with an Argentine group. The factory will build commercial vehicles for the local market and for export to Brazil to compensate for rising imports from Brazil where GM has a major presence. GM is joining forces with the local owners of Iveco, the Italian truck company. In Argentina, Fiat holds only 30 per cent of Iveco. GM will set up a joint venture with the wealthy Garfunkel family, which holds the other 70 per cent. Fiat is not expected to put more money into the venture, thus reducing its holding in Iveco. GM's decision follows the announcement last month by Renault, the French state-owned car maker, to withdraw from Argentina by selling a majority stake in its local subsidiary to a group of Argentine and Brazilian investors.</p>

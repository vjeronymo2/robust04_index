			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 74 (564): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] During his stay in Moscow last weekend President  Leonid Kravchuk visited INTERFAX headquarters and answered  questions from our correspondents.    INTERFAX: Ukraine's signing of the CIS treaty of an economic  union was one of the highlights of the Moscow CIS summit. Why  did the Ukrainian leadership choose the status of an associated  member and what practical benefit can Ukraine derive from it?    KRAVCHUK: I think that in this case the difference between  full and associated members is symbolic because the CIS has not  taken final shape yet. The Commonwealth is in the making.  Ukraine's signature under all economic documents of the summit  is another indication of the fact that there is practically no  difference between associated and full members. The point is  that when the Ukrainian parliament discussed the founding  documents of the CIS, it ratified them with certain reservations  which remain in force and being president I could not ignore  them when I signed the treaty. This is the explanation for our  associated status, but it will not prevent us from most active  and full membership in the union in the future.    IF Note: On 15 April after discussing the implementation of  the treaty of the economic union the Moscow summit formed the  commission of the union. An agreement on the gradual formation  of a free trade zone was also signed.    INTERFAX: Some politicians are disappointed with the low  efficiency of the CIS and offer other patterns of integration of  former Soviet republics. What is your attitude to the idea of  the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbaev concerning an  Eurasian union and the calls of the Russian Deputy  Prime-Minister Sergey Shakhray for a confederation of Eurasian  states?    KRAVCHUK: Today the large-scale integration which some  politicians speak of imply the European Union as a model is  beyond our possibilities. It would be naive to think that the  signing of certain decisions automatically leads to the  formation of effective integration mechanisms whether it be the  CIS or the Eurasian union. In order to be effective, conditions  should be formed gradually step by step. We should have  complete clarity: what aims and tasks do we put forward?    It is an open secret that the European Union covered a road  of 35 years before it reached its present form. The CIS is only  a couple of years old and we have not yet managed to build  mechanisms guaranteeing the Commonwealth at least minimal  efficiency. It is not a question of the reluctance of leaders  to resolve the matters, but the absence of objective conditions.    Besides, the transition to other forms of integration should  be civilized. First of all, a team of truly qualified persons  should define all the parameters of such transformation and  later discuss the matter with the public. Look how tolerantly  European countries approach these matters, what respect they  show for the public: they hold referendums and polls. Our  mentality has been different: leaders would get together, sign  papers and consider the matter settled. And we are not  concerned at all about the public response, believing that the  people will later see what is what. Probably, that is not quite  correct.    I do not reject the idea of deepening integration in  principle, but I do not want it to become a subject of hasty  solutions at this moment.    INTERFAX: There is certain anxiety in Russian government  circles about the results of Ukrainian parliamentary elections.  It stems from the victory of opposite political forces in  different parts of your country. What do you think of the  forecasts about the growing disintegration of Ukraine and the  prediction that for the sake of consolidation an attempt might  be made to play the nationalist card using such problems as the  Black Sea Fleet etc.?    KRAVCHUK: The results of our parliamentary elections prompt  the question: consolidation around what or confrontation with  whom? In Russia, by the way, different forces won strong  positions in parliament, but no Russian political circles are  debating the possibility of Russia joining Ukraine. If anyone  raised the matter in your Federal Assembly, the person would  hardly be taken seriously.    We can speak of certain differences between western and  eastern regions over the future of the country whether it should  be independent, with Russia or under Russia. As president I  declare that I want to live in friendship, cooperation and  partnership with Russia. But I do not wish to be under Russia.  Some people accuse me of hypocrisy. I am really convinced that  this form of bilateral relations is the best -- friendship and  partnership.    The acute problems should be resolved so that Ukraine and  Russia would live as good neighbors. I think we have managed to  resolve one of them -- nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine. I  am pleased that the trilateral agreement  (Yeltsin-Clinton-Kravchuk) is beginning to work despite the  difficulties.    The next matter is the Black Sea Fleet. Without going into  details I would want to view the Odessa incident as an example  of fast and constructive settlement of matters related to the  fleet. We should not try to find the right and the wrong side,  but use mechanisms worked out in Yalta, Zavidovo and Massandra.  It is simply necessary to sit down to the negotiating table  guided by good intentions. There can be no other approach.    When the Russian military say they intend to control the  entire fleet and infrastructure and Ukrainians say they will not  give away anything, both sides are unrealistic, they are making  a mistake. Here are a few figures. According to 1992 prices,  the fleet with its infrastructure cost 35 trillion rubles or $35  Bn [billion] according to the then exchange rate. If today  Ukraine accepts the version suggested by the Russian military,  Russia must immediately pay Ukraine $14 Bn. Can Russia afford  that?    Therefore one should not kick up a racket. The problem  should be resolved gradually on a realistic basis avoiding  slogans. First, the fleet should be separated, divided because  if there are two commanders "in one kitchen," they are bound to  argue. The experience of relations between fleet commanders and  the commanders of the Ukrainian navy has proved that.    At the next stage the matter of the Russian naval base  should  be resolved in keeping with international principles. In this  case we mean Sevastopol. But that is too little for your  military. They are pressuring the political leadership and the  leadership is procrastinating the solution of the problem. When  your military say, that in addition to Sevastopol Feodosia,  Odessa, Izmail, Nikolayev and all airfields should be considered  the naval base, I ask them: "Are you serious?" Twelve Russian  naval bases in Ukraine! That is impossible. The matter belongs  to parliament.    Several times already Ukraine has expressed its agreement to  sell Russia part of the fleet and I have not given up these  intentions. But first we should have a chance to see the  documents and find out what costs what. I have the right to  know that I am giving away.    INTERFAX: One gets the impression that you can effectively  cooperate with Boris Yeltsin on the acutest matters, like in  Massandra on the fleet problem, but later these concrete  decisions of the presidents are not carried out.    KRAVCHUK: Every nation elects the leader to its liking.  Russians elected Yeltsin, Ukrainians -- Kravchuk. Whether we  fit each other as persons or not, we must work together. As for  Boris Yeltsin personally, I find a possibility to resolve  difficult matters with him. I raise questions and get a clear  answer, positive or negative, but clear.    You mentioned the Massandra agreement (under the protocol to  it the Ukrainian part of the fleet was to be leased by Russia --  INTERFAX). However, this document was preceeded by the Yalta  and Zavidovo agreements (on the division of the fleet --  INTERFAX). No one denounced. They were still in force. The  Massandra protocol was very beneficial to certain political  forces. They forgot about Yalta and Zavidovo and concentrated  on the Massandra protocol.    The three documents should be taken as a package and the  problem resolved fast.    IF Note: The Moscow talks between Russia and Ukraine last  Friday resulted in an agreement on the gradual settlement of  problems related to the Black Sea Fleet. Under the document the  two sides "willing to strengthen friendship, cooperation and  partnership" agreed on the following:    1. The Ukrainian navy and the Russian Black Sea Fleet shall  be based separately.    2. Ukraine shall keep 15-20 percent of the fleet's ships and  vessels.    3. An agreement on the parameters of such a division shall  be worked out within 10 days. The Ukrainian Defence Minister  Vitaliy Radetskiy told the press that the fleet shall be divided  fifty-fifty. Out of the half that is going to Ukraine 15-20  percent will be kept by Kiev and the rest sold to Russia.  However, the Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev has not  confirmed this interpretation.    INTERFAX: Many experts believe that the incident involving  the Cheleken hydrographic ship for the first time demonstrated  the possibility of an armed clash between Ukrainians and  Russians. Do you earnestly think of ways to rule out the very  possibility of the repetition of such conflict situations in the  future?    KRAVCHUK: This is the key question for us. We should not  argue over matters related to the Black Sea Fleet and especially  Sevastopol, even though I realize how painful they are for the  Russian mentality. The Russian leadership is bound to take it  into account and protect Russians, while I must protect Ukraine.    We must make decisions that would guarantee our peoples who  have lived shoulder to shoulder for 340 years against arguments.  It is the task of politicians to demonstrate restraint and will  without permitting themselves to be dragged into conflict  situations which armed people always begin.    Sometimes one shot aggravates problems so much that it  becomes impossible to stop the avalanche later. The examples  and lessons are before our eyes: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia.  That is why I am in favor of quick solutions, of not putting  things off.    We have no right to argue even over the Crimea. We should do  so that the Crimea would not separate us and our peoples.  Leaders come and go, nations remain.</p>

Applicability of Rules in States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce RCRA programs within the State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization EPA retains enforcement authority under Sections 3008, 7003, and 3013 of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), a State with final RCRA authorization administered its authorized hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of EPA. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities in the State which the State was authorized to permit. When new, more-stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, under Section 3006(g) of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in unauthorized States. EPA is directed to implement these requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State modifies its program to reflect the Federal standards, and applies for and is granted authorization. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States in the interim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal for listing EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. K140 and U408 is being proposed pursuant to Section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA, a provision added by HSWA. When the final rules are promulgated, EPA will consider its HSWA obligation to make a determination regarding listing organobromine wastes to be fulfilled. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to add these requirements to Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j), which identifies the Federal program requirements that are promulgated pursuant to HSWA and that take effect in all States, regardless of their authorization status. States may apply for final authorization for the HSWA provisions identified in 40 CFR 271.1(j) Table 1, as discussed in the following section of the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Effect on State Authorizations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted previously, today's rule is being proposed pursuant to provisions added by HSWA. The addition of K140 to the list of hazardous wastes from specific sources and the addition of U408 to the list of commercial chemical products that are hazardous when discarded is proposed pursuant to Section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA, a provision added by the HSWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, EPA will implement the HSWA portions of today's rule ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the addition of K140 to the list of hazardous wastes from specific sources and the addition of U408 to the list of commercial chemical products that are hazardous when discarded) in authorized States until they modify their programs to adopt these rules and such modifications are approved by EPA. Because this rule will be promulgated pursuant to HSWA, a State submitting a program modification may apply to receive either interim or final RCRA authorization under Section 3006 (b) and (g) on the basis that State regulations are substantially equivalent or fully equivalent to EPA's regulations. The procedures and schedule for State programs modifications for either interim or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. It should be noted that all HSWA interim authorizations will expire on January 1, 2003 (see 40 CFR 271.24(c)), 52 FR 60129, December 18, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that 40 CFR 271.21(e) requires that States having final RCRA authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and subsequently must submit the modifications to EPA for approval. The deadline by which States must modify their programs to adopt today's proposed rule will be determined by the date of promulgation of the final rule in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2). Once EPA approves the modification, the State requirements become RCRA Subtitle C requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

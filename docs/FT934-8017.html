			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Brierley group drops executives' options plan BRIERLEY Investments unexpectedly abandoned plans at yesterday's annual meeting for a controversial proposal that would have given 30 top executives options to buy shares at a discount. The proposal had run into stiff opposition from New Zealand institutional managers, who attempted to enlist the support of the company's founder, Sir Ron Brierley. They wanted to overturn it on the grounds that Brierley executives were sufficiently well paid. Sir Ron, who was displaced as chairman in an executive coup in 1990, had previously criticised the proposal. He had undertaken to raise the issue at a board meeting that preceded yesterday's annual meeting. The new chairman, Mr Bob Matthew, announced soon after the shareholders' meeting began that the proposal was being reconsidered. He said the company had 'substantially underestimated the extent of the ill-informed and misleading debate' the proposal had sparked. The abandoned proposal would have given selected managers options to buy 35m shares at NZDollars 1.22 each over the next four years, provided the gross return on the shares was more than 15 per cent a year.</p>

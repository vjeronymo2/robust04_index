			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Hungarians and Czechs set their eyes on 2000 Hungary and the Czech Republic have set themselves a five-year timetable for joining the European Union. Although EU leaders refused to fix a timetable for enlargement at the weekend, the two most economically advanced countries in the former communist bloc publicly set their sights on the year 2000 as the nearest feasible date of entry. Mr Gyula Horn, Hungarian prime minister, attempted to steal a march on the other aspiring members, claiming that his country was the furthest ahead and a prime candidate for early entry. The 2000 deadline was ambitious but realistic, said his foreign minister, Mr Laszlo Kovacs. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech leader said his government would advance reforms and put a case for early entry. While Romanian officials were anxious that the applicants should stick together rather than jockey for advantage, the EU leaders specifically ruled out accession en bloc, and stressed membership negotiations would be carried out case by case. They also pressed the council of ministers and the European commission to prepare so-called 'Europe agreements' with Slovenia, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia so they could be included in the overall enlargement strategy. Representatives of the other putative members - Poland, the Czechs, Slovakia and Bulgaria - were more restrained and contented themselves mainly with reflections on the symbolic nature of their unprecedented participation at the EU summit talks. Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the Polish premier, said the meeting marked an historic occasion, although a timetable for entry might have helped encourage speedier reforms in his country. For their part the six planned to increase co-operation among themselves to improve political and economic stability along the EU's eastern flank, according to Mr Horn. That was equally important as a preparation for possible membership of Nato, he said. But German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the man leading the drive for eastwards enlargement of the EU, said it was important not to arouse false hopes among the candidates. They would have to carry most of the burdens associated with aligning their economic, financial and legal systems to those of the EU, he added. Apparently under prompting from France, which is more pre-occupied with 'balancing' EU policies to the east with those towards the Mediterranean region, he and his officials stressed that a planned programme of regular top-level contacts did not constitute entry negotiations. On the contrary, the summit agreed that substantive talks on extension eastwards would have to wait until after the 1996 inter-governmental conference, called to review the EU's future institutional needs, which could last two years. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, noted that forging monetary union would be 'exceptionally difficult' in a union of 15 members and even tougher with more. Responding to a warning that enlargement made reforms of regional and agricultural policies essential, the EU leaders asked the commission to prepare a study on the impact of a further enlargement on the agricultural budget.</p>

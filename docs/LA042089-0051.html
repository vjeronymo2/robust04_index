			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY AT THE AFI FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'American Roulette'  </P> <P> Great Britain, 1988, 102 minutes  </P> <P> 6:45 p.m.  </P> <P>  No doubt there's decent raw thriller material in the story of a deposed Latin  American president finding himself on the run from death squads and foreign  intelligence agents in London. This puffball of a movie squanders that premise,  though, plying the Central American crisis merely for generic,  sub-"Hitchcockian" romance and yuks. Writer-director Maurice Hatton strains  credibility at every turn, having handsome hero-in-exile Andy Garcia run into  KGB clowns, a sinister CIA operative, a WASPy love interest and any other fatal  cliche in sight. Avoid.CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

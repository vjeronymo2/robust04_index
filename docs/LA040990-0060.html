			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AGRICULTURE BIOTECH FIRMS CUT GOOD DEALS WITH JAPANESE;  </P> <P> VENTURES: AGREEMENTS ONCE WERE A ONE-WAY STREET, WITH TECHNOLOGY BEING  TRANSFERRED FROM HERE TO THERE. TODAY, THEY ARE MUCH MORE EQUITABLE.  </P> <P> For the past month, Calgene Inc., a Davis, Calif.-based firm specializing in  genetically engineered plants, has been doing more than just splicing genes. It  has been grafting business deals as well.  </P> <P> First came the news of a $4-million agreement with Kirin Brewery Co. of Japan,  announced March 15. And a week ago, the company reported that its researchers  will genetically engineer disease-resistant vegetables with Sakata Seed America  Inc. in a deal valued at less than $500,000.  </P> <P> "In the last 3 1/2 years, we've done over $10 million in projects with Japan,"  said Kenneth Moonie, director of product planning for the agricultural  biotechnology firm. "Some of that money is still being paid out over the next  couple of years."  </P> <P> Agricultural biotechnology is a fledgling field in which scientists work to  genetically engineer plants and animals to create bio-insecticides,  bio-herbicides, plants resistant to disease and pestilence and treatments for  diseases.  </P> <P> Although Japanese investment in ag biotech is still in its early stages,  industry watchers say that its growth is rapid and its future is bright. They  also contend that deals such as Calgene's symbolize the changing nature of  Japanese-American business relationships -- particularly in the area of  technology.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s -- the nascent stages of Japanese investment in U.S.  biotechnology firms -- Japanese investors would swoop in with money and out  with U.S. research and broad licensing rights for future products, said Jim  McCamant, who edits the AgBiotech Stock Letter and the Medical Technology Stock  Letter.  </P> <P> Today, they are much more equitable, in part because American companies are  demanding more than just a quick cash infusion in exchange for their research.  And they're getting it.  </P> <P> "In the agriculture area, most of the deals being done with the Japanese are  good ones," McCamant said. "Today, when you look at the deals made with Japan,  you'd better ask for a lot. It's clear you're apt to get it."  </P> <P> That's just what happened with Calgene in the past month and Mycogen Corp., a  San Diego-based bio-pesticide firm, in the past two years.  </P> <P> On March 15, Calgene and Kirin officials announced that the two firms had  agreed to launch a joint venture in the field of potatoes. Kirin would pay  Calgene $2.5 million to purchase 30% of Calgene's seed potato business. The  joint venture would consist of Kirin's 30% share and Calgene's 70%.  </P> <P> In addition, the Japanese firm agreed to fund a two-year, $1.5-million research  and development project at Calgene to genetically engineer potato seed, making  it resistant to disease and such insects as the Colorado potato beetle.  </P> <P> But that's not all. Kirin also agreed to contribute its own potato propagation  technology to the joint venture. Moonie called that part of the deal unique,  and he hasn't gotten much argument about his characterization.  </P> <P> "In deals with the Japanese it's been a one-way street, with technology being  transferred from the U.S. to Japan," Moonie said. "What the Kirin people are  providing us with is their production technology, which could revolutionize the  seed potato industry in the U.S."  </P> <P> Mycogen is another success story, a firm that Mark Ratner, senior editor at  Bio/Technology magazine, calls "a leader in truly coming to significant  agreements with Japanese companies" in the area of ag biotech.  </P> <P> The first was in 1988 with Kubota of Tokyo, a Japanese manufacturer of farm  equipment, said Jerry Caulder, Mycogen's president, chairman and chief  executive. As part of the 1988 deal, Kubota agreed to provide $6 million over  three years for the development of biological insecticides.  </P> <P> The agreement gave Kubota exclusive rights in the Far East alone to all  products developed through the collaboration. In addition, Mycogen would  receive 50% of all product sales. Then in 1989, Kubota invested $10 million in  the company, making Kubota a 14% shareholder. Mycogen also has a deal with  Japan Tobacco Inc. for the development of bio-herbicides.  </P> <P> "Mycogen is separated from most (ag biotech companies) in that we didn't do  contract research," Caulder said. "We would do deals that brought in money that  augmented our core research projects. I don't think you can build a very large  profitable business . . . giving away your products for royalties."  </P> <P> Tetsuo Nishide is director of machinery and technology for the Japan External  Trade Organization in Los Angeles. To Nishide, the increased interest in  agricultural research is partly due to problems Japanese investors have  encountered while trying to break into the U.S. pharmaceutical field.  </P> <P> "The agriculture area is one of the perhaps most promising areas," Nishide  said. Investors "can get fruit from the investment. The medical part, it takes  time to get the return because of the procedures to get approval for the  medical products. The agriculture area is the easier way."  </P> <P> But other industry watchers warn that Japanese investment in agricultural  biotechnology should not be overstated. It's too early, they say, and Japanese  public opinion is not entirely behind the idea of genetic engineering.  </P> <P> The Japanese are "very well versed in 'classical' biotechnology techniques,  especially fermenting," Ratner said. "When it comes to genetic engineering,  they still have a long way to go in terms of public acceptance."  </P> <P> The government has yet to allow a field test of a genetically engineered  product, he said. "Public perception of biotechnology is still straight out of  those '50s science fiction movies, where the animal gets irradiated and turns  into a giant," Ratner said. "Instead of radiation, they're worried about  biotechnology."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AARON COPLAND DIES; MUSIC FOUND THE AMERICAN MOOD  </P> <P> Aaron Copland, who sought a recognizable American sound in serious music and  was considered the nation's finest living composer, died Sunday.  </P> <P> He died in Phelps Memorial Hospital in Westchester, N. Y. only two weeks after  his 90th birthday, an occasion noted with celebrations and tributes from  throughout the land.  </P> <P> He had suffered two strokes and died of the complications from them, said his  attorney, Ellis Freedman.  </P> <P> Copland's true achievement, concert pianist Samuel Lipman once observed, was  not the composer's use of rhythm, harmony, counterpoint or inventive structure,  but his ability to evoke through melody the "mood of America" from the Civil  War to World War II.  </P> <P> Copland, wrote the esteemed pianist, "catches the emptiness of the city and the  quiet of the land. He has succeeded in fixing in the mind of a large public an  aural image of what America, and therefore American music, sounds like."  </P> <P> Unlike other serious composers, the Brooklyn-born Copland did not spurn writing  for the masses, although many of his works were abstract and some could be  attempted by only the most skilled musicians. Compositions such as "Piano  Variations" were not meant for everybody.  </P> <P> (In 1928, during his first trip to the West, Copland heard another of his  keyboard pieces, "Piano Concerto" with its frequently changing rhythms, hissed  during rehearsal and again in concert at the Hollywood Bowl.)  </P> <P> But the sweep of his honors attests to his wide appeal. They included a  Pulitzer Prize, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Guggenheim Foundation's  first music fellowship and an Oscar.  </P> <P> "He was the composer who would lead American music out of the wilderness,"  Leonard Bernstein wrote in High Fidelity magazine for the occasion of Copland's  70th birthday. "He was The Leader, the one to whom the young always came with  their compositions."  </P> <P> Early in his career, when he searched jazz and folk songs as well as Latin  rhythms to find new musical forms, he was considered by many too avant-garde  for the concert hall.  </P> <P> He reached a wide audience with his ballet compositions: "Billy the Kid,"  "Rodeo" and "Appalachian Spring," the last written for dancer Martha Graham.  </P> <P> His "Fanfare for the Common Man" became an anthem played around the world and  was heard in such disparate places as the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer  Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan in  Washington.  </P> <P> He did not consider himself above writing background music for films -- "Of  Mice and Men," "Our Town," "North Star" and "The Red Pony" -- and for several  years that work provided his main source of income.  </P> <P> His Academy Award came for the score for William Wyler's 1949 "The Heiress."  </P> <P> Copland, the youngest of five children of Russian Jewish immigrants, did not  begin taking formal piano lessons until he was 12 or 13 and it was not until he  was 15 that, he said, "the idea of becoming a composer seems gradually to have  dawned upon me."  </P> <P> That was an advanced age for a future professional composer to begin training,  it was noted by Copland biographer Arthur Berger, "but his determination was  such that things went rapidly."  </P> <P> After studying piano with various teachers and learning composition under Rubin  Goldmark, who believed some of his pupil's efforts mere "modern experiments,"  20-year-old Copland went to France to enroll in a new music school for  Americans at Fontainebleau.  </P> <P> He could afford to go there, Berger pointed out, because his immigrant father  had a department store in New York and young Copland drew a "nice allowance" to  supplement what he had earned working in the store and as a runner on Wall  Street.  </P> <P> At Fontainebleau, Copland met harmony teacher Nadia Boulanger and was  overwhelmed by what he said was her enthusiasm and "clarity in teaching." He  became the first of several noted American composers who studied under her.  </P> <P> In post-World War I Paris, where Copland went to study with Boulanger, he found  himself caught up in the excitement over the experimenting European composers  -- Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, Bela Bartok and Arnold Schoenberg.  </P> <P> He wrote a one-act ballet, "Grohg," from which he later extracted three  movements to form his "Dance Symphony," subsequently winning with it a $5,000  prize in a 1930 contest sponsored by RCA Victor Co.  </P> <P> It was during his three years in France, Copland said later, that he became  aware that French music sounded distinctly French.  </P> <P> "I couldn't understand why we in America couldn't create serious music which  people would recognize as typically American," he told an interviewer before  his 80th birthday, "particularly since the jazz boys and the ragtime fellows  had succeeded in doing it."  </P> <P> He made up his mind to write serious music that would reflect America's  diversity and somehow capture the national character.  </P> <P> When he returned to the United States at 23, Copland earned his living for a  time playing in a Milford, Pa., hotel trio -- while writing for Boulanger a  "Symphony for Organ and Orchestra" she was to perform with conductor Walter  Damrosch and the New York Symphony Orchestra.  </P> <P> At the end of the initial performance, which was not very successful by all  accounts, Damrosch told the audience: "If a young man at the age of 23 can  write a symphony like that, in five years he will be ready to commit murder."  </P> <P> It was not clear what Damrosch meant, but at a time when modern composers were  regarded as doing little more than trying to shock the public, he may have felt  that Copland's talent could bring him intense frustration.  </P> <P> A month later, the Boston Symphony Orchestra performed Copland's symphony. Its  conductor, Russian-born Serge Koussevitsky, was so enthusiastic about the young  composer that he asked him to write a chamber orchestra piece to be performed  at a League of Composers concert.  </P> <P> Copland decided he had drawn upon European influences too much for his  symphony, so he drew upon the jazz idiom for "Music for the Theatre."  Biographer Berger observed that Copland, with his superb training, could  utilize advanced harmonies that were beyond George Gershwin.  </P> <P> Although the league concert audience took "Music for the Theatre" in stride,  the general symphony public did not.  </P> <P> Berger wrote that "a veritable cabal was formed against the work . . . among  staid Boston listeners, some of whom claimed that such music had no place in  Symphony Hall and that Koussevitsky had given it with disguised malice, namely  as a foreigner who wanted to show how bad American music is."  </P> <P> In a 1975 New York Times interview, Copland recalled the difficulties of trying  to write serious music that would appeal to a larger public without alienating  those willing to accept only traditional forms.  </P> <P> He told of fellow composer Roy Harris, who "was interested in writing big,  serious symphonies in the Sibelius vein," being aghast at the jazz-flavored  work Copland was writing for the Boston Symphony. Copland told the interviewer:  </P> <P> "I remember him jumping up and holding his head between his hands and shouting,  'My God, it's whorehouse music! It's whorehouse music!' "  </P> <P> Nevertheless, it was at the time of this brouhaha that Copland became the first  composer to win a Guggenheim Fellowship.  </P> <P> By 1927, he decided he had done as much as he could with jazz and he went on to  a new phase, producing "Piano Variations," "Short Symphony" and "Statements."  </P> <P> They were difficult to perform or to understand. Critics noted that Copland was  using dissonance, irregular rhythms and unmelodic themes. He had become a  leading figure in modern music.  </P> <P> Copland, however, was increasingly uncomfortable with the failure of composers  to reach the music-loving public.  </P> <P> So Copland went to a new style, composing and orchestrating by 1936 "El Salon  Mexico," based on Mexican melodies. It was an immediate success.  </P> <P> As he sought a broader audience and the true American musical idiom, Copland  drew upon such folk sources as cowboy songs, New England hymns and Shaker  melodies.  </P> <P> He wrote a play-opera for high school performance, "The Second Hurricane," as  well as incidental music for two plays and even a puppet show that was  presented at the 1939 New York World's Fair.  </P> <P> His three major ballets were responsible for most of his fame. "Appalachian  Spring" won him the 1944 Pulitzer Prize for music as well as the New York Music  Critics' Award as the outstanding theatrical composition for 1944-45.  </P> <P> He wrote music especially commissioned for radio performance and composed for  films without, the critics said, sinking to the level of many Hollywood scores.  </P> <P> In fact, Arthur Berger wrote, Copland "exerted an influence on some of the  resident, routine composers there and helped raise the general standards."  </P> <P> In writing about Copland, pianist Lipman observed that "notwithstanding this  opening to the masses," the composer already had resumed his interest in more  abstract music with "Piano Sonata," "Sonata for Violin and Piano" and his  "Third Symphony."  </P> <P> The last was called by Koussevitsky "the greatest American symphony" and was  the New York Music Critics' choice for the best orchestral piece of the 1946-47  season.  </P> <P> Copland's career also included his work as a performer of his own music and as  a conductor -- both in concert and on recordings.  </P> <P> He wrote three books: "Our New Music," "What to Listen for in Music" and "Music  and Imagination." He also wrote articles for various magazines while others  wrote several books and hundreds of articles about him.  </P> <P> Copland was celebrated at length and interviewed often at the time of his 80th  birthday in 1980, three years after his last composition "Midsummer Nocturne."  He was living, as he had for years, in a rambling hilltop house overlooking the  Hudson River at Peekskill, N. Y.  </P> <P> His 90th birthday was marked by concerts and tributes stretching across the  country. But this time his health was too frail for interviews or even comment.  </P> <P> He never married and lived alone with his grand piano, stacks of music  manuscript, dog and cat. A housekeeper, a cook and a secretary attended to his  needs.  </P> <P> "This is my hideaway, my solitude," he told one reporter many years ago. "You  know what the composer's life is like in Manhattan. The telephone is always  ringing, people are always dropping in. You are expected to go places and take  part.  </P> <P> "It's a matter of keeping yourself free from interruptions."  </P></p>

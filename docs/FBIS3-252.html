Patterton] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg, March 4 SAPA -- It was not the  Afrikaner Volksfront's [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] policy to  become involved in hit squad activites, AVF leader Gen Constand  Viljoen said on Friday [4 March]. He was speaking against the  background of a SOWETAN newspaper report of an alleged rightwing  plot to murder African National Congress Secretary-General Cyril  Ramaphosa. Gen Viljoen said the story was probably aimed at  discrediting the rightwing.    The unfortunate assassination of SA Communist Party General  Secretary Chris Hani was a clear example of an incident from  which the country, and especially the AVF, had not benefited at  all. "On the contrary, it caused more damage.    "I as a person am not involved in the alleged activities and  play no role in such planning.    "If I should become aware of such planning I would report it  to the police and do everything possible to prevent such a  dangerous deed."    Mr Ramaphosa said on Radio 702 he had been left numb by the  reports. "It causes a great deal of concern that there could be  a bunch of people out there who want to eliminate one."    The WEEKLY MAIL on Friday ran a story about an alleged  rightwing war plan to hijack the SA Defence Force's Rapid  Deployment Force and strategic installations and to "neutralise"  hostile generals at the outbreak of hypothetical hostilities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Election platform of the party "Union in Support of the </F> Republic of Crimea" signed by the Political Council of the  party: "Opportunities for the Strong, Protection for the Weak"]    [Text] The development of society in the interests of all  strata of the population is the key idea of the program  documents of the party "Union in Support of the Republic of  Crimea." The goal of our party is to ensure that man, his rights  and freedoms, labor and welfare become the real values of the  society in which we live. To this end, our Republic should  become an economically strong, democratic, rule-of-law state.    The SPRK [Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea] has  already accomplished, in cooperation with other parties,  politicians, and representatives of the business communities of  Ukraine and Russia, a number of specific endeavors that will be  helpful in solving the economic problems of the Crimea:    -- An agreement has been signed with the "Grinev-Kuchma"  bloc  and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (Stankevich-Shakhray)  on establishing permanent informational contacts; cooperation  between the centrist forces of Ukraine, Russia, and the Crimea  has thus been actually initiated;    -- The holding of a conference of the centrist forces of  Ukraine, Belorusia [Belarus], and Russia (possibly Moldova) in  the Crimea in April has been agreed upon with a view to pooling  our efforts in the advancement of the states toward an economic  and political union;    -- A package of documents containing specific studies of  ways to overcome an economic crisis and stabilize the economic  and political situation in the Crimea has been given to the  president of the Crimea.    At present, the party is looking for ways to accomplish  tasks  that can overcome the chaos and ruin in the Crimea with the  participation of economists, lawyers, and social science  specialists.    1. A set of measures to carry out reform of the tax system  of  the Republic of Crimea is being developed. The essence of the  reform is to reduce tax rates at the expense of nontax funds  being taken in by the budget.    This reform will ensure:    --An increase in the profits and solvency of existing  enterprises;    --The development of new enterprises;    --The creation of new jobs;    --An increase in output produced and services rendered;    --Greater welfare for the working people.    2. A program of measures to restore disrupted economic  relations through economic cooperation with CIS countries is  being developed:    --The simplification of mutual settlements and customs  barriers between the Crimea, Ukraine, and Russia;    --The creation of local free economic zones with  subsequent transition to an international free enterprise zone;    --The upgrading of Crimean ports and restoration of the  Crimea- Caucasus railway ferry, with subsequent construction of  the "Crimea- Russia" bridge;    --The creation of an international joint-stock airline  (the Crimea-Ukraine-Russia) using the facilities of the  Simferopol Airport and the takeoff and landing potential of the  military bases in Belbek, Dzhankoy, and Bagerovo;    --The creation of joint Crimean-Russian wine-making,  tobacco- growing, silk-producing, seed-producing, and  sheep-breeding enterprises.    3. The privatization program we propose can stop the process  of hidden privatization, i.e. the secret pilfering of public  property, and make this a truly people's privatization.    The key stages of the program are:    --Adopting the Law on Privatization, which takes into  account  the specifics of the region, analyzes the mistakes and crimes  that have been allowed to occur, and codifies the priority  status of labor collectives in both industry and agriculture;    --Taking a complete inventory with the participation of  the public, the deputy corps, trade unions, and independent  experts in order to analyze in detail all changes in the form of  ownership;    --Reinforcing criminal liability for secretly changing the  form of ownership.    4. Our social programs guarantee opportunities for the  strong  and protection for the weak:    --The preservation of free education and health care, along  with paid education and health care;    --Material support for motherhood and childhood;    --A minimum retirement benefit corresponding to the level  of the subsistence minimum;    --Long-term easy credit to young people for the  construction and acquisition of housing, with a proportion of  the loan being written off after the birth of each child;    --Easy credit to young people to learn a profession or  retrain.    A program for supporting agriculture--the main sector in the  economy of the Crimea:    --The immediate payment of accumulated arrears by the state;    --Easy credit to agricultural producers;    --The lifting of existing restrictions on the area of land  grants;    --Long-term, indefinite land leases with right of  inheritance for those who work the land;    --Respect for all forms of ownership.    In the name of human health and the conservation of unique  nature in the Crimea, all construction, land, military, and  economic projects should be carried out in keeping with the Law  "On Environmental Protection" and should undergo ecological  reviews.    Stage-by-stage demilitarization of the peninsula, with the  potential of the military-industrial complex being used in the  interests of the Crimea.    The Republic of Crimea must become a symbol of peace and  welfare. All nations residing in the Republic should have equal  opportunities to develop their ethnic cultures.    Reorganization of law enforcement organs in conjunction with  their reliable outfitting should become a guarantee of  protection of the life, dignity, rights, and freedoms of  citizens of the Crimea.    We come out against the reforms that have robbed the people  and turned a majority of them into beggars. All labor has lost  prestige, whereas speculation, bribery, and plunder have become  prestigious. We have created the "Union in Support of the  Republic of Crimea" in order to bring this outrage to an end and  prevent the worst from happening.    We count on support from all those who create material and  intellectual assets and who are concerned about the fate of the  Crimea.    Let us help the Republic together!!!    [Signed] SPRK Political Council</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Computing liability FOR CAPITAL gains tax purposes, my shareholding in RTZ is split into two pools, before and after April 5 1982. In April this year, I opted for the enhanced scrip dividend of the company and accepted the corresponding BZW cash offer, and intend to do the same with the current enhanced scrip dividend and BZW cash offer. To compute capital gains/losses: 1. Does the 10-day rule apply, whereby the new shares acquired are identified with the same shares disposed of, given that the acquisitions and disposals take place within 10 days? Or, 2. Does one add the cost of the new shares to the cost base of the post-April 1982 pool? Or, 3. Does one apportion the new shares between the ante- and post-April 1982 pools, adding their costs to the base costs of these pools? 1. No. 2. No. 3. Yes, by virtue of section 141 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, in conjunction with section 128(1). Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

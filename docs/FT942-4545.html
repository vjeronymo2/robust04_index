			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Arts: Face the music and skate - Can Torvill and Dean go beyond the competition stakes? When Torvill and Dean are competing, as everybody knows, their artistry transcends competition. When they are giving professional performances, however, you realise that competition is what they most need. For it is competition, ironically, that brings out their best artistry. Some half-dozen of the duets they have created for competition are classics  -potently expressive images of male-female partnership on a level rare in any art, and unique in their genre. And they themselves are a rare partnership. What a curious partnership, though - for they are only interesting when together. Astaire and Rogers, Fonteyn and Nureyev, Sibley and Dowell were all supreme soloists too, who could sustain major careers apart from each other. Not so Torvill and Dean - who, apart from each other even for a minute or two, are unremarkable either as personalities or as ice dancers. Their new world tour gives them very little solo exposure, but just enough - in a Beatles anthology, Paperback Sixties - to prove this. And they are not an invariably thrilling partnership; the duet that finally brings them together at the climax of this Beatles collection is fairly blah. You cannot even say (as Katherine Hepburn said of Astaire and Rogers) that she gives him sex while he gives her class. The Midas touch that sometimes turns these two pleasant but uninspiring individuals into a joint icon of the sublime is the tight specifications of competitive ice dancing: never more than a yard apart from each other; no flamboyantly high lifts; a steady supply of virtuosity amid a non-stop flowing legato journey around the ice . . . It is now more than 12 years since Torvill and Dean first took those challenging limitations and turned them into a transporting image of the inseparability of man and woman. If there is just one thing that sets them apart from other ice partnerships, it is musicality. (Why is this so rare on ice?) As the climax of another big ensemble piece to music from Orff's Carmina Burana, they dance a duet, 'In Trutina.' Not on their best level throughout, but with some long and heartstopping phrases wedded to the flow and peaks of phrases in the music. At one peak, Dean holds her high, and her gesture into the air above exactly hits its climax with the music; and then, while the same phrase continues, Dean lowers her and holds her, immobile and horizontal, like a steel bar across his chest; and the phrase contains other marvels too. The choreography is credited to Torvill, Dean, and Andris Toppe. Nineteen other skaters are involved, in solos, duets and larger ensembles. The mood keeps changing from comedy to virtuosity to lyricism; a Strictly Skating medley makes some OK jokes about the usual tackiness of ballroom forms on ice in very Strictly Ballroom vein; and the evening's programme is a passable mix of showbiz and acrobatics. The naffest excess of ice dance are avoided; but its rare potential for poetry is only present in the T &amp; D duets. But there are too many jokes about competition marks, too many references to competition triumphs. Years ago, John Curry swept straight out of competition format to prove himself a major lyricist on ice, and built up a company of likeminded skaters. Can Torvill and Dean go beyond their competition successes? The pattern of their career - and the fact that all their best numbers have been made for competition  - suggests not. This programme begins with the Bolero, includes History of Love and a medley of Barnum, the Paso Doble, and Mack and Mabel, and ends with Let's Face the Music and Dance. Musicality apart, Torvill and Dean are an outstanding choreographic example of male-female cooperation. Whether in the sweeping tragic glory of Bolero or the chugging robust vivacity of Mack and Mabel, you can see how often Torvill propels Dean as well as vice versa. Often they become intricately interdependent. In one phrase of Bolero she arches back over his body, facing up to the ceiling, and yet it is her feet, lightly running on point, that are propelling them both. Breathtaking, no matter how often you see it, and seriously moving. At Wembley Arena until June 22</p>

In particular, the  examination functions have been divided between the Ministry of  Health and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and  Fisheries, and effective examinations have not been conducted.  Reporter Hwang Song-su reports:    [Begin Hwang Song-su recording] These are imported farm  products waiting for clearance in a bonded warehouse in Inchon  port [video shows various farm products]. Approximately 7,600  kinds of farming products were cleared through the Inchon  quarantine station last year, up 25 percent compared with 1992.  [end recording]    [Begin Inchon quarantine port official Kim Sung-kyom  recording] Most farm products have been imported from China. We  cannot conduct thorough examinations of agricultural chemicals  in imported foodstuffs. Thus, we are in a position of looking  into 10 or 20 boxes at most a day to examine for agricultural  chemicals. [end recording]    [Begin Hwang recording] To effectively quarantine the  increased number of agricultural and stockbreeding products that  will start with the import-opening era, the Ministry of Health  and Social Affairs will expand from 38 to 105 the number of  agricultural products that will require examination for  agricultural chemicals. In particular, to cope with imported  agricultural products, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs  will increase from 24 to 58 the number of grains, including  rice, that will be required to be examined. However, there are  only 7 inspectors at Inchon quarantine port out of a total of 37  called for. The situation is the same at other quarantine  stations. [end recording]    [Begin recording of Yi Chae-kwan, section chief of  foodstuffs  circulation department under the Ministry of Health and Social  Affairs] We have demanded that the number of personnel in  charge of close examination be increased to 265. The Ministry  of Government Administration is now considering the personnel  increase. We judge that if the number of personnel is  increased, control of all imported foodstuffs will be properly  examined. [end recording]    [Begin Hwang recording] In particular, quarantine functions  in our country have been divided. That is, the national  quarantine station affiliated with the Ministry of Health and  Social Affairs conducts the sanitary examination of imported  agricultural and stockbreeding products. The animal quarantine  station and plant quarantine station affiliated with the  Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have conducted quarantine  tasks. Effective examination has not been conducted.

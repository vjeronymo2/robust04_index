			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hays buys agency for Pounds 5.1m Hays, the business services group, has reaffirmed its faith in the reviving recruitment market by paying Pounds 5.1m for Modus Holdings, a specialist agency which provides information technology staff. Modus, which has two branches north of London, provides computer systems, programming and operating staff. The management will stay with the business. Hays said Modus would fit well with its Accountancy Personnel business, which has 120 branches providing accountancy placements and is part of the group's personnel services division. Client contact within both businesses was with finance directors and there would be opportunities to cross-market client databases and expand Modus through the Hays personnel network. Hays' operating profits from personnel plunged from Pounds 19m in 1990 to just Pounds 4.8m two years later, but the division showed a 40 per cent recovery to Pounds 6.7m in the year to June 30. Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman, said the recruitment market was continuing to make steady progress. 'Every single week is better than the last on temps, and permanent staff are beginning to show.' Modus made operating profits of Pounds 950,000 on sales of Pounds 13.9m in the 11 months to December 10. Hays has acquired the share capital for Pounds 2.7m and assumed debt of Pounds 2.4m. The consideration consists of Pounds 2.04m in loan notes, Pounds 540,000 in cash and Pounds 120,000 through issuing 45,045 Hays shares.</p>

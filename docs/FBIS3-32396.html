			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 Feb (DPA) -- A commando unit  of the communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)  has claimed responsibility for the latest terrorist escalation  that took place this morning in the northwestern Colombian city  of Medellin.    The subversives sent a clandestine communique to Medellin  radio stations, justifying the planting of explosives at U.S.  facilities to reject the presence of U.S. troops in Colombia.    Four bombs exploded at Citibank branches and at an English  academy in several Medellin locations. Meanwhile, the police  defused three other explosive devices.    The FARC said the presence of U.S. soldiers harms Colombian  interests; thus, it is exerting pressure for their immediate  departure.    About 250 U.S. soldiers are building bases in Puerto Lopez,  Meta Department, and in Araracuara, Amazonas Department, to  detect drug traffickers' planes. In addition, the troops are  building a school, a health center, and a road in Juanchaco, in  the western Valle del Cauca Department.    Mauricio Navas Talero, a former Attorney General's Office  high-ranking official, filed a petition today for protection, a  judicial mechanism used to protect constitutional rights,  requesting the departure of foreign soldiers.    Navas explained the Colombian Constitution does not empower  the president "to tolerate, consent, or allow the entry of  foreign troops in the country." This would be acceptable if the  Council of State issued an authorization.    He added "to defend this constitutional right, I am asking  the courts to urge President Cesar Gaviria to order the  immediate departure of the troops."    Judicial sources have said the courts will issue a ruling on  the petition for protection within 10 days.</p>

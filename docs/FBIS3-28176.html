The information says:    At a time when the bellicose quarters of the United States  threatened to take "sanctions" against the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea after setting a deadline under the pretext of  "nuclear arms development" by the DPRK, the U.S. imperialist  aggression forces and the South Korean puppet Army have staged  an unbroken chain of war exercises and military provocations  against the DPRK. This is very dangerous moves.    The U.S. and South Korean warmaniacs are scheming to  introduce Patriot missiles into South Korea as part of their  attempt to overpower the DPRK militarily. They have brought  into South Korea and set in motion a "U.S. state  intelligence-supporting team" for war preparations to "intensify  espionage on the North."    All these ill-boding military moves indicate that the war  preparations of the United States and the South Korean rulers  have got into full stride and they are now going to take a  practical military action by inventing a pretext.    If the U.S. and South Korean hardline conservatives attempt  to frighten the DPRK with military threat it is a foolish act.    We have already solemnly stated that we are prepared either  for dialogue or for war.    If the U.S. and South Korean bellicose circles persistently  seek military adventures, ignoring the DPRK's patient efforts  for peace, they will be held fully responsible for the grave  situation created by them.</p>

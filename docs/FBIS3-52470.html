Vice  President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam says that following Israel's  agreement with the PLO, Syria informed the U.S. side that it did  not agree to resume negotiations because Oslo constituted a  deviation from the Madrid formula. However, subsequent contacts  were held and an agreement was reached on a meeting between  Presidents Clinton and al-Asad in Geneva, he added.    Khaddam asserted that Syria's position continues to be clear  and the same, that peace must lead to implementing UN  resolutions and to a comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied  Arab territories.    Khaddam criticized the Israeli-Arab meetings under the name  of multilaterals and repeated Syria's position on them. He  indicated that such issues should not be discussed before the  issue of peace and Israeli withdrawal is settled. Khaddam said  Syria does not feel that it is weak otherwise it would not have  gone to the peace negotiations. This is because the weak would  enter negotiations at his expense and at the expense of his  land, as he put it.    The Syrian vice president criticized the Oslo agreement,  stressing the importance of a comprehensive solution on all  fronts of struggle and said: Many attempts have been made to  reach solutions with Syria for Syrian territory only. Syria  rejected all these attempts because it is convinced of the  pan-Arab nature of the struggle and the need for a comprehensive  solution.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Sharp fall in Eagle Star life business EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, yesterday announced substantially reduced new life business figures for 1992. Worldwide new regular premiums fell 6 per cent to Pounds 110m, while new single premiums dropped 18 per cent to Pounds 436m. The company attributed the bulk of this fall to a deliberate strategic decision to cut less profitable lines of business where competition is on price. These included UK annuity business, which fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 372.6m. Group annuities dropped to Pounds 53m (Pounds 200m). On the regular premium side, the company offered less competitive rates for group life business, where new premiums fell from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 3.6m. Mr Ian Owen, managing director of Eagle Star Life, said: 'It would be easy to increase business in those areas with higher rates but we don't believe we can do that profitably. We would not want to announce increased business figures in annuities or term assurance at present.' The depressed housing market hit demand for mortgage-related endowment policies, where premiums fell from Pounds 28m to Pounds 25m. The company has instead concentrated on individual investment products. New regular premium pensions rose by 13 per cent while single premium pensions rose from Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 67m. Single-premium bonds, boosted by its with-profits bond, rose from Pounds 53m to Pounds 140m, while unit trust sales rose from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 26m. Group funds under management increased by 11 per cent from Pounds 10.9bn to Pounds 12.1bn.</p>

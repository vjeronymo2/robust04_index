			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: Defiant Bosnian Serbs tell west: 'Do your worst' AS the sun rose yesterday over Mount Jahorina above Sarajevo, a silent and frustrated President Slobodan Milosevic, accompanied by Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, his closest international ally, piled into their Mercedes. They had failed to persuade the Bosnian Serb parliament to accept the Vance-Owen plan. In contrast, exhausted but triumphant deputies called the outcome of the 17-hour session 'a victory of the people and against western dictates'. Burly guards in camouflage uniforms pushed journalists away from the closed-door session as the vote was taken. A weighty majority, 51 out of 65 votes cast, reaffirmed their decision of last week to hold a referendum on May 15 and 16 in their self-styled Srpska Republika, which covers about two-thirds of Bosnia. Mr Radoslav Brdjanin, a key hardliner from Banja Luka, the bastion of Serb radicals in north-west Bosnia, praised the failure of deputies to kowtow to western pressure and politicians from Belgrade who 'don't understand the situation'. 'Let the Americans bomb. They'll never win, we made the just decision. The only possible one,' he said. General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, in a blustering and angry briefing to the deputies dismissed as biased the proposed maps, which he said would 'bring horrible consequences'. His soldiers were not afraid of military intervention, he boasted. The deputies' refusal to ratify the peace plan has set them on a collision course with Mr Milosevic, who told the 73 deputies gathered at the Heavenly Valley hotel above Sarajevo: 'We cannot afford to lose everything we have, staking it all and losing like a drunken poker player.' But only two members of the assembly backed the Serbian president, who in the past has brilliantly outmanoeuvred political challengers. Mr Nenad Veselinovic, the mayor of Pale, dismissed the visit of the Serbian and Yugoslav leaders: 'We knew what these speeches were going to be. They didn't need to come all the way here. They have the right to think what they want. But the reality on the ground is very different from what they think it is.' Mr Milosevic responded last night by cutting off supplies to the Bosnian Serbs, a move that carries political risks, as he so far has been bolstered by nationalist support within Serbia. Ultra-nationalists and an unofficial ally of Serbia's ruling Socialists, such as Mr Vojislav Seselj, a Belgrade parliamentary deputy and paramilitary commander, are likely to whip up fears by protesting against the isolation of their kin in Bosnia. Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic, appearing worn and grim, yesterday called the vote 'the worst possible decision'. 'It is disastrous. I don't know what the next night and day will bring to this country,' said Mr Cosic, one of the architects of the plan to create a Greater Serbia. But defiance was the dominant theme among Bosnian Serbs yesterday. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, tried to paint the decision to hold a referendum as postponement rather than a rejection of the plan to divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces. Despite having signed the plan in Athens at the weekend, in Pale he described the maps as catastrophic. 'If they accept, one half of the Serbian population will be in Moslem and Croatian provinces and the other half in Nagorno Karabakh.' Mr Ratko Adzic, the interior minister, warned: 'Surely against such a power as Nato our losses would be very heavy. But we also remember what happened in the Vietnam war and we ourselves have rich experience in guerrilla warfare. 'If they make us really angry, we can launch a guerrilla campaign on their territory, such as on nuclear power plants. If our children are dying why should theirs live?' Only a few Bosnian Serb leaders voiced uncertainty. Mr Milan Tesic, one of the two opponents to the referendum, called the decision one of extreme ignorance. 'I am obligated to support any agreement for peace. But they are voting for war and they have managed to silence the others,' he said. Despite the convincing defeat of the plan, several deputies, fighters, and guests were visibly shaken after the marathon session. One delegate in military garb said: 'It is a frightening and unwise decision. Who knows what will happen to us now?'</p>

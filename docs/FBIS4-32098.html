			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Warsaw, 20 Jun--During a news conference on 20  June, Jerzy Szmajdzinski, general secretary of the Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic, said that, according to  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] estimates, the number of local  councillors from that party increased tenfold after the 19 June  local elections. There were 758 councillors during the previous  term. The SLD won the largest number of seats (over 50 percent)  in Wloclawek, Sosnowiec, and Czeladz.

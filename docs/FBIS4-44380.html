			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 29 (AFP) -- The Western European  Union [WEU], the military arm of the European Union, has asked  Central and East European countries to help in the French  operation in Rwanda, the WEU said Wednesday [29 June].    East European countries have been asked to contribute but  have not yet responded, WEU secretary general Willem van Eekelen  said.    France has told the WEU it needs principally medical  equipment for its operations, he added.    Romania told the WEU it intended to help the UN operation in  Rwanda.    Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the  Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia are associate countries in  the WEU.

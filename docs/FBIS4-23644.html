			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki by Shaun </F> Johnson and Kaizer Nyatsumba in Pretoria; date not given]    [Text]  <H5>  On how the new Cabinet is working together. </H5>   One of the most important processes that has taken place  since this Cabinet was formed was the discussion and the inputs  with regard to the president's state of the nation address. It  was an important moment because here you have three different  parties within the Cabinet, the result of the particular contest  of the election. And, for the first time, we all of us had to  sit and say: Is there anything that binds us together sitting  here? Is there a common basis on which we can operate as a  Cabinet? We began to address the question: What is this  Government of National Unity [GNU]?  <H5>  On agreement so far in Cabinet. </H5>   We have now, all of us, agreed that the country needs  reconstruction and development, that you can't come into  Government just to run a bureaucracy, to keep things ticking  over. That if this GNU is to mean anything, it's got to have a  visible effect. Everybody said fine, and then there was  agreement on important detailed elements -- where the president  said let's get these particular programmes going in the next 100  days to signal a serious intent to change the country for the  better. It gives everybody common purpose. That was the first  test of the unity concept.  <H5>  On his relationship with ministries. </H5>   Every day I am in contact with a lot of the Ministers, not  just ANC Ministers. A Minister might want a decision, and might  call or send a note to say what do you think. And it is  possible to judge and say it sounds right, or it doesn't sound  right, because there is a broad framework. Ministers have no  problem with that contact regardless of the parties to which  they belong. I think the relations are very good. I don't  think anybody feels they are being used by another party.  <H5>  On dealing with disagreements. </H5>   Matters that could have been contentious have been dealt  with  in this co-operative spirit. For instance, the Ingonyama Trust  business, the land issue. It was dealt with in a very open  manner, no fights, and a quite serious intent to say this is  what happened, let's go into it. Because we have a basic  context, you can deal with the matter. It's not a case of one  party getting advantaged or whatever. It's a question of  whether we can sustain this decision, or not. I'm saying nobody  feels threatened. Generally within the Cabinet, there's a great  deal of co-operation.  <H5>  On co-operation between ministries. </H5>   Take the question of the release of children and juveniles,  the amnesty question and so on. You would find the Minister of  Justice, Dullar Omar, and the Minister of Correctional Services,  Sipho Mzimela, dealing with it together a lot of the time -- one  from the ANC, one from the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], working  together very well, joint presentations to Cabinet and so on. I  think the same is true of the relationship between the two  deputy presidents. I've always had a good relationship with him  (F.W. de Klerk) and that's not changed.  <H5>  On how De Klerk is adjusting to his new role. </H5>   I think he is adjusting. Clearly, you would not believe me  if I said he was not conscious of having (formerly) been the  leader -- of course he is -- but I think he accepts the fact  that Nelson Mandela is president, with that constitutional role.  But I think he also accepts that, apart from constitutions,  this is the leader of this country in more ways than are defined  on paper. He accepts that, and I think he accepts that he  comes from a minority party. But of course you will see that  he is in the process of adjustment.  <H5>  On how Mangosuthu Buthelezi is adjusting to his new role. </H5>   We sit next to each other in the Cabinet, so we are always  whispering things to each other. I haven't had a sense of him  needing to adjust as much as Mr de Klerk. He has walked in as a  Cabinet Minister, he has his portfolio, and he behaves like all  other Ministers.  <H5>  On the new Government's priority. </H5>   Underlying everything is actually changing the conditions of  life of the people of the country, in every way. Whether in  terms of providing jobs, clean water, better health, education  and so on, this has to be the main thrust.  <H5>  On the role of deputy presidents. </H5>   We carry out tasks to assist the president. As of now we  have a decision to establish at least three Cabinet committees,  which will do a lot of preparatory work for Cabinet meetings.  You've got a Cabinet committee, for instance, which will deal  with security and intelligence matters, one which will deal with  economic matters, another to deal with social and administrative  questions. And the chairpersonship of those committees will be  distributed between the president and his deputy presidents.  <H5>  On the first and second deputy presidents. </H5>   The constitution does not talk about first and second  deputies, it talks about a deputy president from the majority  party and a deputy president from the minority party. Clearly,  in political terms, the deputy president from the majority party  represents the majority. (President Mandela) uses the terms  first and second deputies because that is the political reality,  but the constitution does not say that. The constitution says  that Cabinet meetings, in the absence of the president, would be  chaired on an alternating basis by the deputies, but that is  all it says. The rest is really up to the president to decide.  <H5>  On Constand Viljoen's role until now. </H5>   Constand Viljoen is an important political figure. We very  deeply appreciated his courage in saying that to the extent that  there was a peaceful constitutional way of addressing issues,  that is the way they should go. We were sensitive to the fact  that there were many people on the right wing who were very  vocal, very threatening, who were putting on a lot of pressure  to take another route. We thought it was an important act of  statesmanship that he took the route he took.  <H5>  On Viljoen's future role. </H5>   We would want to respect the opinion he represents. It might  not be massive in terms of numbers, but we would want to ensure  that he plays his own role in terms of this making of the new  South Africa. Sure, if they had had the numbers, it would have  been very good to have him in the Cabinet. But the role of a  Constand Viljoen, beyond what is provided for in the  constitution, is something that must continue to receive some  consideration.  <H5>  On his own role in Cabinet appointments. </H5>   The Cabinet was chosen by the president. There was a  meeting, for instance, of the NEC [National Executive Committee]  of the ANC just before the elections. It was agreed that the  president would choose the Cabinet, and of course would consult  as he wished. I know for a fact that he consulted many people  -- the leadership of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade  Unions], the SACP [South African Communist Party], individuals,  myself as an individual. And in terms of the constitution he  consulted De Klerk, Buthelezi and so on. There isn't any  particular person -- certainly not me -- who was the determining  factor in terms of the selection of the Cabinet and the deputy  ministers.  <H5>  On his view of the Cabinet. </H5>   I think it's a very good Cabinet, and I personally don't  agree with the criticisms of some people. If you take, for  instance, the Foreign Minister (Alfred Nzo), if you look at the  Cabinet as it stands now, you would find very few people who  have had as much exposure in terms of foreign affairs as he has.  You should look at his own history.  <H5>  On rumours that he effectively runs the foreign ministry. </H5>   No. I think it really wouldn't matter who had been appointed  foreign minister -- we would have to come to their assistance.  The fact of the matter is that I was in charge of the ANC's  international relations for I don't know how many years, and  therefore am most familiar with current foreign policy  positions. It doesn't really matter who you would have chosen,  the same thing would have happened.  <H5>  On Cyril Ramaphosa's absence from the Cabinet. </H5>   Well, for some time we had been discussing the possible  impact of the election, the formation of a Government,  Parliament, and all that, on the functioning of the ANC. There  were three major deployments that had to be done. One to  Parliament, Government and Cabinet. Another to the public  service and the army. The third to the ANC. Clearly, all three  areas were important. It is in that context that Cyril has been  saying for quite some time that he thought, as secretary-general  of the ANC, he needed to be among those people who would stay  in the ANC and therefore not have any other responsibility. I  have discussed the question with Cyril since the end of last  year, when he raised it. And he persisted with that position,  up to now.  <H5>  On whether Ramaphosa's position might change. </H5>   It's a continuing challenge. Personally, I have no role in  deploying people. But I don't think this matter generally has  been resolved in terms of the ANC. I think we have to continue  looking at the question of that deployment, and might have  indeed to redeploy people as we see what is happening. Whether  out of Parliament to other positions, and so on. So it's a  continuing responsibility. That kind of thing is going to  happen, and I think we should read it straight, as it is. It is  quite a challenge to the ANC. I'm personally quite convinced  that in the whole process of making sure that we have rational  and effective deployment of people, you make sure of effective  participation in all three areas. You foresee certain things and  prepare for them, but in the actual practice, as you begin to  work, experience will tell you something. I would imagine  personally that there will still be a shifting around of people.  People could be redeployed.  <H5>  On whether he now sees himself as heir-apparent to Mandela. </H5>   No, no, no. You see, Nelson Mandela is president of the ANC  and he is president of this country. That is all there is to  this matter.  <H5>  On how long the post-election honeymoon will last. </H5>   I think the honeymoon arises from the expectation that  things  will change for the better. I think it's necessary and possible  to sustain that optimism among people by actually bringing about  that change. Its the urgent responsibility of the Government to  show visible results. And I think we can and shall. People  will begin to see movement as far as informal settlements are  concerned, houses being built, children and expectant mothers  getting free treatment in hospitals. I think things will happen  -- they have to happen, to change the country for the better.  I think that so long as the Government sticks to its promises  in terms of that delivery, that mood of optimism will persist.  This is not to say that there are not going to be hiccups and  explosions, but there is so much that needs to be changed for  the better -- and the potential for changing things for the  better is so big that we ourselves have not even quite  understood the potential energy that resides among our people,  which will be set free by these changes. So I don't think we  are in for a short honeymoon period -- unless the Government  doesn't do its work.  <H5>  On the controversy over politicians's salaries. </H5>   The Melament Commission was set up by the TEC [Transitional  Executive Committee] to look at the whole question, because  there were no rules. At the end of this month, if there hadn't  been something like this, none of the MPs would have been paid.  So the Melament Commission was set up as a temporary emergency  measure, and they've made their recommendations and also drafted  a Bill to create a new salaries commission, remuneration  commission, to look at the question again. So the Melament  Commission recommendations are very temporary. What they have  said will be replaced by what will come out of the other  commission which will be appointed.  <H5>  On the peaceful nature of the election and inauguration. </H5>   We had been dealing with the potential for violence for  quite  some time. In 1986 I had a discussion with the-then chairman of  the Broederbond, Mr de Lange. We have dealt with this matter  with the IFP for a long time, and in discussions with the  Afrikaner Volksfront. Even later than that, with the police.  Three weeks before the elections senior police officers came to  see me. I had wanted to see them also, and so we sat and  discussed the need to secure the elections to make sure that  there was no violence. We set up a joint task force which then  met every day. So by the time we came to election day we were  quite familiar with where the problems might come from. There  was a danger that there might be an eruption somewhere, but I  think the positions that were taken up by the Freedom Front and  by the police (made a big difference).</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / French clear Maastricht treaty hurdle PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand yesterday scored an important victory when parliament voted overwhelmingly to change the French constitution as the first step towards ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. The vote passed off without disruption after farmers called off an attempt to blockade roads around Paris in protest at EC agricultural reforms which will lead to sharp cuts in farm prices. The radical farmers' group Co-ordination Rurale accused riot police of using 'brutal' tactics to remove the roadblocks. The decisive 592-73 vote by a joint parliamentary session at Versailles will be an important morale booster for Mr Mitterrand at the European Community summit in Lisbon at the end of this week. It may help offset the psychological effect of Danish rejection of the treaty earlier this month. Ratification itself will be subject to a popular referendum in the autumn, but the size of yesterday's parliamentary majority suggests that most of the mainstream parties on the left and the centre-right will campaign for a Yes vote. Only two political groups expressed systematic opposition to the constitutional revision: almost all the Communists voted against the revision; almost all the Gaullists refused to take part. The Gaullists, deeply divided between those who are sceptical about the EC and those who are totally hostile to the Maastricht treaty, saved the appearance of party unity by walking out of the parliamentary session. They declared there was no case for a constitutional revision, since the Danish No vote had made the treaty null and void. In practice, the Gaullist walk-out only magnified the scale of the government majority, which far exceeded the minimum three-fifths majority required. 'We must not miss our rendezvous,' said Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, when he opened the special session of the two houses of parliament in Versailles. 'Europe is union, and union is strength.' The most significant symbolic innovation introduced by the vote is that the EC is now part of the French constitution, in a chapter entitled: 'Of the European communities and of European union.' The most important substantive changes are provisions allowing France to take part in economic and monetary union, admitting that French visa policy may be subject to majority voting in the Community, and permitting EC citizens resident in France to take part in French local elections. The government has had to make two significant concessions to the conservative opposition parties. Voting in local elections will be a possibility, but not a right; and the French parliament will have increased rights to scrutinise Community legislation before the French government agrees to it.

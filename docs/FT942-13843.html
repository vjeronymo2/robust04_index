			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: MCI Communications surges MCI Communications, the second-largest long-distance telephone company in the US, yesterday reported a 38 per cent increase in first-quarter profits to Dollars 209m, or 39 cents a share. A year ago, the company earned Dollars 151m, or 28 cents, although that figure included a modest charge taken to cover the early retirement of debt. Revenues were up 15 per cent at Dollars 3.22bn, and traffic volume rose more than 16 per cent. The first three months of the year were a busy period for MCI, which announced several strategic initiatives during the quarter. These included: the investment of Dollars 1.3bn in an alliance with Nextel Communications and Comcast to provide digital wireless personal communications services developed by Motorola; the acquisition of BT North America as part of an alliance with British Telecommunications; and a joint venture with Banacci, Mexico's largest financial group, to compete for long-distance business in Mexico. MCI said the key to its growth was the steady winning of new customers. New revenue commitments from large business accounts were up more than 50 per cent on the previous three months.</p>

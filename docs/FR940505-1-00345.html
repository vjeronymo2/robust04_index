This paragraph shall not apply to those innovative products which have VOC emissions less than the appropriate lowered VOC standard and for which a written notification of the product's emissions status versus the lowered VOC standard has been submitted to and approved by the Administrator at least 60 days before the effective date of such standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) If the Administrator believes that a consumer product for which an exemption has been granted no longer meets the criteria for an innovative product specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, the Administrator may modify or revoke the exemption as necessary to assure that the product will meet these criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No later than three months after the effective date of this section, each manufacturer of an antiperspirant or deodorant subject to this article shall clearly display on each container of antiperspirant or deodorant, the date on which the product was manufactured, or a code indicating such date.

Compliance determination based on these records may not be used unless the manufacturer of a consumer product keeps accurate records for each day of production of the amount and chemical composition of the individual product constituents. These records must be kept for at least five years. In the event of a conflict between EPA and a manufacturer over the results of compliance testing, EPA's results shall be used as the determinant result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;52.2958  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Aerosol coating products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section shall apply to any person who sells, supplies, offers for sale, applies, or manufactures aerosol coating products for use in the state of California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply.

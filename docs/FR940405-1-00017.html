			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SBA also has been making physical injury disaster loans to media concerns and academic schools since 1953, based on humanitarian grounds. The disaster loan program attempts to restore to an injured party that which was lost due to circumstances beyond its control. No distinction is made for eligibility purposes between media and non-media concerns for physical disaster loans, but economic injury disaster loans are subject to the limitations of the media policy rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA believes that the assistance it presently makes available under the exceptions to the media rule and under the SBIC and disaster programs are not sufficient to assist small businesses in the media industries which are demonstrably in need of increased aid. Accordingly, SBA is proposing to change its policy so as to make assistance available, under the 7(a) business, economic injury disaster and development company loan programs, to media concerns which are otherwise eligible for such assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While SBA is proposing to repeal the present rule primarily in order to make assistance available to a larger universe of small businesses, it is not unmindful of the implications of a total reversal of the policy. It has considered whether the policy determinations which where the underpinnings of the former rule should be maintained. After careful review, SBA is persuaded that repeal is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A revision of the present rule which would attempt to differentiate among media businesses on the basis of business activity likely would be challenged in court. There is a risk that such proposed revision would be found unconstitutional. Keeping the Government from becoming involved with controversial speech may be a worthy goal, but it arguably puts the Government in the position of allocating benefits with reference to the content of speech. This type of decision could be held by courts to be in conflict with the First Amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SBA believes that it present regulatory apparatus and administrative practice are sufficient to protect the public interest. In this regard, the present credit criteria under which applications for such assistance are reviewed and the prohibition on funding illegal activities should be sufficient to provide the desired level of protection.

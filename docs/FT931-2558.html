			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Yeltsin will play by the rules: but what are they? - John Lloyd on the constitutional jigsaw that limits president's options in his struggle with congress RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin and his supporters among the Group of Seven industrial countries have indicated that he should stay within the law in his bitter power struggle with the conservative Russian Congress. Though leaving some ambiguity on how far they would support Mr Yeltsin if he adopted authoritarian powers, most G7 governments and Mr Yeltsin himself have made clear that the game should be played, as far as possible, by the rules. Those rules are the existing constitution of the Russian Federation, a Soviet-era document adopted in April 1978 and amended nine times before Mr Yeltsin's battle with congress began. Last week congress substantially weakened the office of the president by cancelling its agreement with Mr Yeltsin last December under which a referendum was agreed for April 11 and amendments to three clauses of the constitution, to which the president had objected, were frozen. This has left the president at the pleasure of congress: the amendments now added to clauses 109 and 121 allow parliament to suspend any presidential decree pending a revision by the constitutional court, and to sack the president if he commits an act it deems unconstitutional. Though the decisions of congress mark a shift in the balance of power between president and parliament, the problem already existed. Parliament - the congress and the smaller, permanent supreme soviet - is governed by a constitution which gives it total power because in the era in which it was written it was understood that no representative body had any real power over the Communist party. Thus the excision of the party from national life has left a Soviet-era parliament basing its argument for democratic authority on a Soviet era constitution. How does Mr Yeltsin break out of this without violating that same constitution? In particular, how does he take his arguments to the people by offering them a referendum, or plebiscite, on who rules the country and, as he wishes, on the private ownership of land? The answer is he probably cannot, but his advisers will try. They will base their arguments on the constitution and the law on referendums. Both give the congress and supreme soviet pride of place in approving a referendum: the president's men are forced to make four, apparently rather narrow points. First, the constitution gives - literally - 'all power. . . to the multinational people'. Since a referendum asks people's opinion, it cannot be cancelled. Second, though the constitution and the law on referendums gives deputies the right to call a referendum, it nowhere gives them the right to cancel it: thus they cannot abridge the December agreement. Third, a referendum can be demanded by the signatures of 1m people (for which a campaign has started), and the law on referendums and the constitution state that parliament must then agree to holding it. Last, article 5 of the constitution allows the 'most important issues. . . to be put to popular discussion' as a prelim-inary to a referendum. A plebiscite, it is argued, counts as part of a 'popular discussion'. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister who made his mark as Mr Yeltsin's legal adviser, sought to talk down the air of crisis when he told the Russkii Vesti newspaper that 'it should be obvious to everyone that no extraordinary measures can be taken by anyone - not the president, nor the congress, nor anyone else'. It seems that, in the tradition of Russian politics, there will again be a lull - though perhaps only a short one - before the next storm.</p>

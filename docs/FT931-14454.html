			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / EC backs Pounds 6.5bn loan deal for Italy EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday approved an Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.5bn) balance of payments loan to Italy to bolster the Rome government's efforts to control its huge budget deficit and overhaul the economy. The loan, which is conditional on periodic EC reviews of the budgetary programme, imposes an external discipline which the government of Mr Giuliano Amato views as vital to winning political support at home. Italy asked for the loan last October, partly to offset the loss of reserves used to support the lira during the September crisis inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Greece and Italy have received similar loans, but this is believed to be the largest of its kind involving the EC using its own guarantees to raise money on the capital markets. According to the agreement reached yesterday in Brussels, Italy will be paid the loan in four tranches of Ecu2bn, two to be paid this year no earlier than February 1 and July 31 respectively; the last two will be paid in 1994 and 1995. Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, outlined a set of conditions: The ratio of Italy's debt to GDP will peak in 1994 to 112 1/2 per cent and then begin to fall; Italy will take further fiscal steps if the government's borrowing requirements increase; The government will pursue reforms in health, pensions, the civil service and local finance; disbursement of the loan will be on 'performance not dates', according to Mr Christophersen. Italian officials said the loan should help pave the way for the re-entry of the lira into the ERM 'as soon as possible', as part of the central bank's efforts to replenish its reserves. But re-entry must be at a 'sustainable parity' which would prove lasting, according to Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's Treasury minister. Mr Christophersen paid tribute to the Amato government's 'courageous measures' to reform the economy, but it was his impression that Rome favoured a step by step approach to the ERM: 'It is a little too early to define a realistic exchange rate (for the lira).' Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German ministry of finance, said ministers were looking forward to seeing the lira return to the ERM, but 'on a solid basis'.</p>

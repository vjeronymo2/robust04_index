			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Engineering workers on strike in Italy Engineering workers throughout Italy yesterday staged two stoppages in protest over employers' refusal to pay index-linked wages, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The protest was also backed by CGIL, the largest of the three main trade union confederations, with members striking in local administration and some schools. The strikes were a foretaste of tough negotiations on wages and labour costs between the unions, employers and the government due to begin on Monday.</p>

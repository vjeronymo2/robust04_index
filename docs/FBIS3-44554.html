China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which oversees  the country's onshore oil exploration and development, is  expected to pump 1 million tons of oil in the shallow waters  along the country's coastline in 1994.    Reports say exploration in offshore areas where the water is  no deeper than 5 metres has made considerable progress.    In China, exploration and development in offshore areas  where  the waters are deeper than 5 metres are conducted by another oil  firm -- China National Offshore Oil Corporation.    Three large onshore oilfields, whose oil deposits stretch  into the continental shelf, have been explored for two years.    However, development of oil there had not begun until  recently when a platform passed state appraisal at Shengli Oil  Field, the country's second-largest oil field.    The platform, named Development No 1, passed the appraisals  after 16 months' trial operation. This marked the official  beginning of oil development in the continental shelf, according  to oil industry officials.    The platform, which can be moved by a vessel or be seated on  muddy or sandy seabeds, has the structure and necessary  facilities to resist earthquakes, strong winds, and tidal waves.    The first one of its kind in China, the design of the  platform was one of the key technological projects listed in the  Eighth Five- Year Plan that ends in 1995.    With it, Shengli Oil Field has developed three oil wells and  produced more than 8,000 tons of oil.    Before that, Shengli Oil Field had explored areas in the  shallow waters for about two years.    A news release from CNPC last week revealed another movable  platform for oil development in shallow waters was ready for use  at Shengli.    The platform, named Development No 2, which was completed at  the end of November, will be used in areas where water is 1.5 to  9 metres deep.    The platform, equipped with facilities to generate  electricity and treat oil-contaminated water, can be used to  develop three oil wells at one time.    It can also gather and transmit data on winds and sea waves.    The release says the platform, now in trial use, is to be  ready for state appraisal within months.    Development in the shallow waters is important for old oil  fields, where stable production in onshore areas has become  difficult after decades of exploitation.    Another two oil fields at Liaohe and Dagang are also being  studied to find ways to develop oil deposits in shallow waters.    The official from CNPC revealed that the corporation will  seek preferential policies from the government to encourage oil  fields to develop the continental shelf.    When the policies are applied oil fields will be allowed to  sell oil developed in the shallow waters at market prices.    Chinese onshore oil fields produce some 138 million tons of  oil a year but most of the oil is priced low and distributed by  the government.</p>

According to the poll, 61 percent of Germans think that the  SPD will win the Bundestag elections in October. In February  this was the opinion of only 49 percent. Only 23 percent still  think that the government coalition will win -- six percentage  points less than a month before. According to the poll,  approval for a potential red-green coalition at the federal  level has also increased. It rose by 9 percentage points to 31  percent most recently.    Another picture resulted from the question about voting  behavior if elections were held next Sunday. The SPD got 39  percent -- just as much as in February. The Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union lost 1 percentage point  and went down to 36 percent. The Free Democratic Party of  Germany remained unchanged at 6 percent and the Alliance  90/Greens at 9 percent. The right-wing extremist Republikaner  received 4 percent and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the  successor of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, 3 percent.</p>

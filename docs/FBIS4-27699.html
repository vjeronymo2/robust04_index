			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By economic reporter Hiroshi Yamazaki] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] is expected to face a  new and difficult issue in connection with the Japan-U.S. trade  talks, the parties to which have agreed to resume negotiations.  The issue consists of the U.S. Government's request to add  financial services to the priority sectors, which means that  other facets of the financial sector will potentially become  targets of negotiations following the imminent agreement on the  insurance sector. The setting of numerical goals has been  avoided, but the agreement to resume the talks included  provision for measurement of "market participation and sales  expansion" for each sector, which would indicate difficult  negotiations for the MOF.    The trade talks targeted financial services from the very  beginning, but the recent request was a move to make financial  services a priority negotiating goal on a par with insurance,  automobiles, and government procurement. According to the MOF,  in past negotiations, the U.S. Government sought 1) relaxation  of controls on management of public annuity funds, 2)  modification of the rule that managing underwriting services are  limited to four major securities firms, and 3) clarification of  government controls over financial services.    The primary focus will be directed at restrictions on the  management of public annuity funds. The Pension Welfare Service  Public Corporation has contracted with life insurance companies  and trust and banking companies to manage a portion of the  welfare annuity and national annuity funds, but the U.S.  Government has asked that the management of such funds be  extended to investment consulting firms. The Ministry of Health  and Welfare had once filed the same request with the MOF, but  the MOF which issues loans for the management of the funds  rejected the request, saying such action would expose the funds  to mismanagement, indicating that negotiations with the U.S.  Government will inevitably encounter difficulty.    The MOF comments, "We have merely heard of the U.S.  request,"  about the demand for priority negotiations, but confidentially  they are concerned. Since early in the negotiations, the U.S.  representatives have said that numerical goals were not sought  for the insurance sector and, according to sources at the  International Finance Bureau, if talks are resumed, "We can be  assured of an agreement" by July. He takes that position  because, just as it appeared that the pending issues would be  resolved, the financial services issue which was expected to be  presented somewhat later was suddenly tabled.    However, the U.S. Government had sought decontrol of  Japanese  financial markets until the final stages of the Uruguay Round  negotiations, and U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.  Summers gave a speech in March 1994, indicating the intention to  make financial services a point of emphasis in trade talks with  Japan. Moreover, legislation is pending in Congress to virtually  target Japan for retaliation in the financial services sector.  Considering the atmosphere in the United States, it could be  seen that it was only a matter of time before additional facets  of the financial sector would be made targets of the trade talks.    The concern of the Japanese Government was reflected in the  items concurred with in the agreement to resume the trade talks.  Both governments agreed that "market participation and sales  increases for competitive foreign products" would be sought for  each principal sector. The U.S. Government declared that it  would not seek numerical goals, but this agreement can be  interpreted to indicate that Japan promised "to ensure a  definite increase in foreign product sales."    In the financial services sector, the U.S. Government seeks  dismantling of virtual monopoly by four major securities firms,  and there is the risk that the failure of U.S. firms to increase  their underwriting share could be treated as a violation of the  agreement. The U.S. side is expected to demand decontrol of the  markets in lieu of numerical goals, and the MOF, which had  agreed to this particular approach in order to win resumption of  the trade talks, may find itself obligated to follow such an  approach.</p>

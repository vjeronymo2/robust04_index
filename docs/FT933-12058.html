			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Department store sales suffer record fall SALES at Japanese department stores were 8.9 per cent lower last month than a year earlier, highlighting the continuing decline in personal consumption and increased competition from discount houses. The fall was the largest on record, the Japan Department Stores' Association said, and was partly caused by unfavourable weather. Japan's unusually cool June, brought an 8.5 per cent decrease in clothing sales, which account for just under half of all sales. Apart from waning consumer confidence because of lower bonus payments and overtime cuts, department stores have been losing customers to discount clothing and electrical goods houses. The association said companies had also cut their spending on mid-year gifts for clients. Sales of personal items slipped 4.8 per cent, household goods were down 12.6 per cent, and foods by 5.7 per cent. Tokyo department store sales fell 13.4 per cent, while sales in regional areas contracted 6.6 per cent. The decline in personal consumption has prompted debate among Japanese business leaders on the need for a cut in income tax or official interest rates to stimulate demand. Finance Ministry officials are opposed to a tax cut because the government is already having difficulty balancing the budget.</p>

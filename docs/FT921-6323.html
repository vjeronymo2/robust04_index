			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Heseltine move to boost rural jobs RURAL job creation schemes and new guidance on planning for rural development were part of an Action for the Countryside package launched by the government yesterday. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said the package demonstrated a new co-ordinated government approach to conservation and development. 'There has to be development if our countryside is to survive in good heart into the next century,' he said. The package is a joint initiative by the environment department, the agriculture ministry and three countryside organisations. Much of it is a reshaping of existing schemes and finance, but Mr Heseltine said Pounds 31.5m of new money would be allocated over the next three years. Schemes to boost rural economies will be run through the Rural Development Commission. More money is to go into grants for the conversion of redundant buildings in agricultural areas into tourist accommodation or shops. Mr Heseltine said the government remained committed to strict planning control in green belts. But it would promote a shift in emphasis from retaining farmland to developing rural economies while protecting landscapes and wildlife habitats.</p>

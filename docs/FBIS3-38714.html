He compared the current NATO  stand regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina to that of a charity  organization such as the Red Cross. Yilmaz stressed that the  Alliance must change its stand. This incident shows the extent  to which the Alliance is passive, he stated.    Yilmaz said: At minimum, the innocent people who are being  attacked must be given the chance to procure arms to defend  themselves.</p>

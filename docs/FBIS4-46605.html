			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article from press service of the NHU [National Guard of </F> Ukraine] commander and Ukrinform under the rubric "In the  National Guard": "Can You Have Forgotten That We Are Brethren?"]    [Text] The military compound of the subunit of the National  Guard in the city of Sevastopol has been under the vigilant  attention of persons unknown lately. Individuals armed with  firearms have repeatedly penetrated the NHU facility, which is  protected only by an unarmed day detail, at night.    Tactical classes of Marines from the Black Sea Fleet are  being conducted immediately adjacent to the premises where the  Guardsmen are based.    The operation of the Guardsmen's electronic-warfare (REB)  systems was suppressed for several hours, while telephone  communications were cut and were restored only with the aid of  internal-affairs bodies.    Unknown persons in civilian dress but a clear military  bearing are constantly near the checkpoint of the subunit. It  has moreover been ascertained that someone has prepared 200  meters of the common roadway leading to the military compound  for demolition--the locations for the placement of explosives  are linked by an electrical network.    A joint police and Guard patrol that was assigned to guard  this area on the night of May 25 set up an ambush close to the  NHU unit. Soon, around 1:30, the sentries noticed an unknown  person who, seeing people in uniform, threw something away and  took to his heels. But in vain. The detainee had on himself  military kit, a pistol holster and the special matches of  reconnaissance personnel. Five kilograms of TNT and a TT pistol  were found at the scene of the incident. The unknown person was  ascertained to be citizen D. Yoho, and was transferred to the  proper authorities. An investigation is underway.    The press service of the National Guard of Ukraine is  calling  on all soldiers who are serving on the Crimean peninsula not to  permit such acts of provocation among themselves, and to resolve  problems in an evenhanded and friendly manner in the name of  peace and harmony in the region.    Can it really be permitted that the servicemen of Ukraine  and  Russia fight, that mutual hatred fill our hearts? Think about  it--to whose advantage is this?</p>

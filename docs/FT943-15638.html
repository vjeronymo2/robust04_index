			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / MPs probe Channel duty dodgers The Commons Treasury committee is to investigate the increase in imports of beer, wine and tobacco from the Continent, which is costing the government millions of pounds a year in lost revenue. Mr John Watts, committee chairman, said he was also concerned about the loss of trade to British distillers, brewers and tobacco manufacturers. 'There is evidence to suggest that much of the increase in imports from the Continent is illegal,' he said. The committee plans to publish a report of its findings in the au-tumn. The committee's decision to launch its review came as British companies yesterday called on the government to reduce excise duties. Mr Simon Redman, chairman of Greene King, the brewing group, said: 'Cheap imports of beer from the Continent are damaging the industry at a substantial cost to the Treasury.' Recent estimates suggest that the Exchequer is losing between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m a year in revenue because of the increase in illegal imports. Mr Michael Jackaman, chairman of Allied-Lyons, said rates of excise duty, which are substantially higher than those in Europe, were encouraging cross-border shopping. 'This trade undermines a key British industry and its contribution to the economy,' he added. Mr Watts said the committee would invite submissions from industry and well as from Customs &amp; Excise. 'This is a very serious matter which is causing concern to both industry and government,' he said. The committee will also study proposals made by the brewers to the Treasury in a Budget submission, which called for a halving of excise duty on beer as a first step towards lowering beer duty to the European average of eight pence a pint by 1997. Mr Redman said that he was hoping for a substantial cut in beer duty in the Budget, and that any reduction would be passed on fully to consumers. He said there was 'irrefutable evidence' that the quantity of beer which is being imported from the Continent for personal consumption is increasing all the time and is now running at the rate of almost 1m pints a day. 'Undoubtedly much of this is for re-sale and therefore illegal,' he added. The Tobacco Manufacturers Association yesterday welcomed the announcement of the committee's review. Mr Clive Turner, director of the association's industrial affairs, said: 'The illegal importing of tobacco and beer is costing the government millions of pounds and should be stopped.'

On 27 April, we completed administrative work to reach this  moment when we will sign the document that the TSE secretary  general will now read:    [Cardoza Ayala] Document No. 19. At the Central American  Room of the Hotel Presidente, San Salvador, at 1700 on 27 April  1994.    At a meeting to conclude the final vote count of the runoff  election for president and vice president of the Republic held  on 24 April, the undersigned Messrs. Magistrate-President Luis  Arturo Zaldivar Romero; Principal Magistrates Jaime Francisco  Romero Ventura, Eduardo Benjamin Colindres, Jose Rutilio  Aguilera Carrera, and Pedro Ricardo Solorzano Burgos; and  Secretary General Miguel Angel Cardoza Ayala proceeded to  conclude the vote count after notifying the representatives of  the Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] and the National  Revolutionary Movement-Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front Alliance, who faced one another in the  runoff election. They also notified Prosecutor General Dr.  Arturo Romeo Melara Granillo. We started this work publicly at  1000 on 26 April, at which time the work tables of the 14  departmental electoral boards were installed.    This vote count was based on vote count certificates from  each Voting Table Board, as well as the general municipal  certificates. We obtained the results detailed in the following  annex.

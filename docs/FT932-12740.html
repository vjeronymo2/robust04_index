			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Observer: Bird of prey winged The fate of the consortium bank might aptly be linked to that of the oofus oofus bird, fabled of course for flying in ever decreasing circles - and then disappearing. Fashionable 20 years ago, the idea of banks of assorted nationalities getting together to do international business they were unable to do separately collapsed as soon as the shareholders found themselves competing with the consortia they part-owned. The latest to come to the end of the line is Intermex. Its main shareholder, Banco Nacional de Mexico, has just said it wants to take over the bank entirely. It is increasing its stake from 51 per cent to almost 75 per cent, and has begun talks to win Bank of England approval to buy out completely the remaining shareholders, Bank of America and the Mexican state-owned institutions Nafinsa and Bancomext. Banamex wants to bring under its wing some Intermex businesses, in particular its Latin American asset trading operation, and is returning to London Rafael Mancera, nephew of the president of the Mexican central bank, who will become head of Banamex's European operations and managing director of Intermex. Unsurprisingly, the changes are not to the liking of Gerard LeGrain, the longstanding managing director of Intermex who, having guided the institution through the debt-distressed 1980s, has now flown the nest.</p>

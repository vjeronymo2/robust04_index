			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Books: Driven to nationalism - The internal struggles of central Asia BETWEEN MARX AND MUHAMMAD by Dilip Hiro HarperCollins Pounds 25, 400 pages In central Asia, always a hotbed of intrigue, an intriguing contest has been played out: in the red corner, socialism, which declared that the brotherhood of man would sweep nationalism away; in the green corner, Islam, believing that God would unite all races of the faithful; and, holding the ring, capitalism, with its promise of a material cornucopia. This is the subject of Dilip Hiro's book. It is a compendious political guide to the internal struggles of central Asia and the south Caucusus, and marks their emergence as geopolitical entities in their own right. Hiro describes how the Bolsheviks' early policy of indulgent assimilation of the semi-nomadic races conquered by the Czars turned to economic exploitation and cultural and religious suppression. Gorbachev's perestroika, aided by such revelations as the cotton scandal in Uzbekistan, destroyed what faith was left in the Kremlin planners. Islamic nationalism was the natural recourse. And yet, as the author shows, the dire forecasts of western analysts have proved wrong. Civil strife did break out - notably in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan - but the presence of fundamentalist Islamic regimes across the southern border in Iran and Afghanistan did not set the region alight. The largely Sunni moslems of central Asia have little religious affinity with Shia Iran - though many sought refuge there over the years - while the government in Teheran has shown a pragmatic reluctance to let its religious enthusiasm interfere with trading prospects. Turkey gloated at the prospect of a pan-Turkic alliance stretching virtually to the Pacific: not only was there a racial and linguistic connection and a coincidence of Sunni belief, but Turkey could offer commercial openings to the west. Yet when the Azeris looked to it for help against the Armenians, they looked in vain. Hiro says Turkey's western assets, in this case membership of NATO, proved as much a liability. He concludes that Russia will continue to be the dominant force in central Asia and Azerbaijan, with Iran and Turkey jostling on the sidelines as complementary suitors. Moscow will treat its former Soviet subjects as client states, much as the US treats the countries of central and south America. This is the reality which the UN appears already to have accepted. Travellers thirsty for the colour and romance of former Soviet central Asia will not find it in this book. Dilip Hiro is a serious, methodical and objective historian of current affairs. But for the growing throng of diplomats and businessmen with an interest in the region - not least in Caspian oil - it must surely be required reading.</p>

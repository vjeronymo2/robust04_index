			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kenan Akin: "Kishinev Notes"] </F>   [Text] The views expressed in my notes from Kiev under the  headline "Demirel's Worries" were "confirmed" just a few hours  after filing them. Among the president's deep worries was also  the "premonition" that Turkey might face great dangers over the  longer period. For that reason, long-term policies, rather than  daily ones, are being formulated.    Demirel desires to establish a balance by trying to contain  the "danger belt" surrounding our country with a new "security  belt."    As regards Demirel's desires, it could be "theoretically  argued that there always existed a potential" of threat, or a  feeling of being under threat; or, it could be recalled that  efforts to formulate such a "security concept" also existed in  the past. However, the revival of the idea of a "security belt"  with the participation of Saudi Arabia and Ukraine should be  regarded as an important development in the region.  <H5>  U.S. Supported It in 1980's </H5>   This new strategy, which was announced by Demirel during an  impromptu conversation, is bound to be an important "phase" in  ensuring peace and prosperity in the region. It should not be  forgotten that this new international restructuring, which could  also be described as a "security umbrella," would be supported  by the United States. This is because long-standing U.S. ties  with Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey have laid the  "foundation" for such an important step. In this way, the  United States will "secure" the Middle East, particularly the  oil routes.    The various dimensions of this new development--which is  tantamount to establishing control over Russia above all, as  well as over Iran, Iraq, Syria, and the future Palestinian  state--will gradually become apparent in the near future.    The dimensions of this "security belt were examined during  Demirel's flight from Kiev to Kishinev. [quotation marks as  published]    By the way, Demirel's decision to take a higher profile on  the international political scene henceforth is already evident.</p>

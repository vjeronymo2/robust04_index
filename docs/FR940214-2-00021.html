Natural proposes to leave the pipe in place in sensitive areas (such as waterbody crossings, wetland crossings, and areas of cultural and sensitive biological resources) where it believes removal activities could result in significant environmental impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amarillo No. 1 mainline is next to the Amarillo No. 4 mainline.

Areas of steep slope, staging areas, and other areas where additional right-of-way would be needed to permit safe construction would be identified on a site-specific basis. No new permanent right-of-way would be required. Abandonment of all 490 miles of pipe by removal and construction of the replacement pipeline would disturb about 5,900 acres. Most of the acreage disturbed would consist of existing pipeline right-of-way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One storage yard, about 4 acres in size, would be required for each of the four segments of new pipeline. Storage yards, about 6 acres in size, would be required about every 50 miles for the removal of the abandoned Amarillo No. 1 mainline. Private roads/lanes would be used to access the pipeline during construction and removal. These roads may require repair and upgrading to support increased traffic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The EA Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By the Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction, operation, and abandonment of the proposed project facilities under these general headings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Geology and soils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water resources, fisheries,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and wetlands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vegetation and wildlife  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Endangered and threatened species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Land use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cultural resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Hazardous waste <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings. A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will then consider all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Currently Identified Environmental Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the environmental information provided by Natural. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list; the list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our own analysis. The currently identified issues are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The removal of abandoned pipeline and construction of new pipeline could affect 30.42 acres of wetlands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The project could cross habitat of the least tern, bald eagle, and whooping crane (federally listed endangered species) and of the piping plover (a federally listed threatened species).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The project could cross habitat of the Arkansas darter, Arkansas river shiner, snowy plover, and eastern spotted skunk (Federal candidate species).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pipeline would be abandoned within the Fort Larned National Historic Site (a National Historic Landmark).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The abandoned pipe may be coated with materials that contain asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

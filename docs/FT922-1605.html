			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Management: Fired with a new enthusiasm - Many arms manufacturers have been seeking to diversify. But BAe's missile makers have been concentrating on what they know best Diversification has become the siren song of arms manufacturers facing reductions in defence spending. But at Britain's principal missile factory, managers have closed their ears to it. They take pride in having chosen just the opposite course. Instead of making use of existing skills to branch out of a depressed defence market into civilian products, British Aerospace managers are sticking to what they know. They have reduced the range of activities at the plant at Lostock near Bolton and are training employees in new skills to improve performance in the core activity of guided weapons. After a period when the future of the business was in serious doubt, the Lostock plant is a changed place. The machinery in what used to be one of the largest machine shops in Europe has been thinned out. The plant has been converted wholesale to Japanese methods of assembly and inventory control, even in specialised low-volume production lines. Round tables have been installed for morning and afternoon performance review meetings. People who worked as machinists can now be seen braiding tresses of electrical wires. Concentrating on core activities was a risky gamble, since the outlook in those activities was far from secure. Until very recently, there were questions over all the division's big new projects. Throughout 1990, BAe's plan was to merge the division with the guidance systems activities of France's Thomson-CSF. But its own business prospects appeared to get steadily bleaker and the merger plan fell through early last year. The British government was threatening to pull out of a multinational project for a new long-range anti-tank weapon involving BAe as the UK partner. The division was also being challenged over its biggest single project: a GEC-Matra consortium was competing to supply the RAF with a new air-to-air missile. If it won, the inevitable next step seemed to be a takeover of BAe's missile operations by GEC. This year its fortunes have turned, with a batch of orders worth more than Pounds 700m. In the interim, BAe's workforce in the Dynamics division has been cut from 16,500 to below 6,000 and the number of big sites from seven to three. Almost all the manufacturing has been concentrated at Lostock. The buildings date from the 1930s, a former de Havilland factory with a long record of diversified aerospace business. In 1988, guided weapons made up only about half the workload. 'What we'd got here was a real mish-mash of everything,' says Tom Nicholson, operations manager of BAe's Dynamics division. Don Dewin, the current general manager for the site, found 'an unsuccessful business unit that was a law unto itself'. Everything was done on-site, from printed circuit-boards to machining nuts and bolts. 'Their standards of success were all about technical performance,' says Nicholson. 'The concept of competitive advantage wasn't understood.' Employees were presented in stark terms with the problems of the business: high costs, high work-in-progress, late deliveries, customer dissatisfaction. 'Existing work is insufficient and the site is grossly overloaded,' said an internal management pamphlet. The management gave itself until the end of 1992. Although more production has been moved to Lostock, the workforce has been almost halved to about 1,400. Demarcation lines have vanished. 'It used to be one man, one skill, one task, one machine,' says Nicholson. 'Now one man can look after three or four machines.' Works convener Frank Hilton admits the lessons were hard to swallow. 'Nobody likes change,' he says. But the need was accepted and the transformation has taken place without industrial disputes. The traditional hierarchy, involving between eight and 11 layers, has gone. Between Dewin and the shopfloor there are now just three layers - head of manufacturing, group leader and team leader. The company is moving towards a flexible, multi-skilled workforce in which each operator is trained to inspect the quality of his own work. Last year, the plant began its conversion to the Kawasaki Production System, applied by consultants Price Waterhouse under a licensing agreement with the Japanese group. The aim is to create a logical work flow, based on integrated teams, and to compress inventories and lead times. When production of the RAF's new Alarm anti-radar missile began in 1989, the manufacturing cycle was 80 weeks. It is now 30. Kawasaki itself has extended the system - designed to ensure that components arrive only when they are needed - from motor-cycle production to other sectors including aerospace. In the UK, says Andy Taylor of Price Waterhouse, 'very few companies have taken it wholeheartedly on board.' The big challenge at Lostock, says Taylor, has been to apply the same principles used in flowline production to 'one-offs', complex products made in small numbers, such as the ground equipment for the new-generation Rapier 2,000 air defence system. Confident that it now has its own manufacturing process under control, BAe Dynamics has started programmes for working with its suppliers on similar lines. Nicholson recognises that the Lostock plant is still 'a long way from best Japanese practices'. But he reckons it is one or two years ahead of BAe's cash-rich military aircraft division, which has not yet had to face an abyss. Says Nicholson: 'There couldn't have been a better climate to do it in'.</p>

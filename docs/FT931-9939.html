			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / India's exports fall by 12.5% INDIA'S exports in December fell 12.5 per cent to Dollars 1.48bn (Pounds 980m), against the equivalent month in 1991, due to weak demand in the former Soviet Union, the disruptive impact of a prolonged domestic airline strike and unrest following destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. The figures, released yesterday, confirm the damage done to foreign trade by disruption to travel caused by the strike, and through the violence in Indian cities after the mosque was sacked on December 6. The fall in exports will hit hopes of achieving a target of 10 per cent export growth in the year to the end of March 1993. A boost to exports is a key element in India's economic reform programme. It needs them to pay for imports of oil and capital equipment. Imports in December grew 2.6 per cent to Dollars 1.94bn, making for a monthly trade deficit of Dollars 460m. For the nine months to end-December, the deficit was Dollars 3.55bn, more than double the Dollars 1.63bn in the equivalent period of 1991. Exports rose 3.4 per cent, with those to countries outside the former Soviet bloc up 11.4 per cent. Imports for the nine months rose 16.5 per cent.</p>

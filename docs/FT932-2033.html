			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television If the sun shines this could be good day to bunk off. Pop a bottle of Australian Chardonnay in the fridge, half close the curtains, and switch on BBC1 at 10.55 this morning for the final day of Cricket: Second Test from Lord's. At noon BBC2 brings live coverage of the opening matches from Wimbledon, then, from 2.00 until 8.00, combines Cricket And Wimbledon. If your only chance is to catch up this evening, BBC1 offers an hour of Today At Wimbledon at 10.20 and 40 minutes of Cricket at 12.45. Horizon returns to one of the passions of popular science in the 70s, teaching chimpanzees to 'talk' or anyway communicate (8.00 BBC2). World In Action provides 'A Gentleman's Guide To Tax Avoidance'; and Panorama, after hurricanes, terrorism, tanker disasters and scores of actions for negligence and fraud, considers 'Lloyd's Last Chance'. In the second of his series on the claims of conventional and alternative health care, Magic Or Medicine?, Rob Buckman considers the growing popularity of alternative approaches. (9.00 C4).</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Total disappoints with 47% decline in first half TOTAL, one of France's largest oil groups, saw its net profits fall by 47 per cent to FFr1.91bn (Dollars 406.3m) from FFr3.61bn in the first half of the year. This was mainly due to depressed refinery prices, squeezed margins and the impact of the dollar's decline against the European currencies. The interim results were well below the expectations of the Paris oil analysts, who had been forecasting first-half profits of between FFr2.2bn and FFr2.4bn. The disappointing figures from Total reflect the general trend among large French companies, which have recently released a series of lacklustre sales and profit figures for the first half. Total's shares have fallen sharply on the Paris stock market in recent weeks on concern about the implications of the continuing decline of the dollar. They slipped again yesterday, falling FFr1.5 to FFr207.3, compared with FFr230, the price at which the French government sold a FFr9.5bn stake in the group in June. The shares were unaffected by the first-half figures which were published after the stock market closed. Group sales fell to FFr68.76bn from FFr69.58bn during the first six months of the year. Operating income slipped to FFr3.4bn from FFr5.77bn and cashflow to FFr5.29bn from FFr7.61bn. Earnings per share were reduced by more than half to FFr9.0 from FFr18.8. The worst affected area of Total's activities was refining where operating income declined dramatically to FFr932m from FFr3.08bn. This was partly due to a 'significant decrease' in European refining margins, which more than halved from an average of Dollars 5.2 a barrel in the first half of 1991, to an average of Dollars 2.1 in the corresponding period this year because of weak demand and high stocks. Exploration and production sustained a slight decline in operating income to FFr1.31bn from FFr1.42bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Open regionalism, growth  with social equity, and the strengthening of democracy are the  main proposals Chilean President Eduardo Frei will present to  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Chiefs of State and  Governments to be held on 14 and 15 June in Cartagena de Indias  (Colombia).    This announcement was made by Foreign Relations Under  Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza, who said Frei will leave for  Cartagena on 13 June with a small delegation aboard a commercial  flight.    Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will leave for  Cartagena on 11 June to attend the preparatory meetings at the  foreign minister level to decide on the proposals to be debated  by the chiefs of state and governments.    Figueroa also confirmed that President Frei will meet with  Spanish King Juan Carlos. He will probably meet with Bolivian  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, and Cuban President Fidel  Castro. These meetings will depend on Frei's agenda.    Insulza confirmed that the Chilean Government has approved  the agenda of the summit which will center mainly on economic  issues. He added that Frei will promote open regionalism, a  policy which Chile has successfully developed at the trade level  through bilateral and multilateral agreements.    He said the Chilean Government wants a regional debate on  growth with equity because it considers overcoming poverty to be  the most important challenge for the countries of the region.    Regarding democracy, Inzulza said Chile advocates a stronger  and better democracy in Ibero-America, efficient governments,  honest administrations, and modernization of the state.    Inzulza added that Frei's proposals to the summit are  closely  linked to the general guidelines of his administration.    Frei was inaugurated last March after winning the December  1993 elections with 58 percent of the vote. He chose as his  government priority the fight against poverty through growth  with equity.    To do this he created a national commission to fight  poverty,  which affects 4 million Chileans; some 1.2 million live in  extreme poverty.</p>

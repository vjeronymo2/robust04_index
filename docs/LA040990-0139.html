			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL '90 PREVIEW;  </P> <P> STARTING PITCHING  </P> <P> Bruce Hurst. Eric Show. Andy Benes. Dennis Rasmussen. Ed Whitson . . . Sure,  there are questions. Will Show's back be able to withstand the rigors of a full  season? Will Benes go on to brilliance or pitch like someone with two months of  big league experience? Will Rasmussen struggle as he did a year ago or perform  brilliantly as he did in 1988? Will Whitson return for an encore or was last  year a mirage?. . . . Only Hurst, who has averaged 16 victories a season for  the past three years, enters the season without any questions. In his first  season in the National League, he tied for first in complete games with 10, and  was fourth in innings pitched with 244 2/3. His changeup is what makes him so  effective. . . . Show underwent surgery in August to remove a disc from his  lower back. He has not pitched in a major league game since June 25. . . .  Benes was voted the rookie pitcher of the year by The Sporting News, despite  playing in the majors just two months. Benes proved to be Dodger pitcher Orel  Hershiser's biggest nemesis, beating Hershiser, 1-0, in each of his two starts  against them. . . . Rasmussen, who pitched just one complete game last year, is  due to for a splendid season. In even-numbered years, Rasmussen has posted a  43-22 record. In odd-numbered years, he is 26-23. . . . Whitson is coming off  the finest season of his 12-year career, establishing career bests with 16  victories and a 2.66 ERA.  </P> <P> He was 9-2 in his first 12 starts, but won just two games after July 5. He gave  up 22 homers, but 16 were with the bases empty, and the other six were with  just one runner on.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RELIEF PITCHING  </P> <P> Pat Clements. Mark Grant. Greg Harris. Craig Lefferts. Calvin Schiraldi. Rafael  Valdez. . . . So much for the easy times. Mark Davis and his 44 saves fled to  Kansas City, leaving the Padres with five relievers who combined for 29 saves  last year. . . . Lefferts, who had 20 for the San Francisco Giants last season,  is being counted on to fill the shoes of Davis. Lefferts opened last season  with 13 2/3 consecutive shutout innings, retiring 29 batters in a row. In his  first 17 appearances, he allowed just one run in 25 1/3, posting a 0.36 ERA. He  relies heavily on his screwball and must have location with his fastball to be  effective. . . . He's expected to receive right-handed help from Harris, who  might have the best arm on the staff. Harris would likely be a starter in any  other organization and one day might be added to the rotation. But the Padres  need him to be a stopper and setup man for the bullpen. Last season, he saved  six games in eight opportunities and allowed just six of 28 inherited runners  to score. . . . Grant and Clements are capable middle relievers and will be  used to set up the save situations. Grant and Clements will each be primarily  pitching in middle and long relief. McKeon is looking for more consistency out  of the two. Grant is coming off the finest season of his career, going 8-2 with  a 3.33 ERA in 50 relief appearances. It was the first time since his  professional career began in 1981 that he did not make a start. Clements' only  defeat of the year occurred in his only start, July 1 in St. Louis. He'll also  be used in spot situations this season to face left-handed hitters. . . .  Schiraldi is the wild card of the bullpen. The Padres hope he'll fit into the  stopper's picture. If not, he'll be used as the setup man. Schiraldi, who  joined the Padres on Aug. 30, 1989, can be used in all roles. He would rather  start, if he had his choice, but for now will remain in the bullpen. He'll be  the man to join the rotation if one of the starters falters. . . . The bullpen  has one rare quality. All but Lefferts started at least one game last season. .  . . Valdez will be on the roster for the first three weeks of the season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CATCHER  </P> <P> Benito Santiago will play all but 25 or 30 games. Mark Parent will play the  rest. . . . Santiago just received a hefty raise to $1.25 million. His  relationship with his manager never has been better. The Padres expect great  improvement over his 1989 season in which he batted .236 with 16 homers and 62  RBIs. . . . Few in the league are better than Parent in his role.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FIRST BASE  </P> <P> It wasn't the kind of club record the Padres were looking for when Jack Clark  walked a record-setting 132 times. But after hitting just .217 with nine homers  and 39 RBIs through June 28, Clark finished the last three months by hitting 17  homers and driving in 55 runs with a .267 batting average. He finished the year  with 26 homers and 94 RBIs. Now, with Joe Carter batting behind him, those  figures should only increase. . . . Before you ignore the contributions Phil  Stephenson could provide, you might want to note that he's the best defensive  first baseman on the team, set the NCAA record at Wichita State with 87 stolen  bases in 1982 and was a consistent .300 hitter in the minors. . . . Rob Nelson  will remain with the team as one of three extra players allowed until May 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SECOND BASE  </P> <P> Roberto Alomar, 22, is a rotisserie player's dream. He has speed. He has power.  He makes contact. He hit .295 with seven homers and 56 RBIs in 1989, and  figures to only improve this season. It's essential that he improves in the  field. He made a league-high 28 errors last season, much too many for a player  of his talents. . . . Joey Cora will be Alomar's primary backup. He's a contact  hitter with no power and decent range in the field.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THIRD BASE  </P> <P> Bip Roberts will never win a Gold Glove, but his quickness and agility enable  him to be an everyday third baseman, if McKeon chooses. Roberts' strength is  his offense. He scored 81 runs in just 329 plate-appearances as the Padres'  leadoff hitter last season. He's capable of playing any position with the  exception of catcher, first base and pitcher. . . . Mike Pagliarulo will play  primarily against right-handed pitchers. He hit just .154 against lefties last  season and likely will be allowed to face few this season. He's a solid  defensive third baseman with a strong arm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHORTSTOP  </P> <P> Garry Templeton's left knee prevents him from having adequate range. Too many  ground balls get past him, say the critics, but he possesses a strong, accurate  arm. Templeton is coming off his best offensive season since 1985, batting .255  with six homers and 40 RBIs. . . . Cora will be Templeton's backup, and Roberts  will be the No. 3.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEFT FIELD  </P> <P> Fred Lynn was supposed to be washed up. He's not only getting old, critics  said, but he's fragile. So would you believe this injury-plagued 38-year-old  man would be the Padres' opening day left fielder?. . . . Roberts will also  spend much of his time in left. Although Lynn is a better outfielder, Roberts  is a more dangerous offensive weapon. . . . Jerald Clark, a rookie, will add  offensive punch off the bench but is a liability in the field.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CENTER FIELD  </P> <P> Joe Carter has averaged 31 home runs and 108 RBIs over the past four seasons  while being surrounded by inferior talent. It's frightening to imagine what he  might do with this supporting cast. Scouts say he's probably more suited for  left, but that move probably won't occur until 1991. . . . Darrin Jackson will  back him up in center and be used as a defensive replacement on occasions. . .  . Shawn Abner will be one of the three extra players allowed until May 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RIGHT FIELD  </P> <P> They have a four-time batting champion who owns a career .332 batting average.  He also has a streak of 74 consecutive at-bats without striking out. And in the  field, he is a three-time Gold Glove winner. Anything else you want to know  about Tony Gwynn?  </P></p>

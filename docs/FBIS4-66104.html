			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Berlin -- Roman Herzog's election as the new  federal president has led to a clear deterioration of the  political climate between the Bonn coalition [Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, CDU/CSU, and the Free  Democratic Party, FDP] and the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] opposition. One day after the new president was  elected by the Federal Assembly, the two sides had a fierce  exchange on the circumstances surrounding the election and the  first speech by the new head of state.    SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping said that Chancellor Helmut  Kohl and the FDP had not been trying to find the best president  for Germany but to "protect their power." Kohl was playing  tactical games with the presidency. The FDP has completely  yielded to its CDU/CSU coalition partner and has ceased to be a  political force of its own, he told journalists in Berlin on  Tuesday [24 May]. But the SPD will cooperate loyally with  Herzog. To make use of the impetus from the population's  support for SPD presidential candidate Johannes Rau, the SPD  will make the European elections the "fourth ballot" of the  Federal Assembly.    The chancellor and CDU chairman sharply rejected the Social  Democrats' accusations. The criticism of Herzog's first speech  after his election is also "completely unacceptable" and is  degrading to the new president's character. The SPD is proving  to be a "bad loser." Herzog's words of thanks after the  election were not his inaugural speech, Kohl said. It is,  therefore, intellectually unfair to draw wrong conclusions from  it deliberately. He is convinced that Herzog will carry out his  duties in a convincing way. CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman  Wolfgang Schaeuble said that the SPD's criticism is incompatible  with the dignity of the office. Respecting majority decisions  is part of democracy.    FDP Chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel defended the  FDP delegates' vote for Herzog. It was right also in view of  the FDP's strategic line in the 1994 election year, he said in  Berlin. He warned the SPD against taking "political revenge" on  the FDP. Kinkel is optimistic that the party's "clarity and  straightforwardness" in the presidential election will have a  positive effect on the upcoming elections. CSU Secretary  General Erwin Huber rejected the SPD's criticism of Herzog as  undemocratic. The Social Democrats should stop their  "propaganda" against the new head of state.    Scharping called upon Herzog to conduct his office in an  absolutely impartial way and to continue the tradition of his  highly respected predecessor, Richard von Weizsaecker. He  criticized misleading statements on the reasons for Germany's  division and on overcoming it: "History is neither a  coincidence nor a miracle," Scharping said in connection with  Herzog's statement that the division came about in 1945 "by  coincidence" and that unity is a miracle. Other leading Social  Democrats were also dismayed about "nationalist comments" that  were present throughout the speech. In addition, he did not say  a word about the recent xenophobic violence.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  and his Maltese counterpart, Eddie Fenech Adami, today agreed to  explore further ways of cooperation between the two countries.    In their talks, the two prime ministers felt that government  officials and entrepreneurs of the two countries can use the  opportunity of the Maltese prime minister's visit to China to  have discussions on furthering their relations of bilateral  cooperation.    Li noted that great progress has been made since the two  countries established diplomatic ties 22 years ago.    He said the two sides signed agreements on shipping and on  avoidance of dual taxation. China is keen to explore new ways  to have mutually beneficial economic cooperation with Malta, he  added.    Adami described Malta-China ties as a fine example of  friendly cooperation between a big nation and a small one,  adding that he first visited China in 1978 as an opposition  leader.    After 16 years, he said, he was very pleased to come to  China  again and had witnessed the tremendous progress that China has  made.    Adami expressed support for the resumption of China's status  as a contracting party in the general agreement on tariffs and  trade, for which Li expressed thanks.    Adami invited Li to visit Malta as soon as possible. Li  accepted the invitation with pleasure. Li said he had planned  to visit Malta in early 1992, but had not gone because he had to  attend the summit of United Nations Security Council. Since  then he had been looking forward to visiting the beautiful  island of Malta.    Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and  Maltese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs  Guido de Marco, who is accompanying Adami, participated in the  talks.    The two prime ministers afterwards answered Maltese and  Chinese journalists' questions, particularly on economic  cooperation and trade.    Adami said the prospects for bilateral ties are very good.  Malta had changed its economic development strategy and adhered  to building the country into a port with services.    Adami arrived here at noon today on an official visit to  China at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Peng.    This afternoon Li hosted a welcoming ceremony for Adami and  his wife and their party.    Among those present were Li Peng's wife Zhu Lin; Qian  Qichen;  Zhao Weizhi, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiu  San (September 3) Society, and Shi Guangsheng, chairman of the  Chinese Government Reception Committee.    This evening, Li gave a banquet in honor of the Maltese  visitors at the state guesthouse.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA'S BICYCLE TASK FORCE TO PUSH THE METTLE OF THE PEDAL  </P> <P> The City of Roses wants to attract pedals as well as petals.  </P> <P> Mayor Jess Hughston wants Pasadena to be bicycle-friendly, so the city now has  a Bicycle Task Force.  </P> <P> Created on Tuesday by the city directors at Hughston's urging, the task force  will develop plans to improve bicycling around the Rose Bowl, make Pasadena  streets more accessible and safer for bicyclists, create a bike path through  the Arroyo Seco and encourage bicycle commuting in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Hughston took to the streets in July with 50 other riders to promote bicycling  during the Mayor's First Occasional Bike Ride.  </P> <P> "I'm not a racer or any of that thing," said Hughston, who regularly rides a  thick-tired 21-speed mountain bike that he concedes rarely sees a trail.  </P> <P> "It's easier to ride," he explained. "And I seldom have to repair flat tires."  VICKI TORRES  </P></p>

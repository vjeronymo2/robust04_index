			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Management: New law will curb fly boys Tough legislation to control fly-tipping will place an intolerable burden of red tape on small business, according to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), writes Charles Batchelor. An estimated 350,000 businesses, many of them small builders, will be required to register under waste control laws which come into effect on April 1. The new rules apply to all businesses which carry waste 'for profit'. Businesses are exempt if they are carrying only waste which they have produced themselves but this exemption does not apply to businesses transporting building or demolition waste. The police will have powers to stop vehicles to check if they are registered and there are fines of up to Pounds 2,000 for failure to comply. At the same time, businesses which produce waste will be required to check that the waste carrier is registered and must fill in a waste transfer note describing the type and amount of waste involved. Some very large businesses involved in waste disposal are unaware of the new legislation while many small firms may also be ignorant, said Jeff Cooper, waste reduction officer of the London Waste Regulation Authority. 'We support measures to protect the environment but it is unreasonable to require a reputable plumber to pay a registration fee to take away an old sink in his van,' said David Brown of the FSB. The FSB objects to the Pounds 95 registration fee being applied to businesses, regardless of size, and says the answer to fly-tipping is to provide more rubbish disposal sites. The federation wants David Trippier, environment department minister responsible for waste, to delay implementation of the laws. Ironically, as small firms' minister in the mid-1980s, Trippier lobbied hard to reduce the burden of red tape on business.

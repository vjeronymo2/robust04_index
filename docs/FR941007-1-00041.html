			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notwithstanding its proposal to require that manually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deactivated air bags reactivate by manual means only, NHTSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on whether it should address the problem of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring both infant and non-infant safety by mandating that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manually deactivated air bag be automatically reactivated upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the occurrence of some subsequent event. The subsequent event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that triggers the automatic reactivation of the air bag could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next restarting of the vehicle. However, such a design could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pose an unnecessary burden and risk in the example given above of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorists making stop-and-go shopping trips. The motorists must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restart their vehicles numerous times on such trips. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of that fact and the automatic reactivation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air bag each time the vehicles are restarted would multiply the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occasions on which the motorists might forget to protect their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infants by deactivating the air bag. To address this problem,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA requests comments on whether, if it were to adopt a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for automatic reactivation, it should qualify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement further, by requiring that the air bag be reactivated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only when the restarting of the vehicle occurs after the ignition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been off for more than some minimum period, perhaps a period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of several hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ultimate decision whether to mandate manual or automatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactivation of the air bag will depend in large measure on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's assessment of the relative effects of each method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactivation on the safety of the infant and non-infant occupants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the front right passenger seating position in the vehicles affected by this rulemaking. Using data from the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accident Sampling System (NASS) and Fatal Accident Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System (FARS), the agency has attempted to quantify the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety trade-offs in its preliminary regulatory evaluation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rulemaking. NHTSA seeks comments and information that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enable the agency to refine its estimates of those trade-offs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Warning Light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is proposing to require a telltale light on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dashboard that is clearly visible from both the driver and front  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger seating positions and that is illuminated whenever the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger air bag has been deactivated by means of the cutoff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device. This light would be separate from the air bag readiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicator already required by Standard No. 208. NHTSA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing that the color of the telltale be yellow, with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> words ``AIR BAG OFF'' clearly visible on the telltale when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger side air bag has been deactivated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that the indicator should be visible to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driver as a reminder that the passenger air bag is, or is not,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functioning. NHTSA believes that the indicator should be also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible from the passenger seating position as a warning to non-infant occupants that they are not protected by their air bag.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the agency is requiring a warning light that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible to the passenger, its effectiveness may be limited by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a passenger actually looks at, or for, the light, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understands its message. The agency seeks comment on whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplemental or additional warning for passengers would minimize instances in which the air bag was unintentionally not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactivated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA is concerned that the level of illumination should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the ambient light condition, and is therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring that the warning light indicator provide at least two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of brightness, one of which is barely discernible to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driver who has adapted to dark ambient roadway conditions. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, NHTSA is specifying that the warning light indicator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall not be adjustable under any driving condition to a level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is invisible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Air Bag Readiness Indicator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, S4.5.2 of FMVSS No. 208 requires that every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle equipped with an air bag also be equipped with an air bag  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readiness indicator that informs the driver about the operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status of the air bag system. Specifically, S4.5.2 states:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An occupant protection system that deploys in the event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a crash shall have a monitoring system with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readiness indicator. The indicator shall monitor its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own readiness and shall be clearly visible from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driver's designated seating position. *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is not aware of any manufacturer which complies with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement by installing separate readiness indicators, one for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the driver air bag and another for the passenger air bag. If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single readiness indicator for two air bags were used on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle with an air bag cutoff device, the indicator would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate the non-functioning of an air bag whenever the passenger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air bag was deactivated. NHTSA is concerned that, under those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, the driver would have no means of knowing the operational status of the driver air bag. NHTSA considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to amend S4.5.2 to require separate readiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicators for the driver and passenger side air bags. Instead,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA is proposing to amend S4.5.2 to limit the operation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single readiness indicator when the cutoff device is ``on'' so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the indicator monitors only the air bag that is not deactivated,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.e., the driver air bag. When the cutoff device is ``off,'' the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger air bag would be activated, and the readiness indicator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would monitor the readiness of both the driver air bag and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger air bag.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Owner's Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is also proposing to require that manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include information concerning the cutoff device in the owner's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manual. NHTSA is not proposing specific language which must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the owner's manual. NHTSA is proposing to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner's manual to include instructions on the operation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cutoff device, a statement that the cutoff device should only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used when a rear-facing infant restraint is installed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> front passenger seating position, and a warning about the safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of using the cutoff device at other times.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Labels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, Standard No. 208 requires that by September 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, air bag-equipped vehicles will bear a label on the sun  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visor that warns, in part:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> DO NOT INSTALL REARWARD-FACING CHILD SEATS IN ANY FRONT PASSENGER SEAT POSITION  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

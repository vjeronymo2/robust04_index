			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein dashes hopes of early end to violence Sinn Fein yesterday dashed hopes of an early end to violence in Northern Ireland by saying it would make no formal response to the Downing Street Declaration until at least the end of February. Mr Tom Hartley, the national chairman of the IRA's political wing, said in Dublin a response would come only after Sinn Fein's so-called 'peace commission' had completed a series of public debates and consultations on the peace process in both parts of Ireland. This would take place over the next six weeks. The statement came as a visit to the province by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, coincided with a fresh upsurge in terrorist violence. A woman soldier was shot and seriously injured in a republican area of north Belfast. But troops returned fire, arresting two men and seizing a loaded gun. Separately, the IRA said it had 'made a joke' of the 'colossal sums' spent by the government to fit police and army vehicles with updated armour-piercing weaponry. This followed a rocket attack in east Belfast on Tuesday night which left three policemen injured. Mr Rifkind, who was meeting security chiefs and soldiers, used the visit to hint that the number of troops there could be cut if the IRA responded positively to the UK-Irish declaration. 'Obviously if there was peace in Northern Ireland it would have very important implications for the security force presence which was needed,' Mr Rifkind said. Sinn Fein said the first public debate under its consultation process would be held in Londonderry on January 28. It would be followed by three others in the Republic up to February 19. Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein's vice-president, said 'numerous groups' had requested meetings with the party, including Protestant organisations in Northern Ireland. This 'external consultation' as Sinn Fein calls it, is to take place in parallel with a series of internal party debates. Mr Doherty said that initial soundings within the party taken since the declaration was published on December 15 suggested there was 'an element of disappointment'. He added: 'But we wish to explore whether there is a genuine opportunity for peace in this document.' Mr Hartley confirmed that Mr Gerry Adams, the party president, had written to both the British and Irish prime ministers for 'clarifications'. Downing Street said yesterday it had not yet decided how to respond to Mr Adams' letter.</p>

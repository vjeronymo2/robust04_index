			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities depressed by supply worries Wall Street US SHARE prices lost ground in quiet trading yesterday as concern about supply pressures, and also economic statistics expected later this week, kept buying to a minimum, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19.90 at 3,304.56. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.57 to 408.45, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.95 to 566.94. New York SE turnover amounted to 173m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 888 to 773. Last week's news that General Motors plans a worldwide offering of common stock that could raise as much as Dollars 2.3bn has prompted the question whether there is sufficient demand from investors to soak up newly issued stock without sending share prices lower. The market was also wary of the approaching US economic data, which should provide an indication of how fast the recovery is progressing. Today is the busiest day for numbers, with first-quarter gross domestic product, March new single-family home sales, and the Conference Board's April consumer confidence index all due for release. General Motors fell at first but recovered to end Dollars  1/8 up on balance at Dollars 39 3/4 in turnover of 2.7m shares as investors continued to react to last Friday's announcement of a planned offering of 50m shares. Compaq dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 23 5/8 on 2.7m shares traded after the computer company reported first-quarter profits of only 53 cents a share, well down from the Dollars 1.26 a share earned a year ago. The weakness in Compaq spread through the sector, with Hewlett-Packard falling Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 77 1/4 , Digital slipping Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 44 1/2 and Unisys easing Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 10 1/4 . IBM, however, posted a slight gain of Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 88 1/4 . Nike retreated Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 61 1/2 on press reports that it could be faced with serious logistical problems if the European Community introduces quotas restricting imports of shoes made in China. Although exact figures are not available, a significant proportion of Nike's sports shoes are made in the Far East, including China, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. On the Nasdaq market, US Healthcare climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 47 1/4 in heavy trading in response to first-quarter net income of 63 cents a share, above both last year's figure and the range of analysts' estimates. In the same sector, Basic American Medical jumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 on news that Columbia Hospital (down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 18 1/4 ) will take over the company in a Dollars 185m stock swap. Medical Care International declined Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57 3/4 after announcing first-quarter profits below market expectations. Canada THE TORONTO market weakened throughout the session in thin trading as nervousness over the extent of Olympia &amp; York's debt troubles continued to depress the real estate and banking sectors. The composite index ended 23.2 lower at 3,326.4 and falls outnumbered rises by 357 to 172 after volume of 18.7m shares valued at CDollars 211m. Market heavy-weight Northern Telecom dropped CDollars 2 to CDollars 48 7/8 following analysts' downgradings.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: GALA OPENS DECORATIVE ARTS CENTER  </P> <P> "We're really not about parties," whispered Gep Durenberger, knee-deep in a  crush of revelers at the gala opening of the Center for the Study of Decorative  Arts in San Juan Capistrano. "But you need them to get things going. We're  about home -- studying about preserving beauty in the home."  </P> <P> Well, everyone knows there's no place like home for a cozy, elegant party, and  the guest list proved it on Saturday night. That's when such members of the  rich-and-famous set as producer Norman Lear, mega-developer Donald Koll and  business magnate Gavin Herbert -- each an admirer of Durenberger, the  antiquarian who started it all -- swept into the new center to peruse period  vignettes and polish off paella, French chocolate cake and white-chocolate ice  cream.  </P> <P> And such a home. The second you set foot on its tiny porch, you knew it was  going to be a party package wrapped in style: the scalloped canopy that framed  the doorway was festooned with bouquets of flowers and centered with a  twinkling chandelier. White camellias drifted in a gushing patio fountain.  </P> <P> Inside, fires roared. Classics by Porter and Gershwin were played on a  mirror-finish grand piano. And champagne and appetizers were proffered from  gleaming silver trays.  </P> <P> "I feel like I've given birth," said Durenberger, brown eyes dancing as he  drank in the richly appointed center, the first of its kind on the West Coast.  "Really! We've had twins here! Maybe even quintuplets."  </P> <P> John Saladino, the revered New York interior designer who was a school chum of  Durenberger at Notre Dame (and is now busy-busy creating lush looks for Lyn and  Norman Lear's new Los Angeles mansion), said the center is unique in the  nation.  </P> <P> "You see this kind of thing in Europe, but for the West Coast, this is a rare  opportunity for people to expand themselves culturally and at the same time  learn about what their great-great-grandmother may have lived with and what  they may now own."  </P> <P> On view through May 6 is an exhibit entitled "California Style: Collectors and  Collections," which includes such items as the 18th-Century cherry highboy  loaned by locals Lori and Bob Warmington. "We've been collecting furniture  since we were first married," Lori said. "The pieces are like children, a very  special part of our lives."  </P> <P> Art Birtcher, director of development for the center, and his wife, Gaye,  honorary chairwoman of the gala, loaned their tabernacle, circa 1500, to the  Renaissance vignette. Carved heads of a man and a woman decorate the sides of  the rare piece, and a carved Cross of Godfrey of the Knights of the Holy  Sepulchre embellishes the front.  </P> <P> "How perfectly appropriate to have the center in San Juan Capistrano, where we  have so much history," said Gaye, greeting guests with a mink tossed over her  bare shoulders. (Fur was the wrap of choice. It was cold outside.)  </P> <P> Gala chairwoman Electa Anderson wowed the crowd in an ecru opera coat that once  belonged to her great-great-grandmother. She said she decided to become  involved with the center after meeting Durenberger only a few months ago. "I  could see right away he was the kind of man who makes dreams come true."  </P> <P> Electa had a secret: She and her husband, Norman, were celebrating their 24th  wedding anniversary at the affair. Underneath her lace-inset coat was her  pearl-trimmed wedding dress. "I'm all CONWAYfor family," she said. "And I'm all  for establishing a purpose for beautiful decor and an attachment to it."  </P> <P> Durenberger said he thinks that the center's supporters must have been taught  about beauty in their childhoods. "And learning about beauty makes you a better  person. There's something very basic about it . . . a reverence. You don't even  have to understand it."  </P> <P> Also at the center of things: Lyn Lear, Norman's newish, young and charming  wife, who said that the couple collect "a lot of modern art" and that their new  home is going to be a mix of modern and classic; Marguerite Holub, who, during  dinner, sat next to Norman Lear and told him that she remembers meeting his  first wife, Frances (publisher of Lear's magazine); and designer Martha  Gresham.  </P> <P> Plus, David and Bette Auerbach (in the night's sartorial showstopper: a  black-jet-beaded fuchsia silk ball gown by Nina Ricci) and Marsha and Phil  Schwartze, who said he had been to San Juan Capistrano's sister city Petra (in  Majorca), birthplace of Junipero Serra, and that it is so much like Capistrano,  "with its swallows and rollings hills, that Father Serra must have felt right  at home here."  </P> <P> Other faces in the crowd: San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer; Jack  and Jody Pike; Chris and John Luhrs; Harry and Diane Johnson (the designer who  worked with Don and Dorothy Koll on their breathtaking chateau-by-the-bay in  Newport); Joyce Mac Rae, an editor of House and Garden magazine, and Phil  Jacoby, president of Marbella Golf and Country Club, who helped underwrite the  affair.  </P> <P> Special favors of fragrance were provided by Tiffany &amp; Co.  </P></p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Act on Cambodia SINCE THE signing in October 1991 of Cambodia's peace agreement, most of the 370,000 refugees in border camps have safely returned home, and 4.7m people have registered to vote in May's elections. Those are the positive achievements of the 22,000-strong United Nations presence. The failures, however, are mounting. The UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, Untac, which was charged with supervising, monitoring and verifying the ceasefire, has instead watched war continuing. Rather than being disarmed and cantoned by Untac, factional forces have intensified their fighting. The Khmer Rouge, though it committed itself to the agreement, is not participating in elections and has perpetrated numerous ceasefire violations including attacks on UN personnel. It controls at most 20 per cent of Cambodia's territory and probably a far smaller proportion of the population. But violence is spreading. Government forces last week attacked Khmer Rouge positions in flagrant violation of the ceasefire. Ceasefire and disarming of troops were to be the building blocks of the free and fair elections which the UN was to supervise. Though they have not been achieved, the country is nevertheless proceeding to elections. Cambodians, especially the Khmer Rouge, are responsible for the deterioration. However, Untac's authority has been undermined by inability, under its peacekeeping mandate, to react strongly to ceasefire violations. It has not acted quickly or firmly enough to correct the situation. It is no longer enough for Untac to hang on grimly and hope for the best. The danger of pushing ahead with elections without implementing other parts of the plan has been all too painfully demonstrated in Angola. If the Cambodian peace process is to be put back on track sufficiently for elections to produce a constitution and a government which can be recognised internationally, the UN needs to take action. The options are not easy. It would probably not be possible to win support for a substantial change in Untac's mandate. What is needed is a substantial effort to win observance of the original peace agreement, even if that means postponement of elections. China needs to exert leverage on the Khmer Rouge - so far it has avoided overt moves to distance itself. France, seeking to re-exert its influence through President Mitterrand's visit today, has mischievously promoted the holding of presidential elections before a constitution is drawn up. The permanent members of the UN Security Council, as well as Japan which is primarily financing the operation, must face up to the problem and act to correct it. If the country descends again into civil war, the years of effort put into obtaining a peace agreement, and the Dollars 2bn allocated to the UN force, will be wasted - not to mention the lives of yet more Cambodians.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Norrback Wants EU Vote Early </F> This Fall"]    [Text] Transport and Communications Minister Ole Norrback,  the Swedish People's Party [RKP] chairman, thinks that an  earlier date for the referendum on European Union [EU]  membership is preferable for several reasons. According to  Norrback, late September/early October is the best time.    "After the referendum a large amount of legislative work  will  still be needed. The vote also affects the work on the budget.  The Eduskunta will have a great deal of work this fall,"  Norrback argued.    "The adjustment of regional policy and agriculture will also  require time. An early date for a vote is therefore vitally  important for agriculture and for all the areas where changes  are great," Norrback said at a meeting of the executive of the  RKP yesterday.    Norrback pointed out that we also need time to prepare for  the Eduskunta elections in March 1995 if the election campaign  is to be able to deal with the important questions the Eduskunta  and the government will have to decide in the latter half of the  nineties. According to Norrback there is a risk of a confusion  of questions that belong to the referendum and questions that  belong to the Eduskunta election if they are too close to each  other in time -- and this would be to the detriment of both.    Norrback warned against rough estimates in the debate on  cost  and on who it is who benefits from or pays for membership.    "There is no room for a permanent increase in costs for the  state as a result of membership."    According to Norrback, the tight budget line that the state  has decided on must hold if the government's economic policy is  to be seen as credible. According to Norrback, the cost of the  transition to free prices in the food industry, for example,  must be seen as an investment in the future.    Norrback also warned against excessive promises of support  for the regions or of a higher level of income for farmers.</p>

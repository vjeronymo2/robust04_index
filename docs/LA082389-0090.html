			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Alliance for Survival on Tuesday presented United Artists  studio officials with a "peace doll," clothed in overalls and peace signs, to  commend the studio for its recent prohibition of horror films. UA movie  president Richard Berger recently pulled the plug on "Child's Play II" the  planned sequel to last fall's hit about a homicidal doll. Berger, part of the  new management at UA, had told the film's producers that the studio no longer  wants to make horror movies. Said Jerry Rubin, director of the Alliance for  Survival: "We wanted to show some appreciation for the courageous stand they've  just taken." The organization has protested films which it believes depict  gratuitous violence and recently demonstrated outside a Westwood theater on the  opening day of "Nightmare on Elm Street Part 5."  </P></p>

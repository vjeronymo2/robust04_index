			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday admitted that  security measures in the South are inadequate.    He said violence in the region including last year's  torching  of more than 30 schools in the southernmost provinces and  Saturday's bomb blast at Nakhon Si Thammarat's railway station,  had adversely affected investment in the South.    Chuan told a gathering of Islamic religious leaders that  while people in the South may have become accustomed to such  incidents, those outside the region were scared by the press  reports.    He said religious leaders could help solve the problem of  violence by giving officials information when incidents occurred  and telling people in their communities to behave themselves.    Many acts of sabotage have occurred in the South since Chuan  took office in 1992, the bomb last Saturday which killed three  people and injured at least 27 others being only the most recent.    The opposition has threatened to file a no-confidence motion  against the government over public security.    Deputy Interior Minister Suthat Ngoenmun said it was the  duty  and right of the opposition to file a no-confidence motion. The  government must publicly explain to avoid confusion, he said.    He said police should come up with better measures and  intelligence to prevent violence. Police performance in dealing  with bombing incidents dissatisfied the people, the press and  the opposition, Suthat said.    "I'm not happy. I'm not satisfied with police performance in  preventing and suppressing crime," Suthat said. "Intelligence  services should be better. I don't know what their problem is,  since the government has allocated a budget for them."    He said police chief Prathin Santipraphop should not comment  on cases while things are still unclear. This only confuses the  public and allows the culprits to escape.    Suthat said evidence, witnesses and investigative procedures  should be kept secret. Police should not publicly reveal  everything because this affects the investigations.    He said Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin is a capable  officer, but he may not have a strong enough team to help him.    Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset said Interior  Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut was ready to face the opposition  in Parliament, should it initiate a censure debate.    He said police should investigate all possible motives  behind  Saturday's bomb blast, including personal affairs and politics.</p>

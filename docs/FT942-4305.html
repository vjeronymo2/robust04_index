			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unanimity a hindrance to OECD progress Sir, Your editorial, 'Future of the OECD' (June 7) comprehensively reviews the group's historical evolution and its valued relevance to key inter-governmental discussions on a wide range of topics. However, as it expands to include important trading nations in eastern Europe, south east Asia and Latin America, its effectiveness should not be hindered by a requirement for unanimity in voting. Such a process has condemned some important UN bodies to ineffectiveness, historically, particularly when addressing an individual nation's errant behaviour. A lowest common denominator of morality, by definition, is usually not the best way forward. To many businessmen active in today's international markets, a recent announcement from the OECD must be extremely hopeful. The group's 24 member states agreed to tackle the corrosive problem of international bribery, as per David Buchan's report 'OECD members agree action to curb bribery of foreign officials' (April 30). Full marks to the vision of the group's current membership. Few issues deserve wider international attention. The proliferation of bribery of decision-makers worldwide encourages wrong, uneconomic choices while private and public morality suffer, particularly among some of the world's poorest nations. Responsible leadership of companies and nations everywhere would strive to set new stan-dards for the way the world trades.

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR WON'T SEEK REELECTION;  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN TO TURN FOCUS ON PRIVATE SECTOR  </P> <P> Grinning happily, Gov. George Deukmejian announced Thursday that he will not  run for a third term in 1990 and instead will look for "new challenges" in the  more lucrative private sector.  </P> <P> The Republican governor said he decided, among other things, that he could be  more effective dealing with the Democratic-controlled Legislature in the next  two years if he did not run for reelection. Pledging a special effort to  "personally reach out" to legislative leaders, Deukmejian said he hopes they  can cooperate to resolve pressing problems of transportation, health care,  waste disposal and "restructuring" of the increasingly restrictive state budget  process.  </P> <P> He called it "a very large window of opportunity" for political bipartisanship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Burnout  </P> <P> But there are growing indications that Deukmejian -- who will be 62 when his  term expires and will have served 28 years in elective state office -- has  become, in many respects, beaten down and burned out from constantly warring  with the Legislature. And this played a major role in his decision, insiders  suggested.  </P> <P> The governor himself acknowledged to reporters that his decision would have  been "tougher" had Republicans controlled the Legislature.  </P> <P> Deukmejian made up his mind over the holidays -- at his home in Long Beach --  and then kept the decision to himself and his family until less than an hour  before he walked into a packed press conference. Sporting a wide grin, he  immediately told reporters: "I'd like to wish each of you a very happy new  year. And I can tell you that 1989 and 1990 are both going to be very good  years for me, because I've decided not to run for a third term. So, I'm  expecting to enjoy these next two years very, very much."  </P> <P> But later Deukmejian -- a devout sports fan -- used a football metaphor to  emphasize that he does not intend to dog it the rest of his term: "I'm not  going to ground the ball and wait for the clock to run out."  </P> <P> Even the governor's closest advisers were not told of his decision until  minutes before he announced it publicly. However, nobody was surprised. He  clearly had been leaning in the direction of retiring.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's announcement immediately changed California's political chemistry  and set off a wave of intense speculation about who might replace him as the  1990 Republican gubernatorial nominee. The strongest candidate, most political  professionals seemed to feel, would be U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. But Wilson last  year won reelection to a second six-year term and advisers have said he would  be reluctant to wage another campaign so soon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ueberroth Mentioned  </P> <P> Outgoing Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth frequently has been talked about  within Republican and corporate circles as a potentially strong "celebrity"  candidate who would begin the race with high name identification. But Ueberroth  has been silent about any political ambitions.  </P> <P> State Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who also has been mentioned  as a potential candidate, seemed to take himself out of the competition by  declaring after Deukmejian's announcement that he intends to run for reelection  to the Legislature.  </P> <P> The only Republican who has indicated he would like to run for governor if  Deukmejian bowed out is Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's advisers have expressed confidence in recent weeks that the  governor could have beaten the early Democratic front-runner, state Atty. Gen.  John K. Van de Kamp. They insisted that the former Los Angeles district  attorney carries some of the same "liberal baggage" on law enforcement that  Democratic presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis did last year.  </P> <P> But they also acknowledged that the possibility of losing a reelection race was  one of the many factors in Deukmejian's decision. He was a young legislator in  1966 when Democratic Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown ran for a third term and was  beaten badly by Ronald Reagan. And this left a lasting impression on  Deukmejian, associates said.  </P> <P> Also, advisers said, Deukmejian has grown weary of campaigning and shuddered at  the thought of another race -- the next one certain to be tougher than his  landslide reelection victory over Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in 1986. While  stumping throughout California with George Bush in last year's presidential  race, an aide recalled, "He'd look at the campaign schedule -- six, eight  events a day -- and say, 'How does (Bush) do that? How does he survive?' He'd  just shake his head."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Popular in Polls  </P> <P> If Deukmejian had run and won -- and public opinion polls showed him to be  still highly popular with voters -- he would have become only the second  California governor to have been elected to three terms. And if he had served  out his third term, he would have set a new record for longevity, because the  other three-term governor, the legendary Earl Warren, left office two years  after reelection to become chief justice of the United States.  </P> <P> "I didn't come to public office for the purpose of setting some record of  longevity," Deukmejian said in his opening statement Thursday. "I came to  public office to try to make California a safer place to live and to create  more opportunities for all of the residents of our state."  </P> <P> He added, "My decision was made easier by the satisfaction that we have  accomplished much of our original agenda." He cited education reform, a  strengthened economy, a good business climate, elimination of an inherited  budget deficit, welfare reform, new prisons and the "appointment of hundreds of  common-sense judges."  </P> <P> Insiders said, however, that Deukmejian had difficulty coming up with a  compelling agenda for a third term.  </P> <P> "His feeling is he's accomplished what he set out to accomplish. Now, he feels  it's time to let someone else accomplish what they want to accomplish," said  Steven A. Merksamer, the governor's first-term chief-of-staff who remains one  of his closest political advisers.  </P> <P> But associates also said that Deukmejian, a man of modest means, was concerned  about building a financial nest egg for his family. Deukmejian, who earns  $85,000 as governor, said he has not decided what to do after leaving  Sacramento. But, as a former state attorney general and governor, he clearly  will have many options -- such as entering private law practice, becoming a  corporate executive, joining corporate boards, or a combination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earning Power  </P> <P> "I'd kind of like to move on to new challenges. And I think there will be some  additional new challenges in the private sector," the governor told reporters.  Deukmejian advisers have speculated that, with his prestige, experience and  contacts, the governor could earn several hundred thousand dollars a year  outside of government.  </P> <P> Deukmejian insisted that he has no interest in joining the Bush Administration  or serving on the U.S. Supreme Court. If he wanted to stay in public life, he  said, he would run for reelection. "This is the best job as far as I'm  concerned," the governor said.  </P> <P> Deukmejian dismissed a suggestion that his political position might now become  weaker in the Legislature's eyes because he will be a short-timer, a "lame  duck." Lawmakers still must come to him to get their bills signed into law, he  noted.  </P> <P> And although he intends to "reach out" more to the Legislature, he will not  change his basic style, said the governor, who has been accused of stubbornness  and being too remote. "You can't teach old dogs like me new tricks," Deukmejian  observed, almost under his breath.  </P> <P> Illustrative of his lukewarm relationship with the Legislature, Deukmejian's  announcement of pending retirement drew these prepared comments from Democratic  leaders:  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) -- "In many ways it is the  state's loss that Gov. Deukmejian does not wish to be a part of policy-making  any more. He has not been as horrible as we have sometimes painted him to be."  </P> <P> Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles): "We wish him well in  all his future endeavors."  </P> <P> The two Democrats both added that they hope to work cooperatively with the  governor in the next two years.  </P> <P> Although Deukmejian insisted during the press conference that "I've really  enjoyed" being governor, people close to him have said there has been far less  joy and more frustration during his second term. Contrasted to his first term  -- a period of new challenge, victories and exhilaration -- Deukmejian in the  last two years has taken a political pounding.  </P> <P> Among other things in Deukmejian's second term, the Legislature rejected his  nomination of Daniel E. Lungren to be state treasurer, voters turned down his  ambitious transportation bond plan, he initially proposed a tax increase to  balance the state's books and then backed off in anger and embarrassment, and  state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig won the final round in a long  battle over education funds by persuading voters to approve Proposition 98.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restrictions on Spending Options  </P> <P> And looking at a possible third term, Deukmejian saw even more potential  frustration with new voter-approved restrictions on a governor's spending  options and Democrats in solid control of the Legislature. "They seemed to want  to create a picture, a record, of my stewardship as being one who would be  constantly denying funds to people," the governor lamented Thursday.  </P> <P> In short, much of the fun had gone out of the job, intimates said, and that was  a big factor in his decision.  </P> <P> In deciding not to run, Deukmejian said he rejected the arguments of most  Republican leaders, including President Reagan, that without him in the race a  Democrat is more likely to capture the governor's office -- a prospect  particularly crucial in 1990 because congressional and legislative districts  will be reapportioned in 1991. Deukmejian said that another candidate would be  just as electable as himself -- "maybe" even more so -- because a "fresh face"  would not have a record as governor for Democrats to shoot at.  </P> <P> Ken Khachigian, a longtime Deukmejian adviser and friend, summed up the  governor's frame of mind this way: "As Ecclesiastes says, 'For everything there  is a season and a time to every purpose under the Heaven . . . a time to keep  and a time to cast away.' "  </P></p>

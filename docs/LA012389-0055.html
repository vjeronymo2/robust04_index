			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: LET THE BEST SUDS WIN, NOT (GASP) GO DOWN DRAIN  </P> <P> Beer wars in San Diego?  </P> <P> After several decades of not having a single local brewery-eatery, San Diego  will soon have two: the Karl Strauss' Old Columbia Brewery &amp; Grill downtown  and Brewski, which will be part of the Mission Brewery shopping complex in Loma  Portal.  </P> <P> Old Columbia is set to open Feb. 2 and Brewski won't be ready until October,  but the competition (none dare call it feuding) has already begun.  </P> <P> Four grim-faced agents from the state Department of Alcohol Beverage Control  visited Brewski late last week. As quick as you could say "untaxed and  unlicensed production of alcohol for commercial purposes," they poured all 400  gallons of Mission Red ESB (Extra Special Bitter) down the drain.  </P> <P> Brewski principal Mike Foote, a developer, is in the process of applying for a  brewery license. He says he thought he had the go-ahead to make a limited  amount of beer for beer shows and promotional events.  </P> <P> And what gave the ABC agents the idea to arrive unannounced at Brewski? Could  it have been an inquiry made earlier in the week by Old Columbia co-owner Chris  Cramer about whether Brewski's license will carry the same restrictions (no  dancing, no entertainment) as Old Columbia's?  </P> <P> After the agents departed, Foote had occasion to contact Cramer to ask him  these and other questions. The two share a passion for the brewing art but are  otherwise quite dissimilar.  </P> <P> Cramer, 27, is MBA (Stanford). Foote, 42, is NFL (Rams and Redskins). Still,  the discussion reportedly was amicable. Both sides say they have the same  motto: Let the best suds prevail.  </P> <P> "I never dreamed that asking a few questions about the Brewski license would  result in this," Cramer said.  </P> <P> "It sure took the wind out of our sails," Foote said. "We were already to start  making T-shirts. But we'll be back."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Of Bengals and Opera  </P> <P> The Peking Opera, which gives three performances this week at the San Diego  Civic Theatre, played earlier in the tour at the Pikes Peak Center in Colorado  Springs, Colo., not normally a hotbed of ancient Oriental art forms.  </P> <P> The critic for the local Gazette-Telegraph decided to grab his Super  Bowl-entranced  </P> <P> readers with a homey comparison between Chinese opera and pro football.  </P> <P> "In both art forms, highly trained performers in bizarre, colorful costumes  appear, often with names taken from the animal kingdom -- Monkeys, Bears, Dogs,  Bengals, Buffaloes, Snakes. They perform time-honored ritualistic acts filled  with passion, larceny, wry fatalism, violence and sometimes inexplicable  motivations. The audience . . . laughs, applauds or weeps."  </P> <P> True, but there's one difference: In Chinese opera, Bengals do not blow a lead  with 34 seconds remaining. Maybe that's where the wry fatalism comes in.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Miserly Thoughts  </P> <P> The Escondido Times-Advocate has criticized the proposed name of San Diego  Martin Luther King Convention Center as a "laborious moniker" and said it  probably won't allow the name in its news columns, even if adopted by the Board  of Port Commissioners.  </P> <P> Conscientious objection to civic name changes is not new to the Times-Advocate.  It also abhors San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, renamed for the late sports  editor of a rival newspaper.  </P> <P> "To save newsprint, the Times-Advocate refers to the stadium as San Diego  Stadium," said a recent editorial. "The same dedication to efficiency and  common sense would probably prevail if the new convention center name  survives."  </P> <P> A rough calculation: 50 omissions of King's name in stories about the  convention center, during the course of maybe five years, would save enough ink  and space for three paragraphs.  </P></p>

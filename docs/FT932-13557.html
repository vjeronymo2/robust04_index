			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (16): A heritage worthy of world attention - A look at the threat to Cairo's architectural remnants of centuries of power and glory Tourists who want to see Cairo's medieval quarters had better hurry. In the golden days before 1939, when Egypt still had grand hotels and a Season that ran from October to May, the main attraction for foreign visitors was not pharaonic monuments or Red Sea beaches, but the Egyptian climate and the city of Cairo. Nearly all tourists were Northern Europeans or Americans; and many spent their entire winter in Egypt; well-heeled refugees from the cold, damp and darkness of winter-time London or New York. The experienced traveller might then move on to Luxor and Aswan. On November 10 of each year Thomas Cook &amp; Son's famous paddle steamer Arabia would depart from Cairo, inaugurating the first of its 20-day cruises upstream to Aswan and back. For visitors who wanted more time to loll under Nubian sun, Thomas Cook maintained a fleet of seven private steamers, four sail-powered dahabiyyahs, and the slow sternwheeler Thebes, which would leave Cairo on November 17, taking two full weeks to arrive at Aswan. There most passengers would stay on in the Cataract Hotel for an additional week or two before making an equally leisurely return cruise back downstream to Cairo. When Thomas Cook's last steamer left Aswan - always on March 23 - the Upper Egyptian season ended. By March 31 the most famous hotels in both Luxor and Aswan would have closed down and would not reopen until the middle of the following November. In Cairo the season was much longer. The Mena House received guests from October 15 to May 15; and though the famous roof terrace at the Semiramis was open only from November 20 to April 20, the hotel itself actually operated all year round, as did Shepheard's, the Continental, the Savoy, and the Heliopolis Palace. Night life, designed for the young and rich, was strenuous. Apart from its glamorous social life, Cairo's main prewar attraction was its picturesque historic zone: the ramshackle medieval quarters that have formed the physical and the moral core of the city and have given it a unique architectural identity. It contains most of the remarkable remnants of those centuries of power and glory, between AD 642 and 1517, when Cairo grew into the largest city in the world west of China, with a high street 13 kilometres long. What is left is still an area larger than Venice, though much of it is ruinous and nearly all of it is given over to slums. Hundreds of monumental buildings, however, most of them intact to a striking degree, still line thoroughfares laid out in the 14th century at the latest. From 1881 until the Egyptian revolution of 1952 these individual buildings were looked after by a Comite de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe, which worked effectively within the international norms of the period, Meanwhile the Cairo governorate remained responsible for infrastructure, while the Ministry of Awqaf (Mortmain Endowments) held the deeds to most of the buildings. After Hitler's war, however, the historic zone seems to have been virtually forgotten by everyone except the Comite and the people who actually lived there. Tourism returned to Egypt very slowly - no important new hotel was built in Cairo between 1910 and 1959 - without recovering the impetus supplied before the war by chic. The jet set and the Beautiful People passed Egypt by. Meanwhile the nature of tourism itself had changed. The historic zone now sees only a few foreign visitors every year, mostly either low-budget strays or architectural experts with particular objectives. Under the Revolution the Comite was dissolved. Its responsibilities were vested in the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation (EAO), which admits that, until 1979, it has done badly by both the area and its monuments That year the EAO requested at last that the entire zone be added to Unesco's World Heritage list; and official attention has been given to it intermittently since. Between 1983 and 1988, for example, it had the EAO's top priority. Several important projects were carried out, with considerable co-operation from the governorate, though little was done to upgrade infrastructure. Outstanding among its monuments are the mosques and religious schools built by great patrons between the 7th century AD and the beginning of the 20th century. But there are also palaces, caravanserais, apartment blocks, workshops, and plenty of bustling markets, often no more than wide places in the road, where merchants of all kinds - stall keepers, hawkers, tradeswomen - foregather, Oriental-style, to sell specific wares. It is these vivifying parts of the city that provide the symbolic settings in the Cairo novels of Egypt's Nobel prize-winner, Naguib Mahfouz. The country's pharaonic monuments, a non-renewable resource, are now routinely surrendered to the requirements of package tourism. Rescued from oblivion only by the heroic labours of generations of Egyptologists during the past 150 years, they are being exploited quickly and thoroughly. Conservation efforts cannot keep pace with the casual destruction that results from massive continuous human presence. The ministries of culture and tourism would undoubtedly be delighted to herd the same foreign multitudes into the medieval monuments of Cairo. For better or worse, however, Cairo's historic zone is immune to such treatment. Some of its narrow streets have at last been blocked off to vehicular traffic. Walking is now quieter, as well as safer and easier. Parking remains limited, however, and there is no room for package-tour buses except in approach areas on distant peripheries. Sanitary conditions generally leave so much to be desired that they are driving out even the native residents. As the population has diminished, derelicts have been left behind - the mentally and physically handicapped are much in evidence - to deepen and confirm official disdain of the populace. Government attitudes typically have had less to do with resolution to improve matters than with a sense of shame, regardless of what aesthetes might say about historical pride or architectural beauty. Such attitudes are demonstrated everywhere, in neglect and obvious decay. But liveliness, charm, and a rich variety of visual delights are still available in plenty for the visitor willing to take very little trouble; a three-hour walk through the city's medieval heart is the same exhilarating experience it must have been six decades or six centuries ago. How much longer the experience will continue to be available is somewhat problematic. On October 12 1992 at 3.14 pm an earthquake centred more than 50 kilometres to the south west hit Cairo. Measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale, it lasted 20 seconds and wrought extensive destruction in villages near the epicentre. In Cairo itself a few recently built apartment blocks collapsed, some during the main shock, others in the course of the next several days. But all the city's medieval monuments which had remained standing before the earthquake, survived. Of the most vulnerable parts of monumental structures - minarets - only one collapsed. Damage ranged from displaced brass or copper finials or lost portions of upper storeys, to serious destabilisation of lower sections. Only one dome fell. Old cracks in walls widened; many new ones appeared. Confused spokesmen finally agreed that 174 medieval monuments had officially suffered damage. The worst of it had been prophesied a dozen years earlier by Professor Ron Lewcock of Cambridge, a leading expert on the restoration and conservation of medieval Islamic buildings, then acting for Unesco as adviser to the EAO. The street he had pinpointed as the most dangerously dilapidated in Cairo had been allowed to become a main artery for heavy traffic. Medieval buildings already declared unsafe had thus been additionally pounded by the passage of buses and lorries day and night for a decade. After the earthquake the EAO was quick to make dramatic gestures. Dozens of monuments are now theatrically screened in scaffolding and repairs are being made throughout the historic zone. At least 10 private contractors, including Osman Ahmed Osman and Hassan Allam, the largest in Egypt, have been hired by the EAO to carry out repairs. Several foreign agencies have joined them, believing that now might be the time to galvanise both the EAO and the Cairo governorate into effective long term action to preserve this heritage. But none of these firms, agencies, governments or government bureaux has announced any large-scale long-term programme. For reasons never made clear, the historic zone was specifically excluded from the city's Wastewater Masterplan, implemented since 1979 with Dollars 10bn worth of foreign aid. Most experts believe that unless the historic zone is properly drained it is futile to pour money into restoration. An international conference on the historic zone will be held in Cairo in June. This may have some influence over its fate. There are important elements in the government, however, whose idea of preserving the heritage is to create a kind of Islamo-Disneyland. Some signs give cause for unease. In February and March this year the Cairo governorate used bulldozers to destroy the stands of bouquinistes in Azbakkyah and al-Azhar, where they had long been an essential part of traditional Cairene culture. And plans have been unveiled to remove the Bab al-Nasr cemetery, an historic graveyard immediately in front of the two northern gates of the 11th century enclosure of Al-Qahirah, from which Cairo takes its name. This graveyard provided not only the setting for the last half of Mahfouz's 1960 novel, The Thief and the Dogs, but also a last resting place for Badr al-Gamali (died 1094 AD), the great general who built the two gates; for the historians Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) and Maqrizi (1364-1442); and for John Lewis Burckhardt (1784-1817), the Anglo-Swiss explorer-ethnographer - together with thousands of other less celebrated folk. Once it is gone, and development on its site begins, ambitions for the rest of the historic zone may change radically. Land values have already begun to rocket. In one recent court case involving an important site, the EAO's argument for protection on the basis of current law was rejected in favour of a developer's right to do what he likes. Doctor Rodenbeck lectures at the American University in Cairo. He is the chairman of the Society for the Preservation of the Architectural Resources of Egypt and has lived in Cairo for 25 years.</p>

He said also that he follows with  great interest the pace of reforms in Russia and wished Russian  President Boris Yeltsin a success in puting them into life.    Kim Yong-sam expressed an intention to pay an official visit  to Russia during this year. "It will be five years this year  since my first visit to your country and I would like to visit  it again," he told the ambassador. Kim Yong-sam visited Moscow  in 1989 as a leader of the opposition Democratic Party for  Reunification.    He met Boris Yeltsin in Seoul, being a presidential nominee  from the Democratic Liberal Party, during the Russian  president's visit to South Korea in November 1992.</p>

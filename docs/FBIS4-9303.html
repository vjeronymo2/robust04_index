			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] With the repressive apparatus  installed in Kosova and after the commotion about the alleged  arrest of members of the defense ministry of the republic of  Kosova, the Belgrade regime is now attempting to find soldiers  for its army. Based on this pretext, the Serbian police have  intensified their punitive actions in many Kosova dwelling  places. Mehmet Haziri has more details:    [Haziri] Albanian youths have particularly become targets of  the Serbian police in Kosova. They are being pursued on two  pretexts -- to be recruited into the service of the so-called  Yugoslav Army and for allegedly having trained in various  military centers in Albania. The Kosova Information Center  reports that after protesting the alleged arrest of members of  the Defense Ministry of the republic of Kosova, Belgrade has  recently been attempting to invent the soldiers of this  ministry. Thus, the Serbian Prosecutor's Office and Peje  District Court decided to pre-imprison [paraburgim] youths  Bedrush Halilaj and Florin Golaj from Lipovec in Gjakove on the  pretext that upon instructions from representatives of the  Kosova government in Tirana, they have become militarily  efficient in Labinot in Elbasan, with the aim of starting an  armed action in Kosova at the proper moment.    Another month of imprisonment has been defined for those  youths, whom the Serbian police arrested in early April. During  April, the Serbs in the Kosova prosecutor's offices and courts  called for pre-imprisonment for many Albanian youths on the  pretext that they allegedly carried out military training in  Albania. In the wake of pursuing Albanian youths, Serbian  recruiters issued draft notices to 125 youths in the Malisheve  commune this week. On the other hand, repressive actions by the  police has spread to other strata of the Albanian population.  On the pretext of searching for weapons or other invented  schemes, police expeditions during the last two days have raided  dozens of families in the communes of Mitrovice, Viti, Kamenice,  Kline, Peje, and Lipjan.    In Okllap in Lipjan, the Serbian police confiscated all of  the pedagogical inspection documents of the education counsels  in Ferizaj.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Thai scheme 'on track' Hopewell Holdings, the public company controlled by Hong Kong entrepreneur Mr Gordon Wu, has rebutted speculation that it wants to dump or delay its Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) mass transit scheme in Bangkok which is two years behind schedule. Notices in yesterday's Thai newspapers dismissed rumours it was proceeding slowly so as to make attached property developments more profitable as prices picked up. No penalties for late delivery were attached to Hopewell's contract by the notoriously casual administration of the former prime minister, Mr Chatichai Choonhavan.</p>

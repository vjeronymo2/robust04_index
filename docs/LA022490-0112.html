			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPUTE OVER CEMETERY RAGES AMID JEWISH DECLINE IN EGYPT;  </P> <P> TRANSITION: AL BASATIN, AN AGING JEWISH BURIAL GROUND, IS THE UNLIKELY CENTER  OF AN AGELESS DISPUTE OVER PROGRESS.  </P> <P> On a windy plateau adjoining the vast City of the Dead, 350 crumbling Jewish  tombs represent much of what remains of the people Moses delivered out of  slavery. Amid the honking taxis and high-rise apartment buildings that now  populate the cities of Egypt, the Jews seem destined to disappear from the  country forever.  </P> <P> More than 150,000 Jews dominated Egypt's wealthy merchant class in the early  20th Century. Now, barely 64 are believed to remain. There is in all of Cairo  only one Jewish family. The last rabbi left in 1972. There are no bar mitzvahs.  There are no weddings.  </P> <P> "The very big problem is when one dies, there is not another born in his  place," said Jacques Jaffe, a 78-year-old former textile merchant who is one of  the few native Jews left in Egypt. "The battle will finish because there are no  fighters. This is the story."  </P> <P> Ten years after Egypt's official peace treaty with Israel, the late President  Anwar Sadat's pleas for the Jews to return to Egypt have gone unheeded, and the  aging Jewish cemetery on Cairo's outskirts has become an unlikely new boiling  point for an ageless dispute.  </P> <P> Plagued with choking traffic that for several hours a day virtually paralyzes  Cairo, the city's engineers are in the midst of a $197-million project to  construct a ring road to allow much of the regional traffic to skirt the  teeming heart of the city.  </P> <P> Several substantial sections of the highway already have been built, including  approaches near both ends of the 1,021-year-old Jewish cemetery of Al Basatin,  believed to be the oldest continuous Jewish cemetery in the world.  </P> <P> The bulldozers were due to plow into the cemetery last month until a rabbinical  delegation from around the world stepped in when Cairo's dwindling Jewish  population proved unable or unwilling to take on the Egyptian authorities over  the project.  </P> <P> The dispute -- which has drawn in rabbis from Israel, England, France, Canada,  Switzerland and the United States, as well as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak  -- has become a symptom of the chilly peace that has existed between Egypt and  Israel in the years since the Camp David accords.  </P> <P> Though the Israeli government has carefully avoided any role in the cemetery  dispute, talk of 20 years of war between Egypt and Israel has emerged during  talk about the dead, and few -- Egyptian or Israeli -- express surprise that  peace with Israel has failed to rejuvenate Egypt's dying Jewish community.  </P> <P> "The peace treaty came 10 years too late," one diplomat said with a shrug.  </P> <P> The Jewish population of the 1930s and 1940s was among the most successful and  cosmopolitan in Egypt, dominating Alexandria's social scene and operating  banks, factories and department stores all over Cairo.  </P> <P> But the creation of Israel in 1948 sent the first wave of immigrants out of  Egypt to populate the new Jewish state. And the Egyptian revolution and the  subsequent 1956 war with Israel created a backlash against Egyptian Jews that  sent many of those who remained fleeing for Europe, Israel and the United  States.  </P> <P> By the time of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, barely 1,500 Jews remained in Egypt.  Their numbers have been dwindling since.  </P> <P> The peace treaty so far has been insufficient to attract Israeli businessmen  back to economically troubled Egypt, and many Egyptians have been content to  leave it that way. Egypt's syndicates for lawyers, journalists and engineers  still forbid members to have contact with Israel. Egyptian newspapers rail  about Israeli leaders' perceived recalcitrance in settling the Palestinian  issue, and, in many cases, still refer to Israel as "the Zionist entity."  </P> <P> "You can't really say, 'Let's get on with being friendly and forget the past,'  " explained Hussein Husseini, a well-known Egyptian journalist. "This will not  happen, not with this generation -- perhaps not with the next."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, most expect Egypt's Jewish community to disappear within the next  few years, and a new crop of Israeli Jews, most say, probably will not emerge  in Egypt unless the troubling Palestinian issue is settled.  </P> <P> On the surface, the cemetery debate has nothing to do with peace treaties, but  nearly everyone involved admits that politics has fueled much of the emotional  fervor.  </P> <P> For their part, Egyptian authorities say privately that they fear a backlash  from their own citizens if they give special treatment to the Jewish cemetery,  when nearby Muslim and Coptic Christian graveyards already have been moved to  make way for the new highway.  </P> <P> "I think there is no problem, except all the Jews in the world make it a  problem," said Mohammed Raschi Morad, Cairo's director of reconstruction and  overseer of the ring road project.  </P> <P> The matter was about to be resolved a year ago when Cairo's Jewish community  agreed to move the 350 graves to Israel or to a nearby location in exchange for  a $31,400 settlement from the government to cover the costs, and provided that  a rabbi from Israel perform the appropriate ceremonies to consecrate the new  grave sites.  </P> <P> The chief rabbi in Israel appeared poised to approve the plan when rabbinical  groups from the United States stepped in and quickly drew support from other  rabbis around the world. Last month, former Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef  issued a statement declaring he had never given permission to transfer the  bones buried at Al Basatin and insisted that "the graves must be left intact."  </P> <P> "We do not intend to take this lying down," declared Brooklyn, N.Y., Rabbi  Herpz Frankel, chairman of the International Society to Preserve Jewish  Cemeteries. "The world Jewish opinion is united in this effort to achieve the  goal of preserving this cemetery, period. If the Egyptian government brings the  bulldozers, they will pay the consequences, I think, frankly speaking."  </P> <P> A rabbinical committee that toured the site with engineers in November suggests  building a bridge over the cemetery, or perhaps a tunnel below it, to preserve  the graves.  </P> <P> Morad says he would go along with the plan if the rabbinical group could also  suggest where to find the estimated $80 million to $100 million such a  diversion would cost. And what, he asks, of the bones buried beneath the  pilings of an overpass?  </P> <P> Another plan suggests relocating the bodies and building a fence around the new  cemetery at government expense, a proposal that is now tied up in the Egyptian  courts.  </P> <P> The aging president of the Jewish community in Cairo died in November, and his  successor, Emil Russo, throws up his hands when asked about the cemetery. He  says he is leaving it for the rabbis to debate.  </P></p>

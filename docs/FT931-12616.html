			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Controversy hits Sweden's Samurai issue SWEDEN'S Y200bn Samurai bond issue arranged by Nomura Securities yesterday became the subject of controversy when the three other leading Japanese securities houses set a precedent by refusing to participate, citing the aggressive pricing of the transaction. Their refusal is particularly embarrassing for Nomura because of the high profile of the deal, the largest issue to date in the Samurai market (the Japanese domestic bond market for foreign borrowers). The controversy has also dealt a blow to the development of a market once seen as a dumping ground for aggressively-priced deals. Under pressure from the Ministry of Finance, the securities houses last year reformed the market by bringing in practices already common in the Eurobond market, such as the fixed price re-offer mechanism and consensus pricing, designed to improve transparency. Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi all told Nomura that they did not see any demand for four-year bonds with a 4.2 per cent coupon and priced at par, but Nomura went ahead with the pricing as planned. 'There are quite a few competing products for Japanese investors, offering yields around that level or better,' said an official at one of the securities houses which stayed out of the deal. They also pointed out that Sweden's recent five-year Eurobond is currently yielding 66 basis points over the JGB yield curve, while the new four-year Samurai issue is yielding only 44 basis points more than the four-year JGB. The two markets are not directly comparable, as they are made up of different investors, and most traders report stronger demand in Japan than in Europe for yen bonds. An official at Nomura pointed out that the three securities houses were the only underwriters to decline, while 41 other institutions agreed to join the underwriting group, and added that it had placed nearly half the transaction on its own by the end of the first day. Meanwhile, new issues in the Eurobond market yesterday were spread across a variety of currency sectors. Finland's successful Dollars 1bn global offering, launched on Tuesday, was priced at the narrow end of the indicated range to yield 63 basis points over the comparable US Treasury.</p>

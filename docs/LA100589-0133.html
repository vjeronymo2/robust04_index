			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS FREE THE DREADED PHOTOCOPIER  </P> <P> Forty years into the era of xerography, the Soviet Union is getting ready to  move its photocopiers from their guarded, double-locked, steel-covered doors as  the country tries to catch up with the worldwide explosion of information.  </P> <P> The Soviet Ministry of Interior Affairs announced Wednesday that it wants to  "relinquish control over the acquisition, storage and operation of copying  equipment," admitting that photocopiers are now standard office equipment and  not really the grave threat to state security they were once perceived to be.  </P> <P> The ministry's Second Department of the Main Directorate of Protecting Public  Order acknowledged that the recent spread to more than 60,000 different Soviet  organizations of kseroks machines, as all photocopiers are called in Russian,  had made its task of supervising their operation virtually impossible.  </P> <P> In what will be a major step toward implementing President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's policy of free-flowing information under glasnost, or political  openness, the ministry is drafting regulations permitting government offices,  scientific institutions, enterprises and other organizations to assume  responsibility for their own photocopiers.  </P> <P> The immediate impact will probably be the importation of thousands more copiers  -- as soon as the foreign exchange can be found to buy them.  </P> <P> Inspectors from the Interior Ministry will no longer be checking each machine  to ensure that it is locked in secure quarters, that complete registers are  kept of the documents copied and that the numbers of copies correspond to the  tamper-proof counters required on each machine.  </P> <P> The truly conscientious inspectors had also checked the desks of the operators  for unauthorized materials and seized such contraband as horoscopes and sex  manuals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Semi-Criminal Operation'  </P> <P> Acknowledging that hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens -- engineers,  students, scientists, even grandmothers with medical records -- need documents  copied every day, the government newspaper Izvestia observed Wednesday that  those people have faced either very long lines, as they and their papers were  scrutinized at authorized photocopier offices, or "a semi-criminal operation"  to get papers copied quickly in violation of government controls.  </P> <P> Under the elaborate "instructions on procedures of printing nonclassified  documentation," adopted in 1974 to prevent dissidents from photocopying their  political tracts, then known as samizdat, or "self-published" materials,  getting anything copied was never quick and never anonymous.  </P> <P> The official reasons for all these controls -- to prevent the copying of  confidential documents in a state obsessed with secrecy and to thwart  counterfeiters -- were valid, Izvestia said, noting as well that "the primary  goal was to prevent the proliferation of undesirable texts" in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> "From the first days of Soviet power," the paper added, "even typewriters were  put under tight supervision, and that incidentally was abolished only  recently."  </P> <P> V. Vashenko, the chief of the Second Department of the Main Directorate of  Protecting Public Order, told Izvestia that, in fact, new technology has  overtaken the controls on photocopiers.  </P> <P> With computers, optical scanners, laser printers and other equipment for  desk-top publishing able "to produce a whole newspaper" and not subject to the  same strict controls as photocopiers, the regulations governing copiers have  become pointless.  </P> <P> "It is simply impossible to control this process now," Vashenko told Izvestia.  </P> <P> Once so rare that access was limited to top government and Communist Party  officials, scientists at the most prestigious research institutes and the KGB,  the state security agency, photocopiers have proliferated to the extent that  political activists of almost every kind have easy access to them.  </P></p>

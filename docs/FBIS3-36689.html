			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 8 Feb -- Members of the Federation  Council Committee for International Affairs intend to have a  preliminary familiarization with texts of all the international  agreements subject to ratification and examination by the  parliament. There are about 100 of these documents, and the  committee has made a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry to  submit them to the Federal Assembly's upper chamber, Vladimir  Podoprigora, chairman of the committee, told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent.    In accordance with the Russian Constitution, the federal  laws  on the ratification and denouncement of Russia's international  agreements are subject to mandatory ratification by the  Federation Council, he noted.    Podoprigora stressed that his committee will closely  coordinate work with colleagues in the lower chamber, and he has  already agreed with Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma's relevant  subdivision and experienced diplomat, to act in harmony to  ensure fruitful work. In his view, this is very important since  the process of passing agreements through parliament will now  become more complicated as they will be discussed at separate  sittings of the chambers.

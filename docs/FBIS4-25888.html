			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "New Foreign Investment Down by 50 Percent"] </F>   [Text] The growth of foreign-funded businesses in China is  slowing down due to State policy readjustments and keen  competition from neighbouring countries for outside capital,  said the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC).    The number of newly established foreign-funded enterprises  was 10,739 in the first quarter of this year, down 43.6 percent  compared to the same period last year.    There was also a 50 percent drop in new foreign investment  and registered capital, according to the latest SAIC statistics.    "The introduction of a new taxation system, which cuts down  preferential tax treatment for foreign-funded ventures, is a  major factor affecting new foreign investment," said Hou Lin,  head of the Enterprise Registration Department of SAIC.    Other policy readjustments, such as the suspension of  duty-free import of foreign cars by foreign-funded firms in  China, and the increasing competition among industries vying for  foreign funds also played a part.    Two other factors also contributed to the slowdown. The  first are the preferential policies adopted by some nearby Asian  countries to attract foreign investments, and the second is the  tightened economic control designed to cut down the scale of  capital investment.    "The slowdown in the growth of foreign-funded firms is  normal  and it is good that the State standardizes foreign firms and  joint ventures and improves their management in China," Hou said.    He added that the rapid growth of foreign-funded firms in  the  past two years saw some unhealthy practices.    For example, bogus joint ventures had been set up to take  advantage of Chinese preferential policies.    A small increase in the number of foreign-funded firms was  reported in. Beijing, Jilin and Tibet Autonomous Region.  However, the number plunged by more than 50 percent in 12  provinces and regions including Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang,  Hainan and Hunan.    About 70 percent of the foreign investment went to the  industrial sector while investment in real estate, public  utility projects and consultancy services is cooling.    The number of joint ventures decreased by 50 percent in the  first quarter but the number of foreignowned firms rose by 6  percent, according to SAIC statistics.    There were a total of 167,000 overseas-funded businesses in  the country by the end of last year.</p>

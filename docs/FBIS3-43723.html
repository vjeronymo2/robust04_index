			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is talk that progress has been made in Lusaka,  the Zambian capital, where the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] have over the last  week discussed the issue of the formation of a new national  police force. Diplomatic sources in Lusaka say that UN Special  Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, the principal mediator at  the talks, has managed to reduce differences between the two  sides concerning the police issue. Those sources also say that  the two sides are reported to have reached an understanding that  the police would be a state administration organ. It is  noteworthy that UN Special Representative Blondin Beye has had  separate meetings with the two sides over the last two days with  a view to narrowing differences over the police issue.    Should those reports prove to be true, the negotiators will  now have to discuss issues pertaining to national  reconciliation, the future role of the United Nations in Angola,  UNITA's active participation in government, and the second round  of presidential elections. Only one thing is quite clear: the  riot police must really be scrapped.</p>

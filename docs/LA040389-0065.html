			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: AT MICHIGAN, HIS ARTISTRY DOESN'T END ON THE COURT  </P> <P> As he was touring the Louvre last summer, or pausing on his morning strolls of  the boulevards of Paris to inspect the canvases of the various street artists,  Rumeal Robinson thought a lot about how art imitates life, and the way life  imitates art.  </P> <P> He thought about the gallery he intends to open someday, the one that will  enable him to exhibit the works of undiscovered geniuses such as himself. He  made a mental memo that when the barnstorming University of Michigan basketball  team returned from its European junket, he must submerge back into that  makeshift studio in the basement of his Ann Arbor apartment building to  complete that portrait of one of his professors that he had been putting off.  </P> <P> Renoir, meet Rumeal.  </P> <P> Already this young man has mastered the art of survival. He was homeless,  abandoned by both parents as a child in Jamaica, then adopted by the parents of  an American boy he barely knew. He also had a learning disability, and was  forced to miss his freshman year of college basketball because his Scholastic  Aptitude Test threw words at him that were beyond his scholastic aptitude.  </P> <P> "Words like regatta. What did somebody like myself know what regatta meant?"  Robinson remembered. "You're not going to see any regattas in Boston or the  Bronx, the places where I spent most of my time. It's just like black history.  I'm sure you wouldn't have known a lot about black history, if somebody had  asked you about that on some test. You're not taught black history."  </P> <P> Rather than pout, Robinson took advantage of his year of Proposition  48-enforced idleness. He embraced collegiate life. He took art and psychology  courses. He played basketball in an intramural league with pre-med and pre-law  yuppies who convinced themselves that they could match jumpers with the Parade  All-American from Patrick Ewing's high school in Cambridge, Mass., which amused  Rumeal to no end.  </P> <P> No one or nothing could keep this kid down. Athletically, he has risen to great  heights, playing the playmaker's role for the Michigan team that will engage  Seton Hall here tonight for college basketball's national championship, earning  acclaim as the best junior guard in the land. Academically? Rumeal Robinson,  product of Cambridge, Class of Prop. 48, will receive his degree in December  from a university that fancies itself "the Harvard of the Midwest."  </P> <P> "Masterpiece Theatre" was rarely so compelling.  </P> <P> As an adolescent he whiled away balmy tropical days diving into the deep blue  sea for lobsters. Often, little Rumeal reclined on the hot sand of Negril Beach  until sundown, in no particular hurry to get home because nobody in particular  was expecting him there. His father, Rupert, he never knew. His mother, Virus,  took off for the mainland without him. A grandmother and some cousins looked  after him, provided a bed, until he was 6, when Virus sent word from her new  home near Boston, wanting there to be a mother-and-child reunion.  </P> <P> It lasted two years. Then, again, she was gone. A foster family took Rumeal in.  His mother reappeared. Back he moved with her. Just as abruptly, she split.  Managing to scrape up enough money for fare to Jamaica, Rumeal returned to the  island, in search of his father. When he got there, an aunt told him Rupert  Robinson was dead.  </P> <P> Finally, when he was 13, Rumeal was playing flag football with another boy  named Donald Ford, who heard of his predicament. Louis Ford, a Boston  letter-carrier, and his wife, Helen, listened to their son's story, then asked  his friend if he cared to move in with the Fords and their other four children.  Rumeal did.  </P> <P> Helen Ford wept four years later when her latest arrival announced that he had  chosen Michigan, so far away, over Villanova, which wasn't that long a drive  from their Massachusetts home. She feared she might never again see Rumeal play  the game he had come to play so well. When Michigan made it to this year's  Final Four, the Fords could afford to send only Helen and one of the children  to Seattle. They came to the game.  </P> <P> After a Boston newspaper account chronicled the family's situation, a donor  sprang for another ticket. Louis Ford hopped on a jet Saturday, flew  cross-country, and arrived at Seattle's Kingdome with eight minutes remaining  in Michigan's game against Illinois. Not until he reached the team's hotel  afterward did Rumeal realize his foster father had, for the first time, seen  him play a college game.  </P> <P> Everything he has endured, Robinson said here Sunday, has "taught me to be a  stronger person. I'm not going to dwell on the past. It was very sad to be so  young and all alone, without a real home. A lot of older people came along to  help me. The bad times? I honestly believe there aren't really any bad times.  There are just some times that are better than other times."  </P> <P> Few times have been better than the one he is having now.  </P> <P> Robinson described it, as any person of his background might, as something on  the order of receiving a new bicycle as a gift. At night, you want to ride it,  but you can't, so you lay in bed and think about it, he said. Next morning, you  can't wait to get back on. He thinks of the national tournament this way.  </P> <P> From the end of last season, when Robinson threw 29 points, six assists and  five rebounds at North Carolina in a losing cause in the West Regional in this  very town, to the start of this season, when Rumeal outplayed Oklahoma's  much-publicized Mookie Blaylock head to head, everything has been going his  way. Even the ouster of the man who recruited him, Bill Frieder, never swayed  him, although they were so close that Robinson was the first player Frieder  phoned after accepting the Arizona State job.  </P> <P> Although generally a sweetheart, Robinson sometimes can be cocky, almost  overbearing, about his own abilities. He resents, for example, being compared  to Gary Grant, the former Michigan guard now with the Clippers, even saying  when he was younger: "I am the type of player who can do anything, like no one  you've ever seen in the Midwest. I played in the shadow of Gary Grant for one  year, but I have the ability to pass and shoot."  </P> <P> Comparisons of any kind disturb Robinson.  </P> <P> "Nobody ever compared Julius Erving or Magic Johnson to anyone," he told the  Detroit Free Press. "The only guy they ever compared me to was a guard in New  York City who never played in college. He was shot eight times by the police --  in the wrong place at the wrong time -- and never played again. His name was  Jimmy something."  </P> <P> There is something about his manner, or maybe the listener's knowledge of his  upbringing, that makes Robinson's words seem more fiercely independent than  boastful. As when someone Sunday asked him which guards gave him trouble in the  tough Big Ten Conference this season. Said Robinson: "I don't feel anybody did.  The only thing that ever bothered me from playing my game is Rumeal Robinson.  Me."  </P> <P> Until you understand somebody, you shouldn't judge him. That is Robinson's  advice. That is what unnerved him about those SAT questions, that they never  take into account the cultural differences of a kid from Jamaica versus a kid  from Seattle versus a kid from New York who, in Robinson's own words, rarely  runs with the sort of friends who rush home to pick up a book, or even to eat  supper at the same time as the rest of the family.  </P> <P> "We were the first guinea pigs of that test," Robinson said, speaking also on  behalf of teammate Terry Mills, with whom he roomed while Prop. 48 denied them  freshman eligibility. "Nobody gave us a legitimate chance, from first grade on.  Nobody said, 'There's going to be a test. If you fail it, you're out.' " He was  considered intelligent enough to be accepted into college, but he was prejudged  incapable of juggling schoolwork and basketball simultaneously.  </P> <P> Rumeal used the free time to refine his art. He specialized in flowers, Georgia  O'Keeffe style, and landscapes. He worked in everything from oil to chalk. He  studied everything from animators to amateurs to the masters.  </P> <P> "It was amazing to see how well they drew in Paris. They have so much to draw  in that city, the old architecture, the charm. The location is important. I  could see myself doing a landscape of Detroit, but nobody would probably like  it for 50 years.  </P> <P> "Most artists aren't widely known until after their deaths. They should be  known now," he said.  </P> <P> Rumeal Robinson, himself a real piece of work, hopes his personal handiwork  will direct Michigan to the national championship. If successful, perhaps he  will go out and paint the town. If not, well, you know how these artists love  to suffer. Maybe he will cut off an ear.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, February 22 (CTK) -- The Liberal National  and Social Party (LSNS) considers the personal initiative of  Defense Minister Antonin Baudys for solving the Bosnian crisis  as highly unfortunate, LSNS Chairman Pavel Hirs told journalists  today.    Hirs said the situation showed the need for coordination in  the Czech Republic's foreign policy.    The LSNS completely disagrees and fundamentally rejects the  idea of Baudys' plan, whereby a committee of countries connected  to the warring sides in Bosnia by shared religious and cultural  values would be created to oversee the peace process. Hirs said  the problem of Bosnia could not be internationalized, for in  this way Russia would very easily get into this space and would  once again dominate southern and central Europe. The plan  divided spheres of interest, which was always dangerous, Hirs  said, because it would lead to the internationalization of the  whole problem.    In democratic systems ministers leave their seats for  relatively small sins, Hirs said. I would not like to comment  myself on the decision of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS)  Executive Council. I believe that decisions concerning whether  to dismiss or not to dismiss a coalition minister should be made  by the government, not by the executive council of a party,  although it is a coalition one, Hirs said, asked by CTK what he  thought of the ODS Executive Council's recommendation that  Premier Vaclav Klaus consider Baudys' dismissal.    LSNS believes that no minister, not even the premier, should  be allowed to carry out foreign policy activity without  informing their own government and the foreign ministry. If  they did so, it was inexcusable and creates a very bad  impression abroad. Foreign policy is the business of the whole  government, and foreign activity should be coordinated,  consulted and approved by the government, Hirs said.</p>

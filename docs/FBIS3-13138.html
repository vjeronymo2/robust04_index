			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Excerpts] Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman  for the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has urged the other  Palestinian forces and factions to develop a jihad and militant  program to deal with settlers and Zionist occupation.    He said: The Zionist challenge forces all to confront this  challenge. The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions [Hamas military  wing] have worked out a plan to deal with the phenomenon of  settlement, the most dangerous phenomenon of occupation, which  stands as the beginning of extending the Zionist entity to any  land on which settlements are built.    In an interview with AL-DUSTUR, he said the jihad and  struggle operations are not coordinated for pure security  reasons. Each mujahid and struggling group plans and carries  out its independent operations, but these operations should have  specific objective and timing.    He added: We believe that Palestinian forces, whether they  are 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, Fatah Hawks, the Red  Eagle, or any another mujahid faction are asked to meet the  demands of the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic  nations by taking revenge on criminal Zionists and give a clear  signal to the world that the Jewish blood is not dearer than the  Arab or Muslim blood.    Ghawshah was answering a question on coordination between  the  members of Alliance of the Palestinian Forces [APF], or between  Fatah and Hamas, to retaliate against the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre. He said: There are some technical obstacles such as  curfew, siege, and restrictions imposed by occupation. These  measures may delay the retaliation, but certainly a good chance  will come and should be used with full force, sacrifice, and  determination. [passage omitted]    He concluded his interview by saying the APF will hold a  meeting in Damascus on 20 March to discuss organizational and  political issues. He said an APF delegation will be formed to  visit the Libyan Jamahiriyah this month. The visit will be the  beginning of other visits that will include a large number of  Arab and Islamic countries, including Iran.</p>

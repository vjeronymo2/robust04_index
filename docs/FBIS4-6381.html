			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Greenpeace Called Upon To Bring Action Against Nuclear </F> Waste Dumping by South Korean Authorities" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in a  letter to the headquarters of the Greenpeace, an international  environmental movement organisation, on April 13 said the South  Korean people who are exposed to radioactive substances from  atomic reactors used for development of nuclear weapons and  exposed to constant nuclear threats by a nuclear powder magazine  of the United States, hope that the Greenpeace will make a  thorough probe into the nuclear waste dumping by the South  Korean authorities and their nuclear arms development and bring  an action against them before the world, the Seoul-based Radio  Voice of National Salvation reported.    Recalling that the South Korean authorities dumped into the  East Sea of Korea nuclear wastes amounting to 11,000 trillion  becquerels in the period from 1986 to 1992, the letter says:    "When their such criminal dumping began to be called in  question, arousing world public opinion, the South Korean  authorities started a socalled `joint survey' in the East Sea of  Korea with Russia and Japan, accomplices in nuclear waste  dumping, and will reportedly notify the International Atomic  Energy Agency of its results.    "This cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to  conceal their nuclear waste dumping with the backing of some  biased officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency who  have already conspired with them in their nuclear racket against  the North, shunning the observation of the Greenpeace.    "The board of governors of the IAEA, while taking issue with  the North over its pilot reactor, branding it as one intended  for the development of nuclear weapons, is overlooking heavy  water reactors and multi-purpose research reactors for military  purposes of the South, and has never published even any results  of its inspection to speak of.    "Amidst of such biased clamor for nuclear inspection by the  IAEA board of governors, the South Korean authorities have  accelerated nuclear arms development and are now openly claiming  `nuclear sovereignty' to justify their nuclear armament.    "If such nuclear development is overlooked, it will not only  destroy the natural ecology but may inflict a grave nuclear  calamity upon our people and nation.    "Our Hanminjon will in the future, too, notify the  Greenpeace  about data on the criminal nuclear waste dumping and nuclear  arms development by the South Korean authorities."</p>

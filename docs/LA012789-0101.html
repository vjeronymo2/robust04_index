			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> KING'S SINGERS AT EL CAMINO: STYLISH, YET THIN TONES  </P> <P> Vocal virtuosity, stylishness of delivery, abundant slickness and slender,  slender tone remain the stock in trade of the touring King's Singers, a male  sextet of English musicians now in their 21st season. Little has changed in the  group's performances since its first visit here 15 years ago.  </P> <P> At their El Camino College appearance Wednesday night in Marsee Auditorium, the  six good-looking, personable vocalists repeated some of their past successes  while introducing new parts of an ever-expanding repertory.  </P> <P> Gyorgy Ligeti's "Nonsense Madrigals," written for the King's Singers last  summer and first performed at the Berlin Festival in September, brings together  felicitously the Hungarian composer's myriad technical complexities and this  ensemble's many musical accomplishments in an amusing, sometimes awesome,  display of musical clockworks.  </P> <P> Still, genuine depth seems to elude the composer here; the real resonance in  these four pieces and 11 minutes comes from the texts by Lewis Carroll and  others. At the end, one can admire the work without having been touched.  </P> <P> Strong entertainment values also characterized the performances of Robert  Chilcott's recent "Simple Gifts," a group of five American folk songs arranged  in a calculated but pleasing way, and of the sextet's familiar Beatles medley,  which closed the program. Despite recurrent problems of intonational  consistency, three pieces by William Byrd emerged pristine in style and usually  comprehensible of text.  </P> <P> Least successful in this varied program was the King's Singers' bland,  thin-toned and word-weak attempt at five part-songs by Schubert. True  versatility is an ideal, not always a practical goal. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

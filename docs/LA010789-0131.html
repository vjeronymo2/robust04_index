			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTNUCLEAR BEER DECISION DELAYED  </P> <P> The Laguna Beach Board of Adjustment put off until Jan. 19 a decision whether  to permit beer sales at Club Postnuclear, a rock concert venue at 775 Laguna  Canyon Road.  </P> <P> The decision was to have been reached Thursday but, according to Jack Connors,  zoning administrator for the city, improper notices went out to area residents.  </P> <P> The club opened in July with a no-alcohol, no-smoking policy; only soft drinks,  cappuccino and espresso are sold.  </P> <P> But club owner William (Max) Nee said recently that about half his customers  have said they would like to have beer. By adding beer sales, Postnuclear also  could expand its potential draw, Nee said. MARK I. PINSKY  </P></p>

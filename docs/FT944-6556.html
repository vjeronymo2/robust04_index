			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: ABC's star attraction The big US broadcasters have been kept out of television production for several decades. Now the shackles are being removed, it is hardly surprising they are rushing to get into the business. When there is an opportunity to link up with media titans such as Mr Steven Spielberg, Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg and Mr David Geffen, the temptation to do so must be irresistible. Capital Cities/ABC clearly hopes for a string of hit TV shows from the trio, which it can then syndicate throughout the US. The deal may make sense for ABC. But the commercial logic behind networks building their own production capacity - rather than buying in programmes on an arms-length basis - is not clear-cut. On the plus side, vertical integration should allow cost savings in that a tied studio should not need its own syndication department. Integration should also shift much of the risk of making programmes from studios to networks. Arguably such risk-allocation is efficient, since networks have bigger balance sheets. If a close relationship allows studio and network to communicate more effectively, the risk of making dud programmes might even be reduced. But there are negatives too. Tied studios, secure of an outlet for their programmes, could easily lose their commercial edge. ABC might also find it hard to rein in its three stars, if ever their programmes were not up to scratch or ran over budget. ABC might note that in the UK there is something of a move away from vertical integration: in a drive to improve value for money, the BBC is contracting out an increasing proportion of its production.</p>

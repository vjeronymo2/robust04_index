It will finalize detailed ways and means of their  privatization with enough time, not sticking to the  previously-set deadline of September.    The decision was made by senior officials from relevant  ministries in a meeting convened by Vice Economic Planning  Minister Han I-hun Wednesday which focused on reviews of  problems which could arise in the privatization process,  officials present at the two-hour session said yesterday.    It came after critics blamed the administration for  commissioning the Federation of Korean Industries, a lobbying  group of conglomerates, to select the winning bidder for the  second cellular phone business license and letting some chaebols  [business conglomerates] share interests in this project.    Concrete measures will be determined later but officials  were  initially inclined to divide business scopes of Korea Gas Corp.  [KGC] into several parts and put them under the control of  private investors to lead them to competition.    In this regard, each supply network and station of liquefied  natural gas will have a different largest shareholder. KGC is  subject to privatization next year.    A golf course in the Cheju resort of Chungmun, run by Korea  National Tourism Corp., will be placed on a public tender after  thorough assessment of its value by August.    Officials will keep deliberating on whether or not they will  allow National Agricultural Cooperative Federation to maintain  the controlling share of 25 percent in Namhae Chemical Corp., a  chemical fertilizer producer, for stable supply of the key  farming material.    However, they will positively consider permitting the  participation by large companies in a bidding for the purchase  of Hanjung shares because the giant firm will not be managed  effectively without their involvement.    Hanjung, formerly Korea Heavy Industry &amp; Construction  Co.,  will be handed over to private shareholders gradually after 1996  when it will lose its 15-year authorization to solely supply  large power generating facilities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by correspondent </F> Judit Jarai; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Jarai] Do you think that full  membership of the European Union can be attained in five or six  years?    [Boross] [passage omitted] As a matter of fact, it can. It  can be attained if the Hungarian economy is no longer hit by  crises such as the collapse of the Soviet market or the Yugoslav  war. [passage omitted] Or a crisis like the West European  recession.    [[Jarai] According to the prime minister, will this  association membership cover security issues as well, apart from  cooperation and political dialogue?    [Boross] [passage omitted] I have to mention here the  Partnership for Peace, which provides an opportunity to get  closer to NATO. [passage omitted] It is a rule for a country  of Hungary's size to seek entry to security organizations,  European and NATO, as soon as possible, because in this way we  will be given definite security guarantees. I think it takes  some time.    [Jarai] I think it is evident that the security of Eastern  Europe depends on the settling of minority issues. [passage  omitted] Can the Balladur plan help our region to sort out these  conflicts through negotiations and peaceful means?    [Boross] Every plan that has the backing of sufficiently  strong political forces and which aims to consolidate these  conditions can help. [passage omitted] I would like to add that  sometimes the minority issue becomes synonymous with fighting  and the danger of war and so on. This is not true. In  Yugoslavia, the war is going on between nations. I consider it  inconceivable for neighboring countries with a Hungarian  minority, however aggressive they become, to reach a stage where  they would want a conflict. [passage omitted]    We are fully aware of our own intentions, [that is] to  settle  or at least improve these issues by political means: Applying  peaceful means, seeking understanding, but at the same time  strongly representing ethnic Hungarians living beyond the border.    [Jarai] In your view, what mechanisms can this plan  [Balladur's plan] contain?    [Boross] What the Hungarians [magyarsag] beyond the border  require -- and I say this in a very simplified way -- is to live  as Hungarians. [passage omitted] Their demands have to be  addressed first. In addition to this, atrocities, unnecessary  provocation must not befall them. I think, for example, of the  bill on population proportions [in Slovakia], which enables  manipulation through a change of administrative borders  [reference to Slovak aspirations to redraw administrative  districts, a move which would result in districts with small  Hungarian populations]. It is a crude method and the cloven  hoof is showing. There are those who want to evade  responsibilities in this way.    I think that the very simple needs have to be submitted. It  has to be said again that the country, and the Hungarians  [magyarsag] as such, do not strive immediately to swoop down on  the borders -- that were guaranteed by peace treaties -- and to  overturn them. This is the phobia that haunts many in our  neighborhood. [passage omitted]    It is our responsibility to represent the interests of  Hungarians beyond the border. [passage omitted]</p>

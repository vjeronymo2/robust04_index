			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Doubt thrown on Start-2 approval THE Start-2 disarmament treaty became the latest political football in Russia's pre-referendum electioneering, when Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliamentary speaker, yesterday said deputies would not ratify it until the foreign minister was sacked. 'First of all this treaty should be submitted by a minister of foreign affairs who enjoys the respect and trust of society. As long as there is no such minister, I think it is absurd to even talk about Start-2,' he said. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, one of the architects of the treaty slashing US and Russian nuclear arsenals, is hated by conservatives for his pro-western policies. The Georgian leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk yesterday signed a friendship and mutual assistance treaty in Kiev with the clear intention of forming a political front against Russia, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. Mr Shevardnadze said Ukraine had agreed to act as a peacekeeper in the Georgian region of Abkhazia, where government forces are fighting separatists. He added that Ukraine and Georgia might co-operate in producing armaments and training soldiers.</p>

Model 369, 369A (OH&hyph;6A), 369D, E, F, FF, H, HE, HS, and HM series helicopters, that requires daily preflight checks and 100 hours time-in-service (TIS) inspections for tail rotor blade abrasion strip (abrasion strip) debonding until abrasion strip rivets (rivets) are installed. This amendment also supersedes a Priority Letter AD that currently requires installation of rivets, corrects tail rotor blade part numbers listed in the previous AD, and retains the daily preflight checks of the previous AD until rivets are installed to secure the abrasion strip. This AD provides a terminating action for the abrasion strip debonding and also seeks to clear up any confusion among operators caused by having a published AD and a Priority Letter that are applicable to the same helicopter part. This AD replaces both of those documents. This amendment is prompted by an accident resulting from the separation of an abrasion strip from a tail rotor blade and subsequent tail rotor separation. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the abrasion strip, separation of the tail rotor, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective September 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 10, 1992 at 57 FR 5379 (February 14, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received by November 7, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;03&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company, Technical Publications, Bldg. 530/B111, 5000 E.

That AD requires installation of the rivets within 300 hours TIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of a more recent helicopter accident involving the separation of an abrasion strip, on October 16, 1992, the FAA issued Priority Letter (PL) AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;14 that superseded the existing AD 92&hyph;02&hyph;15. The PL AD corrects certain tail rotor blade part numbers as listed in AD 92&hyph;02&hyph;15 and retains the daily preflight checks of the previous AD 92&hyph;02&hyph;15 until rivets are installed. The PL AD further requires installation of the rivets within 25 hours TIS or within 7 days, whichever comes first.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both AD 92&hyph;02&hyph;15, issued December 31, 1991 and the PL AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;14, issued October 16, 1992, require a visual check for evidence of debonding before the first flight of each day. However, AD 92&hyph;02&hyph;15 requires installation of rivets within 300 hours TIS while PL AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;14 requires installation of the rivets within 25 hours TIS or on or before 7 days after the effective date of that AD. Both of these ADs require the same corrective action but have different compliance times. Additionally, the PL AD did not specify whether the 7-day compliance time was in terms of ``work'' days or ``calendar'' days. As a result of having two ADs that require the same corrective action with only differing compliance times, and additionally failing to specifically describe the type of compliance day as that term was used in the PL AD, operators may be confused about when compliance is required. Such confusion may lead an operator to inadvertently fail to comply with the necessary safety requirements for these rotorcraft and result in an unsafe condition. Therefore, due to the criticality of the abrasion strip, the short compliance times, and the possible confusion as a result of having two effective ADs that require the same corrective action with one containing a potentially confusing compliance time, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to correcting the unsafe conditions described, this AD also provides that installation of the rivets to secure the abrasion strip constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The checks required by this AD before the first flight of each day may be performed by an owner/operator (pilot) but must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with sections 43.11 and 91.417 (a)(2)(v) of the Federal Aviation Regulations. This AD allows a pilot to perform this check because it involves only a visual check for debonding of the abrasion strip from the tail rotor blade and is required only until rivets are installed. This check can be performed equally well by a pilot or a mechanic. It involves checking items similar to those items that a pilot checks during a preflight. Safety does not require that this check be performed by a mechanic before the first flight of each day. The AD does require that a mechanic inspect the tail rotor blades within 25 hours TIS or within 7 calendar days, whichever occurs first.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other helicopters of the same type design, this AD supersedes the PL, AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;14, and AD 92&hyph;02&hyph;15 to require more prompt installation of rivets, to specify that the 7 days compliance time refers to calendar days, and to correct tail rotor blade part numbers as listed in AD 92&hyph;02&hyph;15. The daily preflight checks required by paragraph (a) of AD 92&hyph;02&hyph;15 are retained until rivets are installed. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with Part II of McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company Service Information Notice HN&hyph;232, DN&hyph;179, EN&hyph;70 and FN&hyph;57, dated September 27, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Invited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

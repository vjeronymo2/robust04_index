			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / US economic growth better than expected THE US economy grew at an annual rate of 0.8 per cent in the final quarter of last year, slightly better than financial markets expected, revised figures from the Commerce Department indicated yesterday. The figures should provide a boost for the Bush administration, which is trying to convince the electorate that the recession is over. Initial estimates indicated growth of only 0.3 per cent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. Real gross domestic product has now grown sluggishly for three quarters following a sharp contraction in the winter of 1990 to 1991. Many analysts, however, remain gloomy about the current quarter. In a speech this week, Mr David Mullins, the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he would not be surprised if the economy declined slightly. The Fed and most private sector analysts expect moderate growth to resume by the middle of this year. The Commerce Department said the upward revision to GDP for the fourth quarter mainly reflected a higher estimate of business inventories and personal consumption, partially offset by lower net exports. Yesterday's report, however, still pointed to a very weak economy. In real terms, personal consumption, business fixed investment and federal government purchases all declined relative to the third quarter. Overall, gross domestic purchases declined at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent. The rise in business inventories at the end of last year, moreover, is seen as an involuntary reaction to weaker than expected demand. It has prompted production cuts in the current quarter. The Fed remains concerned by exceptionally weak consumer confidence - which fell to a 17-year low this month - and by the failure of long bond yields to decline in response to cuts in short-term interest rates. Bond yields influence mortgage rates and hence the pace of housing recovery. Yesterday's report, however, showed a further moderation in inflationary pressures. The price index for gross domestic purchases - a broad measure of inflation - rose 2.3 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with 2.5 per cent in the third.</p>

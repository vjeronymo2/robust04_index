			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Iraqis face humanitarian crisis, says Oxfam 'ORDINARY Iraqis are still facing a humanitarian crisis,' according to a team of aid workers that has just returned from Iraq. The team, from the British-based charity Oxfam, spent two weeks in Iraq visiting Baghdad, the south and the north. They were especially concerned by the lack of sewage treatment and clean water supplies in the south (where many urban areas are ankle deep in 70 per cent raw sewage) and by the lack of heating oil in the north, where oak forests are being felled for firewood in the absence of other fuel. The shortage of textbooks, blackboards and other educational aids throughout the country was another big area of concern. At a press conference in London yesterday Mr David Jones, Oxfam's associate director who led the team, urged the UN and Iraq to resume negotiations on oil sales to finance the purchase of food and other humanitarian supplies not subject to UN sanctions. He also called for the sanctions regime to be re-examined to allow more exemptions, notably for educational supplies, the lack of which was 'stunting the mental development of a generation of Iraqi children'.</p>

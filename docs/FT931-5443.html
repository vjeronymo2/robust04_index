			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Three further sterling issues dominate activity FURTHER supply in the sterling bond market dominated activity yesterday, with three more issues totalling Pounds 350m. Demand remains generally strong, particularly among UK investors who are keen to improve their returns by buying some higher yielding assets, following the sharp declines in UK interest rates. Rank Organisation's Pounds 100m issue of bonds due 2000 sold out rapidly, due to the pricing of the issue at a yield spread of 140 basis points over the comparable gilt. Investors felt that the margin was an attractive reward for taking a single-A rated asset, and UK institutions rushed to buy paper. The spread of the deal, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, tightened by about five basis points. The bonds are callable at any time at the higher of par or the yield of the 9 per cent gilt due 2000. Rank is using the proceeds of the issue to pay off more expensive bank debt. In contrast, a Pounds 100m issue for Commerzbank, due December 1998, proved difficult to sell. The issue was priced at 37 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998, which appeared tightly priced compared with secondary market levels, dealers said. However, the chances of getting the deal away slimmed, when a Pounds 150m deal for Bayerische Hypobank, a similarly-rated German bank, was launched at a spread of 50 basis points over the same gilt. By the end of trading, the Commerzbank deal, arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, had not broken syndicate. Both banks raised the funds for their sterling-based operations, bankers said. Meanwhile, JP Morgan is believed to be arranging a Pounds 100m issue for Carlsberg, and other offerings, especially for UK companies keen to lock in lower interest rates, are also in the pipeline. Great Belt, the Danish state-owned tunnel link developer, launched a Y35bn issue of five-year Eurobonds led by Daiwa Europe, and also brought a DKr1.5bn issue of 10-year zero coupon bonds, arranged by Kidder Peabody. In the dollar sector, Copene, the Brazilian petrochemical producer launched a Dollars 50m five-year deal, which was subsequently increased to Dollars 65m. The issue, the borrower's second in the Eurobond market, was able to go ahead despite recent uncertainty over the Brazilian government's stability.</p>

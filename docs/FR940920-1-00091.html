The MACT floor for PM at large MWC plants is 27 mg/dscm. The MACT floor will require greater than a 99-percent reduction in PM emissions. The EPA's analysis of data from existing MWC's showed that both SD/FF and SD/ESP systems can meet MACT floor PM levels. Although the newest SD/FF systems can meet levels of less than 15 mg/dscm, SD/ESP systems and many existing SD/FF systems cannot achieve such levels. Therefore, the proposed MACT for PM at large MWC's is the MACT floor level of 27 mg/dscm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Cadmium for Large MWC Plants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Average uncontrolled levels of Cd are about 1.2 mg/dscm from MWC's. The MACT floor for Cd for large MWC plants is 0.25 mg/dscm. Therefore, the MACT floor will require about 80-percent Cd reduction. As with Pb, Cd control is associated with PM control. The EPA's analysis of Cd control showed that SD/FF systems can generally achieve Cd levels of less than 0.010 mg/dscm and that SD/ESP systems can achieve less than 0.040 mg/dscm. The Cd removal efficiency achievable with an SD/FF is only about 1.2 percent better than an SD/ESP (99.5-percent reduction versus 98.3-percent reduction, respectively). Again, the high cost of retrofit to an SD/FF is considered unreasonable for such a small incremental reduction in emissions. Because a level of 0.040 mg/dscm is achievable with both SD/ESP and SD/FF systems, and these technologies would already be needed to meet MACT for acid gas control, the proposed MACT for Cd is more stringent than the MACT floor, at a level of 0.040 mg/dscm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Lead for Large MWC Plants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Uncontrolled Pb emissions from MWC's are about 25 mg/dscm, and the MACT floor for large MWC's is 0.53 mg/dscm. A reduction of about 98 percent would be needed to achieve the MACT floor. The SD/ESP or SD/FF systems needed to meet MACT for acid gases will also meet the MACT floor for Pb. The EPA's analysis of Pb control showed that SD/FF systems can meet Pb levels of 0.20 mg/dscm, and SD/ESP systems can meet Pb levels of 0.50 mg/dscm. The Pb removal efficiency achievable with an SD/FF is only about 0.8 percent better than an SD/ESP (reductions of about 99.8 versus 99.0 percent, respectively). As explained above, the cost of replacing an SD/ESP with an SD/FF would be unreasonable considering the small difference in control efficiency. Because both SD/FF and SD/ESP systems can achieve Pb levels of 0.50 mg/dscm, the proposed MACT for Pb is more stringent than the MACT floor, at a level of 0.50 mg/dscm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Mercury for Large MWC Plants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Uncontrolled levels of Hg from MWC's are about 0.65 mg/dscm on average. The MACT floor for Hg for large plants is 0.36 mg/dscm. The MACT floor, therefore, will require about 40-percent reduction in Hg emissions. As described in section IV.F.1.b of this preamble, Hg control can be achieved by using activated carbon injection in combination with an acid gas/PM control system (and the associated low flue gas temperatures). Recent tests at the MWC's at Camden County, New Jersey (SD/ESP), and Stanislaus County, California (SD/FF), demonstrate that both SD/ESP and SD/FF systems with activated carbon injection can achieve an 85-percent emission reduction in Hg emissions or an Hg emission level of 0.080 mg/dscm, corrected to 7 percent O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Data from individual test runs show occasional spikes of high inlet Hg emissions due to the variability in the waste feed composition. In cases where Hg levels are temporarily elevated, a 0.080 mg/dscm level may not be consistently achievable; however, activated carbon injection could achieve an 85-percent reduction during such episodes. Based on the data from MWC's using activated carbon injection, Hg control to these levels is achievable by properly operated systems on all types of MWC's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the MACT floor requires Hg control, the control levels achievable using SD/ESP or SD/FF systems and activated carbon injection are more stringent than the MACT floor. The incremental cost of reducing Hg emissions from the MACT floor level of 0.36 mg/dscm to the demonstrated level of 0.080 is less than about $1.00/Mg of MSW combusted. This incremental cost is considered reasonable given the toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of Hg. Therefore, the proposed MACT guidelines for Hg are 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction, whichever is least stringent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has selected activated carbon injection as the basis for achieving MACT for Hg, although facilities may use any technology capable of meeting the proposed guideline. Of the three Hg control technologies discussed in section IV.F.1.b of this preamble, the EPA has determined that activated carbon injection is the most widely tested of the three Hg control technologies in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Dioxins/Furans for Large MWC Plants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The average level of dioxins/furans from an uncontrolled MWC is about 1,000 ng/dscm total mass. The MACT floor for total dioxins/furans of 100 ng/dscm would require about a 90-percent reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dioxins/furans are controlled by GCP and acid gas/PM control. Good combustion practices alone can achieve total dioxin/furan levels of about 500 ng/dscm. In combination with GCP, SD/FF systems can achieve total dioxin/furan levels less than 30 ng/dscm, and SD/ESP systems can achieve total dioxin/furan levels of less than 60 ng/dscm. Therefore, the MACT floor (i.e., 100 ng/dscm) can be achieved with either SD/ESP or SD/FF systems, and these systems would already be the basis for meeting MACT for acid gas and PM emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the MACT for Hg would be based on activated carbon injection. Recent tests at the Camden County, New Jersey, MWC showed that the injection of activated carbon into the flue gas of an SD/ESP system provides further removal of dioxins/furans (greater than 50-percent reduction over levels achieved by the SD/ESP systems). The greater than 50-percent reduction of the 60 ng/dscm level achieved by an SD/ESP would equate to total dioxin/furan emission levels below 30 ng/dscm (0.5 ng/dscm dioxin/furan TEQ) for SD/ESP systems with activated carbon injection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted, SD/ESP or SD/FF systems with activated carbon injection would already be needed to achieve MACT for acid gas, PM, and Hg. Because both of these control systems in combination with activated carbon injection can achieve a dioxin/furan emission level of 30 ng/dscm or less, and because of the high cost for retrofitting an SD/FF, the proposed guideline for dioxin/furan at large MWC's is based on GCP and SD/ESP systems plus activated carbon injection. The EPA is proposing MACT for dioxins/furans on both a TEQ and a total mass basis. The 30 ng/dscm of total dioxins/furans is equivalent to 0.50 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ; therefore, the proposed guideline level for large MWC plants is 30 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans or 0.50 ng/dscm of dioxin/furan TEQ. Comments are requested on whether lower dioxin/furan guideline levels, which would require SD/FF's, should be incorporated into the final guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> j.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Nitrogen Oxides for Large MWC Plants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The average level of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from MWC's without postcombustion NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control is about 225 ppmv. The MACT floor, however, is 215 ppmv. Therefore, postcombustion NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  controls will be needed by most existing MWC's at large plants to meet the MACT floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

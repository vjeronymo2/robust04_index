			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F> by Franz-Olivier Giesbert in Brussels; date not given -- live or  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Mr. Delors, you  have just been to Hungary, and we now have to think about an  enlargement with the countries of former East Europe, in  particular Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. They are  all in a great hurry and want to go faster. But we do not.    [Delors] No, because the economic conditions must be  fulfilled. Otherwise, they will be crushed by the might of our  economies.    [Giesbert] But is it not scandalous to leave them at the  door, as we are doing, when they are knocking so loudly?    [Delors] If we accepted them tomorrow, they would face  insurmountable economic problems, and that would mean a  financial cost to us, in other words, to our taxpayers, and I am  not sure that those who are saying today they have to come in  immediately would be able to defend this stand tomorrow to the  public.    [Giesbert] But is there not a danger of pushing them toward  the East, toward adventurism, or toward Russia, or the Ukraine?    [Delors] No, because we have contracts of association with  them, which enable us to work together and to ask them their  opinions in the political, cultural, and economic fields. But  the most important thing, you know, the thing that has to be  understood is the historic duty of our generation, the one in  charge at the moment, is to spread the values of peace, mutual  understanding, and cooperation -- which, after all, have led to  the success of this Europe -- to Europe as a whole, and hence to  those countries.    [Giesbert] With all these countries joining and planning to  join the European Union, we are moving toward a greater Europe,  a mega-Europe, a Europe with 20 members; 12 was complicated  enough, but 20? Will it not give you an amazing amount of work?    [Delors] It was complicated, but in spite of everything,  there were happy moments. When you see, for example, that the  events connected with German unification or with Yugoslavia did  not lead to the resurgence of old antagonisms between Germany  and its former opponents, that is grounds for satisfaction and  shows that the fathers of Europe were right.    But now, there is a contradiction that has to be overcome.  You are right. How can we simultaneously build a political  Europe, in other words, made up of countries that want to share  part of their destiny because they think they will build it  better if they are together, given the amazing changes happening  in the world, and the new risks, with a Europe made up of 22 or  24 countries? [sentence as heard] [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] When do you envisage a Europe with the countries  of East Europe?    [Delors] Oh, around the turn of the century.    [Giesbert] So it is a long way off?    [Delors] Yes.    [Giesbert] In the latest edition of the British magazine THE  ECONOMIST, there is an interesting article that says that if  Europe wants to exist, it should make examples of the  troublemakers of Europe -- of whom there are quite a few. It  suggests several candidates for expulsion: Greece, Greece,  Greece, and then there is also Greece. Is this a good idea?    [Delors] No. You know, you have to distinguish between  family spirit and disputes.    [Giesbert] But Greece is the bad pupil at the moment?    [Delors] No. Europe is based on a family spirit. In other  words, we have decided to live together -- not in all areas:  there are a lot of things that fortunately still remain in the  purview of the nation-states. This demands a certain frame of  mind. At the beginning of the Greek presidency, this frame of  mind had been forgotten by the other countries. Now it is  Greece that is forgetting it, and has to get back to it. In a  family, you can have quarrels, but there are some things you  must not do.    So Greece must pay heed, and for example, the embargo  measures it has taken against the little republic of Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM] are not  acceptable.    [Giesbert] The European Commission's white paper on  employment and growth will go on sale today, published by Michel  (?Lafon-Ramsay). It is called: Into the 21st Century. When you  see the figures, is there not a European sickness of  unemployment?    [Delors] Yes, there is a European sickness of unemployment,  and that is why, back in June, I took it upon myself to  demonstrate to the heads of state and government at their  meeting in Copenhagen -- and for some of them it was a real  shock -- that Europe was losing its competitiveness, and if it  continued in the same way it would be unable to ensure equality  for all the young people in finding jobs.    [Giesbert] With 16 million unemployed in Europe, is that not  the result of inflexibility and obstacles everywhere?    [Delors] There are several reasons I can sum up like this:  insufficient economic growth, insufficient competitiveness with  regard to the outside world -- and we have new competitors  coming in from Asia and the Pacific, and for that reason we have  to think in the medium term -- and insufficient expertise in  technical progress. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] You are proposing more flexibility. That is what  is interesting. Are you not, in fact, making very liberal  proposals for a socialist?    [Delors] You know, for me, socialism means equality of  opportunity and the opportunity for everyone to fulfill oneself  by means of work in society. [passage omitted]    I will tell you about two lessons in the white paper that  can  be drawn from the experiences of all the European countries.  First, work is too highly taxed, in particular in France, where  80 percent of the financing of social security comes from wages.  These contributions have to be brought down. It is ridiculous  that the commodity that is in the shortest supply, the  environment, is not taxed, while we need a healthy environment,  for our health among other things, and that the resource that is  in the greatest supply, labor, is what is most highly taxed.  [passage omitted] Second, society tomorrow will be a society  of skills, and therefore, of people who have both knowledge and  skill, and knowledge and skill both demand a good education and  high pay.    [Giesbert] Mr. Delors, you will leave the presidency of the  Commission at the end of the year. Your successor will be  appointed in June. It is said that Leon Brittan is a good  candidate. Would that be a good thing?    [Delors] It is not for me to comment on that. It is up to  the 12 heads of government to appoint my successor. I have been  preparing the way for him as well as I can, leaving him with  margins for maneuver so that he, in turn, can put his mark on  the construction of Europe. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Letter: No political bias in social justice debate Sir, The Commission on Social Justice is grateful for all the advice it receives, including the admonition to 'think radically' in your editorial ('Social justice', January 18). But I must stress that the commission - although established at the initiative of the Labour party's leader, John Smith - is an independent body working under the auspices of the independent Institute for Public Policy Research. Our final report will not only advise the Labour party but everyone who cares to read it. The commission's members, who include people belonging to different political parties and to none, are determined to make the commission as open as possible to everyone who shares our concern with creating wider opportunities for all in our society. We hope that, with your assistance, our work will stimulate a wide and well-informed public debate which will reach well beyond the membership of any political party. Gordon Borrie, chairman, Commission on Social Justice, 30-32 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA</p>

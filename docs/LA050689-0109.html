			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pension Funds May Gang Up on Exxon: California's state employee pension fund,  the nation's biggest, said it might back an attempt by other major Exxon Corp.  shareholders to pressure the company to better prepare for future environmental  disasters in the wake of its Alaskan oil spill. A spokesman for the California  Public Employee Retirement System, which owns 8 million shares, amounting to  about 0.6% of Exxon's outstanding common stock, said it may back New York  City's pension plans' proposal to vote their 6 million shares of Exxon against  company management at the May 18 annual meeting of shareholders.  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / NHL to raise funds from mortgages NATIONAL Home Loans, the troubled mortgage lender, has repackaged most of its non-performing mortgages into an offering of mortgage-backed securities, in order to raise funds to repay some of its bank and bond debt. The process, known as securitisation, allows the company to remove Pounds 175m of non-performing mortgages from its books, leaving a mortgage book totalling only Pounds 325m. It is the first publicly offered issue of sterling mortgage-backed securities consisting of mortgages which are in arrears. It is the latest step in NHL's efforts to repay its debt and reduce heavy financing costs. The company's funding costs soared after the rescheduling of its debt, when it came close to collapse last June. 'We need to restore our financial position by de-gearing,' said Mr Nigel Terrington, NHL's treasurer. 'With this latest deal, we will have paid down 40 per cent of our total debt in nine months.' In spite of the poor credit quality of the mortgages, the issue has been rated triple-A by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. The rating agencies awarded their top ratings because of the high level of collateralisation: the Pounds 105m issue is backed by a Pounds 175m pool of mortgages. Also, interest payments on the securities can be delayed, to allow for the uncertain cash-flow on non-performing mortgages. 'The general assumption is that (the mortgages) go bad,' said Mr Paul Taylor, a director at Standard &amp; Poor's. 'We focused on how much cash (could be recovered) from the property when it is sold.' As properties are repossessed and sold off, the proceeds are used to pay interest and principal to bondholders. much Investors are prepared to buy the paper, in spite of the weak quality of the underlying assets and the interest deferral feature, because the bonds offer a considerably higher return than for other mortgage-backed securities. The deal, which pays interest of about one point above the London interbank offered rate, halves NHL's current funding costs on current bank and bond debt. Other centralised mortgage lenders, including the Household Mortgage Corporation, have securitised non-performing mortgages, but previous deals were not privately placed. Details, Page 30</p>

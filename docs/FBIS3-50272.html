Minister Zlenko  conveyed to President Tudjman greetings from Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk as well as Kravchuk's message that Ukraine  attaches special importance to good neighborly relations between  Ukraine and Croatia.    President Tudjman stressed Ukraine's considerable  contribution to efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement of the  crisis in the UN Protected Areas, particularly with help from  the Ukrainian battalion serving with the UNPROFOR.    Successful cooperation with the UN and the CSCE, as well as  Ukraine's support -- on the diplomatic field -- for efforts  aimed at a peaceful settlement of the situation in former  Yugoslavia, were said to be of particular importance for both  countries. Both sides reached the conclusion that all the  prerequisites exist for a successful development of political,  economic, cultural, sporting, and other relations.</p>

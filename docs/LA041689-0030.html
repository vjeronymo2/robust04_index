			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: PASADENA SHOWCASE CLOAKED IN SECRECY  </P> <P> Secrecy and suspense so surround the Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee's  25th Anniversary Premiere Night Party of the Pasadena Showcase House of Design  that only party chairman Shirley Goldsmith, president Christina Varner and  Brenda Owen, the anniversary benefit chairman, know the intricacies of the gala  on Saturday.  </P> <P> We can tell you it's on a monumental scale with dancing planned until the wee  hours. This year, says Linda Seiter, the committee goes to a reservation system  for the Showcase public days next Sunday through May 21. That's because they  couldn't control the flow of sometimes 53,000 people a year who come to the  event in La Canada Flintridge. The phone number for reservations and tickets is  (818) 792-4661, though reservations also are available through members,  Ticketmaster outlets and the Music Center, P.O Box 1951, L.A. 90078.  </P> <P> CELEBRATION WEEKEND: Marlborough School's festivities for its many-faceted  Centennial Celebration Weekend on April 28-30 are moving right along, said  Centennial chairman Terry Von Hagen Bucher and co-chair Louise Trotti. Aileen  Adams and Mary Adams Reinisch co-chair the weekend.  </P> <P> That includes the Alumnae Luncheon, co-chaired by Nancy McCullough; a  Marlborough "Then and Now" musical revue with a cast of students, alumnae,  parents and friends; a day of seminars headed by Daryn Horton and Chris  Westwater, and alumnae brunches co-chaired by Suzanne Crowell and Bonnie  McClure.  </P> <P> A highlight will be the Gala Celebration planned by Pamela Mullin and Barbara  Myerson. It's April 29, black-tie, at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum.  More involved are Carole Terry, Corki Clark, Joan Graves, Patti Doheny and  Kacey McCoy (co-chairing a "Generations Tea"), Jane Warner, Laurie Stoneman,  Susan Brant, Paulette Katzenbach, Cece Baise, Kay Gates, Michele Crahan, Carol  King, Maggie Russell, Mary Morgan and Leah Coulter.  </P> <P> EVER ONWARD: In 1983, opera diva Dorothy Kirsten French created the French  Foundation for Alzheimer Research to seek advances in scientific and medical  research and provide model methods for caring for America's 3 million  Alzheimer's patients. The result, in five years: $2 million.  </P> <P> Dorothy's husband, Dr. John Douglas French, the brain surgeon who founded the  UCLA Brain Research Institute, died recently of Alzheimer's. His spirit  emboldens efforts on the foundation's fifth anniversary gala May 7 at the  Beverly Hilton. Pia Zadora, Dudley Moore, Norm Crosby and composer Bill Conti  will entertain. Alex Trebek, "Jeopardy!" host, will emcee. First Lady Barbara  Bush, a member of the foundation's honorary board, has accepted to be honorary  chairman.  </P> <P> This year, Roy Anderson, former chairman of Lockheed, serves as dinner  chairman; Bonnie Green is Founding Associates chairman.  </P> <P> In 1987, the foundation joined with Richard K.

The evening begins with the guest headdress  competition during the reception in the Grand Ballroom.

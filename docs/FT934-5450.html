			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Barclays lends more EIB money - In a Nutshell Barclays Bank is revamping a scheme to lend European Investment Bank funds to small and medium-sized businesses making capital investments. This Friday the EIB will provide Barclays with the first Pounds 50m line of low-cost credit - larger sums are expected later. The bank will lend between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 10m for a minimum of four years. Companies should have fewer than 500 employees and net fixed assets of less than Pounds 60m. The EIB will lend half of the total investment cost but borrowers do not need to borrow from Barclays for the balance. Barclays has already lent Pounds 130m of EIB money over the last four years.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (19): Cost-saving, a big reason for contracting out - Payroll bureaux date back to the 1960s yet they are still used by companies which have brought every other system in-house. John Kavanagh finds out why / Payroll processing; Bureau Users' Views PAYROLL processing has traditionally been a mainstay of the computer bureau business and even companies which are automating their personnel departments are still happily contracting out the payroll. Even organisations which have had bad experiences with payroll bureaux have simply switched to another supplier, rather than take on the task themselves. Yet these days there are endless payroll software packages available for personal computers, minicomputers and mainframes of all kinds. In many cases these packages can be integrated with personnel products which companies are installing, enabling them to run these functions from a single database. But still they prefer to have one of their most sensitive tasks handled by an outside agency. Cost is a key reason mentioned by bureau users. 'We looked at bringing the payroll in-house when we changed bureaux, but it would have been more expensive because we would have needed more people,' says Mr Greg Judge, finance director at Manchester Polytechnic, the UK's biggest polytechnic, with 3,000 staff. The polytechnic switched to an on-line service provided by the CMG bureau in April after growing frustration with another supplier. The previous bureau had made basic mistakes such as running a payroll using an earlier month's data. Mr Ken Dodd, computing manager at Northumbria Ambulance Service, agrees. His organisation uses the Compower bureau. 'We have one person managing the payroll and keying in all the data and we would certainly need more if we ran the payroll in-house,' says Mr Dodd. 'In addition our contract with Compower was 30 per cent cheaper than the cheapest software package we looked at. It was also 20 per cent cheaper than the nearest bureau competitor.' A worthwhile investment Greg Judge at Manchester Polytechnic points out that bureaux can keep costs down because they use the same staff to run many companies' payrolls. 'This also means they have specialist expertise,' he says. 'Unless you have a sizeable payroll section, it's difficult to attract suitably experienced and qualified staff. 'Good payroll managers are hard to come by: people who are fully aware of new legislation, penalties which the Inland Revenue and statutory pensions authorities can impose and so on. It's worthwhile paying to have this taken care of: a bureau takes on the risks and the problems of day-to-day operation. I've worked for organisations which have taken the payroll in-house and have got problems.' Passing sensitive work and data to an outside contractor brings other benefits, according to Mr Judge - 'the payroll can be disrupted during industrial disputes,' he says. 'The management can in effect be held to ransom by the payroll staff. 'In addition we have an executive payroll for heads of department and above: people who are on individual contracts and benefits packages. Politically, it can be better to have such information handled elsewhere rather than internally: using a bureau means only two or three people in the poly have access to this information.' None of the bureau users contacted by Software At Work feel that their payroll processing is out of their control. In some cases the work is processed at computer centres many miles away: indeed, some of the users are vague about where their suppliers' computers are - but feel that with modern telecommunications this is of no concern. The user companies contacted are quite large organisations which might need to make changes at short notice. They have therefore all chosen or switched to services which accept data keyed in on PCs at the customer-end and transmitted over telecommunications links to the bureau just before the payroll is run. Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest retail travel agent, for example, switched to CMG last November after using a service which involved completing documents by hand, sending them to the bureau for entering to the system, receiving printouts of the information for checking, sending these back, checking the corrections and so on. 'We had a deadline from the bureau which was two weeks before the payroll run,' says Lunn Poly's chief accountant, Mr Simon Barge. 'This meant we were always doing things outside the payroll to cope with late adjustments and people joining the company.' Mr Barge and others say that although they cannot start the payroll processing run themselves they are in control. 'We tell CMG when we are ready to transmit data and we can generate report printing runs from here, although the reports are printed at CMG,' says Mr Barge. Greg Judge at Manchester Polytechnic comments: 'CMG has a very flexible package and you can specify virtually any reports you want. There are almost unlimited permutations of the ways you can record and report on employee-costs.' Although a bureau holds its customers' employee master files, the data can also be held at the customer end. Lunn Poly, for example, has taken a CMG facility which transmits part or all of a payroll master file back to the customer and includes a local report generator. Lunn Poly can thus make enquiries to its own local version of the master file, running on its network of Compaq personal computers. Indeed, as Mr Barge points out, because changes to employee data can be entered to the local database as they happen, this file is always more up to date than the file held by CMG, which tends to be updated with all the changes only just before a payroll run. Even so, a bureau payroll system is still separate from an in-house personnel system, not just because it is being run at a different site by a different organisation but mainly because it is normally based on different software and a separate database. Users contacted by Software At Work generally recognise that the level of integration of the separate human resources systems is not as great as it could be if everything was run in-house, but they do not see this is a big inconvenience. For some users this is partly because updates to payroll information, such as the addition of new staff and changes in salary, are entered to the in-house personnel package, which passes the data to the payroll bureau when the customer gets its monthly processing slot. These links, however, tend to be in one direction only: this means, for example, that pure payroll data, such as overtime earnings, which generally do not go through the personnel system but are keyed directly to the payroll system, might not be readily available. Northumbria Ambulance Service, a Percom personnel system user, has separate payroll and personnel units - 'the definition of integration depends on how far we want to go,' says Ken Dodd. 'Personnel can ask payroll for information. It's easy to get a person's salary - but if you want to know how much a certain person earned on a certain day, there might be more of a problem.' Simon Barge at Lunn Poly, which has a personnel system developed in-house on a Hewlett-Packard minicomputer, regards the reduced integration as a benefit  -'full integration would save re-keying of information, but this in itself is a control,' he says. If data is being entered from payroll and from personnel, comparisons between the two serve as a clear-cut control.' These and other users contacted are happy with their current bureau services and it seems that as long as the services remain reliable, even big computer users will prefer to contract out the payroll to specialist companies rather than take all the risks themselves. For as Greg Judge at Manchester Polytechnic puts it: 'For any employer, there's nothing so sensitive as payroll.'</p>

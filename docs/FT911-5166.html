			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Question mark over US insurers ALMOST 500 US insurance companies have had a question mark placed against their claims-paying ability in a new survey published yesterday by Standard &amp; Poor's, the large US ratings agency. Although many of the 489 companies - drawn from both the life and property/casualty sectors - are small, they wrote an aggregate Dollars 18.3bn-worth (Pounds 10.3bn) of premiums in 1989. The report comes close on the heels of last week's action against the main operating unit of First Executive, the large Los Angeles-based insurer which was taken over by the Californian state regulators. The action by regulators was the largest-ever seizure of an insurance company. S&amp;P stressed that not all of the companies were necessarily in danger, but suggested their financial condition was 'below average' and they 'deserve close attention'. The agency's findings come at a sensitive time for the US insurance industry. The issue of solvency regulation - and whether the state regulatory system is adequate or whether a Federal agency should be set up - has been under scrutiny for many months. Full story, Page 26</p>

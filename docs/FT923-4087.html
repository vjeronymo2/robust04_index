			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / India urged to stick to reform THE Reserve Bank of India says India must stay on the path of economic reform despite persistent inflation, slow growth and the recent Bombay stock market scandal. The far-reaching liberalisation programme, which started a year ago in response to a balance-of-payments crisis, should be completed as quickly as possible, says the central bank in its annual report published this week. The bank gives credit to the measures taken by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, saying that recent macro-economic reforms have been managed satisfactorily. But, echoing a concern frequently voiced in recent months, the reserve bank urges the government not to allow the reform programme to run out of steam. It says: 'There is still a hiatus between policy formulation and implementation at ground level.' The reserve bank is particularly worried that the Bombay scandal, which involves alleged attempts by banks and brokers to circumvent investment rules, should not upset further financial deregulation. 'It is important that the recent episode, though an unfortunate one, does not put back the clock of reforms.' The bank admits that the economic recovery in the 1992-93 financial year will be weaker than expected. It says that after falling in the year to June to 2.5 per cent, the real economic growth rate should rise to around 3.5 per cent. This is well short of the 5.6 per cent figure achieved in 1990-91. The rapid growth of the 1980s is now only a memory. Growth has been held back by a fall in exports, including sales to former communist countries, and a government-imposed squeeze on imports, put in place last year to conserve foreign exchange. To create conditions for sustainable growth, inflation has to be cut from last year's 13.6 per cent to 8-9 per cent this financial year. Also, the government deficit has to be reduced, says the bank, calling for wholesale reform including a law which would establish a ceiling for public sector borrowing. It puts the country's total external debt at Dollars 70bn at the end of March.</p>

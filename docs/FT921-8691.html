			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / BNFL to shed 750 workers BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels is to cut 750 jobs at its head office and design centre at Risley, near Warrington, Cheshire, the company said yesterday. The cuts, which affect engineering and design staff, have been caused by the rundown of construction at BNFL's Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant in Cumbria. BNFL said the job losses, which would reduce its engineering division from 1,750 to 1,000 by the mid 1990s, were necessary for it to become more competitive.</p>

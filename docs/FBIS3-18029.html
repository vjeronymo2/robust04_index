			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JDT: "Dutch CDA Wins Support -- VVD Drops </F> Back"; as released by The Hague ANP Database]    [Text] The Hague, 22 Feb (ANP) -- With 40 seats, the Dutch  Christian Democratic CDA has regained electoral support  somewhat, following the sharp fall of recent weeks. In the race  for second place, the PvdA [Labor Party], VVD [People's Party  for Freedom and Democracy], and D66 [Democrats 66] are currently  running neck and neck, recent opinion polls indicate.    The excitement among members of the principal opposition  party, the VVD, over last week's 34 seats seems to have been  rather premature. The Social Democratic PvdA has made something  of a comeback with 30 seats. The advance of the liberal left  D66 has apparently reached a strength of 30 seats.    These are the results of the latest polls published on  Tuesday [22 February] and conducted by the interview bureau for  the ANP press agency and the Dutch television current affairs  program, NOVA.    Two weeks ago the CDA received a sharp setback following  doubts about the future of the AOW, the Dutch pensions law. The  party dropped in the polls to 37 seats, a dramatic loss of 17  seats compared with their present strength of 54. The 24  percent for the Christian Democrats was the lowest figure since  the Lubbers/Kok government took office in November 1989.    Brinkman's party, who is heading the list of candidates,  climbed back up to 26.2 percent in the survey which closed last  Monday. That probably represents a gain of three seats compared  to two weeks ago, but nevertheless a significant loss of 14  seats.    PvdA, the coalition partner, scored 19.5 percent in the  poll,  which means that Kok's party is maintaining the momentum of  growing support recorded over recent weeks. But with around 30  seats, the loss of 19 compared with the present 49 is  nevertheless quite dramatic.    The VVD, the big winner over recent weeks, has lost ground  in  this latest poll conducted by ANP/NOVA. Interview has dampened  their enthusiasm somewhat, recording a score of 19.2 percent or  29 seats, which means that the VVD falls back to fourth position.    D66 stands at 30 seats in the poll, a big gain of 18. But  following the unprecedented advance of summer 1991 when it won  36 seats, decline seems to have well and truly set in. Two  weeks ago Van Mierlo's party still stood at 32 seats. The  Greens have also made gains, up by 6.4 percent from 6 to 9 seats.</p>

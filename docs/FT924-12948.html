			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Books: Shylock: a figure in his own right - Anthony Curtis on Shakespeare's favourite outcast SHYLOCK by John Gross Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18, 335 pages AUDEN conceived of a select part of heaven where he would at last meet Shakespeare 'lounging grandly by the bar' (rather like Sir Kingsley Amis at the Garrick). Shakespeare as a fellow-member - the image seems wonderfully apt. You cannot work as Shakespeare did for many years as a leading writer and performer, part of a permanent company, without gaining a degree of acceptance and respect from colleagues, something their obituary tributes to him testified. And afterwards, when Shakespeare had taken retirement from the theatre and returned to Stratford, he aimed to regain the social position of membership of the town's hierarchy once occupied - but sadly forfeited - by his father, a failed alderman and leather merchant. When one turns from these sketchy biographical facts to the work, Shakespeare's mind appears to be ignited to some of its greatest explosions of dramatic energy by figures who undergo permanent, traumatic rejection by the ruling group. Shakespeare endows these outcast figures with a towering strength and puts memorable utterances of defiance into their mouths: 'I banish you]' yells Coriolanus at his former countrymen. 'I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you]' says Malvolio; while Timon, the devalued entrepreneur, retires to a cave in the woods in complete isolation, uttering curses at his former hangers-on, and living off roots plucked from the earth. The sequence of rejection, defiance, trial and ultimate humbling (in his case a forced conversion to Christianity) reaches its most sustained heights in Shakespeare's depiction of Shylock the Jew. Once conceived the figure of Shylock took lasting hold and became a part of collective myth in a way that, for example, his stage predecessor Barabas - Marlowe's Jew of Malta, an even more villainous character - never did. The implications of Shylock and his career are so rich, resonating still, that the literary and dramatic critic John Gross has thought it worth his while to devote a whole book to this one figure. Gross studies Shylock as part of Shakespeare's text and then as existing in his own right as a hate-icon. With the rise of liberalism he shows Shylock being interpreted more sympathetically - understanding alternating with hatred. Gross resuscitates the main line of Shylockian performance from the 18th century to the present. He demonstrates how to begin with Shylock was established as a grotesque caricature and then transformed by a succession of great actors into an individual of exalted stature and brought to life with vibrant realism. This part of the story begins in 1741 when the Irish-born actor Charles Macklin attempted the role at Drury Lane. He was in his late forties at the time and he went on to play the part into his eighties. Although the character he presented was in Gross's words 'unyieldingly malignant' he had researched it historically. He discovered, for instance, that the Jews in 16th century Venice wore red hats and donned one. Macklin's performance came as a revelation of the play's power in the theatre. After Macklin there were - apart from Garrick - few leading British actors who did not attempt the part. Kean's version was a particular triumph. It was described by Hazlitt who felt that great as it was, it tended by its very livelines, to diminish the obsessive vengeful nature of Shylock's character. But Hazlitt concluded that for sheer variety of response, for 'presenting a series of striking pictures and giving perpetually fresh shocks of delight and surprise, it would be difficult to single out a competitor'. John Philip Kemble who played Shylock opposite Sarah Siddons as Portia - she was his sister - was considered too remote and neo-classical. The next great landmark was Henry Irving with whom the role underwent a complete re-interpretation. He gave Shylock an aloof dignity based on his observation of a Jewish merchant he had encountered while on holiday in North Africa. 'I look upon Shylock as the type of a persecuted race', he wrote in 1884, 'almost the only gentleman in the play, and the most ill-used'. It was a controversial reading then in a role that has continued to arouse controversy ever since. Gross traces the lines of interpretation all over the world - American Shylocks like Edwin Booth, German Shylocks both pre-Nazi ones and Nazi-inspired ones like the horrible one of Werner Krauss in 1943, and the less numerous French ones like that of Harry Baur, the French Jewish actor who afterwards perished in Auschwitz. There have been translations of the play into both Yiddish and Hebrew and Gross deals with these going on to discuss Shylock in the context of the rise of anti-semitism as a political doctrine. He scours many works of fiction, of political and social theory, of clinical psychology, as he tracks down the emergence of a whole family of Shylocks and Shylock-types in novelists from Scott and Trollope to Svevo and Lewishon. Thinkers like Freud and Marx are given their say along with the more obscure pundits who have contributed to the debate. Gross is always immensely well-informed, perceptive without being ponderous, and he never allows indignation to cloud his judgment. His own view is stated clearly on the last page: 'I personally think that it is absurd to suppose that there is a direct line of descent from Antonio to Hitler, or from Portia to the SS, but that is because I do not believe that the Holocaust was in any way inevitable. I do believe, on the other hand that the ground for the Holocaust was well prepared, and to that extent the play can never seem quite the same again'. It certainly emerges in a fresh light after one has read this learned yet enjoyable book.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / London results grim for Major The by-election results in the four Labour-held seats were less spectacular than the crushing Conservative defeat in Eastleigh. But they still represent very bad news for Mr John Major. On the basis of the 1992 general election results, the Conservatives started second in all four seats - Bradford South in West Yorkshire, and the three east London seats of Barking, Dagenham and Newham North East. By the end of counting early this morning, they had finished a humiliating third in Bradford South and Barking, and a poor second in Dagenham and Newham, where they were helped by the last-minute defection to Labour of Liberal Democrat Mr Alec Kellaway. Labour's vote rose strongly in all four seats - by 20 per cent in Dagenham, 17 per cent in Newham, 22 per cent in Barking and 8 per cent in Bradford. The Conservatives were down 26 per cent, 7 per cent, 21 per cent and 21 per cent respectively. Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, admitted that the results were 'very disappointing', but claimed that the impact of the defeat would be muted by an 'amazingly low' turnout in all four constituencies. 'By any analysis, a lot of people are simply staying away and not voting,' he said on BBC television. 'That gives us the opportunity to recover and regain our support.' Nevertheless, the polling is deeply depressing for the Conservatives, who had pinned their hopes of remaining a credible force in Labour seats on coming second in all four seats. Labour hailed the results as a signal that the government's popularity had fallen too far for the Tories to have much hope of recovering ground in London before the next general election. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow minister for London, said the east London results were 'stunningly good' and 'very disturbing for the government'. Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour campaign organiser for London, said the results reinforced Labour's standing as the biggest party in the capital. The results were mixed for the Liberal Democrats, who finished second in Bradford South with 24 per cent of the vote, up 10 per cent on the general election; and in Barking, with 12 per cent, down from 14.5 per cent. The poor result in Newham - where the party polled just 821 votes - was expected because of the embarrassment and confusion caused by the defection of Mr Kellaway. But Liberal Democrat strategists will be disappointed not to have done better in Dagenham, where their share of the vote fell by 3 percentage points to 8.4 per cent. The feared revival of the extreme right in London did not materialise. The British National Party came fourth in Dagenham, but won only 1,511 votes in spite of pouring in resources for the campaign. The National Front won only 551 votes in Barking. Ms Judith Church, the victor in Dagenham, said the extreme right had been 'firmly' rejected. 'This is a wonderful defeat for them and a wonderful victory for us,' she said.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BARKING  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Margaret Hodge (Lab)                       13,704 Theresa May (C)                             1,976 Garry White (LD)                            2,290 Turnout: 38.58%                   Lab maj: 11,414  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Others: Gerard Batten (UK Independence) 406; Heather Butensky (Natural Law Party) 90; Garry Needs (National Front) 551 1992 result: Jo Richardson (Lab) 18,224; John Kennedy (C) 11,956; Steve Churchman (LD) 5,133.

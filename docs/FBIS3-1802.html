The source said Deng issued the call after he received a  briefing on North Korea from Ding Guangen, a Politburo member of  the Chinese Communist Party.    Ding has met Hwang Chang-yop, a North Korean parliamentary  committee chairman, who made a trip to China leading a  five-member delegation in January.    During his stay in China from January 15 to 23, Hwang  discussed with Chinese leaders Pyongyang's economic policy and  Kim's planned visit to China, the source said.    In a meeting with Ding, Hwang, who is chairman of the  Foreign  Affairs Committee of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly and  in charge of relations with China and the United States,  conveyed North Korea's intention to adopt a Chinese-style open  economic policy.    North Korea announced in 1991 a plan to set up free economic  zones in Nachin and Sonpong, in the northeastern part of the  country, as part of a Tumen river development program.    North Korea made a rare and candid admission early in  December that the country is in serious economic difficulties  and carried out a leadership reshuffle in an apparent move to  revitalize its economy.    "The targets of the total scope of industrial output and  some  major indices including electric power, steel and chemical fiber  envisaged in the third seven-year plan failed to be attained due  to international events and the acute situation created in  (North) Korea," Pyongyang's official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY  (KCNA) reported.    Seoul's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY reported in mid-January in a  dispatch from Beijing that Kim plans to visit China for in-depth  talks with Chinese leaders over the situation on the Korean  peninsula and possible favorable moves in connection with North  Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program.    YONHAP quoted Western sources as saying Kim's visit to  China,  expected soon, is being discussed through diplomatic channels  and China has reacted positively to the move.    Hwang surfaced as a core member of the North Korean power  hierarchy during the December session of the Supreme People's  Assembly, along with Kim Il-song's brother Kim Yong-chu.</p>

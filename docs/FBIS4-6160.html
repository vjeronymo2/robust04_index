			<p>CSO     [Text] IDC To Double Systems Engineering Staff in  Information Systems Division by Fiscal Yearend by Hiring Mostly  Experienced Applicants    International Digital Communications (IDC) a new telegraph  and telephone company engaged in international communications,  headquartered in Daito ward, Tokyo and headed by Kento Orihata,  will double its systems engineering staff in its Information  Systems Division during fiscal year 1994. Additionally, this  development will evolve into the active assignment of the  division to projects designed to develop new types of services.  The company will beef up its services development capabilities  as a way to better compete with rival Kokusai Denshin Denwa  (KDD).    As of 1 March, IDC had a total of 530 employees, of which 38  were assigned to the Information Systems Division. That number  will be increased to about 70 in fiscal year 1994. Recruiting  will focus primarily on experienced applicants, but will also  include some newly graduated applicants.    IDC formerly assigned most of its new services development  projects to two activities known as "Services Development  Promotion Section" and "Business Promotion Division." The  "Information System Division" specialized in projects in the  administrative area such as the design and operation of billing  systems and late-payment follow-up systems. However, now that  communications services have become sophisticated and  complicated and billing formats will change drastically, IDC  seeks to enhance developmental efficiency by involving the  Information Services Division from the early stages of services  development work.</p>

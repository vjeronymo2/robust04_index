			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Suchocka to salvage privatisation POLAND'S coalition government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka is to press ahead with its mass privatisation plans despite the defeat by 12 votes in parliament on Thursday of legislation underpinning the proposals, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The government's counter-offensive includes the resubmission of the legislation in 'the near future' as well as the speedy implementation of parts of the scheme which can be brought in under existing laws. 'We want to move ahead fast with what will be in effect a policy of fait accompli,' said a source close to Ms Suchocka. The plan to try to salvage mass privatisation is to be finalised by the cabinet today and announced on Monday.</p>

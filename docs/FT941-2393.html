			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Shell Australia plans metals float Shell Australia, part of the Anglo-Dutch oil group, plans to float its metals division on the stock market. Its 37.5 per cent interest held in the Worsley bauxite/alumina project in Western Australia will, however, be excluded from the sale. The company declined to say when the float might take place, but claimed preparations were 'at an advanced stage'. The main assets to be floated include a 30 per cent interest in the Boddington gold mine and a 42 per cent interest in the Cadjebut zinc/lead project, both in Western Australia. The metals division (including Worsley) made a pre-tax profit of ADollars 30m (USDollars 21.4m) last year, on sales of ADollars 225m. Gold production was 113,000 ounces; zinc production (concentrate), 43,000 tonnes; lead production (concentrate), 12,000 tonnes. The announcement comes as Gencor, the South African resources house, and Royal Dutch/Shell, Shell Australia's parent, continue discussions over Gencor's purchase of a major part of Royal Dutch/Shell's metals interests. These talks were announced last May, and if the deal goes ahead, it is reckoned to be worth USDollars 1.5bn - Dollars 2bn. But as far as Shell Australia is concerned, Gencor's primary interest is thought to centre on the Worsley joint venture, which produces around 13 per cent of Australia's alumina. This is understood to be the main reason for excluding the holding from the flotation plan.</p>

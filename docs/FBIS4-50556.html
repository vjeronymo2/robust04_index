			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC), today urged for mutual  understanding and cooperation when addressing international  issues.    In a speech at the Royal Institute of International  Relations  in Brussels, the visiting Chinese official said, "Differences in  the social system and ideology between countries should not  stand in the way of their friendly relations and cooperation."    "Mankind should discard the outworn concepts left over from  history and work together to address problems which are  increasing and which can not be settled without mutual  understanding and cooperation," he added.    Li arrived here on Tuesday [17 May] for a five-day visit to  Belgium, which is the last leg of his five-European-nation tour.    He indicated that one must pay attention to the objective  reality in observing international situation.    There are over 180 independent sovereign states, he said,  "these states differ from each other in the social system, level  of development, historical and cultural tradition, ethnic group  and religious belief."    Each country has its own distinctive features, he declared,  adding, "it is these distinctive features that contribute to the  diversity of our world making it a colorful one."    "Given the distinctive features, countries that have strong  and weak points in different areas may learn from each other and  progress and develop further," Li pointed out.    "And those with different social systems and ideologies  should try to seek common ground while putting aside  differences, reduce pointless disputes and conflicts and live in  peace with each other."    In fact, he continued, there are also a lot in common among  different nations. "They have the same goals and something in  common."    He stressed, "It is this generality that lays the foundation  for international cooperation and exchanges. It is the  distinctive features of different countries that the generality  resides. [sentence as received] And it is their enrichment and  improvement that the generality takes shape and develops."    "We must establish norms of conduct for all to observe  through consultations on an equal footing and on the basis of  full respect for the distinctive features of each country," he  urged.    Meanwhile, the Chinese official also briefed about the  viewpoints of his country on human rights.</p>

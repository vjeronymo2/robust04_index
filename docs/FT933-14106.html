			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Hilton hit by lack of 'high rollers' A SHORTAGE of 'high rollers' - gamblers willing to bet the largest stakes - at the Las Vegas Hilton contributed to a second-quarter decline in net income for Hilton, the hotels and gaming group, to Dollars 26.8m, or Dollars 0.56 a share, from Dollars 32.4m, or Dollars 0.68 a share, in the same period in 1992. A strong rise in operating income from gaming had helped Hilton to shrug off flat operating revenues from its hotels division in 1992 and the first quarter of 1993. In the three months to June 30, however, operating income from gaming fell slightly, to Dollars 37.4m from Dollars 37.5m. The company blamed the result on a lack of gamblers placing large stakes at the tables in the Las Vegas Hilton, although it said the Flamingo Hilton in Las Vegas and its two hotel-casinos in Reno, Nevada, had done well. The hotels division recorded unchanged operating income, at Dollars 29.7m. Continuing weakness in New York and Hawaii, and industry-wide pressure on rates, had accounted for the result, Hilton said. The hotel occupancy rate rose by one point, to 70 per cent, compared with the same quarter in 1992, but average room rates fell in a number of areas. Turnover rose 17 per cent to Dollars 345.2m from Dollars 294.8m. Net income was struck after financing charges up to Dollars 17.7m from Dollars 13.2m due to the Dollars 300m of extra borrowing taken on last year to finance further casino developments. Hilton said it had accelerated its development of casinos in New Orleans and Kansas City, both of which were expected to open in the first quarter of 1994.</p>

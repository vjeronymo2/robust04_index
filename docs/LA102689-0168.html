			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW DIPS 5.94; TRADING FRENZY SETTLES DOWN  </P> <P> Wall Street stocks returned to calmer territory Wednesday, falling modestly in  cautious but steady trading following the market's wild session on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials slipped 5.94 to 2,653.28.  </P> <P> But advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading  of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 784 up, 700 down and 474  unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume was 155.65 million shares, down from 237.96 million on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Dow index plunged about 80 points in early trading Tuesday, then rebounded  to recoup most of its loss, finishing down 3.69 points.  </P> <P> Traders seemed reluctant to make big commitments in advance of the government's  report today on the gross national product for the third quarter of the year.  </P> <P> The figures are expected to show a continued slowing of economic growth,  possibly setting the stage for lower interest rates but also raising questions  about the outlook for corporate profits.  </P> <P> The brokerage firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. estimates that  third-quarter GNP will show an increase at an annual rate of 1.5% to 2%, after  adjustment for inflation, down from 2.5% in the April-June quarter.  </P> <P> Du Pont turned in one of the best performances among the Dow industrials,  climbing 2 1/2 to 117 3/8. The company reported higher third-quarter earnings,  raised its dividend and disclosed plans for a 3-for-1 stock split.  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks eased as investors cashed in some of the profits they made during  last week's advance. The 225-share Nikkei index slipped 84.15 points to close  at 35,442.40. Losers outnumbered winners 2 to 1 on heavy volume of 1 billion  shares.  </P> <P> Share prices closed modestly higher in London largely on technical factors,  although the market was underpinned near the end of the session by Wall  Street's stronger trend. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index  finished at 2,161.9, up 12.6 points.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices ended slightly higher after pulling back from a rally that was  stimulated by a successful auction of savings and loan bailout bonds.  </P> <P> The Treasury's key 30-year issue rose 1/8 point, or about $1.25 per $1,000 in  face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, eased to 7.88% from 7.89%  late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Traders attributed the midday strength in bonds to the bailout bond auction as  well as to congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan  Greenspan and lingering nervousness about the stock market.  </P> <P> The rally faded late in the day after traders concluded that Greenspan's  comments on inflation and interest rates were nothing new and that the bailout  bonds would take some time to be absorbed by the market. Also, stocks finished  mixed, giving traders no reason to shift money into bonds.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8.688%, unchanged from late Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar ended mostly lower against major foreign currencies in thin, narrow  trading following a mixed performance overseas.  </P> <P> Currency dealers said the dollar got an early lift from comments from Fed  Chairman Greenspan but edged lower mainly on technical factors. They said many  dealers were awaiting today's release of third-quarter gross national product  data, which should shed more light on the direction of the economy and interest  rates.  </P> <P> In testimony before Congress, Greenspan hinted that the central bank was  unlikely to ease credit by lowering interest rates any time soon because the  current inflation rate of 4.4% was too high to be ignored.  </P> <P> Firm rates are seen as bullish for the dollar partly because they make  dollar-denominated securities more attractive to foreigners, thereby increasing  the need for those investors to convert their money into the U.S. currency.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  fell to 141.55 Japanese yen from 142.10 yen Tuesday. It traded at 141.60 yen in  London, and at 141.57 yen in New York, up from 141.50 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The dollar was weaker against the British pound. In London, the pound rose to  $1.6090 from $1.6065 late Tuesday. Later, in New York, sterling fetched  $1.6143, up from $1.6075.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Tuesday's quotes, included:  1.8350 West German marks, down from 1.8358; 1.6075 Swiss francs, down from  1.6095; 6.2270 French francs, down from 6.2370; 1.17545 Canadian dollars, up  from 1.17135, and 1,345.00 Italian lire, down from 1345.75.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> A steadier stock market and Japanese buying allowed copper futures prices to  end a three-day decline.  </P> <P> On other futures markets, precious metals were slightly lower, while oil  products, most grains and livestock were generally higher.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the most active copper contract, for  delivery in December, moved from its Tuesday low of $1.134 a pound to as high  as $1.17 in early trading, but slipped back as the day went on.  </P> <P> Copper settled 35 to 45 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in October  at $1.15 a pound.  </P> <P> Also on the Comex, the steadier stock market and stronger dollar sent gold and  silver futures slightly lower.  </P> <P> Gold settled $1 to $1.10 lower, with the contract for delivery in October at  $369.10 an ounce; and silver was 3.4 to 3.5 cents lower, with October at $5.114  an ounce.  </P> <P> Futures prices for corn and soybeans climbed higher, but wheat prices sagged on  the Chicago Board of Trade.  </P> <P> Wheat settled 1.25 to 6.25 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in  December at $4.055 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2.25 cents higher, with  December at $2.4225 a bushel; oats were 0.75 cent to 1.25 cents lower, with  December at $1.46 a bushel, and soybeans were 3 to 6 cents higher, with  November at $5.66 a bushel.  </P> <P> On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock and pork prices were mostly  higher.  </P> <P> Cattle settled 0.02 cent lower to 0.03 cent higher, with the contract for  delivery in December at 75.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.03 cent lower  to 0.30 cent higher, with October at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.10  cent lower to 0.27 cent higher, with December at 47.80 cents a pound, and  frozen pork bellies were 0.20 to 0.55 cent higher, with February at 53.32 cents  a pound.  </P></p>

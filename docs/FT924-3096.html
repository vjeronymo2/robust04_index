			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Short sterling rallies SHORT sterling recovered slightly from its oversold position but activity in the money markets was dominated by technical trading yesterday, writes Peter John. The short sterling futures contract for March delivery opened marginally weaker and was sold down to 93.25. Nevertheless, it had already begun to look cheap on Monday night and it picked up 11 basis points from the open to end at 93.39 by the official close with more than 14,500 contracts dealt. In after hours trading it was sold back down to 93.30. Meanwhile, French cash futures continued to drift down. On the Matif, three-month Pibor for March delivery opened 5 lower at 91.25 and fell a further 14 to 91.11 on heavy turnover of 18,000 contracts. Bank of England operations were highlighted by a large forecast liquidity shortage which failed to be completely taken out. Dealers said many banks were unwilling to take up the latest repo offer which matures on January 5 because it carried over the year end and would upset balance sheets. There were some concerns that, if the trend continues, a cumulative shortage might develop in the very tight pre-Christmas market. The Bank of England offered the money market an early round of assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.2bn. Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of treasury bills and paper maturing in official hands, expected to drain Pounds 302m, bills for repurchase by the market, set to remove Pounds 691m, and bankers' balances below target set to take up Pounds 425m. Partly offsetting these were exchequer transactions which would add Pounds 140m to the market and a fall in note circulation which would provide another Pounds 75m. The Bank provided the money market with Pounds 108m of early assistance, buying Pounds 33m of band one bank bills at the established 6 7/8 per cent rate and Pounds 75m of bills for resale to the market on January 5 at an interest rate of 6 15/16 per cent. It provided a further Pounds 140m of assistance in the morning, buying outright Pounds 50m of band two bank bills at 6 7/8 per cent and Pounds 90m of bills for resale to the market on January 5 at an interest rate of 6 15/16 per cent. Finally, it provided about Pounds 305m of late, unspecified assistance, bringing total help to Pounds 938m.</p>

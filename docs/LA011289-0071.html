			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL MARKS DEMOCRACY IN W. GERMANY, MARSHALL PLAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials and representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany  met at the Occidental College in Eagle Rock on Tuesday evening to begin the  city's yearlong commemoration of the Marshall Plan and West Germany's 40 years  of democratic government.  </P> <P> In brief remarks to an audience of about 50 people, West German Deputy Consul  General Klaus Rupprecht thanked Americans for the foresight and generosity that  made democracy possible in his country.  </P> <P> Keynote speaker Lawrence Mihlon, whose coming novel "Out of the Ashes" is set  in the reconstruction period, summarized the Marshall Plan and the development  of West German democracy as "a time of vision and courage the like of which the  United States may not see again."  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre used the event to propose a new  Marshall Plan for the poor of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The reception marked the opening in the Occidental College library of a  traveling exhibit on the Marshall Plan, the U.S. aid program that set the stage  for democracy in the shattered postwar nations of Europe through economic  recovery.  </P> <P> The exhibit consists of dramatic photos of a devastated Europe -- battered  cities, hungry children, displaced people grubbing for coal in icy fields --  and more optimistic pictures of rebirth -- buildings being erected, people  eating, coal miners working with pneumatic tools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Figures of the Mid-Century  </P> <P> Alongside the immediately grasped picture story are drab shots of  almost-forgotten figures of the mid-century such as British Foreign Secretary  Ernest Bevin, French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault, Soviet Foreign Minister  V.M. Molotov and U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall.  </P> <P> Among the photos are a scattering of documents, including a copy of the  typewritten text from which Marshall read as he proposed the historic plan in a  short address at Harvard University on June 5, 1947.  </P> <P> The exhibit is produced by the German Marshall Plan Fund, an organization that  promotes scholarship and appreciation for the program that is considered  America's boldest and most successful foreign policy achievement of the  century.  </P> <P> It has been traveling to universities and museums around the United States  since 1987, the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, and reached Los Angeles  in December, first staying two weeks in UCLA's International Student Center. It  will move to Cal State Northridge later this month.  </P> <P> Its arrival in Los Angeles brought the celebration of European recovery to a  new phase, keying on the 1949 adoption of the West German Constitution, known  as the Basic Law.  </P> <P> Through the formation of the Out of the Ashes committee, Los Angeles became the  nation's first city to honor the anniversary of West German constitutional  democracy.  </P> <P> Committee member Jurgen Pelzer, an associate professor at Occidental, arranged  for the exhibit and reception at the Eagle Rock campus as a double celebration  for the Marshall Plan and the Basic Law of his native West Germany.  </P> <P> At Occidental, the commemoration will continue with a film festival on U.S. and  West German relations and a panel discussion in the fall on political issues,  Pelzer said.  </P> <P> Throughout Los Angeles, the Out of the Ashes committee will sponsor German jazz  festivals, radio broadcasts and a conference on European democracy.  </P></p>

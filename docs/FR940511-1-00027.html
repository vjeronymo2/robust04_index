			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comparing accounts that disclose the same APY but earn different dollar amounts of interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the proposal, consumers may receive the same APY disclosure but different dollar amounts of interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Board solicits comment on whether consumers who are comparison shopping would be better served if the specific manner in which interest is credited (such as, ``An annual percentage yield of 6.17% with monthly interest checks'') should be stated along with the APY. (See &sect;&sect;230.3(e), 4(a)(ii), 4(b)(1)(i), 5(b), 8(b).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, assume a one-year CD that pays an interest rate of 6.00%. Consumers would receive an APY of 6.17% if the institution requires monthly interest payments. Or, if the institution permits interest to be withdrawn monthly instead, the proposed amendments would also require institutions to permit interest to remain in the account for monthly compounding. Consumers holding this account would also receive an APY of 6.17% whether the consumer chooses to take monthly interest checks or to have interest remain in the account. However, based on a $1,000 deposit consumers who receive interest checks will earn $60.00, while those who compound interest will earn $61.70.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compounding and crediting frequencies. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulation requires institutions to disclose the frequency with which interest is compounded and credited. This standard would require institutions also to specify the crediting frequency for interest payments sent directly to the consumer or to another account, whether by check or other means, as well as when interest is credited to the account. The Board solicits comment on the proposed disclosure and on whether stating the frequency of crediting by interest payments or transfers to other accounts is likely to help consumers compare and understand differences in account terms. (See &sect;230.4(b)(2).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Form of Comment Letters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment letters should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0836, and, when possible, should use a standard typeface with a type size of 10 or 12 characters per inch. This will enable the Board to convert the text into machine-readable form through electronic scanning, and will facilitate automated retrieval of comments for review. Also, if accompanied by an original document in paper form, comments may be submitted on 3 1/2 inch or 5 1/4 inch computer diskettes in any IBM-compatible DOS-based format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board's Office of the Secretary has prepared an economic impact statement on the proposed revisions to Regulation DD. The analysis expresses concern about the desirability of amending the regulation regarding the linkage of compounding and crediting frequencies at this time. A copy of the analysis may be obtained from Publications Services, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, at (202) 452&hyph;3245.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board solicits information regarding the likely costs for complying with the proposed changes to the regulation. In particular, the Board solicits comments on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What proportion of existing accounts would be affected by the proposed new rule requiring institutions to offer compounding on the same frequency as they permit interest payouts?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What changes would institutions have to make to implement the proposed new compounding and crediting rule, and what would it cost institutions to make these changes?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What changes in the number of different account terms and types of accounts offered would result if the proposal were adopted? For example, would institutions reduce the number of products offered? What effect would the amendments have on ``private banking'' relationships? Would institutions change from compounding to distributing the interest paid on accounts without compounding?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (44 U.S.C. 35; 5 CFR 1320.13), the proposed revisions will be reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget after consideration of comments received during the public comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 230  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Advertising, Banks, Banking, Consumer protection, Deposit accounts, Interest, Interest rates, Truth in savings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain conventions have been used to highlight the proposed revisions to the regulation. New language is shown inside bold-faced arrows, while language that would be deleted is set off with bold-faced brackets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board proposes to amend 12 CFR part 230 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=50 g=1 f=1 --> PART 230_TRUTH IN SAVINGS (REGULATION DD) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The authority citation for part 230 would continue to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  12 U.S.C. 4301  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Part 230.2 would be amended by revising paragraph (c), by redesignating paragraph (h) and paragraphs (i) through (v) as paragraph (i) and paragraphs (k) through (w), respectively, and by adding new paragraphs (h) and (j) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

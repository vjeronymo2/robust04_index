			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Marlowe to acquire Bennett &amp; Fountain MARLOWE HOLDINGS, the electrical distributor, is to buy Bennett &amp; Fountain in a recommended cash offer valuing its troubled rival at Pounds 2.1m. Marlowe is offering 2p in cash for each B&amp;F share. It is also negotiating to buy B&amp;F's Pounds 18m of bank debts at a discount and virtually all the group's preference shares. B&amp;F's thinly traded shares briefly touched a low of 1 3/4 p last year. They stood at 4p last Friday before the offer was made but fell to 2 1/2 p on the announcement, moving up  1/4 p yesterday. Marlowe has received irrevocable acceptances from Voltex Holdings, B&amp;F's South African parent, which holds about 60 per cent of the equity. B&amp;F, which has yet to publish preliminary results for its year to June 30, was last year in dispute with its former chairman. The company's financial advisers, Samuel Montagu, also resigned about a year ago. Kleinwort Benson is now advising the com-pany. B&amp;F incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.3m profit) on sales of Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 74.1m) in the year to end-June 1992. The company's net assets were then Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 16.5m). The losses came against 'difficult trading conditions and a very high level of bank indebtedness, repayable on demand'. The company said: 'In the absence of alternative proposals to provide additional funds to B&amp;F, the outlook for B&amp;F is very uncertain.'</p>

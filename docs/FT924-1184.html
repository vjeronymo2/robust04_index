			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Bank presses EC on supervision THE BANK of England is pressing European Community countries to allow outside regulators to review banking supervision arrangements once the Second Banking Co-ordination is implemented in the new year. Under the directive, branches of EC banks operating outside their home market will no longer be primarily supervised by their local regulator. Instead the regulator in the parent bank's home country will have supervisory responsibility. This will mean principal supervisory responsibility for branches of EC banks in the UK will rest with their home country supervisors rather than the Bank, though it will continue to monitor the branches' liquidity. This supervisory system is the corollary of a new 'passport' given to EC banks which will allow them to operate in any EC country so long as they have been authorised to conduct banking business in at least one member state. There is concern that some EC bank supervisors could be less effective than others. This would risk branches of EC banks in Britain not being supervised properly - to the possible detriment of customers. The Bank wants both EC and international supervisors among the G10 group of industrialised countries to accept a system of 'peer group review' recommended in the wake of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Lord Justice Bingham recommended the idea of peer group review in his report on BCCI. The suggestion was intended to help ensure common high standards of bank supervision among EC countries. The directive has caused some concern in the wake of BCCI because the bank was incorporated in Luxembourg, and was supervised by a college of regulators led by the Bank of England and Luxembourg bank regulators.</p>

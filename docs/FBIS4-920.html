			<p>BFN     [Text] The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] must submit its list  of election candidates to the Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC] today. IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler says the commission  will approve the lists by Friday so that they can be published  by the weekend. Mr. Justice Kriegler said the IFP's decision to  take part in the elections could cost millions of rands. An  additional 700 polling stations have to be established in  kwaZulu-Natal. Earlier it was reported that the state of  emergency in kwaZulu-Natal would stay in force until the  situation had improved.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 8 (BTA) -- Experts of the World  Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,  the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency arrived on a visit to Bulgaria  at the invitation of Environment Minister Valentin Bosevski.  The visit will last until February 17.    The mission, led by Spyros Margetis, senior environmental  specialist for Europe and Central Asia at the World Bank, will  survey the implementation of the plan of action which is part of  Bulgaria's environmental strategy. The plan, specifying the  main aspects of this country's environmental policy until the  year 2000, was developed in 1991 by Bulgarian specialists with  the assistance of experts of the same financial institutions and  agencies. Some of the foreign experts are members of the  present mission. The plan will be updated to bring it into line  with the changes that took place in Bulgaria over the last few  years. Stress will be laid on the development of an investment  matrix specifying the ways and mechanisms of attracting  investment for the implementation of the updated plan of action.  The draft update is expected to be ready by the end of March.    Bulgaria would like to show it pursues a consistent  environmental policy conducting cooperation with the  international financial and political institutions concerned  with the problems of environment at the 1995 Conference on  European Environment which Sofia is to host, Environment  Minister Bosevski said today before the opening of the working  meeting with the foreign experts. He stressed that Bulgaria  seeks integration with the financial and political mechanisms of  Europe and the world for the purpose of optimizing its  environmental policy. As hosts to the 1995 environmental  conference, we want to make our own contribution to the  formulation of the concept about environmental policy, Minister  Bosevski added.    World Bank resident representative John Wilton, who attended  the opening of the meeting, said that the updated plan of action  could also provide an input to the meeting of international  donors organized by the World Bank in June this year. The idea  of both meetings is to provide assistance for those priority  actions that are to be taken in the environmental area, Mr.  Wilton stressed.    Minister Bosevski expressed his hope that during the  mission's visit a national group would be established to draw up  Bulgaria's report for the 1995 conference. "This national team  would act as a coordinator of relations with the countries in  Central and Eastern Europe which are expected to raise a number  of social, political and economic problems at the forum," the  Bulgarian environment minister said.    Apart from the Environment Ministry team, the mission of  experts will also meet representatives of state and academic  institutions and non-government environmental formations.</p>

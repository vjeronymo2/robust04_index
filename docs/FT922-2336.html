			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour attacks water pricing THE AVERAGE household water payment has increased by more than 47 per cent - or three times the rate of inflation - since water companies were privatised, Labour claimed yesterday, urging the government to give greater priority to consumers' interests. Ms Ann Taylor, shadow environment spokesman, attacked the government for treating water as a marketable commodity rather than a 'vital natural resource'. The actual price increases compared with government predictions that water prices would rise by between 7.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent by the end of the century, she said, opening an Opposition debate on water since privatisation. The Labour motion expressed alarm at the 'record profits, record dividends and record salaries and perks of top management in the water companies', especially at a time when households were facing record bills. Mr David Maclean, environment minister, ruled out intervention to curb the increased charges, and accused Labour of 'not having the nous to realise that there is no investment without profits'. Privatisation had overcome the handicap of severe under-investment over 20 to 30 years, he said, praising the privatised companies for their Pounds 28bn investment programme. The motion fell by 274-317, a government majority of 43.</p>

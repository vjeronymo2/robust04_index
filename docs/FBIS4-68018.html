			<p>U.S.   <F P=102>   JN0205135094 Paris AL-MUHARRIR in Arabic 2 May 94 p 20 </F> <F P=103> JN0205135094 </F> <F P=104>  Paris AL-MUHARRIR </F> <F P=105>  Arabic </F> BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by AL-MUHARRIR correspondent in </F> Washington]    [Text] A special Egyptian unit has returned to Cairo from  the United States where it received training under the  supervision of U.S. agencies on operations requiring more  sophisticated training than could be provided by Egyptian  security agencies. The units were trained at the expense of an  oil-rich Arab country.    Competent U.S. quarters did not deny that the units' future  tasks would include the execution of operations outside Egyptian  boundaries for the United States or the state that has financed  the units' training. It has been rumored here that among the  expected or scheduled operations may be one or more in Sudan  against the ruling Islamic Front and some of its leaders. The  expected operations in Sudan will particularly target Usamah  Bin-Ladin, who has been accused by foreign and certain Arab  quarters of financing and leading extremist fundamentalist  movements.    Usamah Bin-Ladin announced in Sudan that he has joined the  Saudi opposition movement in London and that he supports its  objectives. Bin-Ladin's announcement came in reaction to the  Saudi authorities' withdrawal of his Saudi passport.    Western circles believe that part of the al-Shaykh religious  family in Saudi Arabia supports and finances the opposition.</p>

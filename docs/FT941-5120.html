			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Polythene rises 28% - Disposal profits boost outcome by Pounds 1.1m British Polythene Industries, Europe's largest polythene film producer, increased its profits by 28 per cent to Pounds 15.4m in 1993 helped by a Pounds 20.6m rights issue which reduced interest charges and Pounds 1.1m of disposal profits. Underlying earnings on a fully diluted basis edged up from 24.75p to 25p. Turnover rose by a fifth to Pounds 212m and Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman, predicted it would top Pounds 250m this year. 'Our business is growing, and with considerable success, in difficult conditions,' he said. Half of group sales go to British food retailers, either as plastic bags or transit packaging, and British Polythene's shares have underperformed on worries about a potential squeeze on margins from the hard-pressed supermarkets. Operating margins slipped from 8.19 per cent to 7.84 per cent, with profits from con-tinuing operations up only 2 per cent to Pounds 14.8m on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 193m. Mr McLatchie said that excluding Pounds 500,000 of reorganisation costs there was an improvement in margins between the two halves. But this was partly because of a reduction in raw materials costs. 'Retailers are being very difficult, but they have been difficult for a long time,' he said. Mr McLatchie said that some retailers had defected after the Pounds 8.4m acquisition of a rival plastic bag manufacturer from Sonoco a year ago. 'They are not comfortable with sole suppliers.' But he stressed that the loss of customers had been expected. 'We have kept half of the real business and moved the spare equipment to China.' British Polythene has formed a joint venture in China which will start producing small, thin retail bags towards the end of the year. The company will offer retailers the choice of UK or Chinese-made bags, but Mr McLatchie warned: 'If retailers end up buying everything from China there will no customers left for their shops.' The final dividend rises to 7.75p for a total up 15 per cent to 11.5p. COMMENT The largest supplier in a mature commodity market, British Polythene has shown it can generate good profits growth by hoovering up its smaller, often struggling, rivals. This cannot go on for ever - though with 25 per cent of the market there appears enough scope for the next few years - and Mr McLatchie is not optimistic that the frustrating search for good acquisitions in Europe will bear fruit. But the more immediate worry is the threat to margins from cost-cutting supermarkets. The shares have picked up over the past month, and on forecasts of Pounds 17.5m are now trading on 16 times forward earnings. Until the trend in margins is clearer that looks high enough.</p>

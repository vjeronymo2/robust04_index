			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Property: Ripple becomes a wider stream - London recovery spreads The little ripple that started running through the central London property market two years ago has now spread. The small upturn started after the devaluation of sterling in September 1992 made the prime areas of central London attractive to buyers from the Far East. The knock-on has now reached to areas of central-outer London where UK buyers predominate, either established Londoners moving house or the young starting their careers. Which parts of town are on the up? Agent Winkworth, which gets a good picture from 31 franchised offices across the capital, suggests familiar names such as Notting Hill and Islington - and surprises such as Acton and Victoria Park, in the depressed East End district of Hackney. The buyers divide into two types: those seeking a single, or main, residence and those who have a larger place elsewhere and are after a pied-a-terre in town. In Bloomsbury, famed for writer Virginia Woolf and her Bloomsbury Set, the pied-a-terre brigade makes up 80 per cent of buyers, says David Salvi of Barnard Marcus. They are mostly lawyers, doctors, and people in publishing and the media. It is much the same in nearby Covent Garden, says Lesa Green, of EA Shaw. 'They want a simple pad. It does not matter if it is over a shop or restaurant.' One of the tricks is to work out which areas are about to become fashionable and buy before the stampede drives prices up. In the west London district of Notting Hill, the herd is gathering already, although prices are cheap only by comparison with similar accommodation in Chelsea, Knightsbridge, Kensington and Holland Park - the areas where the ripple began. Communal gardens, a feature of the area, are a great advantage. A large Notting Hill maisonette opening on to one costs Pounds 450,000 to Pounds 500,000 and will attract younger buyers away from two-bedroom flats in Chelsea and Knightsbridge. And there are large family houses at about Pounds 2m, against Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 7m for similar town mansions in Holland Park. In some cases, prices in the area have risen sometimes by as much as 20 per cent this year, says Giles Hoskins, of Winkworth in Notting Hill - and 90 per cent of the buyers are British. This demand has spread northwards to W10 where the Queen's Park estate (originally the Shaftesbury estate) north of the Harrow Road is popular. Terrace houses with two or three bedrooms, costing Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 100,000, go quickly to young professional couples or singles. The latter are often first-time buyers who continued renting through the recession. Now, they have enough money to jump the usual first step in the housing ladder - a studio flat - in favour of something more substantial. Further west, Acton W3 takes over-spill from Chiswick and Hammersmith. Prices range from Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 155,000 for a house near Acton Town (District and Piccadilly Underground lines) in the triangle of roads formed by The Ridgeway, Park Drive and Princes Avenue. Those prices are 10 to 15 per cent lower than they would be in neighbouring Chiswick, and Winkworth has sold 17 houses in this triangle in the past year. The alternative is the 'poets' corner' near Acton Central (North London line) where the roads are named after Cowper, Milton and others. Further north and east, Islington offers fine Georgian and early-Victorian houses, theatres, restaurants and good public transport. For real value, though, Winkworth's Andrew Towler advises buyers to go half a mile east to the De Beauvoir estate. This has excellent Victorian houses interspersed with council homes. A three-bedroom property there would cost Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 160,000, compared with Pounds 250,000 near the Angel in the heart of Islington. Still further east, City people are discovering Victoria Park, E9, where four-bedroom houses cost from Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 250,000 and it is easy to reach the City and the West End by bus or Underground (District and Central lines). At Clapham South SW4, (Northern line), four estate agents have opened recently to cover the streets off Abbeville Road, near the south-east corner of Clapham Common. A five-bedroom house in Elms Road with conservatory, roof terrace and garden is available from Winkworth for Pounds 365,000. But go a mile south-east, to Streatham SW2, and you will find splendid value in five streets around the area of Telford Avenue. The houses are substantial and mostly red-brick late Victorian and Edwardian, with five to eight bedrooms and costing around Pounds 250,000.</p>

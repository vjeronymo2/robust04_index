"He has survived for now but the real battle is only  starting," said an aide to Kitingan, the embattled Catholic  politician who beat Mahathir's Muslim-dominated National Front  by a narrow two-seat margin in weekend polls to elect 48 members  to the state assembly.    Kitingan made his first move toward a reconciliation with  Mahathir on Monday, immediately after Governor Mohamed Said  Keruak swore him into office after a humiliating 36-hour wait  outside the bolted gates of the governor's mansion. "I hope  things go smoothly. It's time to sit down and look ahead," he  said, although supporters who kept a vigil outside the mansion  for fear Kitingan would be denied office seemed less willing to  overlook the indignity suffered by their leader. But the chief  minister said threats made in the heat of an election campaign  should not set the tone for the long-term relationship between  his state and the federal government.    "Now that the election is over, there must be communication  channels and sensibility," said Kitingan, who said Monday he  would seek a meeting with Mahathir to improve federal-state  ties. [passage omitted]    Sakaran Dandai, Sabah head of Mahathir's United Malays  National Organisation (UMNO), the largest component in the  National Front, said however that Kitingan's government cannot  survive. "Several assemblymen have expressed interest in joining  the National Front," said Sakaran, a federal minister.    Kitingan could also face a legal challenge to his right  under  the state constitution to appoint six members to the state  assembly to fortify his position. "The provision may be in  conflict with the federal constitution," according to federal  Law Minister Hamid Albar.</p>

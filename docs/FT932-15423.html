			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Chernobyl reactor shut down after engine malfunction The No 1 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine was shut down yesterday because of a malfunction in the turbine engine, the Itar-Tass news agency said. There was no danger of any radiation being released, according Mr Viktor Vasilchenko, chief engineer at the complex. The plant has four graphite reactors. Reactor No 4, which exploded in 1986, has been encased in a steel-and-concrete 'sarcophagus', and reactor No 2 has been shut down since a fire in 1991. Mr Vasilchenko said the generator at Chernobyl was being repaired. He said yesterday's incident ranked 'zero' on the International Atomic Agency's seven-point scale, meaning it posed no danger. It is the second shutdown because of malfunction at the Chernobyl complex since March 1. In 1991, there were 270 shutdowns at nuclear plants in the former Soviet Union, according to the State Atomic Security Commission.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["fel"-attributed report: "Intelligence Service Officials </F> to the Drug Front"]    [Text] Berlin -- This week Italy's and France's security  organs managed to deal two blows to organized crime. In  Lombardy, more than 200 suspected Mafiosi were arrested, who are  accused of hundreds of crimes -- from drug trafficking to  murder. Among the more than two dozen drug dealers who were  arrested in Toulon and the surroundings, there are also the two  killers of Yann Pait, a parliamentary deputy and dedicated  fighter against organized crime, who was shot dead in Hyeres in  February.    Reportedly, intelligence service experts were involved in  the  investigations preceding the two large-scale police operations.  If this is true, Italians and French did what FRG Interior  Minister Kanther wants to make possible in Germany and which has  been repeatedly been demanded by Interpol Secretary General  Raymond Kendall over the past weeks.    The British criminologist, who was responsible for antidrug  operations at Scotland Yard for several years, recently said  that one may assume that drugs constitute a threat that is  similar to a war. Thus, appropriate means must be mobilized,  starting with the intelligence services and counterespionage.  With their technical knowledge, these authorities could "be  extremely useful in the struggle against organized crime."    The criminal opponents at the drug front have long been  using  intelligence service means. Given estimated annual profits of  $300 billion, they have the financial means to undermine the  bases of the democratic states. Consequently, Rendall and other  advocates of stricter drug repression accept rule-of-law  objections against the mixing of the assignments of intelligence  services and police only to a certain extent. The Interpol  chief thinks that the resulting risks are "far smaller than the  dangers posed by organized crime." Kanther, too, wants the 6,000  officials of the Federal Intelligence Office (BND) to "put their  technical possibilities into the service of discovering crimes."  For this purpose, he must amend the BND law. Whether the  Bundestag will agree is just as questionable as the readiness of  the intelligence service officials to subject themselves to  stricter political control.</p>

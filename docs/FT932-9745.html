			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: US brokerage to sell off energy partnerships PRUDENTIAL Securities, the fourth-largest brokerage firm in the US, is to sell 35 energy partnerships to a US petroleum company for Dollars 557m. The deal is an important step towards resolving the problems of Prudential's troubled limited partnership business. If the offer from Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum is accepted, Dollars 448m will be paid directly to investors. This means that, along with the Dollars 665m Prudential has already distributed, investors could receive about 76 cents on the dollar for their initial investment of Dollars 1.45bn. The partnerships, which invested in US oil and gas properties, were popular in the 1980s and sold aggressively by big brokerage firms, particularly Prudential. But after tax laws changes and depression in the energy and property businesses, the partnerships racked up heavy losses. Prudential faces a class-action lawsuit filed by thousands of investors who lost money in the partnerships, and it is the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into whether the firm improperly sold the partnerships to investors. The legal battle has cost the firm's parent, Prudential Insurance, more than Dollars 400m, which has been set aside to cover the cost of fighting the lawsuits. Although neither the class-action lawsuit nor the SEC investigation will be directly affected by the deal with Parker &amp; Parsley, Prudential will soon offer investors who filed the class-action suit a new settlement in light of the sale. News of the deal, which if accepted will boost Parker &amp; Parsley's proven oil and gas reserves by 75 per cent, was well received on Wall Street. In early trading yesterday, the company's shares were up Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

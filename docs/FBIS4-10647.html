			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Correspondent Aurelio Garibay and special </F> correspondents Salvador Guerrero and Jesus Aranda]    [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 11 Apr -- The Office of  the Attorney General of the Republic is examining possible ties  between Mario Aburto and a legal political organization that  advocates Mexico's annexation by the United States. The leader  of that organization, the American Union Party (PUA), Dr.  Ernesto G. Messina, denies knowing the confessed assassin of  Luis Donaldo Colosio, but he explains: "Mario Aburto Martinez is  a great patriot and a great Mexican because he saved the country  from the continued dictatorship we are experiencing and which we  are trying to disguise as a democracy."    Documents obtained by local reporters and special  correspondents covering the assassination of Luis Donaldo  Colosio Murrieta, attribute to Gabriela Gonzalez, cousin of  Graciela Gonzalez, the alleged girlfriend of Mario Aburto,  statements to the effect that the confessed murderer used to  visit a white building located between Madero and Revolution  Streets. After exhausting various possibilities involving the  location of that building, it was decided that it was the  building that houses the clinic of the plastic surgeon who wrote  the book entitled Mexico-United States of America Union:  Worldwide Revolution.    Approximately eight years ago, Messina became a public  figure  when he decided to place a U.S. flag in front of his clinic on  the first floor of an old building on Madero Street, between  Third and Fourth Streets; he painted the last stripe on the flag  green. He also disclosed that his clinic was the headquarters  of the American Union Party and shortly after that the book, the  title of which we mentioned earlier, went on sale. Also in 1992  Messina was involved in a controversy when "to protest against  fiscal terrorism, anti- democracy in Mexico and police  repression," he had a three-colored flag placed on a pole that  projected from his clinic, but he had the national coat of arms  removed from it.    This final action cost him a complaint for violating the  symbols of the fatherland, and he had to go to the 4th Penal  District Court every week to sign a document. He quoted  Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, who in his book The  Fish in the Water justified any means of ending a  dictatorship wherever it might exist; within this context, he  said that Aburto did not assassinate Colosio out of hatred or  because Luis Donaldo Colosio was the person, but because "he  personified the dictator's unilateral designation [dedazo]."    Mario Aburto, he said, is a patriot because he acted against  a dictatorship, regardless of its nature. That is what does the  greatest harm to the country and the world. The crime Aburto  perpetrated, he argued, is justifiable because we are living in  a dictatorship; it would have been objectionable if he had done  this in a democracy as happened in the case of John F. Kennedy.    Messina said that Colosio's confessed assassin was never a  member of his organization, but he would have liked very much if  he had been because "he is a brave man who put his life on the  line. He knew he could have been killed and despite this he did  it in view of the inefficiency of the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] candidate's security guards."    Regarding the possibility that Aburto acted alone, Dr.  Messina trusts this is so because "we should not undermine his  discernment capabilities. As you can see, that is what was said  of Chiapas; that they were ignorant Indians who had certain  rights and no more, and see what happened. They organized and  how are they now?</p>

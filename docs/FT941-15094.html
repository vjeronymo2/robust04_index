			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / The Markets: Unstable foundations of the Chinese economic miracle - Economic Eye Arriving in today's China is a shocking experience. Even the most experienced Sino-travellers marvel at the pace of economic development in Chinese cities and the enthusiasm with which urban dwellers are embracing the trappings of capitalist societies. For Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary who lands in Beijing on Wednesday, having spent last week in Moscow, the signs of economic dynamism will look even more sparkling. A week in Moscow is enough to convince anyone that there are no easy solutions to Russia's economic difficulties. China, by contrast, is in the seemingly enviable position of having too much growth rather than too little. After fifteen years of market-orientated reform in which economic growth has averaged nearly 10 per cent a year, the assumption built into most scenarios of the coming decade is that China's economic miracle will continue. Certainly the large number of foreign companies who have poured into China over the past three years believe so. So does the World Bank. Last year's report on the economic prospects for developing countries estimated that, by the beginning of the next decade, China's economy (properly measured) would be larger than that of the US. However will the past turn out to be as reliable a guide to the future as many investors seem to hope? Perhaps. But it is also possible to construct a scenario in which China's economic success story goes decidely sour. Like Russia, China suffers from a number of post-planning hangovers - inequality and under-employment, growing regional tensions and a decline in central authority - which could yet undermine its prospects for the decade ahead. It is easy for the foreign visitor to be fooled by a city-hopping trip to China. Travelling by train rather than aeroplane quickly reveals that the vast mass of rural China remains poor and undeveloped. The percentage of the population which now lives in poverty has fallen from 33 per cent in 1970 to 9 per cent in 1990. But 100m Chinese are still living in absolute poverty, many of whom are under-employed farmers. The Chinese government estimates that 130m of the total 333m agricultural labour force is surplus to requirements, a figure which could reach 200m by the end of the decade. The income gap between urban and rural populations, after narrowing in the early 1980s, is growing again, as the upper chart shows. But it is regional differences in growth and poverty which hint at the underlying threat to China's economic future. Poverty rates are much higher in the northern and western regions, far from the coastal growth centres. In these regions, rural manufacturing enterprises employ a much smaller percentage of the rural workforce. The market economy ought to provide an easy mechanism for easing the political tensions that regional inequalities on this scale can throw up by mass migration of rural workers to urban areas in the richer provinces. But in China, legal inter-provincial migration is strictly controlled in order to maintain 'social stability'. This, translated, means that the central government and affluent provincial governments want to stop what they consider would be a socially explosive flood of poorer workers into cities. But sporadic rural riots and the large groups of illegal rural migrants in China's main cities suggest this attempt to bottle-up the problem is not succeeding. Alternatively, the central government could use the tax system to spread the fruits of growth more widely. But in China, as in Russia and other former communist states, total tax revenue has dropped sharply in the past decade. Within this declining total, the share of revenue which the central government retains has fallen from 60 per cent in the early 1980s to 45 per cent by the end of the decade as the richer and progressively more powerful provinces have become increasingly unwilling to transfer revenue to the centre. The central government's new value-added tax is supposed to solve this problem. It will only succeed if increasingly unco-operative, or corrupt, provincial officials are willing to collect and pass on the revenues. As the power of the centre has weakened, so its ability to manage the economy has also dwindled. The fall in tax revenue has undermined the power of fiscal policy as a macroeconomic policy weapon for the central government. Provincial governments have also extended their influence over the local branches of the central bank, thereby undermining central monetary control. The result has been progressively violent boom-bust cycles of rapid growth followed by accelerating inflation. Meanwhile, as total tax revenues have fallen, so monetary policy has become the main means of financing subsidies to loss-making state enterprises. According to estimates by Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, these consume 10 per cent of GNP. So far they have not been inflationary largely because of the willingness of the Chinese public to build-up substantial savings in money deposits. But the rapid growth of street-side sellers of shares suggest that the public's toleration for money savings may be dwindling. In short, the risk of a destabilising acceleration in inflation is growing. But the central government faces a paradox. The success of further decentralised economic development is increasingly dependent on a substantial re-centralisation of economic power to control inflation and share the fruits of growth. That industrial output and inflation are both still accelerating, despite the central government's campaign to slow the economy last year, suggests that its softly softly approach to re-establishing central economic control is not working. A return to more repressive central government, and a stalling of reform and economic growth, may yet be the only way to force the richer provinces to recognise that this re-centralisation must occur. Continued rapid growth in China is far from assured.</p>

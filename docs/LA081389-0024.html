			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A PRIEST ON ABORTION'  </P> <P> Finally a picture of abortion painted by a man who obviously cares about women.  A man who is not pro-abortion but pro-choice. I have no problem with that  concept. And my guess is that most women, even the most liberal, would agree  with Regas. Women are not interested in frivolous abortions as those pro-lifers  lead us to believe. They are interested in their right to having control over  their bodies. And what in heaven's name is wrong with that?  </P> <P> MARJORIE L. SCHWARTZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by Georges Combevi Agbodjan, minister of </F> territorial administration and security, in Lome on 2 January --  read by announcer]    [Text] The country has no time to lose if it wants to  ensure that 1994 is a better year for all Togolese. All the  conditions will be met so that the legislative elections can  take place on 23 January and 6 February. Contrary to the  statement of certain opposition parties claiming that the  revision of voters registers is not yet complete and that the  distribution of voters cards could not begin, the minister of  territorial administration and security wishes to make the  following clarifications:    The results of the revision of voters registers made by the  administrative commissions, composed of representatives of all  political parties legally constituted, were transmitted to the  National Electoral Commission [CEN] on 31 December 1993. The  electoral code stipulates that the National Electoral Commission  will be responsible for the personification of voters cards  while the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security  will be responsible for their distribution. To accelerate these  last two phases of the preparations for the legislative  elections -- the personification and the distribution -- the CEN  and the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Security have  adopted the procedure proposed by French and German experts  permitting the simultaneous personification and distribution of  the cards in the presence of voters. The structures set up in  the electoral constituencies and polling stations will make it  possible for all voters to withdraw their cards before 23  January.    To this end, the minister of territorial administration and  security requests the representatives of political parties, who  are members of distribution commissions, to assist the chairmen  of the local electoral committees and prefects. The government  will do everything possible so that the legislative elections of  23 January will be regular, democratic, open, and fair.    Signed by Georges Combevi Agbodjan.</p>

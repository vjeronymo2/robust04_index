			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Principality deserts Swiss lead with vote for EEA A MOUSE roared in alpine Europe yesterday when the tiny principality of Liechtenstein defied public opinion in neighbouring Switzerland and voted to join the European Economic Area. In traditional Ruritanian style, Mr Hans Brunhart, the prime minister, offered a news conference dominated by Swiss journalists the joking pledge that this would not mean border posts being put up on the country's eastern Rhine frontier - 'at least not tomorrow.' The outcome, nonetheless, was quite as surprising to many Liechtensteiners as Switzerland's vote just a week earlier not to join the EEA, the free trade accord widely seen as a waiting room for the European Community. Most of Liechtenstein's political leaders had warned before the Swiss plebiscite that - whatever its result - their country should follow their neighbour's lead. But when the Swiss voted No, Vaduz was caught between solidarity with Berne and its need to trade in a wider Europe to defend an industrial base accounting for a remarkable 50 per cent of gross domestic product. In the event, the outcome was decisive, with all 12 communes obeying Prince Hans Adam II's impassioned entreaties for a Yes vote. The overall majority was exactly 1,400 votes - a wafer in a UK constituency, but a landslide in a country of just 30,000. The consequences, nonetheless, may be significant for the 70-year-old customs union with Switzerland. Hurried assurances were issued last night that the vote will not materially affect relations with the Swiss nor involve surrendering the mighty Swiss franc as Liechtenstein's national currency. The principality's businessmen and international bankers have also been promised that there is no threat to its much-envied low-tax regime that has helped make it the richest country in Europe in terms of GDP per capita. Talks will open soon with Switzerland on how to adjust the terms of the customs union to accommodate both sides. Last night, the Prince was clearly jubilant at his subjects' independence of spirit. But he insisted that the outcome was not so much a rejection of Switzerland as a solid endorsement of closer trade ties with a wider Europe that buys 45 per cent of Liechtenstein's manufactured exports. Questioned on possible EC membership, the Prince rejected a membership application as 'a step too far.' That will come as a relief to the lightly-taxed drinkers celebrating or drowning their sorrows last night in the Old Castle inn in downtown Vaduz. Whatever their views they were united in a determination not to be drawn into a system which might force them to bail out their, in comparative terms, impoverished northern near-neighbours - the Germans.</p>

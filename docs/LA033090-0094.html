			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRED POLICEMAN JAILED IN STALKING, RAPE OF  GIRL, 11  </P> <P> A fired Beverly Hills police officer allegedly used his training to stalk an  11-year-old Irvine girl, then posed as a deliveryman to gain entry into her  home when she was alone and raped her at knife-point, Orange County prosecutors  said Thursday.  </P> <P> Steven Rush McCoy, 36, was jailed in lieu of $250,000 bail on six felony counts  that include rape, sexual assault and burglary, authorities said.  </P> <P> His arraignment is set for Tuesday.  </P> <P> "This is far more frightening than your average rape," said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Ariadne Symons. "This man obviously stalked the child, chose her for whatever  reason to be his victim, waited for her to be alone, and planned the crime in  what he thought would be the most undetectable way."  </P> <P> Police said the girl called 911 after the attack and identified McCoy from a  photo. Beverly Hills police officials declined to comment on the reasons for  McCoy's firing in 1978.  </P></p>

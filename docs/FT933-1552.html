			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / China says Hurd's Olympic attack may harm relations CHINA gave a veiled warning yesterday that an attack by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, on Beijing's suitability as a site for the 2000 Olympics might further harm Sino-British relations. The International Olympic Committee will choose from five contenders for the site tonight, with Beijing still the favourite. Meanwhile, Mr Hurd said he would meet Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, in New York on October 1 to try to speed up talks over Hong Kong. In Monaco Mr Li Lanqing, a Chinese vice-premier, said: 'We feel astonishment and regret at Mr Hurd's remarks.' Mr Hurd had implied on Australian television that Beijing did not deserve to host the games because of its poor human rights record. Mr Li, a former trade minister, said: 'This is politics and I believe that sport and politics should not be mixed.' He went on to caution: 'The improvement of bilateral relations depends on the efforts of both sides.' Without being prompted, he raised the question of the future of Hong Kong, saying in a clear linkage of the two issues: 'China is sincere in all its talks with Britain. We would like to see a fair and equitable settlement of the question of Hong Kong.' Sydney, Manchester, Berlin and Istanbul are also competing to host the millennial Olympiad. Two prime ministers - Mr Paul Keating of Australia and Mrs Tansu Ciller of Turkey, arrived yesterday to reinforce the final bid presentations to the IOC today. Mr John Major will fly in from his Far East tour this morning. Manchester and Beijing each flew in dozens of children to provide street performances. The five contenders are together estimated to have spent well over Dollars 125m (Pounds 81m) on campaigns. Mr Li said if China won, Beijing would seek IOC permission to hold sections of the games in Hong Kong and possibly Macao. IOC team ready to award biggest prize, Page 6</p>

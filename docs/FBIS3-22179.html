The area suitable for agriculture is 27,349 square  kilometers; evergreen forests account for another 28,353 square  kilometers; deciduous forests, 23,434; and as for maritime  coastal resources, the southern zone has most of the mangrove  forests with 46,756 hectares.    The country's water resources include 19 important rivers,  of  which the largest are: the Patuca, Ulua, Chamelecon and Aguan  Rivers in the Atlantic zone; and the Choluteca and Nacaome in  the Pacific zone.    These natural resources are undergoing great pressure from  unscrupulous investors who stop at no outrage to obtain a few  millions, without concerning themselves about the rest of the  population.    According to studies, approximately 100,000 hectares of  evergreen, deciduous, and mangrove forests were destroyed this  year [1993]. The causes were various: forest fires, migrant  farming, extensive livestock raising, poor land distribution and  ownership, timber exports, use as firewood, salt production, and  the shrimping industry.    The rivers suffer most from these problems, since into them  are discarded garbage, construction debris, silt, fecal matter,  industrial wastes, and dangerous chemical residues, such as  nondegradable fertilizers, pesticides, and fungicides. Drought  also contributes resulting in most medium-sized and small  streams drying up, reducing the volume of water carried by the  principal rivers.    The environmental problems that affect people are alarming,  including: a rise in the temperature, erosion, droughts and  floods, poor agricultural production, respiratory, contagious,  and infectious diseases, skin allergies, and cancerous growths.    In order to halt this accelerated process of  self-destruction, experts in environmental affairs recommend  stricter laws, institutional responsibility, more resources and  better management for environmental protection, inventories and  data centers for protected areas, and better programs for  promoting public awareness through environmental education.  Respect by politicians for renewable natural resources is also  necessary, since any damage to these resources is irreversible.</p>

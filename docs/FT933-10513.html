			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / US optimistic on Mideast talks MR WARREN CHRISTOPHER, US secretary of state, yesterday appeared to support Israel's view that the US-arranged ceasefire which ended Israel's bombardment of southern Lebanon last week could advance stalled bilateral peace talks with Syria and Lebanon, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem. 'The fighting in Lebanon. . . was a reminder of how urgent our task is and how real are the enemies of peace,' he said after meeting Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister. 'But it is also an indication of the fact that Israel, Lebanon and Syria are able to work together on a problem and I think take a step in trying to ensure that the peace process isn't derailed.' Jerusalem has expressed the hope recently that Mr Christopher would focus on making progress in talks between Syria and Israel over the occupied Golan Heights, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. However, analysts believe progress with Syria will be difficult so long as talks between Israel and the Palestinians remain deadlocked. There appeared little progress in yesterday's meeting between Mr Christopher and the Palestinians. Several members of the Palestinian delegation, including Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, chief negotiator in the peace talks, boycotted the meeting with Mr Christopher, accusing the US of bias towards Israel. After the talks, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, said there had been no discussion of a US-drafted document which lays the ground for an interim period of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. Instead, she said, the Palestinians pressed Mr Christopher to consider reviewing the framework for the talks and to allow immediate discussion on the final status of a Palestinian entity.</p>

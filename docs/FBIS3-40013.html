In a statement to the Bundestag Budget Committee,  Mr. Goehner parliamentary state secretary in the FRG Economics  Minister, stressed that the originally agreed goal of completing  36,000 apartments by the end of 1994 is not in danger as far as  one can say at the moment.    Goehner said that Burlakov's repeated accusations are due to  his duty to care for his soldiers. According to the Russian  Defense Ministry, about 220,000 apartments for soldiers are  currently missing, and Germany's contribution is just  alleviating the problem.    According to Goehner, some interim building deadlines have  not been observed. The delays are three months at the most.  The biggest delays happened in 1992. According to the state  secretary, 15,000 apartments are finished. In total, the  Federal Government provides 8.35 billion marks, with which at  least 45,000 apartments in 40 building sights, including all  technical and social infrastructure are being built. In  addition, two housing construction combines and about 20  factories for building and equipment materials are part of the  program.</p>

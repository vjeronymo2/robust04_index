			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Royal Trustco deep in red as provisions almost treble ROYAL Trustco, the crippled financial services group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, has disclosed the severity of the financial problems which led to the pending takeover of its operations by Royal Bank of Canada. The group yesterday reported a record net loss in 1992 of CDollars 852m (USDollars 676.1m), or CDollars 5.93 a share, compared with earnings in 1991 of CDollars 107m, or 25 cents a share. Loan-loss provisions almost trebled to CDollars 421m from CDollars 155m. Much of the increase was blamed on a significant deterioration in its commercial real estate portfolio in the fourth quarter, especially in Canada. The company also took a CDollars 93m write-down of goodwill in the fourth quarter, while assets fell to CDollars 25.1bn from CDollars 37.5bn. Royal Trustco was for years one of Canada's most venerable financial institutions, specialising in home mortgages and fiduciary services. But ill-advised forays into Europe and the US, compounded by the North American recession, resulted in heavy losses in recent years. Trilon Financial, a Bronfman holding company, earlier this year began seeking an outside investor to inject equity into Royal Trustco. Trilon Financial last month agreed to sell all Royal Trustco's operations to Royal Bank of Canada for CDollars 1.65bn. Royal Trustco will be left as little more than a shell to recoup what it can from a loan portfolio of CDollars 4.5bn. The company expects the deal with Royal Bank to close either in the late summer or autumn. Several outside shareholders have accused Royal Trustco's management of not providing timely disclosure of the company's financial problems. Royal Trustco's share price has plummeted from CDollars 18.25 in 1990 to 40 cents yesterday, down 7 cents on the day.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UNIONS TURN TO ORGANIZING WHITE-COLLAR PROFESSIONALS  </P> <P> What do auto workers in Detroit and attorneys from the county Public Defenders  Office have in common? Blue-collar workers and white-collar professionals are  often labor adversaries, but the assembly-line worker in Michigan and public  defender working in a San Diego County courtroom may soon be represented by the  same union.  </P> <P> For the past four months, the United Auto Workers quietly have been organizing  about 160 attorneys and 60 investigators from the public defenders office into  a union. The lawyers and investigators are part of a growing trend in  California, where blue-collar unions are competing for the hearts and minds of  the state's public-sector lawyers and other white-collar professionals.  </P> <P> The UAW and Teamsters have emerged as the most aggressive recruiters of deputy  district attorneys, public defenders and legal aid lawyers in the state and  nationally. The two unions have gone head-to-head in the battle for attorneys  in a few California counties, but the UAW has a big edge in the recruiting war,  which is being led by UAW District 65, based in New York.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UAW Gaining Membership  </P> <P> District 65 vice president Dwight Loines said from New York that the union  represents about 5,000 attorneys, paralegals and law clerks in 30 states, most  of them independent employees of the federally funded legal services program.  However, in New York City and Long Island, the UAW represents about 1,000  community defenders who are categorized as private employees and contract with  the city and Nassau County, Loines said.  </P> <P> One labor expert called white-collar professionals in the public sector,  including lawyers, a fertile field for traditional unions whose blue-collar  membership in the private sector has been declining steadily for the past  decade.  </P> <P> At the same time, workers in the public sector have seen a decline in  government spending and are becoming increasingly concerned about working  conditions, while demanding better pay and benefits. In California, many public  employees are forsaking independent employee associations in favor of labor  unions.  </P> <P> Mary Ann Massenburg, District 65's chief organizer in Northern California, said  the union represents about 900 legal aid and California Rural Legal Assistance  attorneys in the state, including San Diego County. The nonprofit legal aid  offices are independent and funded by the Legal Services Corp., which was  established by Congress in 1973. The union negotiates with a management team  representing each office.  </P> <P> In addition, District 65 recently organized about 210 employees at  Bancroft-Whitney in San Francisco. The company is a major legal publisher in  the United States.  </P> <P> If the UAW succeeds in organizing the public defenders in San Diego, it will  mark the first time the union has organized county-employed attorneys in the  state, said Terry Skotnes, District 65's chief Southern California organizer.  However, the San Diego County Employees Assn., which currently represents the  public defenders, is expected to challenge the UAW's petition to serve as the  attorneys' bargaining unit and decertify the association at a hearing next  month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawyers Felt Slighted  </P> <P> Attorney Marsha Duggan, who has led the effort to unionize public defenders,  said she and her colleagues felt they were not being adequately represented by  the employees group. She complained that lawyers were lumped in with  architects, health-care professionals and other white-collar workers in  bargaining sessions with the county.  </P> <P> "We were represented at the last session by an architect. Nobody in our office  was aware that we had an opportunity to become part of the bargaining process.  We weren't aware of who our representative was until our contract was  negotiated. . . . The idea of an architect knowing what our needs are was  appalling. We have interests and needs that are different. We need a bargaining  unit more closely aligned to our needs," Duggan said.  </P> <P> Robert Warshawsky, a lawyer with the Public Defenders Office in Solano County,  echoed Duggan's complaint. The Solano County public defenders and deputy  district attorneys were organized into a single bargaining unit by the  Teamsters last October. Warshawsky complained that the Solano County Employees  Assn. frequently ignored the lawyers' interests during contract talks because  they were a relatively small group.  </P> <P> "There were too many cooks spoiling the soup. . . . When you try to make too  many people happy, you're going to make some unhappy. We felt we were too small  a group for the association to look out for our particular needs and  interests," Warshawsky said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Presentations Were Requested  </P> <P> Attorney Jacqueline Crowle, who also was involved in the organizing drive in  San Diego County, said the lawyers contacted several unions, including the  Teamsters and UAW, and invited them to make a presentation.  </P> <P> "We listened to several representatives and voted for the UAW," Crowle said.  "District 65 is fairly well-known for the work it's done in the legal aid  services. We felt it had the best track record."  </P> <P> Crowle said the drive to affiliate with an international union began earlier in  the year in a series of meetings involving public defenders from the downtown,  Chula Vista, El Cajon and Juvenile Hall offices.  </P> <P> "We had these meetings to see what interest there was among our colleagues,  whether they wanted to stay with the CEA or look for a new bargaining unit. We  had presentations from the SEIU (Service Employees International Union), AFSCME  (the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees) and others,  but the overwhelming support was for the UAW," Crowle said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attorneys Called Undecided  </P> <P> Frank Bardsley, head of the public defenders office declined to comment on the  drive by his staff to unionize. However, Richard Gates, a veteran defense  attorney, said a large group of attorneys are still undecided about which union  will represent them.  </P> <P> Gates said, "If I were working with the UAW, I would be working harder to get  more support. There's nothing that binds us right now to accept the UAW as our  union, even if they are the central figure in decertifying the CEA. While there  is a strong feeling in our office that we should be unionized and be  represented by professional people, I can't say whether that feeling extends to  the UAW specifically."  </P> <P> If the UAW's organizing drive succeeds in San Diego County, local public  defenders would form a unit that would be affiliated with UAW Local 635, the  international union's and District 65's bargaining agent for its legal service  members.  </P> <P> District 65 was founded as the Distributive Workers of America, which was a  textile union in the 1930s, and later was affiliated with the Hospital Workers  Union in New York City. Its name is a leftover from the old Congress of  Industrial Organization's practice of giving charter numbers to its member  unions. District 65 was the 65th charter given by the congress. The union  affiliated itself with the UAW in 1980 and has concentrated its efforts in  organizing the legal services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Petition May Be Challenged  </P> <P> The UAW's Skotnes said the public defenders may be able to sever their ties to  the CEA by early next year. However, CEA sources, who requested anonymity, said  the association was planning to challenge the UAW petition by arguing that it  was filed in an untimely manner. If the CEA position is upheld by a hearing  officer, the UAW would have to wait another year before it could petition  again.  </P> <P> "The CEA is not an appropriate bargaining unit for them to be in," Skotnes  said. "They have to sever into a smaller unit with a clearer community of  interest where they could bargain appropriately."  </P> <P> However, in some counties where the UAW and Teamsters have attempted to  organize attorneys in the public sector, the unions' detractors have succeeded  in keeping them out by arguing that lawyers and auto workers really do not have  much in common.  </P> <P> Such was the case in Tulare County, where both the UAW and Teamsters lost out  to the local county employees association. Tulare County Deputy Dist. Atty.  Bill Yoshimoto said that earlier this year prosecutors and public defenders  debated whether to join the UAW as a single bargaining unit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Teamsters Court Attorneys  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Teamsters have been courting both groups since 1978, he said.  </P> <P> "Together, we are a small organization of about 45 lawyers," Yoshimoto said.  "We've been concerned for years because we are such a small group represented  by our association, and we kind of get lost in the shuffle during the  bargaining talks.  </P> <P> "But then the question was asked, 'What do we as lawyers have to do with the  UAW? What do we have in common?' " Yoshimoto asked. "But the UAW has a number  of different organizations under their umbrella. There is a point to be made  about solidarity."  </P> <P> Crowle, the San Diego organizer, and Warshawsky, the Solano County public  defender, said they see nothing wrong with being represented by unions that are  more closely identified with blue-collar workers.  </P> <P> "It is precisely their blue-collar concerns that made us interested in them. We  feel that their concerns, combined with our professional concerns, are a  legitimate representation of our clients' needs," Crowle said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ties With Truckers  </P> <P> Warshawsky, noting that public defenders usually represent poor defendants,  said lawyers in his office never worried about "being lumped in with truck  drivers" when they signed with the Teamsters.  </P> <P> "The attorneys in this office feel there is a blue-collar essence to this  place. . . . We see ourselves as county workers," Warshawsky said.  </P> <P> Solano County represents the Teamsters' only victory in California in the  union's drive to organize public-sector attorneys. The Teamsters succeeded in  organizing about 36 public defenders and 40 deputy district attorneys into a  single bargaining unit, where the UAW failed.  </P> <P> "The Teamsters are the labor organization as far as I'm concerned," Warshawsky  said. "They're established and have strength. . . . The thing we didn't want to  do is to go with a union that when push came to shove would tell us, 'We did  our best. We're sorry.' We felt that the Teamsters by virtue of their strength  were in a position to push back and back us realistically."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unions Target Public Sector  </P> <P> Dan Mitchell, director of the UCLA Institute of Industrial Relations, said that  unions are looking for new members among professionals in the public sector  because "that is a more fertile field." He noted that the UAW lost an important  election in July at the Nissan automotive plant in Tennessee, where auto  workers voted to keep the union out.  </P> <P> "Unions have been doing poorly in the private sector, but have been more than  holding their own in the public sector," Mitchell said. "If you're a union  official, you tend to look to the public sector. The climate is more receptive  there."  </P> <P> He said that public-sector employees such as lawyers are becoming more and more  receptive to unions because they are becoming increasingly concerned about  working conditions and reductions in benefits.  </P> <P> "Most studies that have compared the impact of unions in the private and public  sectors show that unions have had a much bigger impact in the private sector,"  Mitchell said. "Working conditions are better, and pay and benefits are much  larger in the private sector where unions have organized workers.  </P> <P> "This may explain why the public sector is no longer as resistant to  unionization."  </P></p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: Markets positive amid better omens on growth US financial markets seemed almost unnaturally calm in the approach to yesterday's presidential election. For the markets, President George Bush is a known quantity, while they have also had plenty of time to get used to the idea of a Bill Clinton presidency. The generally positive mood on Wall Street also reflects the slightly better tone of some recent economic reports. The 2.7 per cent economic growth reported for the third quarter overstated the economy's momentum and appeared to come too late to give President Bush's campaign much of a lift; but it was nevertheless better than expected. The news this week that the Purchasing Managers' Index moved back above 50 per cent last month, signalling a mild expansion of manufacturing industry, was also seen as a good omen. But economic clouds continued to mar hopes of better times. Figures yesterday showed a 0.3 per cent decline in the official index of leading economic indicators in September, a blow after a decline of similar magnitude in August. Officials said the index of coincident indicators, designed to measure the current state of the economy, was even weaker and would have fallen 0.8 per cent in September but for distortions caused by Hurricane Andrew. The behaviour of financial markets in the final weeks of the election campaign has been entirely logical. As polling day neared, share prices and the dollar either held their ground or strengthened, while bond prices weakened steadily. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 9.73 points yesterday to 3,252.48. The traditionally pro-Republican stock markets have approached the possibility of a President Clinton with surprising equanimity. When the Democratic challenger retained his big lead in the polls after the Republican convention in August investors began scrambling to prepare for a Clinton victory. Stocks expected to benefit from higher government spending and stronger economic growth rose, while stocks likely to suffer from increased government regulation or higher taxes fell. The overall result was mixed and by mid-autumn a Democratic triumph was fully priced into equities. The market ultimately concluded that President Clinton would be moderately bullish for stocks as he would do more to boost the economy in 1993 than would a second-term President Bush. The Republicans' late surge in the polls at the end of October had little impact on equities. If anything, prices weakened as the market grew jittery because an element of uncertainty had been introduced. The dollar, meanwhile, drew strength from the polls showing a likely Clinton win, because under the Democrats economic growth would be expected to gather pace and interest rates would be expected to rise. The prospect of higher interest rates under a Clinton presidency, however, partly explains why the bond markets have performed so poorly during the final weeks of the campaign. Many investors in government securities fear that a Democrat-controlled White House and Congress would mean three things: rising interest rates, rising inflation, and a widening budget deficit. The fears are predicated on an aggressive fiscal stimulus during the first few months of a Clinton presidency. However, some close advisers to Mr Clinton, such as Mr Robert Shapiro, have repeatedly denied that any fiscal stimulus is planned. 'The mood is one of hope,' said Mr Stephen Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank. 'Markets are willing to give a new president a chance.' He predicted a brief honeymoon period for such an incoming administration. 'The next test for the market will be the new economic appointees and the detailed policy proposals for next year.' Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities, was more cautious. 'The stockmarket has yet to come to grips with the rise in long bond yields in recent weeks.' Unless the fiscal roots of bond markets fears were addressed by a new Clinton administration, higher long-term rates would impair the recovery next year.</p>

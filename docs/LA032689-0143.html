			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A priest and nine other anti-nuclear activists were arrested at the Nevada Test  Site in the town of Mercury after conducting religious ceremonies at a former  chapel on the top-secret nuclear compound. Department of Energy spokesman Jim  Boyer said 10 demonstrators, including some clergy members, were cited for  penetrating the testing grounds -- a more serious offense than simple  trespassing -- and transported to the jail in nearby Beatty. The incident was  part of an annual Easter demonstration called the Lenten Desert Experience,  sponsored by the group Nevada Desert Experience, which is opposed to nuclear  weapons testing and the proliferation of the arms race. Boyer said there was no  breach of classified security. The test site, about 65 miles northwest of Las  Vegas, is the center of the nation's nuclear weapons testing program.  </P></p>

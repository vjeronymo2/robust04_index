			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Holderbank improves 49% HOLDERBANK, the leading Swiss international cement group, reports net income in 1992 up 49 per cent to SFr376m (Dollars 247m) on sales up 18 per cent to SFr7.8bn, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Full details will be provided on May 4. Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman, said in November that Latin American subsidiaries were performing very strongly. Losses in the US, which had caused a 12.5 per cent slide in group profits in 1991, were expected to remain high in 1992. ***** Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, suffered a sharp fall in net profits to FFr130m (Dollars 23.4m) in 1992 from FFr233m in 1991, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The group was hit by the sluggish state of the global luxury goods market and a FFr40m loss on the launch of a new skin care range. This may aggravate the political row over its FFr3.6bn acquisition earlier this year by Elf-Sanofi, a subsidiary of Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group. YSL turnover slipped to FFr3.0bn from FFr3.01bn in 1991 but operating profits declined to FFr379m from FFr512m over the same period. The group was also affected by the impact of the rationalisation of its licensing interests and of its perfume business, where it reduced sales to certain countries to counter the threat of the grey market, or discount sector. ***** Asarco, a leading US integrated copper producer, said it would report a loss in the first quarter as a result of depressed metals prices and problems with flooding at one of its Arizona mines, writes Laurie Morse from Chicago. The company estimated that the effect of heavy rains and flooding would cost about Dollars 20m after taxes. Asarco will report those charges in the first quarter. Asarco's Ray mine has been plagued by above-normal rainfall since mid-1992, reducing copper production by 10,000 tonnes in the first quarter. Metals refining processes in areas near the mine were also adversely affected.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEMATECH NOT IDEAL MODEL, STUDY SUGGESTS  </P> <P> Sematech, a government-funded consortium formed to enhance the U.S.  semiconductor industry, has been successful so far but should not necessarily  be used as a role model for other industries, according to a new government  study.  </P> <P> The report, prepared by the Commerce Department and issued by the Pentagon,  generally praises the work of the 2-year-old consortium, whose members are  charged with the task of developing technologies needed to produce  sophisticated semiconductors. The Bush Administration has recommended  continuing Sematech's $100-million annual government funding next year, an  amount matched by the 14 member companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on Conditions  </P> <P> The report notes, however, that the set of conditions working in favor of  Sematech may not exist for other technologies. In recent months, a sort of  "consortium fever" has spread through high-tech industries, with cooperative  ventures being discussed for the development of high-definition television,  opto-electronics and superconductivity, among others.  </P> <P> "Sematech has a lot of things going for it that might not be present in other  cases," said Jeffrey L. Mayer, the report's author and deputy director of the  Commerce Department's Office of Economic Policy.  </P> <P> Among other things, Sematech benefits from participation by leading firms in  the industry, including International Business Machines Corp., and enjoys wide  support among experts who believe that semiconductor know-how is essential to  U.S. economic and military strength. It not only has a set of research problems  common to all its members, but the problems are far enough removed from  commercialization that firms can cooperate in the laboratory while still  competing in the marketplace, the report concludes.  </P> <P> The report also notes the tensions that can develop as Sematech's members --  most of them large firms with worldwide operations -- forge ties with foreign  competitors. Last December, for example, Texas Instruments Inc. caused a stir  when it agreed to work with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan to develop a certain type of  semiconductor.  </P></p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: All-round increases help FKI rise to Pounds 22m IMPROVED performances from all five divisions helped FKI, the electrical engineering group, to a 41 per cent rise to Pounds 22.1m in pre-tax profits for the six months to end-September. Mr Jeff Whalley, chairman, said yesterday the figures showed the management's ability to deliver improved results 'even in difficult conditions.' The profits improvement, up from last time's Pounds 15.6m, was achieved on turnover ahead some Pounds 62m at Pounds 394m. Exchange rate movements accounted for Pounds 1.8m of the profits increase and most of the increase in turnover. Earnings per share rose from 2.56p to 3.52p and the interim dividend is raised from 1.2p to 1.5p. The shares closed up 5 1/2 p yesterday at 183 1/2 p. Mr Whalley said the group had continued with its strategy of raising margins while turnover was expected to remain steady. The average margin rose to 6.5 per cent in the half from a previous 5.5 per cent, and he expected to hit the target of 10 per cent in 1995. A further Pounds 3m was spent on restructuring in the half, and another Pounds 3m would be spent in the second half. By the end of the year the number of people employed by the group would be below 11,000, compared with 13,500 three years ago. The group operates through five divisions - hardware, materials handling, automotive, engineering and process control. The first three operate primarily in the US, which accounted for 53.6 per cent of group profits in the half, against 39.5 per cent last time. The materials handling division boosted operating profits by 83 per cent from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 8.2m on turnover of Pounds 98.3m (Pounds 82m). The group attributed the rise to aggressive cost cutting, the discontinuation of unprofitable lines and productivity gains. The decline in orders from British Coal had hit orders in the UK, but this had been anticipated and the group had won an order to China. The automotive division lifted operating profits from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 1.7m following a rationalisation programme in North America. Difficult market conditions in Europe had been offset by North American demand. Operating profits in the hardware division rose to Pounds 7.9m (Pounds 6.7m). On November 5 the group completed the Pounds 66.5m cash acquisition of Truth, the US manufacturer of hinges, operating and locking mechanisms for windows and doors. Mr Bob Beeston, chief executive, described the acquisition as 'very exciting', and predicted a strong contribution to profits next year. Gearing at the end of the half was 20 per cent (24 per cent). The Truth buy lifted it to 58 per cent, but 50 per cent was expected by the year end. COMMENT FKI is delivering exactly what it set out to do when the new management team took over last year - to boost the group's profitability on flat turnover. This has been achieved through increased prices, production improvements and well focused capital expenditure. The business is now generating a lot of cash. Margins continue to improve, and while a target of 10 per cent by 1995 looks a shade optimistic, no-one would now be surprised if the target was hit. The acquisition of Truth could add as much as 1p to earnings per share next year. An earnings forecast of 8p per share for the year gives the company a p/e of 22.5. This might look justified now, but the group will need to tread carefully along the acquisition path.</p>

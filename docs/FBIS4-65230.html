			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The results of a poll by the Hellenic  Research House on behalf of the CIVITAS A.E. company, conducted  from 30 March to 12 April among 925 individuals in the Athens  area, appeared in the 29 April Athens daily TA NEA, along with a  commentary by D. Dhasenakis. According to poll results, a  majority of respondents (89 percent) agreed with the statement  that "our country is going through a period filled with  dangers," while only 11 percent disagreed, with figures cutting  across party lines. When asked whether Greece "gained from the  European Union (EU)," 23 percent agreed, 30 percent rather  agreed, 19 percent rather disagreed, 18 percent disagreed, and 9  percent did not know. According to Dhasenakis, of those who  agreed, 70 percent belong to the New Democracy (ND) and to  Political Spring. When queried whether "Europeans are  anti-Greek," 36 percent fully agreed and 28 percent rather  agreed, compared to 17 percent who rather disagreed, 12 percent  who disagreed, and 7 percent who did not know. The majority of  those who agreed support the Panhellenic Socialist Movement  (PASOK) and Political Spring.    Suspicion of foreigners surfaced also in the response to the  statement that "foreigners do not understand us in national  issues," as 84 percent of the respondents agreed. Nevertheless,  65 percent disagreed with the statement that "Greece is strong  and needs no one."    Another question asked whether "there should be less  government intervention in the economy." Some 57 percent agreed,  while 32 percent did not. It is noteworthy, Dhasenakis points  out, that according to poll results, majorities expressing  reservations on the role of the state exist across party lines,  and even in the Left.    When the statement "tax evasion is not stealing" was put to  the respondents, 8 percent agreed with it, 8 percent rather  agreed, 16 percent rather disagreed, 63 percent disagreed, and 5  percent did not know. Dhasenakis reports that most of those who  tolerate tax evasion said they had voted for Political Spring  (19 percent) and for the ND (20 percent). He adds that no  Communist Party (KKE) voter agreed with the statement. Finally,  the poll also showed that 43 percent of Athenians believe that  "pulling strings is a necessary evil."</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann shelves venture with TCI Bertelsmann Music, part of the German Bertlesmann media group, has shelved plans to launch a music video and home-shopping cable-TV channel with Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the biggest cable system operator in the US, AP-DJ reports from New York. The companies had planned to launch the service later this year in direct competition with Viacom's MTV channel. Several large music industry companies, including the music divisions of Sony, Time Warner, Thorn EMI and Polygram, subsequently announced plans to launch a music channel. New regulations have led cable companies to cut revenue forecasts and some are trimming plans for new channels. TCI and Bertelsmann dropped plans for their music and shopping channel due to 'changing market conditions' Bertelsmann said. The companies were continuing to discuss other possible ventures, it added. Bertelsmann Music's revenues rose to Dollars 3bn last year from Dollars 2.7bn in 1992.</p>

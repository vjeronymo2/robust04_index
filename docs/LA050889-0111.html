			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ACCOUNTING OF B-2 PROGRAM URGED  </P> <P> The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said today that recent data  on the B-2 stealth bomber indicates that the cost of the program may have risen  to about $75 billion.  </P> <P> Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said the estimated cost may have risen by about $17  billion over the last two years, and he urged Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to  declassify as much information as possible on the program to build  radar-evading bombers.  </P> <P> "A straightforward accounting of the B-2's cost, schedule, capabilities and  management would contribute to the program's creditability and accountability,"  Aspin said in a two-page letter to Cheney.  </P></p>

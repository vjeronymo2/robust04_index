			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species is listed as endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for this species. Such a determination would result in no known benefit to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delissea undulata.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The extant population is on State land; State government agencies can be alerted to the presence of the plant without the publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps. The publication of such descriptions and maps would potentially increase the degree of threats from taking or vandalism because a live specimen of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be of interest to curiosity seekers or collectors of rare plants. Taking prohibitions are difficult to enforce, and publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps would make  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> more vulnerable to taking and increase enforcement problems. All involved parties and landowners have been notified of the importance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of the species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process. There are no known Federal activities within the currently known habitat of this species. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent at this time, because such designation would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely to aid in the conservation of this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing results in public awareness and conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations, and individuals. Harold L. Lyon Arboretum of the University of Hawaii at Manoa is propagating seeds collected from the one remaining individual as part of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex situ  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> conservation program. The Arboretum has over 300 seedlings growing as part of this conservation program, and has sent approximately 20 individuals to the State's Hawaii forestry district for experimental outplanting in the Puu Waawaa area (Charles H. Lamoureux, Harold L. Lyon Arboretum at University of Hawaii and J. Giffin, pers. comms.). The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Since  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delissea undulata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is known to occur on State land, cooperation between Federal and State agencies is necessary to provide for its conservation. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7 of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. No Federal involvement is known or anticipated that would affect  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as the only known site is on State owned land.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and its implementing regulations set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. undulata.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, remove and reduce to possession an endangered plant species from areas under Federal jurisdiction, maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction, or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered plants under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes and to enhance the propagation and survival of the species. It is anticipated that few trade permits would ever be sought or issued because the species is uncommon in cultivation and is very rare in the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503) 231&hyph;6131 .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly are sought concerning:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

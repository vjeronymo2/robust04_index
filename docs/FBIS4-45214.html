			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] More than a thousand porters are being used by  the Burmese army in fighting against Khun Sa's Shan forces,  according to porters who recently escaped to the border of  northern Chiang Mai province.    The porters fled three days ago to the Thai border through  the jungle from Mong Kyawt, the base north of Piang Luang  recaptured a week ago by Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army Forces.    One of the porters, a Burmese construction worker from  Rangoon, said he had been captured in the street in Keng Tung  two months earlier and was then trucked with 80 others to work  for the State Law and Order Restoration Council's (Slorc)  Battalion 245 at Mong Kyawt.    He said Battalion 245 alone was using about 150 porters. An  estimated 10 battalions have been deployed by the Slorc in the  Mong Kyawt area.    Two of the porters, Shan farmers, had been captured only a  week previously from their homes in Mong Hsat, 100 km northeast  of Mong Kyawt. They said new groups of porters were being  trucked in from different parts of Shan State.    The porters were made to carry heavy loads of ammunition and  rice for the soldiers. They described how soldiers beat those  unable to carry on walking.    "Four porters in my group died of diarrhea," said one  porter.  "I thought I would die if I did not escape." The porters had  run away at night. Their clothes were ragged and they had cuts  and sores from running through the jungle. [passage omitted]</p>

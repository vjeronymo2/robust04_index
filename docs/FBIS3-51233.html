			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] According to Philippe Reinhard's article  in the 3 January Paris center-right daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS,  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's most delicate task for 1994  will be dealing with Jacques Chirac, leader of Balladur's own  party, the Rally for the Republic (RPR), in a probable race for  the succession to President Francois Mitterrand in 1995. In the  "inevitable" struggle that will ensue, Chirac enjoys two  important advantages, says Reinhard. He can count on a devoted  political apparatus and, unlike a Balladur busy with day-to-day  problems and bound by his own promise to postpone the opening of  the presidential debate, he enjoys greater freedom of movement.  For his part, Balladur does not lack trump cards, Reinhard  continues. The prime minister is already considered a candidate  by a number of political personalities of the parliamentary  majority and enjoys popular support, as indicated in a series of  polls. However, the outcome of a race is undecided, Reinhard  points out. Both men must take into account those who prefer to  wait--like Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe--and those  "lurking in the background," such as Union for French Democracy  (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who hopes that a  Chirac-Balladur confrontation will open a "window of  opportunity" for himself.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Memories: A recent tour of Vietnam brought back some unpleasant memories for  actress Audrey Hepburn and strengthened her resolve to increase her efforts on  behalf of UNICEF. As a teen-ager in Holland at the end of World War II, she  learned firsthand about foraging for food and the difference international help  can make. "I was one of the thousands of kids who got packages of food and  medicine to take home from the Red Cross, UNICEF and CARE," she said.  </P> <P> Up and Coming: Zang Toi was pronounced winner of the third annual Mouton-Cadet  Young Designers Award during a gala Thursday night at the Fashion Institute of  Technology in New York. Toi, 29, who specializes in "classics with an  unexpected twist," was back on the job the next day and surrounded by so many  congratulatory floral arrangements "it feels like a wedding," he said. Toi's  award-winning sportswear and evening wear are carried by I. Magnin and Fred  Hayman in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> A Bum Trip: Author Ken Kesey ("One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest") may be on a  ride to nowhere as he and a few members of the old Merry Pranksters head for  Washington, D.C., in a new version of the psychedelic bus Further, made famous  in Tom Wolfe's "Electric Kool-Aid Acid Trip." Kesey said he plans to donate the  bus to the Smithsonian Institute, an idea that got a cool reception from  institute spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs. "The current bus he is using is not  even close to the original," she said. "Even if it were, the Smithsonian is not  interested in a replica."  </P> <P> Woe to You, Too: Jackie Gordon is spending the next 30 days in the Tulsa,  Okla., jail because a judge disagrees with the Isabella, Mo., woman's  interpretation of the Bible. Citing Luke 11:45 ("Woe to you also, lawyers!"),  Gordon refuses to pay an attorney who helped her win custody of her  granddaughter. The question now is whether she will pay the $500 fine that went  along with the jail sentence.  </P></p>

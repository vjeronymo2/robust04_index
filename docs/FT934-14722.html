			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / IBM offshoot in mainframe drive THE UK subsidiary of International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, is spending Pounds 3m over the next 18 months on a campaign to persuade top executives that mainframe computers have a future. Sales of mainframes, costing Pounds 1m or more, have been steadily declining for years. IBM UK has been particularly hard hit, losing more than Pounds 600m in 1992. Mr Arthur Parker, director of the UK company's mainframe division, said the decline in mainframe revenues had been halted. IBM's profitability depends, however, on customers finding new uses for mainframes. The campaign aims to persuade executives that mainframes have a role in future systems. A survey, commissioned by IBM and carried out by Cranfield School of Management, concludes that chief executives believe mainframes are essential but unexciting. It says: 'Chief executives feel far less intimidated by information technology than they used to. As a result, they demand more from their systems, want commercial solutions, not 'products' and want the focus set firmly on end users.' Companies have recently been buying networks of smaller computers, which may cost more to run, rather than mainframes. No Man is an Island. From Emma Silver at IBM on 0345-898898. Pounds 15.</p>

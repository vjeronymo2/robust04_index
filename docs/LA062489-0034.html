			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOCA NO FUN?  </P> <P> I am offended by Atkinson's characterization of the music of Mel Powell.  According to Atkinson, "Powell writes the sort of horribly dissonant music that  should be confined to bad horror films." In my opinion, a critic who writes  that sort of horribly ignorant review should himself be confined -- to musical  matters that will not unduly tax his meager mind and minimalist ears.  </P> <P> DAVID RAKSIN  </P> <P> Adjunct Professor  </P> <P> Music and Public Administration  </P> <P> USC  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A drug trafficking group that transports marijuana  and cocaine from southern Mexico to cities bordering Texas has  extended its Mafia execution arm to Nuevo Leon, where five  people have been murdered.    Of the six apparent narcotrafficker murders in 1993, five  occurred in municipalities located close to highways and places  where Federal Judicial Police [PJF] had previously discovered  shipments of tons of marijuana.    The bodies of the murdered men were found in the towns of  China, General Bravo, Cadereyta, and Santiago. Another murder  took place in Mina, and according to investigations by the State  Judicial Police, the suspects in that crime are linked to the  murders in China and Cadereyta.    The Monterrey-Reynosa Highway is toll-free, and the PGR  [Attorney General's Office] has seized tons of marijuana there.  It is also a place where drug traffickers have "settled  accounts" several times. Drugs coming from Oaxaca and Michoacan  States usually go to Reynosa, Matamoros, or Ciudad Mier.    The PJF got involved in drug trafficking activities in 1993  when Commander Jorge Guzman Torres, aided by "godmothers"  ["madrinas"], kidnapped Lauro Gonzalez Garcia. Police  identified the kidnapped man as a drug trafficker, and he paid  federal agents 200,000 new pesos for his release.    The PGR has confiscated shipments of tons of marijuana on  the  highway between China and General Bravo and in country houses in  Cadereyta and Ciudad Benito Juarez.    The PGR actions, which led to the confiscation of almost 5  tons of marijuana, have taken place a few days before or after  the body of a murdered man has been found.    Merchants Gaspar de Jesus Sandoval Rodriguez and Martin  Garcia Rodriguez, alias El Guero Martin, were executed in  January. The following month, the PGR seized 2.376 tons of  marijuana in two actions.    On 9 February, just seven days after finding the body of  Garcia Rodriguez, alias El Guero Martin, the PJF seized a ton of  marijuana in a tractor-trailer operated by two people. The PJF  also found 1.376 tons of marijuana in a house on the San Isidro  de Cadereyta estate on 20 February. They also arrested two men  who were loading the drugs into a Suburban.    On 28 February, Lauro Gonzalez Garcia, suspected of  executing  Sandoval Rodriguez, was kidnapped by PJF Commander Guzman Torres  with the complicity of "godmother" Cuauhtemoc Labastida Salazar.  The association between the PJF and the drug traffickers ended  when Gonzalez Garcia paid 200,000 new pesos for his release.    Lawyer Octavio Leal Moncada and physician Javier Salinas  Perez are said to be suspects in the death of Garcia Rodriguez,  alias El Guero Martin, for alleged joint business transactions.  However, Leal Moncada told a Prosecutor's Office investigator  that Garcia Rodriguez was his friend, and the physician asserted  that the murdered man owed him 700,000 new pesos. During a  special operation, the PJF unsuccessfully attempted to arrest  Labastida Salazar, who was accompanied by Leal Moncada at the  time, in his house in Colonia Las Brisas. The "godmother" and  the lawyer are currently fugitives.    Although the PGR arrested in January 1994 two alleged  members  of a drug trafficking band in General Bravo, they were  investigated as members of a marijuana and gunrunning group in  June 1993.    This month, Francisco Garcia Martinez, an employee of Angel  Avila Neri, came to EL NORTE to personally report that the PGR  is persecuting his boss and three other people.    The PGR established that Avila Neri was a ringleader whose  accomplices included Jose Santos Rodriguez Cantu, alias La  Pinina; brothers Martin and Jorge Arizpe Gonzalez; Jesus Antonio  Gutierrez Gonzalez, alias El Zurdo; Juan Aguilar Gonzalez; and  "Lalo" Solis.    On 9 August, Margarito Hernandez was murdered in Cadereyta,  allegedly by Horacio Montelongo Salinas, during a discussion  over drug debts. The alleged killer is the brother of Jose Luis  Montelongo Salinas, a suspected drug trafficker who was later  murdered in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Jose Luis Montelongo was  also a suspect in the murder of Gaspar de Jesus Sandoval  Rodriguez.    Almost a month after Margarita Hernandez's murder, the PGR  confiscated half a ton of marijuana that they found buried in a  trench in a Colonia Monte Bello house in Ciudad Benito Juarez.    Two other important actions carried out between 6 and 9  November resulted in the seizure of 2.565 tons of marijuana; the  first in Ciudad Benito Juarez and the other on a train heading  for Matamoros.    Five days later there were two murders; one in General Bravo  and another in Santiago.    The PJF found 396 kg of marijuana in the cellar of a house  in  Colonia Lomas del Solo in Ciudad Benito Juarez on 6 November.  The PJF went to the house because two women reported the  presence of the drug when they were arrested with a shipment of  168 kg of marijuana in their vehicle.    On 9 November, the PJF seized two tons of marijuana in a  train boxcar.    Those confiscations presaged the murder of Abel Salazar  Martinez, who was found in General Bravo on 14 November. He had  disappeared from his home in Weslaco, Texas on 8 November.    Fifteen days later, the body of Jaime Enrique Lopez Castillo  was found at the 13-km marker of Santiago-Juarez Highway near  the La Boca Dam. Lopes Castillo had also been murdered.    The year 1993 ended with a "war" among alleged drug  traffickers and a "settling of accounts" in General Bravo.    The homes of Jose Santos Rodriguez Cantu, alias La Pinina,  and Martin Arizpe Gonzalez were strafed by AK-47 rifle fire.  The Caballito de Mar Restaurant, owned by Angel Avila Neri, is  also bullet riddled.    Fourteen days after the attacks in General Bravo, the PJF  arrested two alleged members of the Avila Neri band that had  been under investigation since June 1993.    Juan Jose Cantu Gonzalez and Raul Gutierrez Gonzalez were  presented as members of the "Jabali guerrilla commando, which  was planning terrorist actions in Nuevo Leon.    Later the PGR retracted and said they were only drug  traffickers and gunrunners.    The Sixth District Judge ordered Gutierrez Gonzalez' release  as he believed him innocent of storing weapons and cartridges  and of illegally possessing and transporting marijuana with the  intent to take it out of the country.  <H5>  Houses searched </H5>   The PGR continued its investigations in the state to  discover  the drug network headed by Matamoros Cartel chief Juan Garcia  Abrego.    A special PJF group has searched several houses and country  homes in Monterrey in the past months to find evidence against  the partners of the so-called drug capo.    The state PGR delegation also wants to identify the safe  houses and the marijuana and cocaine distribution centers.    So far, the searches have not resulted in the arrest of any  of the alleged drug traffickers. Several people whose houses  where searched assert that they have no ties with Garcia Abrego.</p>

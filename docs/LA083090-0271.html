			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> TOURING RETROSPECTIVE EXAMINES CHICANO ART  </P> <P> For some, the Chicano movement came and went. For others it is alive and  gaining strength. But one of its enduring manifestations are the artworks, from  pencil drawings to murals, which arose from the late 1960s to mid-1970s and  beyond.  </P> <P> "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985" (CARA) will chronicle the  movement through art in its premiere exhibition at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery  from Sept. 9 through Dec. 9.  </P> <P> Chicanos such as Luis Jimenez, Mel Casas, Judith F. Baca, Carmen Lomas-Garza  and John Valadez will be among the 90 artists featured in the exhibit, along  with group installations showcasing pieces by ASCO, Los Four and The Royal  Chicano Air Force.  </P> <P> The exhibit, held in conjunction with the Los Angeles Festival, is one of the  largest assemblages ever of Chicano artworks, with 130 paintings, drawings,  posters, sculptures, photographs and murals.  </P> <P> "(CARA) will prove to be an informational, educational tool so that people  understand that Chicano art is a viable and very strong force within American  art -- that is, the United States and Latin America," said Teresa McKenna, CARA  executive committee member and a professor of English at USC.  </P> <P> Chicano art is CARA's focus because "Hispanic usually refers to a  conglomeration of Hispanic cultures, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and other Hispanic  cultures," said CARA assistant publicist Lindsey Haley.  </P> <P> "Latino also carries that kind of large connotation, whereas Chicano is a term  that was developed during the Chicano movement to reflect the political  attitude of affirmation," Haley said.  </P> <P> Organizers of the $1-million project met with 50 artists, authors and Chicano  activists in 1985 to form the "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation" theme.  </P> <P> "It's a process of self-definition. We tried to give artists and members of the  Chicano community a chance to define who they are," said Wight Gallery curator  Elizabeth Shepherd.  </P> <P> The CARA theme "has to do with the history of the Southwest, and the notion of  resistance and affirmation has to do with culture, as well as politics. It has  to do with the affirmation of one's culture in the face of political change,"  McKenna said.  </P> <P> "Chicano art is not that different from the so-called mainstream," according to  Margarita Nieto, a professor of Chicano Studies at Cal State Northridge who has  written on art for the past 14 years. "It has a bite to it, an aggressiveness .  . . a vitality that comes from this confrontation, living on-the-edge feeling  that is much a part of the aesthetics of contemporary art."  </P> <P> Exhibits will be divided into sections including the pre-movement; la causa:  farm workers; cultural icons; civil liberties; urban images; regional  expressions; Chicana feminist visions, and redefining American art.  </P> <P> A sampling of more than 40 murals from throughout the country will be shown in  a large-scale slide presentation along with a videotape to show each mural in  its social and geographical context.  </P> <P> On Sept. 9, a special program, "Dia Para Los Angeles," will be held from noon  to 5 p.m. The free activities will include speakers, music, dance, children's  theater and bilingual tours of the exhibition.  </P> <P> After the three-month stay in Los Angeles, CARA will travel to Denver,  Albuquerque, Tucson, San Francisco, Fresno, Washington, Madrid and Mexico City  over the next three years.  </P> <P>  Admission to the Wight Art Gallery exhibit is free. Open Tuesdays 11 a.m. to 8  p.m. and Wednesdays through Sundays 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Closed Mondays and  holidays. Docent tours will be conducted in English and Spanish. Parking ($4)  via UCLA entrance at 405 Hilgard Ave.; (213) 825-9345.  </P> <P> </P></p>

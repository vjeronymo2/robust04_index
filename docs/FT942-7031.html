			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Corrupt ex-MoD official is jailed A former director of the Ministry of Defence munitions procurement department - who was paid Pounds 1.3m in illegal backhanders by foreign arms companies - was jailed for a total of four years yesterday. In Britain's biggest cash corruption case, Mr Gordon Foxley, 69, also had assets worth more than Pounds 1.5m confiscated at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London. Judge Andrew Brooks said various factors had prevented him from passing a six-year sentence, including Mr Foxley's work record and the fact that he was likely to lose his MoD pension. Mr Foxley was found guilty last November of 12 counts of corruption between 1979 and 1984. His ill-health forced repeated sentence adjournments. The judge said he was satisfied that, when inflation was taken into account, Mr Foxley's benefit from his crimes was just over Pounds 2,092,500. Mr Foxley was given 18 months to meet the confiscation order or serve a further three years in prison.</p>

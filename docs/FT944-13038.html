			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / A convergence of cultures: Deutsche Bank's merger plans Deutsche Bank, Germany's leading commercial bank, has decided to show the banking world a more aggressive face. Few people in the financial world have doubted its muscle - it is a triple-A rated bank with assets of more than DM570bn (Pounds 232bn). But many have questioned whether the bank was prepared to use its strength to the utmost to carve out more business at home and abroad. Yesterday, Deutsche Bank served notice that it intended to become a more powerful force in investment banking worldwide by putting all its business in this competitive, fast-growing sector in London. This comes five years after it paid a generous Pounds 950m for Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank that forms a key part of this strategy. At the same time, the bank is acting in its domestic banking market to eliminate regional branch management layers, speed up decision-making and get closer to its German customers. What the bank is trying to do is maintain the benefits of its universal banking structure - combining the whole range of banking services under one corporate roof - while also moving deeper into the less familiar territory of investment banking, which specialises in the business of raising capital for companies and governments. If it is to succeed, the bank will have to meld two very different cultures. 'How a 175-year-old English institution operates is very different from a how a universal German bank operates,' says Mr John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell. Germany's universal banking tradition is nurtured on long relationships with corporate loan customers and reliable, risk-averse private savers, who put most of their money into fixed-interest deposits. Investment banking does not come easy to German bankers: German investors prefer bonds to shares, and much of the country's share capital is owned by banks and other companies. Innovations such as derivatives, though now commonplace, caught on slowly. Yet if the bank is to become the world financial force that Mr Hilmar Kopper, its chairman, feels is justified by its size and strength, it will have to make the effort. 'The bank has still not really punched its weight on the international scene,' says Mr Bryan Crossley, European banking analyst at Hoare Govett, the securities firm. 'This is a step towards doing so.' Mr Kopper makes no secret of the fact that one reason for the Morgan Grenfell purchase was to learn from the innovative, freewheeling Anglo-Saxon way of doing business. Germany's consensus-minded approach leads to consistency and quality. But it can be a handicap in rapidly evolving financial markets and new technology-based industries. Even so, Deutsche Bank is not proceeding with speed. The investment banking businesses of Deutsche and Morgan Grenfell will be integrated 'over time' and changes to the organisational structures will be 'evolutionary'. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank board member who will head its new investment banking board, said yesterday: 'What we are doing now is to start the process that will lead to the merger of the investment banking activities of Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell. There is no new legal entity as yet, but it will happen.' He hoped the merger would also provide valuable feedback to the non-investment banking operations of Deutsche Bank. 'We hope it will give Deutsche Bank another culture and help to speed up the other things we are doing.' The consensus approach to business has not been abandoned entirely. But 'Deutsche Bank is continuing to move on and we don't want to lose time', he adds. So why has it taken five years to start the integration of the two sides' investment banking activities? When Deutsche Bank acquired Morgan Grenfell in 1989, it was keen not to submerge the merchant bank's identity and demotivate its employees. A 40-page memorandum of understanding spelt out the operating agreement between them. With this history in mind, it is understandable that a move to integrate the investment banking operations has taken years to evolve. 'We're not putting factories together, but people,' says Mr Schmitz. 'We have to look after the whole thing as gently as handling a raw egg.' Even after mulling over the move for five years, the terms of the merger suggest both parties remain ambivalent about integration. The new investment banking operation will not carry the name of both organisations, but there is no agreement on what the name will be. Deutsche Bank has not committed any specific amount of additional capital to the operation, which it will surely need. Moreover, the expanded equities operations in London will be administered by Deutsche Bank's equities team. However, Mr Craven says it is likely the two firms will operate out of the same premises. According to Mr Michael Dobson, Morgan Grenfell's chief executive who will run the combined investment banking group, the main goal of integrating the investment banking businesses is to build a UK and international equities business capable of raising capital and selling shares around the world. Morgan Grenfell has concentrated its UK business on corporate advisory work, helping companies to devise strategies for raising capital and to complete mergers and acquisitions. It also has strengths in emerging markets, especially in trading third world debt. But when it comes to selling shares in the UK and internationally, Morgan Grenfell lacks the research, trading and sales teams necessary for it to become a world-class force, having abandoned these in 1988. Mr Craven concedes its shortcomings. 'There is no significant UK equity distribution and what we have internationally is very fragmented,' he says. Morgan Grenfell's competitors speculate the only way it will build a UK distribution network will be to buy a stockbroking firm. However, Mr Craven says the group has 'no concrete plans for filling the gap' in its UK distribution network. The merged operation will be able to draw on distribution capacity in Germany, Australia, the Far East and to a lesser degree, in the US and on the Continent through subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell. However, these units have operated independently of each other, hindering Morgan Grenfell's ability to sell large blocks of shares worldwide. The integrated model that Deutsche Bank now says it is prepared to follow has been adopted by the most successful investment bankers. 'Deutsche Bank is finding the Goldman Sachses and the Morgan Stanleys of this world coming into their own backyard,' says the head of corporate finance at a rival. US and UK banks have perfected the integrated model that blends the underwriting, research, sales and trading functions with corporate advisory business. 'Morgan Grenfell's great strength has always been its ability to identify clients who will do a lot of business with it over the years,' says one London-based corporate financier. 'And they have been very good at executing deals. But this move shows the value that investment banks will have to place on distribution.' The question, some of Morgan Grenfell's competitors say, is whether it has delayed the move to integration too long.</p>

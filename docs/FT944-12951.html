			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wedding doubt My daughter has a certain amount of personal equity and is about to marry a person with few resources. How can she can arrange her finances so that, if her marriage fails, she does not lose capital in any settlement? Your daughter and her fiance could enter a pre-nuptial contract providing that, if the marriage ends in divorce or separation, her capital would not be able to be shared. Such contracts are not strictly legally enforceable, but any court would take its contents into account. There is, also, the possibility of effecting a settlement by which your daughter would transfer property from her ownership to those of trustees, although this might well be impractical because of the expenses involved and the small amount of property. At the end of the day, though, marriage has to be a matter of trust and, if there is the slightest doubt, the general advice would have to be - 'don't]' (Reply by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

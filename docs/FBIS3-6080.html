			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government is currently racking its brains for  devising measures to open Japan's markets to U.S. products. On  10 March, it decided to review Japanese business practices and  the keiretsu system of interlocking corporate groups -- which  have drawn severe criticism from foreign countries -- looking  for possible measures to reduce Japan's trade surplus.    A "distribution and market opening division" is to be  established under the Administrative Reform Promotion  Headquarters to discuss deregulatory measures which can produce  immediate effects. The government plans to ask the division to  discuss business practices and review them. This idea has  already been approved by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  has been conveyed to each ministry as the prime minister's plan.    According to a government source, the government decided to  review business practices because: 1) the United States has not  been satisfied with the measures that Japan has worked out to  cut its trade surplus, and the government has faced difficulties  formulating measures to open markets in priority trade areas,  such as autos and auto parts, which resulted in the breakup of  the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks; and 2) Japanese business  practices lie behind arguments that "Japan is different from  other countries" and behind U.S. demands for Japan to set  numerical targets, as well as its impatient actions toward  imposing sanctions on Japan.    The government is worried that the United States and other  countries might intensify their criticism that "Japan's trade  surplus is aggravating the world's employment situation" through  a G-7 job summit scheduled in Detroit this month and a Naples  summit in July.    The distribution and market opening division, which will be  inaugurated at the end of March, is to review business practices  and the keiretsu system. Specifically, it will review keiretsu  transactions among interconnected business groups and groups in  which banks form the central elements. Also, it will discuss  group boycotting, a practice in which a group of companies  prevent newcomers from entering their markets, as well as  collusive bidding practices in tenders for public works  projects. The division is expected to reach a conclusion before  the Naples summit.</p>

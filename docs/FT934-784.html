			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Growth in US revised upward The US economy grew slightly more briskly in the third quarter of this year than had been previously thought, Reuter reports from Washington. The reason, said the Commerce Department, was businesses stepped up production of goods for inventories. Third quarter gross domestic product was valued at Dollars 5,140bn. In a second and final look at national output during the third quarter, the department said GDP expanded at a 2.9 per cent annual rate instead of 2.7 per cent as earlier estimated. Though third-quarter growth was modest, it eclipsed increases of 0.8 and 1.9 per cent in the first and second quarters. Consumer spending was strong, helping set the stage for a much firmer closing quarter this year. Damaging floods in the Midwest and drought in the southeast cut about 0.6 percentage point from third quarter growth by destroying crops. But a rebound in the fourth quarter for agricultural production will add about 0.4 of a percentage point to fourth quarter output, department officials said. The key reason for the upward revision in third quarter growth was that businesses added about Dollars 2.7bn more goods to their inventories than previously estimated. Inflation was restrained in the third quarter with the implicit price deflator rising at a 1.6 per cent rate, the same as reckoned earlier, and the GDP fixed-weight index up 2.1 per cent instead of 2.2 per cent. The department said Americans saved just Dollars 0.038 out of each dollar of income in the third quarter, close to the lowest level since 1950. Consumer spending rose by Dollars 36.9bn in the quarter after Dollars 28.9bn in the previous quarter. Non-farm businesses boosted their inventories by Dollars 19.4bn in the third quarter instead of by Dollars 16.7bn as estimated previously. Foreign trade faded in the third quarter. Net exports - the difference between foreign sales and imports - decreased by Dollars 11.1bn after falling Dollars 15.3bn in the second quarter.</p>

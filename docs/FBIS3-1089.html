The minister of state for foreign affairs,  Chief Anthony Ani, said in an interview in Abuja that if it  became necessary as part of a peaceful resolution of the  dispute, Nigeria might give it a thought. He, however, added  that a referendum was not necessary to establish the citizenship  of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The minister emphasized  that 90 percent of them were Efik-speaking Nigerians.</p>

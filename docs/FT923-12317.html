			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Link to European resignation denied MR Pier Carlo Falotti, who resigned on Friday as president of Digital Equipment's European operations, will succeed Ms Sandra Kurtzig as chief executive officer of ASK, a US software group.  Mr Falotti's resignation, a day after the announcement of Mr Kenneth Olsen's retirement as president of Digital, prompted speculation that the two events were linked.  According to Digital however, Mr Falotti's resignation was planned before Mr Olsen's retirement was made known.</p>

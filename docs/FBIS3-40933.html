"Ukraine will carry out its obligations and will not stand  in  the way of nuclear disarmament," Kravchuk told a press  conference on Wednesday after talks with U.S. President Bill  Clinton.    The U.S. President stressed that the Ukrainian decision to  become nuclear free opens wide prospects for it in getting  economic aid from various international financial institutions.    The "Partnership for Peace" plan provides Ukraine with a  possibility to cooperate with the armed forces of the United  States and NATO which will also promote Ukrainian security,  according to Clinton.    The agreement will enhance the security of the three parties  and the entire world, Clinton said.    Kravchuk thanked the U.S. President for his active promotion  of cooperation between the two countries.</p>

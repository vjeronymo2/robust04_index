			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Conflict of interest? MY EMPLOYER has never had its own pension scheme but has always had an arrangement that, if an employee pays up to 10 per cent of his gross salary into any reputable private scheme, the company would reimburse half the payment through payroll. Recently, a director who is in charge of recruitment has insisted that new employees direct their pension payments through a broker based in a small West Sussex town. This director lives in the same small town. As we have a desperately high rate of unemployment in our particular industry, new employees are accepting this condition, but with extremely bad grace. Is this action legal, or ethical? Can a director interfere in private schemes this way? Although we cannot be certain from the facts in your letter there is a possibility that your director and/or the broker may be in breach of the Financial Services Act, particularly if the director either has a financial interest in the broking firm or is receiving some form of benefit (such as a share of commission, corresponding rebate on his personal business, etc). Thus, there might be some merit in drawing this matter to the attention of the appropriate regulatory body. The broker's letterhead should state the regulatory body to which he belongs (eg, FIMBRA). If you or any of your colleagues has dealt with an independent financial adviser, you should ask him to raise this apparent malpractice with the regulatory body and request an explanation. He should be able to do this as a matter of public concern on a no-names basis - ie, without having to embarrass any of you. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

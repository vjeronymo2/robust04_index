			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Treasury reshuffle targets efficiency: Changes signal intent to focus on wealth creation The Treasury has launched its most sweeping reorganisation for a decade in a bid to improve management efficiency and counter criticism that it is out of touch with the business world. The moves, announced yesterday, will give more responsibilities to relatively junior officials and set up a new directorate to handle policies affecting industry, including education and employment. Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, will link more closely with officials lower down the department who will report directly to him. The shift, to take effect next month, is intended to make the Treasury more receptive to events outside Whitehall. It is the strongest signal yet from the government's most powerful department that it intends to change its culture to focus more on wealth creation. The changes come after criticism from industrialists and non-government economists in recent years that the Treasury has developed too few contacts with the business world and has been slow to react to outside events. In particular, critics have said the department failed to wake up early enough to the seriousness of the recession, and also to sense the pressures on sterling prior to Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism 15 months ago. Sir Terry has spent the past 18 months refining ways to reform the Treasury's management. He has recently been working with Ms Wendy Pritchard, a management consultant, on ways to alter the department's culture. The biggest element of the change is the regrouping of the Treasury's financial services and industry divisions into one directorate under Mr Steve Robson, a high-flying Treasury official currently in charge of industry policies. Mr Robson will take charge of the Treasury's responsibilities for supervising financial institutions, and also for policies to help industry work more effectively. Such 'supply side' policies include ways to attract more private-sector involvement into large projects normally funded by the government. On the same deputy-secretary level as Mr Robson will be three other officials who cover civil-service pay and management, public services, and fiscal and monetary policy. As part of the reshuffle, two of the Treasury's current deputy secretaries - Ms Rachel Lomax, in charge of financial institutions, and Mr Huw Evans, number two to Sir Nigel Wicks in overseas affairs - are moving to new jobs and are not being replaced. Ms Lomax is to become economic adviser at the Cabinet Office while Mr Evans is to become the UK's representative at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Mr Brian Fox is moving to the Cabinet Office from his current Treasury job as head of establishments and organisation.</p>

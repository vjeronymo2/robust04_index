			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Bad news guys MISS LEE, my executive assistant, was in fine form on New Year's eve. We put on paper hats, lit the pink candles, and had partridge and raspberries. Then we repaired to the sitting room, to await the chimes of midnight. To pass the time, I fossicked through a book about multiple universes. Apparently there is an infinity of universes. They pop out of nothing. While I was wrestling with all this, Miss Lee had picked up a copy of The Journalist's Handbook which was lying around, and was flicking through it impatiently. She was looking particularly beautiful: a smart type of frock, Pounds 400 shoes, hair nicely twirled, endearing crimson lipstick. She started to laugh throatily. I asked about the cause. Miss Lee said: 'I am reading an article by this creature Peter Fiddick which poses the question: 'Can a 24-hour rolling news service on the BBC be justified? Is there enough news?' Fiddick has his doubts. Regales us with them lumpenly. In the limpest way imaginable, he wonders whether there is enough news to sustain listeners' interest on a round-the-clock basis. 'What this creature doesn't realise is that most of humanity's problems can be ascribed to an excess of media. There are far too many journalists, all of them battening leech-like on what is a finite supply of news. It is my opinion, Michael, that most of our problems in 1992 were exacerbated by the media - not exactly caused by them but fanned and enflamed out of all proportion. 'Take John Major and Norman Lamont. Perfectly decent men who have been ridiculed for doing their best to wrestle with problems not of their making. How can Major and Lamont be held responsible for German foolhardiness or the global debt splurge? 'Or take the royal family. Look how the Queen and her hapless children were singled out in 1992 for remorseless persecution. All families have their problems. That is only human nature. But when Windsor Castle burned to the ground, the media gloated - virtually suggested she rebuild it herself. When the Queen offered to pay income tax, the media speculated on the scale of her liabilities. When her children's marriages encountered minor difficulties, the media snooped and eavesdropped and hounded them unforgivably. 'If you examine the world's problems in 1992, you will see that most of them were local difficulties that would have blown over if the media hadn't latched on to them. When real news dries up, they feast on each another. Look at the attention paid this week to Britain's commercial television network. Who cares a matchstick for ITV? It is a haven for minor talent. It is there to sell dog food. End of story. 'Or take the tabloid press. Anyone with four brain cells knows that the tabloids are written and commissioned by menopausal men with severe sexual hang-ups and chips on their shoulders. So let them get on with it. If the quality newspapers would deny the tabloids the oxygen of publicity, the tabloids would soon be read only by inmates of prisons and people in the Navy. There are far too many newspapers. Britain could easily get by with one pink broadsheet and one white broadsheet.' 'But which white broadsheet?' I asked. 'Certainly not The Times. I used to be fond of it. Its last editor had knocked it into shape. But then along comes this Peter Stothard creature. Swans in from nowhere. Fires two dozen journalists. Tosses the whole thing in the air and rearranges it so that none of us can find our favourite columnists or features. There is an interview in here' - she brandished The Journalist's Handbook - 'in which this creature seeks to justify his actions, but he doesn't fool me. What could be his problem?' 'Insecurity,' I said. 'You must remember, Miss Lee, that Stothard is a Murdoch editor. Can you imagine what hoops of ice constricted his brain and heart when Murdoch rang him from LA and appointed him editor? Must have been a nightmare. He deserves our deepest sympathy.' Suddenly I felt maudlin. The clock was close to midnight. 'This is a weary, wracked planet, Miss Lee. We must learn to hold our tongues, learn to stay our hands. Our planet is bleeding. It is crying for our sympathy. We are alone in the universe. We must love one another. Let us start with this Stothard creature and take it from there.'</p>

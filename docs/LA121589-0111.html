			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJERUS CRITICAL BUT STABLE AFTER BYPASS SURGERY  </P> <P> Utah basketball Coach Rick Majerus underwent coronary bypass surgery for more  than five hours Thursday and was listed in critical but stable condition.  </P> <P> "He came through the surgery very well," LDS Hospital spokesman Tim Madden  said. "His surgeon expects a normal recovery and a normal resumption of  activities."  </P> <P> Majerus, 41, received seven bypasses, and the amount of time spent on the  operating table was normal for heart surgery, according to doctors.  </P> <P> Majerus experienced chest pains after a game against Purdue two weeks ago, and  his condition was considered serious enough to require open-heart surgery.  Before the operation, Majerus said that assistant Joe Cravens would lead the  Utes (4-2) for the remainder of the season.  </P></p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: MG sees big future as integrated copper producer - Metallgesellschaft's plans to rejoin the ranks of the world's metal-producing giants Metallgesellschaft of Germany is about to take a big leap towards its goal of becoming an integrated, global copper producer. By 1998 it should be producing about 800,000 tonnes of the metal from mines and smelters on three continents. That represents about 9 per cent of present western world annual output. This is the message Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch has been sending to the rest of the metals industry. As chairman of MG's executive board he set the strategy in motion. It will not be long, he says, before MG will be back among the world's metal-producing giants. Yet only eight years ago its presence in the business had shrunk to the point where it was producing mainly zinc and only in Germany. MG has chosen to expand mainly in copper because, Mr Schimmelbusch suggests, there should be no shortage of demand as developing countries in Asia, South America and eastern Europe put electric lighting into homes and make improvements to their infrastructure and communications facilities. But copper companies need their own smelting operations, he says. Shortages of smelting capacity will continue even though a good proportion of new copper mines will produce the metal by solvent extraction-electrowinning technology, which does away with the need for smelting. The present world recession has only temporarily eased the copper smelting 'bottleneck', he insists, and many of the smelters in the Commonwealth of Independent States, which also helped the easing process, will soon shut permanently when the mines that supply them run out of ore. In these circumstances, any banker asked to put money into a copper mine first wants to know what arrangements are being made to treat the concentrate, the intermediate material which goes to the smelters. The banks are comforted if the mining company has its own smelting capacity, Mr Schimmelbusch points out. MG reconsidered its corporate strategy in 1985 and decided to stay in mining and metals production but to build those operations into a global business. The first overt indication of this new approach came two years later when MG put its remaining foreign mining interests into a new company, Metall Mining (MM), based in Toronto, which was quickly floated on the local stock exchange. 'It was not really a company, ' recalls Mr Schimmelbusch, who is also chairman of MM. 'It just had a few assets and a plan. We were selling a concept.' MM moved into copper production early in 1989 when it paid about Dollars 85m for the Copper Range mining company in White Pine, Michigan, which had an underground mine, smelter and an up-to-date refinery. More recently MM opportunistically snapped up Minnova, a Canadian mining company, in two bites totalling about USDollars 200m. Minnova's juiciest asset is the Izok Lake project, which has a geological ore reserve of 13.6m tonnes with an average of 14.6 per cent zinc and 2.5 per cent copper. The big drawback is that Izok Lake is in the far north of Canada, 300km north of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories. Now MG is proposing that MM should buy its European copper smelting and refining operations, the most important of which is 35 per cent of Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg, one of Europe's largest, operated by MG and described by Mr Schimmelbusch as the most efficient and cleanest in the world. There is also 40 per cent of the Brixlegg secondary (scrap) copper smelter in Austria. If this deal goes through - it is being carefully vetted by UK merchant bank NM Rothschild on MM's behalf - all MG's copper eggs will be in one basket. Mr Schimmelbusch says the decision to switch the European assets to MM was linked with events at the Copper Range mine. MM has been struggling hard to bring down production costs there - the cash costs were reduced last year from 94 US cents a lb in 1991 to 82 cents. It also needs to spend about Dollars 6.5m to bring Copper Range's smelter into compliance with new US air quality standards. This stimulated some innovative thinking that resulted in a scheme to leach copper out of the pillars left behind to hold up the roof during underground mining. MM reckons there are 200m tonnes of ore containing 4bn lb of copper in the pillars and this summer it was finally concluded that the metal could be removed by in situ leaching at very low cost. Various permits have still to be obtained but leach production might start at 40m to 50m lb a year and rise to 90m lb eventually, which would dramatically reduce Copper Range's average production costs. Leaching consumes large quantities of sulphuric acid, a by-product of copper smelting. The quantities of acid needed would make it worthwhile to enlarge the present smelter at Copper Range or build a new one - the preferred choice, because it would be more efficient and less-polluting. However, it would also necessitate an expansion of the refinery. Nevertheless, the case for a new larger, cleaner smelter at Copper Range is a strong one, particularly as there are already permits for the site. Norddeutsche in Germany would be able to supply essential operating know-how if it was part of the MM 'family' - it would not want to pass on the information to a rival, however. A formal link between MM and Norddeutsche would also benefit the Hamburg refinery by providing another source of concentrates and an outlet for the sulphuric acid it generates. Finding customers for sulphuric acid is becoming one of the smelting industry's biggest headaches. Last year MM's copper production, from Copper Range and its minority investments in other companies, was about 109,000 tonnes. In order to reach the 800,000 level quickly it will need more mine capacity. Mr Schimmelbusch says MM does indeed plan to buy a large copper mining project. He gives no clue as to the location, however, and is equally evasive about another important topic - whether MG's 55 per cent share of a proposed copper smelter in Indonesia will also go to MM - as would seem logical. Mr Schimmelbusch is convinced a go-ahead will soon be given for the Indonesian smelter, in which Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold, owner of the huge Ertsberg/Grasberg mine in the highlands of Irian Jaya, would have a 20 per cent shareholding. He is also convinced that MG would not have won permission for the smelter without being able to show what had been achieved at Norddeutsche in Germany. 'Developing countries don't want to compromise, they want the best technology available.' What will be the cost of all this - new smelter, enlarged refinery, new mine and purchase of the European assets - to MM? Mr Schimmelbusch will give no hint. However, Mr Michael Brown, analyst at Toronto stockbroker McLean McCarthy, part of the Deutsche Bank group, says the total could range between CDollars 1.1bn and CDollars 1.3bn. MM might have to find CDollars 600m of new equity towards this. But MM is well-financed and in a position to finance its expansion, says Mr Brown, particularly if it is willing to sell its 14 per cent stake in MIM, the Australian resources group, which has a present market value of about CDollars 385m. He also suggests that the issue of MM shares to MG might take the German group's stake from the present 60 per cent to 69 per cent and that MG might sell down some of that holding. But MG will want to keep control, as Mr Schimmelbusch makes clear. He says: 'Metall Mining will continue to be one of our core businesses.'</p>

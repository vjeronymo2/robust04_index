			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Lookers shares leap as profits treble to Pounds 5m Shares in Lookers leapt 31p to 229p yesterday as the Manchester-based motor dealer announced pre-tax profits more than trebled in the year to September 30. Profits expanded from Pounds 1.63m to Pounds 5.01m on turnover up from Pounds 332.7m to Pounds 363.3m. Mr William Martindale, chairman, said that the main engine of growth was the increased level of new and used cars sales in the volume car segment. The agricultural division continued to recover strongly, he added, since the devaluation of the green pound. Lookers' sales of new cars - at about 17,500 - represented a 20 per cent advance over last time: this in turn was 8 percentage points higher than the national increase of 12 per cent. Sales of used cars - at about 15,000 - represented a rise of 14 per cent over last time. Mr Martindale said that in the case of both new and used cars, margins had risen. He said that his salespeople had 'worked really hard' and that there had been many promotions to achieve the sales. Further, the group had managed to prevent the overhead level rising. Car prices would not rise in the UK, said Mr Martindale, while the current competition persisted. With the Continent in recession, the UK was the only expanding car market and therefore was targeted by all manufacturers. Lookers has 10 Vauxhall franchises, and nine Rover. Among others, it also has four Nissan, three Ford, VAG, Renault and Toyota, and two Seat, Hyundai and Land Rover. The profit included a Pounds 452,000 surplus from the sale of 51 per cent of Lookers Planned Motoring, the contract hire business, to Woodchester Credit Lyonnais, Lookers' 29.8 per cent shareholder. Earnings vaulted to 12.3p (0.1p) per share and the final dividend is lifted to 4.5p (4.2p) for a 6.5p (6.2p) total.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- By the end of this  century, China will finish construction of a major  telecommunications network composed of 16 optical cable trunk  lines, which will cover all the provincial capitals and become  connected with the world's network. Minister of Posts &amp;  Telecommunications Wu Jichuan said today that the Ninth 5-Year  Plan (1996-2000) for telecommunications development has been  initially drafted. He said that in the new plan priority is  given to construction of long-distance optical cable networks.    According to major targets set in the plan, the ministry's  total business volume will have an annual average growth rate of  23.7 percent, while the annual average growth rate for its  business income will be 24.2 percent. Wu said that fulfillment  of the plan will bring the national telephone capacity from the  present 42 million lines up to 140 million lines, and the  national telephone availability rate will reach 8 percent, while  that for urban areas will reach 30-40 percent. In addition,  mobile telephones will cover all the country's large and  medium-sized cities, as well as most of the towns, basically  realizing national automatic roaming.    The ministry will establish its own air postal routes and  improve other postal facilities to shorten mail delivery time.  Meanwhile, computer networks will be established for EMS  [electronic mail system] inquiries, issuing of publications,  postal management, postal deposit and other business.    Posts and telecommunications have been experiencing the  fastest development among all the country's industries in the  past few years. Last year its growth rate reached 59 percent,  exceeding the development speed of the national economy for the  ninth successive year. An official from the ministry predicted  that this year the sector will maintain a development speed of  about 50 percent.    To ensure that the targets set in the plan be fulfilled, the  ministry has drafted a huge budget of 360 billion yuan for the  construction of posts and telecommunications infrastructures.  At present, China's telecommunications capacity ranks seventh  in the world; if all these targets are met, it will be able to  edge into the world's first three positions.</p>

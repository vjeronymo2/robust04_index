			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  SITE ON PARADE ROUTE SOLD FOR $11 MILLION  </P> <P> Members of the Pasadena Elks Lodge have agreed to sell a parking lot at a key  location along the Tournament of Roses parade route for almost $11 million,  lodge officials said.  </P> <P> The Ramser Development Co. said it will use the parcel near "perhaps the most  visible corner in the world" -- the intersection of Orange Grove and Colorado  boulevards -- for construction of a luxury hotel, commercial space and an  underground parking facility.  </P> <P> Lodge 672 said the land is just too valuable to continue using it as a parking  lot. Under terms of the proposed sale, the Elks and Ramser will continue to  rent television and seating rights at the property during future Tournament of  Roses parades.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lastenia Murillo Munoz] </F>   [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov  arrived in Panama yesterday at the invitation of the government  to strengthen ties of friendship and trade between the two  countries. Mamedov, who will remain in Panama two days, will  meet today with President Guillermo Endara and will later meet  with Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino. He will meet with the  local and foreign media tomorrow.    The Russian deputy foreign minister was met at Tocumen  International Airport by Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero  and members of the Russian Consulate. Alexis Ermaro, Russian  consul in Panama, said this is the first time a high-ranking  Russian Government official has visited Panama since the Soviet  Union was dissolved two years ago. Ermaro said the deputy  foreign minister will also meet with Panamanian businessmen to  study the benefits of trading with Panama.    The consul approved of Mamedov's visit because his  government  is mainly interested in the trade potential, given Panama's good  relations with the European markets. Likewise, he said the two  countries wish to establish technical, trade, and financial  cooperation to strengthen those relations. The diplomat did not  give details about the meetings or the topics that the Russian  authorities would discuss with the Panamanian authorities during  the two-day visit.    Trade relations between the two nations have gradually  developed after the Soviet Union disappeared.</p>

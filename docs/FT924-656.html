			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / BICC in optics tie with Japanese BICC, the UK cables manu-facturer, has formed a company with Furukawa Electric and Nippon Telegraph of Japan to make optical components for European telecommunications markets. The company, Europtics, will operate from Knowsley, Merseyside. About 30 people will be employed when it opens next September but more than 120 jobs are forecast by the end of 1995. The government announced regional assistance of Pounds 900,000 for the project yesterday. The companies are refusing to disclose the total value because of a commercial confidentiality agreement with the Japanese partners. BICC will have 51 per cent of Europtics, with 29 per cent for Furukawa and 20 per cent for Nippon. The project follows research by the companies into new markets for fibre-optic technology in subscriber access and telephone networks, video switching and computer processing systems. The factory will be the first in Europe to make MT connectors - a plastic moulded plug for joining optical-fibre ribbons, a fibre optics equivalent of the three-way connector for a household electrical socket. It enables several cables to be connected for about Pounds 25 as opposed to Pounds 125 for joining them up individually.</p>

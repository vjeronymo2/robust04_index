			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Smith hits out over tax 'waste' Mr John Smith, Labour leader, yesterday accused the prime minister of a 'grotesque waste of taxpayers' money' in employing outside consultants at a cost of more than Pounds 500m a year to produce savings of just Pounds 10m. The government reacted defensively to Labour's charges, which followed a report in the Financial Times on the findings of a Cabinet Office efficiency unit report which has yet to be published. Downing Street said the report had been commissioned because ministers were concerned about consultancy spending, but stressed that it was still not complete. Mr Alan Milburn, chairman of Labour's backbench treasury committee, published figures from ministerial answers showing that the transport department alone had spent almost Pounds 200m on consultants last year. The Scottish Office spent more than Pounds 100m and the Department of Trade and Industry more than Pounds 29m. During questions to the prime minister in the Commons, Mr Smith said families paying a big rise in taxes would 'bitterly resent this further example of this government's now legendary incompetence'. Mr Major said: 'If there was an intention to hide anything, perhaps you could explain why we established the scrutiny in the first place? It was precisely to determine that the expenditure is conducted properly. 'If it confirms that the expenditure is producing good results we will maintain it. If not we will make the changes required.' Earlier, Sir Robin Butler, head of the civil service, said that it was right for the government to investigate the value for money from spending 'very large sums' on consultancy. 'It is creditable that the government is doing this and that it will publish the results when it is completed,' he said.</p>

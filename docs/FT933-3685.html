			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / France on list for Mercedes plant FRANCE was identified by Mercedes-Benz at the weekend as the fourth short-listed production site for the German manufacturer's 200,000 units-a-year small car project. The others are the UK, the Czech Republic and Germany itself. The disclosure is certain to intensify rivalry among the short-listed countries to attract the prestigious project. In the UK 'there will be as many bids as there are local authorities that know about it', said a government official. He suggested the project 'will need development funding, so will have to go to a selective assistance area'. Senior Department of Trade and Industry officials in London would not comment on what stage the assessment process had reached and what role the DTI might be playing. However, the Northern Development Corporation, whose area includes the Nissan plant at Sunderland, said it had already responded to a DTI request made last week for details of potentially suitable 250-300-acre sites in its area. The west Midlands, Merseyside and north and south Wales are expected to be among the front-runners in the UK for the project. Welsh development agency officials were at the weekend shedding no light on their involvement. However, they are likely to be encouraged in their own bid for the venture by the recent rapid growth of the motor components industry in Wales.</p>

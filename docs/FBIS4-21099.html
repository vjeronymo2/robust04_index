This "phenomenal social vice" has only developed over the past  three years, mainly among the new ethnic minority settlers  migrating from Cao Bang. Hundreds of households are now living  in destitute conditions because of opium addiction. In early  1994, Dac Lac set up a labor education center to help  rehabilitate drug addicts. Opium addiction is still on the rise,  though, and may spread quickly to local residents because the  number of immigrants from Cao Bang is growing fast.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [AZERTADZH report: "At the Center of Attention--Social </F> Protection"]    [Text] Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, has  conducted a meeting devoted to questions of increased social  protection for the population and a normalization of the  financial situation of the republic's economy. Senior officials  of the president's staff, the Supreme Council, and the Cabinet  of Ministers and the leaders of ministries, state committees,  companies, and banking and financial authorities took part in  the meeting.    The meeting's opening remarks were delivered by Geydar  Aliyev.    We are paying constant attention to the socioeconomic  problems of the republic, the president observed, although we  are having to devote a large amount of time to matters connected  with the war. Sometimes, therefore, problems of the  socioeconomic sphere are not being resolved quickly enough, at  times, because the instructions that are issued are not  fulfilled in good time. But we consider the solution of these  questions a most important task and we will continue to work in  earnest in this direction. The development of the socioeconomic  sphere, Geydar Aliyev emphasized, is our strategic course and  the path toward a strengthening of the country's independence  and the increased well-being of the people.    Tasks of socioeconomic development are being tackled  together  with the shaping of a free market economy and the creation of  extensive opportunities for enterprise and business initiative,  the president went on to say, and the measures that are being  adopted are designed, primarily, to serve the interests of the  people and are targeted at an improvement in the social position  of all strata of the population.    Having announced that the leadership of the republic was  preparing for the implementation of a number of steps in this  direction, Geydar Aliyev expressed the opinion that they should  be discussed in advance and invited the participants in the  meeting to embark on this discussion.    Vakhid Akhundov, state counselor for economic policy,  described the principal measures that it was planned  implementing for a resolution of problems of the socioeconomic  sphere and familiarized the participants in the meeting with a  draft presidential edict that had been prepared in this  connection.    Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council, Fikret  Yusifov, first deputy minister of finance, Tofik Azizov,  chairman of the Commission of the Supreme Council for Economic  Policy and general director of the Nord Research-Production  Association, Abdulla Melikaslanov, deputy president of the  National Bank, Chingiz Abdullayev, chairman of the board of the  Azerigazbank Industrial- Investment Bank, Rovshan Mustafayev,  rector of the Azerbaijan Constitutional Development and  International Relations Institute, Shokhret Vekilov, chief of  the Republic State Main Tax Inspectorate, Sayad Ibragimov, vice  president of the Azerbaijani Republic GNK [State Petroleum  Company], Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, Fazail Agamaliyev,  minister of labor and social protection of the populace, and  Asaf Nadirov, academic secretary of the Academy of Sciences,  took part in the discussion.    There was a wide-ranging exchange of opinions on the ways to  lower social tension and normalize the financial situation. It  was observed that whereas prices grew in the year approximately  14-fold, wages grew on average by a factor of 4.4. The  interruptions in the supply to the populace of bread and fuel  were discussed, and the opinion that a negative influence on the  state of affairs in the baking industry was being exerted by the  current big difference in the price of flour and the finished  product was expressed. The situation in the petroleum industry  has become extremely complicated, and the sector's debts have  risen by 10 billion manat.    The participants in the meeting agreed with the need for the  adoption of urgent measures to rectify the current situation. It  is necessary first and foremost, the speakers emphasized, to  increase the minimum wage and pensions paid to nonworking  retirees and the grants to students and trainees of  vocational-technical schools, to make provision for the payment  of supplementary compensation from the resources of the republic  budget for families whose per capita monthly income does not  exceed double the minimum wage, and to raise the price of bread  and energy, which should, in addition, be revised at least  quarterly and brought into line with the rate of inflation.    Proposals were heard concerning the suspension prior to the  end of the year of the construction of publicly funded  facilities, the cancellation of the decisions adopted earlier on  the allocation of soft loans to state-owned enterprises and  organizations, a reduction in the number of central organs of  administration and their employees, and a cutback on  administrative-managerial costs. It was proposed also to make  provision for the government's issue and sale of the requisite  quantity of securities in order to partially cover the budget  deficit and to switch from a tax-free system and tax exemptions  for individual categories of individuals and legal entities to a  system of payments of monetary compensation to the socially  unprotected strata of the populace.    Speaking of other measures pertaining to a solution of the  questions discussed, the participants in the meeting noted the  importance of increased supervision of the pricing of the  products and services of state-owned enterprises and  organizations, the need for an audit of the resources of the  entrepreneurs and other resources invested by state-owned  enterprises in the private sector, the establishment of a  precise delineation between republic and local budgets, and so  forth.    In the opinion of a number of speakers, a rise in the  minimum  wage not only would not lower but would, on the contrary,  increase the rate of inflation. To reduce it it is essential to  saturate the consumer market either by increasing production or,  temporarily, thanks to credit resources, thereby creating real  conditions for a lowering of prices.    Having dwelt on questions connected with a normalization of  the financial situation, the participants in the meeting  observed that the criminal machinations and exaggerations in  determination of the price of the dollar perpetrated by a number  of private banks are serious destabilizing factors in this  sphere. The president of Azerbaijan gave the necessary  instructions in this connection.    Having considered the proposed draft presidential edict, the  participants in the meetings were of the opinion that it should  be reworked with the participation of scientists and specialists.    The meeting was summed up by Geydar Aliyev, president of  Azerbaijan, who delivered an important speech.    Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council,  Fuad Guliyev, first deputy prime minister, State Counselors Arif  Ragimzade, Gabil Guseynli, and Idayat Orudzhev, Deputy Prime  Ministers Samed Sadykhov, Elchin Efendiyev, and Asker Mamedov,  and Rafael Allakhverdiyev, chief of the executive of the city of  Baku, took part in the meeting.</p>

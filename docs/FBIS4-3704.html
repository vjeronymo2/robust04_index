			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by President Husni Mubarak in response to questions </F> from unidentified correspondents following a visit to the  economic and technological development area in Beijing on 22  April-- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. President, how do you view  prospects for Egyptian-Chinese cooperation in the technological  fields?    [Mubarak] There is cooperation between Egypt and China in  many fields. I hope this cooperation will continue. China has  a great deal of potential and capabilities and we can benefit  from them. The similarity between Egypt and China in many  aspects calls on us to maintain that cooperation and enhance it.    China is a Third World country. It is a big state that has  strong determination. Everyone here must work; there is no room  here for empty talk. I admire the Chinese for their  determination to develop and progress. They see world progress  and work to develop themselves. The type of development we have  seen, in fields like journalism and communications, calls for  admiration. China is a Third World state and we have always  called for cooperation with it within the framework of  south-south cooperation.    [Correspondent] How can we benefit from China's experience  in  increasing rates of development while sustaining political,  economic, and social stability in the country in spite of the  huge population, and how can this experience benefit us in  economic reform and openness?    [Mubarak] You know that we always consult with China in the  areas of development. China's development rate might have been  very high. However, many disadvantages were involved. The  Chinese decided to reduce these rates. When the rates resulted  in very high standards, prices increased. A steep drop in these  rates involved a number of problems, too. They are trying to  determine the rate that suits the citizens most. This is  exactly what we are doing. They keep social justice and the  quality of the citizens' lives in mind. The same thing happens  with us. In all our actions, we must see how the citizen will  cope. Sometimes our citizens complain of increasing prices, but  [words indistinct] are unavoidable. Problems arise [words  indistinct] and it is the same with China.    [Correspondent] China is a nuclear state. What is the  Chinese stance on your call for making the Middle East free from  weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons?    [Mubarak] I am making this call. Being a nuclear state  itself, America is making the same call. Why should I talk  about America or China? Why should I get involved in such an  issue? All countries agree that the Middle East should be free  from nuclear and chemical weapons.    [Correspondent] What about the talks between Your Excellency  and the Chinese president?    [Mubarak] We have excellent relations with China. We are  linked by very strong ties. The first time I visited China was  on 17 April 1976, when I was vice president. As an Egyptian  citizen, I share the same problems with the Chinese citizens.    We talked with the Chinese president about all international  issues. We have almost the same views and have no differences  as to how to tackle international issues. China has supported  Arab rights in the Middle East issue from the outset. It has  adopted noble stances regarding the Arab nation, particularly  Egypt. Of course we discussed bilateral relations. I think  that scopes of cooperation are very wide. Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F> Young Democrats, by Attila Farkas; place and date not given:  "Party Interests Should Not Have Priority Over the Interests of  the Bourgeois Center"]    [Text] In our series with heads of various political  parties, Orban Viktor, chairman of the Federation of Young  Democrats [Fidesz], speaks about the chances of the liberal  center, including the chances of his party.    [Orban] I see the bloc of liberal parties to become  increasingly stronger, and I do not attribute importance to the  occasional excessive statements. The chairmen of the four  liberal parties agreed on the strategy to be followed until the  elections. From the experiences of presenting candidates, the  four parties representing the bourgeois center force came to the  conclusion that, together, they have a good chance to get more  than half of the mandates. Therefore, it has no sense to think  of a social-liberal coalition.    [Farkas] Have the chairmen of the four party agreed on this?    [Orban] The party chairmen agreed to use all their power to  gain 50 percent of the votes, and they are advancing to a  relevant political strategy. I do not know who denies what, but  I think that we need time for this position to infiltrate the  parties. The Fidesz is in an better position in the sense that  the party presidium decided on the political strategy to follow  on coalition matters before the four-party meeting, and this  strategy is identical with those of the four parties.    [Farkas] There is often suspicion coming from the Fidesz and  the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] that the SZDSZ is  approaching the socialists, while the other side is accusing you  of "flirting" with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. Could  this lead to a split between the two leading parties of the  liberal bloc?    [Orban] In principle, it could. But, in my opinion, this  debate is over now. In the course of our talks held last week,  we accepted the guidelines to be mutually followed and, in my  view, this satisfies both the Fidesz and the SZDSZ.    [Farkas] At the relevant news conference, the Agrarian  Federation, the Fidesz, and the Entrepreneurs' Party rejected  the ideas of excluding the social-liberal coalition, but later  SZDSZ leaders denied that this issue was on the agenda....    [Orban] Everyone says what he wants. Journalists were  present at that news conference and they were able to hear  everything; therefore, it is useless to make something out of  this after the event. We said everything at that news  conference and, in my opinion, the correct formulation was that  there is no longer sense in thinking about a social-liberal  coalition.    [Farkas] In your statements made in recent weeks, you  clearly excluded the possibility of a Fidesz-Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] coalition. It seems, however, that your scope of  maneuvering is smaller than that of your party. To what extent  is this opinion different from that of the leading bodies of the  Fidesz? Can one interpret this difference as a strategic split?    [Orban] This cannot be regarded as a strong difference, and  I do not intend to step in the background or to resign at all.  I have a clear opinion on how to solve Hungary's economic  crisis. I argue in favor of this opinion and I hope that I will  have a majority within the party.    [Farkas] What if the cooperation of the four liberal parties  does not work after all?    [Orban] I do not know. In my opinion, we have no other  choice, and this should be clear both to the SZDSZ and the  Fidesz, as well as to the other two parties. These parties got  into one camp not only through their identical programs but also  through their common political interests, because every other  form of cooperation only creates worse chances. This is  particularly sensitive regarding the SZDSZ and the Fidesz,  because these two parties were the most radical anti-communist  parties four years ago, and we confronted daily those people who  are still heading the MSZP. If we did this four years ago, it is  impossible to be with them in a coalition. One cannot make such  a turn, because the Hungarian public would not forgive us. This  is equal to a situation in which a party wipes itself off the  domestic political palette, and we must accept this.    [Farkas] It has often been said that "the four years have  been nice, we have learned a lot, but now we want to be part of  the government...." Do you see a chance for that? If not,  will the Fidesz be able to stand four more years in opposition?    [Orban] I see chances, and this originates from the fact  that the four bourgeois parties succeeded in presenting  candidates. Regarding the Fidesz, I think we are moving forward,  because we have gone through tests in the past four years, tests  that every party can only handle with difficulty.    [Farkas] On what do you base your optimism?    [Orban] Opinion polls and the gathering of nomination slips  show this. I think that the sympathy toward the policy  represented by us is increasing and our prestige in the society  is growing. We said last year that one should think in terms of  a liberal center, and not in terms of a social-liberal  coalition. We were accused a lot because of this, and we even  lost several battles, but winning the final battle is very near.  Now we must not fail and put party interests above the  interests of the bourgeois center....    [Farkas] A real war of messages has evolved between you and  Gyula Horn. It seems that you appear most frequently in the  declarations of the MSZP chairman, and not necessarily in a  positive light....    [Orban] This is not surprising. It was the same before.  After a temporary fallback, Gyula Horn and his party found their  old voice. Their voice resembles the tone flowing toward the  Fidesz in 1988 and 1989. They spoke to us so aggressively and  accusingly after 16 June 1989. In my opinion, every  manifestation of the MSZP, including their videoclips, tones,  and statements, speak about revenge, and this is their message  to everyone, and especially to us. This tone is not new; I got  used to this after 16 June 1989. The Fidesz did not get scared  at that time either; nor do we think that we will get scared now.</p>

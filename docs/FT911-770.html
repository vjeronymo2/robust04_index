			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Democratic seeds in the soil of absolute monarchy: The issue in Nepal's election is whether the multi-party system itself can work THERE are no issues in Nepal's first multi-party elections in 30 years, people say, except democracy itself. Twenty political parites have been holding public rallies and marches throughout the country to woo the 11.5m Nepalese eligible to vote on Sunday. Buses loaded with pretty girls and wired with loudspeakers blare forth folk music and campaign slogans as they canvass the tiny rural villages where most of Nepal's 18m people live. Politicians are promising everything from cash to land reform in exchange for votes. Yet, almost everyone agrees, the key election issue is whether democracy can take root in the soil of absolute monarchy. A year ago thousands marched through the streets of Nepal's cities in a popular call for a constitution to limit the power of the monarch, King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dez. After three months of protest, in which, according to official figures, 56 people died, the king agreed to a constitution involving a multi-party system and a reduction in his power from absolute ruler to constitutional monarch. An interim government was appointed in April last year representing the various constituencies of the pro-democracy movement. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, prime minister, led the 11-member coalition cabinet with four representatives from his Nepali Congress Party. Three cabinet members came from the United Left Front, representing Nepal's six communist party factions and one labour organisation. There are two palace representatives and two independents. Today there are 1,345 candidates and 20 political parties contesting the 205 seats in parliament. The largest party is the Congress Party which is contesting 204 seats. The Nepal Communist Party (United Marxist-Leninist) is contesting 177 while five other communist factions are competing for the remaining slots. Another political force is represented by two National Democratic Parties, reflecting the moneyed village council interests that have in effect kept power in the hands of the king. Most observers predict a slim majority for the Nepali Congress Party, which has strong backing from India. A US embassy official predicted that Congress would win 'a weak majority, if barely'. He expected the communists to get 20-30 per cent at the most. 'And, of course, the National Democratic parties will be able to mobilise their vassals.' The communist strength is in urban areas, while remote rural regions will probably keep the village council leaders in power. A shopkeeper in the village of Dhulikhel, for instance, watched as a helicopter carrying the prime minister circled overhead. 'We don't like him here. Go around to the villages and see how the people live. Then you will know why we don't like all those rich people from the Congress Party. This town is going to vote for the Cow.' The cow is the election symbol of the National Democratic (Thata) party, led by former Royalist prime minister Surya Bahadur Thata. If no single party wins an absolute majority, the Congress party is expected to form a coalition with the right-wing parties. 'The most likely coalition is one between Congress and Thata,' says Shyam Bahadur KC, editor in chief of Nepal's govenment-owned newspaper, The Rising Nepal. 'Thata has a soft spot for India as do the leaders of the Congress Party.' Nepal learned the importance of its link with India two years ago, when Delhi imposed a trade embargo to punish Nepal for purchasing arms from China. The nation barely survived for 15 months by rationing everything from petrol to salt. 'I will vote for Congress but not because I want to,' said Sunder Shrestha, a tailor from Katmandu, 'but Nepal has to face the fact that India is its neighbour. We learned what can happen when India cuts us off economically. For months I had no petrol or kerosene. China cannot help us, so we have no other choice. If Nepal goes communist, India will close our border again.' Nepal, with a per capita annual income of Dollars 170, is one of the poorest nations in the world. There is no foreign debt problem, but that is because loans come on the most concessional terms. In the 1989/90 and current fiscal year ending on July 14, foreign aid income has not lagged far behind total tax revenue. This dependence on foreign donors for funds and on Nepal's giant southern neighbour India for most essential goods allows little room for fiscal and monetary manoeuvre. There were pledges last year of nearly Dollars 1bn from Nepal's main donors, to be granted by July 1992. They include Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Britain and the US. Under the new constitution the king remains supreme commander of the armed forces and retains the right to declare a state of emergency. 'The army will not listen to anyone other than the king,' said Rishikesh Shaha, founder of the Human Rights Organisation of Nepal. 'He can do anything he likes. This is not a constitution by the people for the people. The king gave us this constitution. He can just as easily take it away.'</p>

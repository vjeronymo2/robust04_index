			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Political Notebook: Referendum herd runs risks of a stampede The herd instinct has always been one of the most powerful forces in politics. Nowhere is it stronger these days than in the Tory party. The debate about a referendum on the next steps towards European integration (whatever they might turn out to be) is a textbook case of how easily fashion can displace reason. It is fair to say that sometime in the next few years political imperatives  -whether party divisions or the mood in the country - might demand a direct test of the electorate's attitude to Europe. There are perfectly respectable intellectual reasons for occasional referendums. No one can doubt that a decision, say, to enter a single European currency would be one of constitutional moment. Nor should we be naive about the politics. The then Mr Harold Wilson used a referendum on Britain's membership of the then Common Market to prevent a schism in his Labour government. But the outcome - skilfully engineered by one of most politically astute prime ministers this century - served the country well. Of course there are drawbacks. The hangers and floggers who still inhabit the fringes of politics are forever looking for ways to mobilise the electorate's instincts for revenge. Any precedent for a plebiscite will do. Then there are the dreamers in the thinktanks. Unable to imagine a coherent model for a modern parliamentary system of government, they see referendums as a populist wheeze to redistribute political power. Press a button on your remote control and, hey presto, you have instant democracy. Apparently in the electronic age there is no need to worry about the tyranny of the majority. But back to the present debate in the Tory party. The idea of a referendum - whether on the 1996 intergovernmental conference or on a subsequent move to economic and monetary union - was born among the Eurosceptics. Now almost everyone wants one. Europhiles see a plebiscite as the way to mobilise the natural pro-European majority in the House of Commons across party divides. The 'phobes insist that it will tie Mr Major's hands at the 1996 intergovernmental conference. Failing that, it would ensure that any concessions made by Mr Major to the wicked federalists could be reversed by the voters. Finally, uncommitted Tory backbenchers - a dying breed - see the government heading for self-destruction. They venture that any straw is worth clutching at. The clamour is in inverse proportion to the logic of the proposition. Deciding now to have a referendum on a question that cannot yet be put is a recipe not for a truce but for a still more protracted civil war. The European Movement, home of the Tory Europhiles, has already fired the opening shots of its campaign to secure a Yes-to-anything vote. Mrs Teresa Gorman has done the same for the sceptics with the launch of a private member's bill demanding a referendum before 1996. The choices she offers as a test of public opinion - withdrawal from the EU, the full federal package (whatever that is), or a simple free trade relationship - are ample testimony to the difficulties of framing a useful question. One or two have not joined the stampede. Mr Kenneth Clarke, once again in powerful pro-European alliance with Mr Michael Heseltine, has applied the brakes to the shift in the prime minister's stance. The chancellor thinks the idea is barmy. The thoughtful among the sceptics - notably Mr Michael Portillo - share his doubts. The outcome of any referendum will depend more on the economic cycle and on the popularity of the government than on the merits of the argument. Nor it is likely that a Tory cabinet could be allowed the freedom of conscience that Mr Wilson gave his ministers in 1975. Mr Portillo understands that the promise of a referendum might strengthen rather than weaken the hands of the pro-European camp. Much better for the sceptics to nail Mr Major to a sufficiently minimalist line to ensure Britain agrees to nothing worth putting to the electorate. But most dangerously, the promise now of a referendum in the distant future would entrench the factionalism which has taken hold in the Tory party. It is already clear that Europe has become a convenient surrogate for a series of private wars on the Tory backbenches. The depth of antagonism between left and right, between pro- and anti-Europeans and between friends and enemies of the prime minister has become more important than the issues at stake. Principles have been buried in personal animosities. To find a voice in the Tory party these days it is essential to belong to one of these armed camps. The parallel with the factionalism that destroyed Labour's hopes of government in the early 1980s grows ever stronger. Pledging a referendum on Europe might buy Mr Major a breathing space. It will not be enough to halt the headlong rush of the Tory herd to the edge of a political cliff.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] The chief advisor to the Moldovan president, Viorel  Chubotaru, has tendered his resignation. In an interview with  INTERFAX, he motivated his decision by saying that as a result  of the recent parliamentary elections the Social Democratic  Party, which nominated him for the republican parliament did not  obtain the right to pursue its policy.    "As the head of the executive, the president cannot base his  moves on a representative of any political course which has  failed to receive the support of the majority of citizens,"  Chubotaru made clear.    Asked whether the parliamentary majority is able to  stabilize  the situation in the country, he pointed out that this depended  on how to understand the stabilization and what methods will be  used to achieve it. "We believe that the retention of  sovereignty by the republic's people is the main aspect of  Moldova's retention of independence as a state. This means  achieving an economic sovereignty, e.g. a possibility to pursue  an independent economic policy, free from pressure from  outside," Chubotaru was quoted as saying.    In his opinion, the new government's actions within the next  six months will not affect Moldova's relations with  international financial and economic institutions, in  particular, the implementation of a memorandum signed by the  Moldovan government, National Bank of Moldova, IMF and World  Bank for the period until July 1 1994.    Chubotaru believes that the state program for privatization  developed by the Social Democratic Party will not be drastically  amended within the next six months. At the same time, he did  not rule out the possibility of other than original  interpretations of the key provisions of the law and the  privatization program.</p>

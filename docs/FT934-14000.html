			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Mt Charlotte benefits from occupancy rate rise AN IMPROVEMENT in occupancy rates in the UK hotel industry is benefiting Mount Charlotte and could hasten its reflotation. This was revealed yesterday by Mr Bob Matthew, chairman of Brierley Investments of New Zealand, which owns 70 per cent of Mount Charlotte. He was speaking after the publication of the group's annual report. However, a float was not expected until 1995. Mr Robert Peel, Mount Charlotte's chief executive who remained in charge when BIL took the group over in 1990, said his preferred route was a flotation. He said there had been 'a material improvement in London occupancy in the last 12 weeks'. BIL said the rate had risen 11 percentage points over a year ago. Mr Peel said volumes in the provincial hotels were also up this year. The chain includes 102 hotels plus another 12 managed for other owners, totalling about 14,500 rooms. Of these, 24 hotels and 6,585 rooms were in London making it the largest chain in the capital. Mr Peel said that in the 1980s London occupancy rates were generally over 80 per cent but had fallen to the low 60s. Now they were in the mid-to-high 70s again. Bookings for next year suggested a considerable improvement for the first half. However, room rates were still under pressure, he said. Operational gearing in the business meant that a return to earlier occupancy rates could add Pounds 30m to pre-tax profits, he said. Mount Charlotte made a profit of Pounds 2.1m after tax in 1992, up from Pounds 1.5m in 1991. Mr Peel added that the market for hotels, which had been difficult and overhung by the number of hotels in the hands of receivers and by the troubles at Queens Moat Houses, was beginning to get easier. Queens Moat Houses, which is negotiating a refinancing, said yesterday that the upturn in UK occupancy levels it had noted at the annual meeting in August was continuing. Aside from a flotation of Mount Charlotte, other options include disposals of individual hotels, packages of hotels or a stake in the group. In 1991 BIL sold a 30 per cent holding to two Singaporean government agencies. Mr Rodney Price, who is to assume direct responsibility for BIL's UK assets when Mr Trevor Beyer retires next March, said a move could not have been contemplated until there was some pick up in the market. Now, he said, 'things are on the move, it is all positive for the industry, but the timing is still not right'. Mr Matthew said BIL had received a wide range of approaches. The time seemed to be approaching when more appropriate prices could be achieved, he added.</p>

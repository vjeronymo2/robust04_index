			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ARGENTINE ENSEMBLE OPENS MONDAY EVE CONCERTS  </P> <P> A deeply serious, ultimately stimulating encounter with new music from Latin  America launched the 52nd season of Monday Evening Concerts. Alicia Terzian and  her Grupo Encuentros de Musica Contemporanea de Buenos Aires offered six  intense, complementary pieces for a large, often restive crowd at the County  Museum of Art's Bing Theater.  </P> <P> But for all the drama, nervous energy and darkling mysteries of the program,  the performances remained surprisingly low in energy and self-effacing --  neatly done, to be sure, but almost demure in music that seemed to call for  extrovert flair.  </P> <P> What the group is capable of in the way of focused passion became fully  apparent only in the second part of the generous agenda. There, two potent,  evocative vocal works framed a devastating instrumental elegy, Luis Naon's  "Tango del Desamparo."  </P> <P> Snatches of taped bandoneon music suggesting Piazolla at his most mournful  provided a sonic and emotional context for the rich cello of Jorge Bergero and  pertinent, highly colored pianism of Claudio Espector.  </P> <P> Naon begins the piece as almost ritual storytelling -- narrated by Bergero --  of the "disappearance" of his brother during the 1976-83 Argentine military  dictatorship, but words soon fail to sustain the overwhelming despair, which  finds expression in lyrically yearning, fragmented and tonally skewed music.  </P> <P> The "Testimonial" of Aurelio de la Vega, a professor at Cal State Northridge,  is a taut song cycle on poems written by Armando Valladares while imprisoned in  Cuba. Three songs move from quiet doom to defiance, separated by two  instrumental interludes, the first a fey scherzo in memory of Ginastera and the  second a linearly dissected dirge given great poignancy by the quotation of a  Cuban song.  </P> <P> Marta Blanco made the vocal parts emerge naturally from the instrumental web,  as though the music were finding its inevitable, explicit voice. Her  soft-grained mezzo did not project quite as forcefully as might be desired, but  it blossomed easily in the swiftly reached final climax.  </P> <P> Terzian conducted the deft, well-balanced ensemble -- Espector, Bergero,  flutist Gabriel Sorin, clarinetist Oscar Baquedano and violinist Sergio  Polizzi.  </P> <P> The same group, minus the flute, also gave her a rapt, fluent performance of  her own "Voces," on fragmentary texts from poets ranging from Lorca through  Whitman to Tumanian.  </P> <P> The voices of the title appear on tape, questioned and extended by Blanco in  styles ranging from folklike chants to poignant pop intimations, with  distracting quasi-dramatic movement and mime. Again, she had trouble balancing  the amplified instruments.  </P> <P> Blanco's fearlessly dramatic abilities found more appropriate, though more  self-indulgent, work in Edgar Alandia's solo "Grito," interpreting lines from  Neruda in hoary agitprop style. Blanco rose from the floor, moaning in rags,  and ended back on the ground, as an earth mother delivering the anguished cry  of a repressed people.  </P> <P> Alejandro Iglesias Rossi's "Canto Viejo" is a moody instrumental evocation of  Quechuan ritual music, relying heavily on skillfully scored effects such as  multiphonics and under-the-string ponticello bowing. Terzian and company set it  out with poised deliberation.  </P> <P> The opening "Vox Faucibus Haesit" by Jose Luis Campana proved a cliched  exercise in amplified instrumental Angst, scratchy climaxes succeeding nebulous  aleatoric patches with little impact.  </P> <P> Grupo Encuentros offers a different program Thursday at the Campus Theatre of  Cal State Northridge.  </P></p>

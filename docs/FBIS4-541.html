			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports reaching us say that heavy fighting took  place yesterday in the areas of Mutara, Byumba, and Ruhengeri.    In the Mutara Zone, our forces inflicted heavy casualties on  government forces. Some of the government soldiers surrended to  our forces voluntarily. Many were taken as prisoners of war,  while others went into disarray. And in Kigali, Presidential  Guards fired heavy rockets at King Faysal Hospital killing 29  people and wounding 70 others. This took place on 10 April  1994, just two days ago.</p>

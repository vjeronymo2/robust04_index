			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Decision on Efim legal action expected next week FOREIGN bank creditors of Italy's Efim state holding company should know next week whether a majority has voted for legal action against the company, and, possibly, the Italian government. The vote followed a tense 3 1/2 -hour meeting of foreign bank creditors in London last week at which bankers were asked to consider various options, including legal action. The increased tension between foreign bank creditors, which provided about L3,500bn (Dollars 2.2bn) of Efim's total borrowings of about L8,800bn to financial institutions, follows mounting dissatisfaction among creditor banks at the failure to receive initial repayments, a year after Efim was put into voluntary liquidation. Shortly before initial repayments were due at the end of April, a representative of Mr Alberto Predieri, the special administrator running Efim, said the situation would be frozen until a dispute over swap contracts undertaken by Efim was resolved. The issue has since been overshadowed by the European Commission's refusal to approve the Italian government's repayment plans. However, one banker involved said: 'Even if the Commission gives its approval tomorrow, the Italians will not pay us back until the swaps are sorted out.' The dispute has incensed foreign bank creditors and raised a serious point of principle. Although only one transaction is involved, bankers are trying to reconstruct whether other transactions may be at risk. Last October, Bankers Trust terminated a swap contracted by Efim on the grounds of default. The previous month, it had informed Mr Predieri and the Italian Treasury that the conditions of the swap were not being respected, and that it could be terminated. The matter remained unnoticed until April, when officials from Mr Predieri's office told bankers no repayments would be made until the issue of the swap was resolved. Terminating the swap, believed to include foreign exchange and interest rate elements, affected Efim's finances because of last year's lira devaluation. Details of the transaction have not been revealed. However, termination has increased Efim's foreign exposure in lira terms. 'I don't think the sums we are talking about are at all large in comparison with the principal and interest due on Efim's debts,' said Mr John Reffell, a banker at Chase Manhattan in London, who is chairing the activities of the group of agent banks involved in Efim's foreign loans. 'It's a question of principle that's involved. You can't just demand that a swap be reinstated. That goes completely against market practice. The issue at stake is much broader than just Efim.' Bankers also argue the swaps were contracted independently of the loans. 'The banks involved in the loans are independent of the bank doing the swap. Moreover, the latter didn't necessarily swap the whole amount,' said one banker.</p>

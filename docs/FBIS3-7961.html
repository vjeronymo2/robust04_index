Conscious of the fact  that he has been militarily defeated in this former Yugoslav  republic, Franjo Tudjman is now offering the Muslim people a  federation with the Croats and a confederation with the Republic  of Croatia.    Although he does not care much for Muslims, he is doing this  because he is under pressure from the United States and is  hoping to create a military counterbalance to Serbia. At the  moment, for him, the alliance is the lesser of two evils.  Moreover, he was the one who flatly refused all proposals for a  Bosnian-Croatian union.    This was stated yesterday by Rasim Ljajic, head of the  Sandzak branch of the Party for Democratic Action [SDA], who  said that Tudjman was still counting on good relations with  Milosevic and the return of the lost territories in the Krajina.  Ljajic advised his compatriots in Bosnia to think before  entering into any kind of alliance with the Croats.</p>

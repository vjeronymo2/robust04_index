			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: RJB Mining RJB Mining cannot be accused of lack of ambition. If the group's bid for the bulk of British Coal is successful, it will have a turnover in excess of Pounds 1bn, which is not bad for a company that did not even exist three years ago. But the scale of RJB Mining's ambition is also a concern. The group will need to raise about Pounds 1.1bn to cover working capital, restoration and subsidence bonds, and the purchase itself. That is a lot of money for a company with a market capitalisation of Pounds 157m. A substantial share issue is needed as well as hefty borrowing. The question is whether the group can pay back the banks and then provide a decent return for shareholders. Competitors, whose bids were between 30 -50 per cent lower, believe not. Shareholders will be gambling that costs can be attacked more aggressively than hitherto, and that RJB Mining's predictions for coal demand and prices are not over-optimistic. The danger is that the group will not have paid down debt by 1998 when the guaranteed contracts with the electricity generators run out. If that happens, and the group's forecasts prove unrealistic, the interest burden will leave little or no return for shareholders. For what it is worth, the government adviser NM Rothschild has given RJB Mining's arithmetic its seal of approval. The UK's coal industry has a promising future if it is sold at the right price. Investors will need to study any prospectus with care.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 18 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In an interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN on 17  February, Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito,  reiterated his support for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  plan to reshuffle the cabinet. He also said: "Objectively  speaking, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura was the one  who created the cabinet reshuffle problem." He indicated the  cabinet reshuffle issue had nothing to do with a realignment of  the political world, but was caused by Takemura's inappropriate  behavior as chief cabinet secretary.    Commenting on Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  Secretary General Wataru Kubo's view that the future  administration should be a coalition under a "trilateral  structure" consisting of the "new conservative forces," "new  reformist forces," and Liberal Democratic Party, Ichikawa said:  "Such a setup will not be suitable under the heiritsu system  [electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with  proportional representation]."    Commenting further on a suggestion by the SDPJ and Chairman  Akira Yamagishi of Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Confederation]  that "social democracy" or "liberalism" should serve as the  unifying force of the political regime, Ichikawa said: "That is  a question for the distant future. We should unite and fight in  the election as an extension of cooperation in reform efforts  (such as Diet reform and deregulation)." He expressed his  belief that the present coalition framework should develop into  a new-new party. He maintained: "It is the SDPJ which should  undertake self-reform first in the areas of foreign policy,  defense, energy, and taxation, to make itself a proper key  component of the political regime."</p>

"It is my conviction that the China-Korea summit this time  will lift economic cooperation onto a higher plane," Kim said at  a luncheon hosted by Chinese business leaders.    The president arrived in Beijing Sunday and began his  official visit on Monday.    Although Kim is expected to focus on the North Korean  nuclear  issue during his talks with President Jiang Zemin and other  Chinese leaders, one of his main objectives is boosting economic  and trade links.    "Our two nations need to build a future-oriented and  mutually  complementary cooperative system through increased joint  ventures in industrial and research projects as well as  increased direct trade," he said.    "If the resources of the two nations -- manpower, natural  resources, technology, capital and development know-how -- are  combined and utilized to promote our mutual interests, it will  produce great results," Kim said.    Kim said South Korean businesses have extensive experience  in  production and marketing, accumulated over the past 30 years.  Korean businessmen, unlike their counterparts from advanced  countries, are familiar with the business climate in developing  countries like China, he said.    Furthermore, Korean firms are stepping up investment in the  technology-intensive industrial sectors of the Chinese economy,  he said.    Seoul will spare no effort in supporting the business  activities of Korean enterprises in China, Kim assured the  Chinese businessmen.    He also expressed hope that businesmen from the two  countries  will promote a combined presence in third countries through  joint investments in such sectors as construction, automobiles  and aviation.    Kim noted that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  forum is being developed as an open cooperative body, and there  have been rapid increases in inter-country investment and trade  within the region.    Furthermore, regional economic projects including  development  of the tumen river basin are being actively promoted, he said.    "Once the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved and the  North decides to pursue policies of openness and reform,  regional cooperation in Northeast Asia wil be greatly  facilitiated, in addition to economic cooperation between China  and South Korea," he said.</p>

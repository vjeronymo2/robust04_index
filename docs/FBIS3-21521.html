Gen. Mikhail  Kolesnikov: Russia Does Not Produce Chemical Weapons" -- first  two paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] Articles and speeches by private individuals are  continuing to appear in the press and on television in which  attempts are made to bring to the notice of Russia's population  and the world public distorted information about Russia's  compliance with the demands of international agreements in the  sphere of banning chemical weapons and about the Defense  Ministry's activity relating to questions of preparations to  destroy these weapons.    At the editorial office's request the chief of the Russian  Armed Forces General Staff dots the "i's" in this matter.    Kolesnikov: Production of chemical weapons in the  former USSR was stopped in 1987 and has never been resumed, and  their stocks have not been replenished or renewed. The stocks  of chemical weapons in the Russian Federation Armed Forces do  not exceed 40,000 tonnes by weight of toxins and are located on  the Russian Federation's territory in seven specially equipped  arsenals which make it possible to ensure their safe and  reliable storage.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: Is it proposed to destroy the  existing stocks?    Kolesnikov: In accordance with a decision of the  Russian Government, the Ministry of Defense is currently  preparing the necessary grounds for a Russian chemical weapons  destruction program. The Defense Ministry is also the state  customer for work on creating ecologically safe technologies for  destroying (recycling) chemical weapons. At the same time it  uses in its work the principles of glasnost in choosing the  necessary technologies and discusses together with the regions'  representatives the sections of the draft program, the project  documentation, and other substantiating documents which concern  them. It actively promotes coverage in the mass media and in  scientific publications of various aspects of the problem of the  destruction of chemical weapons. The time for adopting "quiet"  decisions is long gone.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: How is it proposed to implement  this program which, without exaggeration, is unprecedented?  Will the destruction of stocks of chemical weapons not affect  people's health and the ecology?    Kolesnikov: The destruction of chemical weapons  will be carried out in the Russian Federation only at  installations specially created for these purposes, and their  location will be decided by a government commission. It has  been formed in accordance with the Russian president's directive  of 9 August 1993. The basic condition in preparing for  destruction is to ensure the safety of the population and the  environment. To these ends the Defense Ministry cooperates  closely with oblast and republic inspection organs in monitoring  the population's health and taking samples of objects in the  environment. Such work has already been carried out in the  region of Kambarka city in the Udmurt Republic and in Saratov  Oblast's Krasnopartizanskiy Rayon (Gornyy settlement) and  Volskiy Rayon (Shikany settlement). Top-class medical  specialists, professionals in their own line, are involved in  carrying it out. The results of the assessment of the state of  health are reported to the regions where this work is carried  out.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: Everything is clear, you might  think. The Defense Ministry makes no secret of the large-scale  measure that is being prepared and is ready to pass information  to the interested persons. Nevertheless, fabricated articles  which inflame the atmosphere in society are continuing to  appear. How do you rate them?    Kolesnikov: In this connection the Defense  Ministry deems it necessary to declare that the use of  information relating to military-chemical potential and to the  Russian Federation's fulfillment of its pledges under  international treaties in the sphere of banning chemical weapons  must be based exclusively on official sources. The opinions of  private individuals may not serve as a basis for assessing  Russia's activity in the said sphere. The incompetence and  unreliability of the sources of information are inflaming the  situation in places where stocks of chemical weapons are stored  and where the military units dealing with the problem of  destroying chemical weapons are stationed, and they are helping  to shape a distorted and false public understanding of the real  state of affairs in respect of Russia's desire to eliminate  chemical weapons stocks. All this can be regarded as blackmail  for the purpose of vilifying Russia's methods of preparing to  destroy chemical weapons and damaging our country's political  authority.    For everyone who makes such statements and for those who  disseminate them among the public it is time to ponder the  question: Whom does this benefit?</p>

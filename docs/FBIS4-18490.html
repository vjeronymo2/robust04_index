			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 5 (AFP) -- Embattled Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur called on neo-Gaullist MPs to rally behind him  on Tuesday [5 April] as he faced a wave of criticism in  parliament from his own supporters for his handling of recent  social conflicts.    Against a background of rivalry within the Gaullist Rally  for  the Republic (RPR) party for presidential elections in May 1995,  Balladur appealed to RPR deputies to show "unity" and  "solidarity" behind him.    Addressing a meeting of RPR MPs held on the sidelines of a  new session of parliament, Balladur said unity was a "condition  of success" while division meant the "certainty of failure,"  Balladur aides reported after the meeting.    The prime minister spoke after coming under heavy criticism  from supporters of RPR president Jacques Chirac, a candidate in  the 1995 presidentials, for his handling of a plan to allow  firms to pay less than the legal minimum to unemployed youths.    Balladur, who has barely concealed his own presidential  ambitions, withdrew the plan last Wednesday after more than a  month of sometimes violent student agitation.    Presenting himself both as "head of the government" and head  of the ruling right-wing parliamentary majority, Balladur said  the government drew its "strength" from the "unflinching"  support of its majority, his aides said.    Without naming him, Balladur attacked RPR  assistant-secretary  general Jean-Louis Debre, a strong Chirac supporter, for  criticising the government as demonstrations were actually going  on.    Balladur also alluded to the presidentials, saying it would  be an "illusion" to believe that his own failures would benefit  any other right-wing candidate in 1995.    The prime minister rejected calls for the resignation of  Labour Minister Michel Giraud over the failed youth jobs scheme,  saying he accepted full responsibility, the aides added.    Balladur also said he accepted responsibility for the  failure  of government plans to aid private schools at the expense of the  public sector, which brought 600,000 demonstrators into the  streets of Paris last January.    In February, the prime minister pledged handouts of 30  million dollars after violent protests by fishermen against  cheap imports.    Meanwhile MPs of the opposition Socialist Party said they  put  down a censure motion on the government's five-year employment  act, under which decrees on the youth jobs scheme were  published. Communists said they would demand abrogation of the  law.    Charles Millon, parliamentary leader of the centre-right  component in the ruling coalition, the Union for French  Democracy (UDF), pledged "total solidarity" for the government,  but warned it to take account of "common sense" criticisms from  its backers.    Bernard Pons, head of the RPR parliamentary group and a  Chirac supporter, renewed calls for Giraud's resignation in an  interview with the GLOBE weekly to be published Wednesday.    He said the RPR group thought there had been failures by  some  ministers. "It is up to the prime minister and him alone to  draw the conclusions."    Pons also confirmed that Balladur and Chirac had reached "a  sort of pact" for the presidential election after the right's  sweeping victory in legislative elections in March, 1993, and  this "will be respected."    Under the pact, Balladur was to have headed a caretaker  government under socialist President Francois Mitterrand,  leaving the field to Chirac in the presidentials.</p>

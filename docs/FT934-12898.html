			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Rocard promises to overhaul French Socialist party MR Michel Rocard yesterday promised an overhaul of France's Socialist party and launched an attack on the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, following his election as Socialist leader on Saturday, writes John Ridding in Paris. Mr Rocard, former prime minister who has provisionally led the Socialist party since its crushing defeat in March's general election, won 80 per cent of the 587 votes cast in a secret ballot for the post of the party's first secretary. He called for a reorganisation of the party and a rethink of policies aimed at reviving support. In his attack on Mr Balladur's centre-right government, Mr Rocard focused on its conduct of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of Gatt international trade talks. He said the government had acted irresponsibly and warned that failure to conclude an agreement with trading partners would have dramatic consequences. Mr Rocard also said he was willing to lead a list of Socialist party candidates in next year's elections for the European parliament. But he only would do so, he added, if women were given half the places on the list. Despite Mr Rocard's unopposed victory, however, the divisions within the party which have contributed to its electoral decline remained in evidence. More than 100 delegates to the weekend party congress cast blank ballots in the secret vote and there were 51 abstentions. The abstentions are believed to have included Mr Roland Dumas, former foreign minister and an ally of President Francois Mitterrand, who is an opponent of Mr Rocard.</p>

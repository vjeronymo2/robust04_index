An applicant may provide additional evidence of the need to establish a fair housing organization in a locality by citing data and studies that indicate the presence of housing discrimination and/or segregation in the locality. An example of evidence that may be used for this purpose is provided in (but is not limited to) the study, American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass, by Nancy A. Denton and Douglas S. Massey (Harvard University Press, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following requirements apply to activities funded under the Establishing New Organizations purpose of the FHO Initiative:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Term of contract.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two-year projects must be twenty-four months in duration, and funding for the second year of a project is subject to a performance review of the first year's activities and available annual appropriations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional Requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following requirements apply to all activities funded under the Fair Housing Organizations Initiative:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Testers in testing activities funded with FHO Initiative funds must not have prior felony convictions or convictions of crimes involving fraud or perjury, and they must receive training or be experienced in testing procedures and techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Projects that appear to be aimed solely or primarily at research or data-gathering unrelated to existing or planned fair housing enforcement programs will not be approved.

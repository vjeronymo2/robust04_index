			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special topic": "Economic Forecasts for China 1994"; </F> first paragraph is TANGTAI editor's note]    [Text] In December, the CPC convened a national economic  work conference at which some forecasts and arrangements for  next year were made. The formal annual economic plan will only  be made public after it has been passed by the NPC in March of  next year. However, from the research of CPC think-tanks, we  can gain an understanding of some of the ideas of the  authorities in respect to the economy next year.  <H3>  "An Analysis of 1994 Macroeconomic Trends" by Liang Yan  [4731 6056] </H3>   The direction of the economy in 1994 will be determined by  the orientation of the regulatory and control policies adopted  by the central government. In the first half of 1993, the speed  of growth in national GNP (gross national product) reached 13.9  percent. Seen from the current economic operational situation,  it will be very unlikely that it will be possible to bring  annual growth in GNP back down to below 10 percent by relying  solely on the existing regulatory and control strengths. Thus,  the annual growth in GNP for 1993 will very likely be between 9  and 12 percent.    1. The expectations and actions of the central  government.    The various central research institutions have put forward  four possibilities for GNP growth next year.    1. First possibility: GNP growth will be less than 9  percent.    When the central government is deciding the orientation of  its 1994 macroeconomic policies, it will be mainly considering  the two following factors: 1) The level of economic growth in  the second half of 1993; 2) The growth in the level of prices.    If the GNP growth in the second half of 1993 falls back to  below 7 percent (the possibility of this is very small), the  central government will place price levels in a secondary  position, and will implement a relaxed monetary policy, so that  the GNP growth in 1994 will recover to 9 percent. This is  because the fall in GNP growth to 7 percent will mean a higher  price has to be paid for the retrenchment policies, and nobody  wants to see that. If price level increases follow GNP growth  back below 10 percent it is certain that we will see a relaxed  monetary policy in 1994.    Second possibility: GNP growth will be 9 percent.    If the GNP growth in the last half of 1993 falls back to  between 7 and 10 percent, and if growth in price levels  continues to hover around 15 percent, it is possible that the  central government will take as its major concern clamping down  on inflation, and will continue to implement a tight monetary  policy for a time, at least until price level growth returns to  below 10 percent. In this way, the GNP growth in 1994 will  hover around 9 percent. Of course, the central government would  not be happy with this situation.    Third possibility: GNP growth will be 10-12  percent.    If the GNP growth in the second half of 1993 is between 10  and 12 percent, and price increases fall back to below 10  percent, this will be an economic operational situation which  will be quite pleasing to the central government. This is  because, in such a situation, there will be little difficulty  for the central government to make policy choices. This will  result in the central government maintaining a tight monetary  policy in 1994. The degree of tightness will be reduced but it  will not be completely given up. As long as the GNP growth rate  is lower than 12 percent, but higher than 10 percent, the tight  money policy will assist in restraining the sprouts of economic  overheating as necessary, and can also guard against an economic  landslide.    Fourth possibility: GNP growth will be above 12  percent.    If the GNP growth in the second half of 1993 is maintained  at  or above 12 percent, and the level of price increases is higher  than 10 percent, then in 1994 the tight monetary policy of the  last half of 1993 will be maintained and the degree of tightness  may even be increased.    Looking comprehensively at the various factors, the economic  regulatory and control policies adopted by the central  government in 1994 will depend of the operational results of the  economy in the last half of 1993. However, the aim of  maintaining GNP growth at 10 percent in 1994 will not be  difficult. The key question is what measures need to be adopted  to curb inflation, so that it can be controlled at below 10  percent.    2. The expectations and actions of local  governments.    The local governments represent the interests of the  regional  economic entities. Thus, there are often clashes with the  overall interests represented by the central authorities.  However, the local governments are also very important  intermediate links in the implementation of the central  government's targets, and the effectiveness of the central  government's policies is to a large degree determined by the  matching policies of the local authorities. Seen from the  current situation, it is impossible for local policies to fully  implement central macroeconomic regulation and control policies.  It may well occur that they, to a greater or lesser extent,  water down the central policies when implementing them in the  localities. This is because there is mutual vying between  provinces and regions in terms of economic growth, and this has  become a major factor in promoting economic overheating.    In addition, because of the imbalance between the economic  development of various regions, they all have full reason to try  to accelerate the economic development of their own regions. The  local governments in various regions are worried that if they  completely implement the central retrenchment policies, it will  result in their locality suffering harm. In the first half of  1993, while the speed of GNP growth in some coastal provinces  exceeded 20 percent, in some other provinces, GNP growth was  only about 3 percent. The situation across the country was that  the growth in coastal areas was higher than that in the central  areas, and in turn that in the central areas was higher than  that in the western areas. This disparity basically reflected  the levels of economic development in the respective areas.    The high speed of economic growth in the last two years  involved the role played by a certain amount of mutual vying  between provinces. This was particularly so in respect of the  leading provinces, whose speed of economic growth exerted a very  great psychological pressure on other provinces.    Economic operations in 1994 will still be carried out under  the impetus of the mutual vying between various levels of local  government. The central government's tight monetary policies  have already realized certain results. However, the policies  and activity modes of local governments cannot be changed and it  is very likely that those who have been affected most by the  tight monetary policies are the hinterland provinces. First,  the funds of coastal provinces do not have the feedback problem,  and it is possible that for there to be continuous development  in those areas. The process by which a small amount of the  funds of hinterland provinces are fed back from coastal  provinces also means that the costs of the original engineering  projects will increase. Under the current tight monetary  policies, feed-back funds will for a time experience difficulty  in finding a profitable project. This will result in the  use-efficiency of the funds of the hinterland provinces being  greatly affected. Second, the funds which have been fed back  from the coastal areas and invested in projects may, in a  situation where there are no guarantees of continuing funds,  turn into dead funds. For these two reasons achieving the  feed-back of funds is extremely difficult.    The goals and activity modes of local governments means that  economic operation will maintain a growth of about 10 percent.  This is because the tight monetary policies of the central  government have not yet been implemented to the degree where  they completely bring under control the activities of mutual  vying between local governments. At the same time, the  differences in the economic development levels of various  regions are becoming increasingly great and in the process of  microeconomic regulation under the tight monetary policies, the  mutual vying among local governments will push the Chinese  economy to a fairly high level of growth.    3. The expectations and actions of enterprises.    The tightening up policies which were initiated in the last  half of 1993 resulted in newly commenced projects being  partially controlled, and the prices of building materials  falling back to lower levels. These tightening up measures  checked the scale of production of enterprises, and the market  saw a contraction. However, the capacity of enterprises to  absorb the costs of raw and semifinished materials was improved.  In looking at whether or not the economic results of  enterprises can be improved, we have to look at which of these  influences is the strongest. If the former is stronger than the  latter, the enterprise results will see a decline. In the  opposite case, the results will see an improvement.    Actually, the current microeconomic regulatory policies  deliver a message to enterprises, and that is that in 1994 the  economy will still grow at quite a high speed. However, in a  situation where financial order sees an improvement, it may well  be of greater benefit to the development of production by  industrial enterprises, as funds will flow toward industrial  production. However, in a situation where the pressure on the  scale of investment is not great, enterprises have an optimistic  attitude towards economic growth in 1994. In addition, over the  last year, consumption by social groups has seen a trend of  strong growth, and consumption by the people has seen a steady  rise. Thus, economic development in 1994 may well see stable  high-speed growth prompted by the optimistic activities of  enterprises.  <H3>  "Analysis and Forecasting of Grain Supply and Demand" by  Cheng Cheng [4453 0701] </H3>   1. Forecast of grain supply in 1994.    1. Forecast of the country's output.    According to forecasts by the Ministry of Agriculture this  year (1993), there will be increased agricultural production in  most areas of the country. Total grain production is likely to  reach 438.86 million tonnes. In 1994, output may reach 451.79  million tonnes, which will be a record figure.    The increased grain production in 1993 has been realized in  a  situation where area planted has seen a continual reduction.  (Following reductions in the previous 2 years, there has been a  further reduction of 11 million mu this year) It is estimated  that 1994 will see a slight increase in the area planted, and  the total may reach 1.66-1.68 billion mu.    2. Forecast of imports next year.    In the past, it was generally the case that over 10 million  tonnes of grain was imported annually. Now that prices have  been freed and each region can operate as it wishes, it is  estimated that 1994 imports will be 13 million tonnes.  Converted to unprocessed grain, this will be equivalent to  about 15.03 million tonnes.    2. Forecast of grain demand in 1994.    1. Forecast of food grain demand.    In 1992, per-capita grain consumption in China was 235  kilograms. It is estimated that in 1994, this figure will fall  to 233 kilograms. If, in 1994, the national population reaches  1.20 billion, the total volume of food grain consumed throughout  the country will be 15.93 million tonnes.    2. Forecast of fodder grain demand.    In 1992 the per-capita consumption volume of fodder grain  was  about 63 kilograms. It is estimated that in 1994, the  per-capita fodder grain demand might reach 67 kilograms. The  national demand for fodder, converted to unprocessed grain, will  total about 93.22 million tonnes.    3. Forecast of demand for industrial-use grain.    It is predicted that in 1994, demand for industrial-use  grain  (including industrial-use grain utilized in foodstuffs,  non-staple foodstuffs and non-food products), converted into  unprocessed grain, will total about 14.15 million tonnes.    4. Forecast of demand for seed grain.    It is predicted that the demand for seed grain throughout  the  country in 1994 will be 19.15 billion tonnes.    5. Forecast of export volume.    From January to August, China exported 7.79 million tonnes  of  grain, an increase of 560,000 tonnes on the same period last  year. The volume of grain imports was 4.51 million tonnes, a  reduction of 4.59 million tonnes as compared with the same  period last year. With this one increase and one decrease, over  the period January to August, the net exports increased by 5.15  million tonnes. It is estimated that the net import of food  grain in 1994 could reach 7 million tonnes, while 1994 exports  could reach 12 million tonnes.    Totaling the above-noted items and adding the 3 million  tonnes of grain wasted or spoiled annually, the total demand for  grain will be 462.92 million tonnes, of which domestic demand  will total 452.92 tonnes.    3. Analysis of China's grain supply and demand in  1994.    On the basis of the calculations above, 1994 should see  demand exceeding production, and we will have to make use of  stores and imported grain to fill the shortfall. Thus, the  general trend of the market price of grain next year will be  upwards. In particular, because the market looks good for  paddy, corn and wheat, their prices will rise to varying degrees.  <H3>  "Inflation Rate in 1994 Will be Between 7 and 10 Percent" by  Jiang Zhuowen [3068 0340 2429] </H3>   There are many factors which will affect the trend of prices  in 1994. Of these many factors, a number of factors such as the  scale of investment, macroeconomic policies, interest rates for  deposits and the price reforms will have a major influence on  prices in 1994.    Investment. The value of actual investment  completed in 1992 was 758.9 billion yuan, an increase of 37.6  percent. This year, the plans kept the figure to 800 billion  yuan, an increase of 5.5 percent. However, excluding price rise  factors, there will be an increase of between 34 and 40 percent.  By July, as the strengthened effects of macroeconomic  regulation and control had begun to see results, the cut back of  fixed assets saw a reduction in newly commenced projects, a  decline in commodity housing investment and a reduction in the  growth of investment in local projects. However, the various  key state construction projects, especially those which  increased supply and alleviated bottlenecks, were not affected.    From this we can see that while the increase in fixed assets  investment this year may be lower than the growth in 1992, it  will not be much lower, and it is likely that a growth rate of  about 30 percent will be maintained. That is, investment will  be 940 to 980 billion yuan. It may also occur that the  investment will break the 1 trillion yuan mark. If this year's  growth rate is maintained next year, it will have a definite  effect on the overall annual price trend.    The regulatory and control power of the macroeconomic  policies. Because of the deepening of reform and opening  up, the establishment of a market economy structure and  particularly because of the initial establishment of China's  commodity market and the initial establishment of an economic  operational mechanism, macroeconomic regulation and control has  already seen initial results.    As to how to carry out regulation and control during the  next  step, the central authorities have decided to carefully handle  the regulatory and control power, so as to avoid great economic  fluctuations. The characteristic of the operation of these  macroeconomic regulatory and control measures is "restricted  braking, so as to achieve a soft landing." Thus, it is  predicted that in spring next year, the regulatory and control  powers may be gradually relaxed.    Interest rates. The raising of savings deposit  interest rates by the People's Bank of China on two occasions,  15 May and 11 July, had the dual effects of increasing deposits  and controlling people's inflationary expectations. However,  the sizes of the increases and the rapid pace of their concrete  implementation are worthy of study. The great increase of 2.18  percent in the interest rate on 15 May saw a lively response by  urban and rural residents, and in May and June the people  increased their deposits by 54 billion yuan. This was 18.2  billion yuan more than the increase during the same period of  the previous year. It should be possible to complete the issue  of state bonds in coordination with administrative measures.  Seen from the situation at present, if the current interest  rate level is maintained until the first half of next year, it  will be beneficial to the reduction of the money supply, and it  will ensure that prices see a quite low growth rate.    Price reform. Considering things from the current  controlling of inflation and the controlling of inflationary  expectations, the State Council has decided to implement no  further price reform measures in the second half of this year,  and related plans have been postponed till an appropriate time  in future. The choice of an appropriate time to implement price  reforms is a very important issue. The reason price reforms saw  results during the period of economic improvement and  rectification was because at that time the overall level of  prices was quite low. Thus, even if the price reforms took big  steps, it did not induce inflationary expectations among the  people. The current postponement of the implementation of price  reform measures is intended to restrain inflation.    Although the investment, interest rate and macroeconomic  policies and the price reforms will play basic roles in respect  of the price situation next year, we also need to pay attention  to exports, imports, exchange rates and the economic situation  around the world.    Exchange rates. Generally, it can be said that  the price of renminbi on the foreign exchange market will  continue to be stable. This is because on the one hand,  international pressure is great. Various Western countries  widely believe that China promotes imports by keeping the value  of its currency low, so as to offset the disadvantageous effects  of the large increase in imports following its readmission to  GATT. If the renminbi is devalued by a great amount however, it  will have a negative effect on the efforts to be readmitted to  GATT. On the other hand, the policy-making level in China has  already recognized that relying purely on a low exchange value  of renminbi to promote exports is not only of limited  effectiveness in promoting exports, but can also increase the  prices of domestic imported products, and give rise to domestic  inflation. This will have a negative effect on China's efforts  to control inflation. Thus, a stable exchange rate is the basic  trend.    Next year, there will be a decline in the growth of the  scale  of investment, interest rates will be maintained at current  levels, macroeconomic policies will continue to increase the  degree of macroeconomic regulatory and control, price reforms  will continue to be deferred, there will continue to be a  favorable balance of trade and the exchange rate will be stable  or will see a slight decline. In addition, there will be the  effects of "cockiness factors" [qiao wei yin su 5062 1442 0936  4790]. Thus, next year, the level of prices will see an overall  fallback. Over the year, there will be a low rate of economic  growth of between 2 and 5 percent.    Next year, the scale of investment will maintain a growth  rate of 30 percent, while at an appropriate time in the first  half of 1994, interest rates and macroeconomic policies will be  gradually readjusted. Price reforms will also be revived and  they will be tightly grasped and completed. In terms of foreign  trade, there will be a small favorable balance or an overall  balance. The exchange rate will be basically stable or will see  a slight decline. This will be beneficial to macroeconomic  readjustment and the maintenance of an appropriate speed of  growth. It will also be beneficial to absorbing the effects of  cockiness factors. Next year, the basic trend of prices will be  a stable increase of between 7 and 10 percent.  <H3>  "Steel Output in 1994 to Top 90 Million Tonnes" by Wang Li  [3769 0500] </H3>   In the first half of 1993, China's steel output reached  43.43  million tonnes, in which the output of steel products reached  38.5 million tonnes. These figures were respectively 12.5  percent and 21.23 percent up on the same period in the previous  year. Calculating on this basis, the total annual production for  1993 will reach 87.5 million tonnes. This shows that China's  iron and steel industry has great prospects.    In 1994, if the national economy continues to grow at a  speed  of 9 percent, there will be a corresponding increase in the  consumption of steel products, and the output of steel products  will continue to grow on the basis of this year's production.  There appears no doubt that steel output will top 90 million  tonnes next year. Following the disintegration of the former  Soviet Union, China's steel output may leap to the number two  position in the world next year. Although next year the steel  products market will continue to see a situation where supply  cannot meet demand, it is predicted that the supply-demand  contradiction will be less intense than that this year.    The reason the steel enterprises will see such growth is  that during the Seventh Five-Year Plan and during the first 2  years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, a great volume of technical  transformation funds have been invested, and production capacity  has been raised. Thus, next year steel output will continue to  see sustained growth. What will constrain it will be raw  materials such as iron ore and scrap steel and the transport  facilities. Apart from having to adopt necessary policies and  encourage increased production of iron ore domestically, there  is also a need to appropriately increase the imports of iron  ore, scrap steel, and steel blanks.    To sum up, as there will still be a supply-demand gap, we  can  look forward to another upward movement in the market. In 1994,  the demand for steel products will grow by 10-13 percent. As to  resources, domestic production may increase by 12 to 15 percent  and to some degree it will be necessary to rely on imports.    In terms of trading in iron and steel, there will be a  decline in the import of steel products. This will show itself  in the second half of this year. According to relevant  statistics, in the first half of this year, 11.16 million tonnes  of steel products were imported, a growth of 3.6 times as  compared with the same period in the previous year. However, in  the second half of the year, the volume of steel products  imported has seen a decline. It is estimated that over the full  year, about 15 million tonnes will have been imported. In 1994,  even if China joins GATT, the volume of imported steel products  certainly will not be higher than this year, and will very  likely be about 10 million tonnes.  <H3>  "Renminbi To Devalue by 15 Percent in 1994" by Jia Changlu  [6328 7022 6424] </H3>   During the period while the renminbi is making the  transition to free convertibility, there exists the risk that  inflation will be induced. The exchange rate lever will become  an important means by which to regulate domestic and external  economic relationships.    In 1993, because of the strengthening of psychological  expectations and speculation in foreign exchange, strong market-  driven fluctuations occurred in the swap exchange rates. Over 7  months, the swap exchange rates for the renminbi saw three major  fluctuations, on each occasion exceeding 20 percent. This means  that the renminbi has already been successively devalued from  the posted exchange rates, to where even the swap exchange rate  is, through these fluctuations, moving downward.    China's economic relations with the outside world have  already greatly expanded and fluctuations in international  prices directly affect the domestic economy. If the renminbi is  not freely convertible, a great amount of international  inflation will flow into the country, but it will not be  possible for domestic inflation to be transferred out into the  international sphere. If there is no futures market for  renminbi, the major risks and damage resultant from exchange  rate fluctuations will have to be borne entirely by enterprises.  During the period while the renminbi is making the transition  to free convertibility, there exists the risk that inflation  will be induced. There will be an increasingly close  relationship between Chinese residents and foreign exchange, and  the exchange rate lever will become an important means by which  to regulate domestic and external economic relationships. On  the basis of this situation, in 1994 the renminbi will  experience the following trends:    To what degree will the renminbi devalue in 1994? The posted  exchange rates are determined on the basis of export foreign  exchange costs, while the swap exchange rates are decided by the  import situation and the foreign exchange management system. In  1994 and for several years hence, renminbi exchange rates will  see a trend of devaluation. The reasons for this are:    -- The domestic economy will see sustained high-speed growth  and GNP will grow at over 10 percent annually.    --Inflation will be sustained at quite a high level, with  the  retail price index seeing an annual growth of 10-15 percent.    --Exports will grow annually at over 20 percent, while  imports will grow even more swiftly. Thus, a trade deficit will  appear.    --Foreign exchange management will be gradually relaxed and  even if it is not relaxed, actual loss of control will become  increasingly serious.    At the same time, the fluctuations in the swap exchange  rates  will be frequent and these will mainly arise through speculation  in foreign exchange. If the state engages in effective  intervention through foreign exchange purchases and sales, these  fluctuations may be reduced. If the state uses the highest  price limit to carry out control, it will result in the  expansion of the foreign exchange black market.    Initial estimates indicate that in 1994, swap exchange rates  will see a drop of about 15 percent. This will exceed the  domestic price rises and economic growth. In subsequent years  we will see a devaluing of between 10 and 15 percent annually.  This is deduced on the basis of historical experiences. Over  the last 15 years, the renminbi exchange rate as calculated on  the basis of the posted price has fallen from $1 being  equivalent to 1.7 yuan to where it is valued at 5.8 yuan, a fall  in value of 240 percent, or an average annual fall of 10  percent. According to the swap exchange rates, it has fallen in  value to 10.8 yuan, a drop of 535 percent, or an average annual  devaluation of 15 percent. Also, the overall level of domestic  prices has risen 150 percent. That is to say, the value of the  renminbi externally has fallen at a rate which is twice as great  as the decline in the domestic value, and in future this trend  will continue.    Is the swap exchange rate stable?    The exchange rate falling back in July 1993 was mainly the  product of the implementation of state economic regulatory and  control measures, which changed psychological expectations and  resulted in companies selling off large quantities of foreign  exchange. The reason it did not break through the 8.5 yuan base  line was the limitations imposed by the foreign exchange costs  of exports. If the value of the renminbi climbed further, it  would affect exports and promote imports. At present, the rate  is stable at about 9 yuan. This is the result of a balance  between the two forces. In the first half of the year, the  trade deficit reached $3.5 billion, while foreign exchange  reserves fell to $6 billion. Proceeding from the requirement to  achieve a balance of international payments, the renminbi should  not be allowed to devalue excessively.    However, as the domestic economic retrenchment whereby banks  only accept funds and do not provide credit has been in place  for over four months, the renminbi is extremely tight, and it  will naturally not lose much value. The current stability is  only temporary. The domestic tight monetary policies cannot be  sustained for too long a time, and they will probably begin to  see gradual relaxation by the end of the year. Also the demand  for foreign exchange to fund imports has not been reduced.  Thus, it is predicted that by the beginning of 1994, there will  be a further fall in the renminbi swap foreign exchange rate.  <H3>  "The Risks of Merging Exchange Prices Next Year" by Jia  Changlu [6328 7022 6424] </H3>   The 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  decided that beginning next year, the exchange prices of the  renminbi would be gradually unified. At present, for renminbi  there are "three prices for the one currency." There is the  "official price" (where $1 converts to 5.68 yuan). There is  also the "swap price" (where $1 converts to 8.7 yuan) and  further the "black market price" (where $1 converts to 9 yuan).  The situation is extremely chaotic and this has obstructed the  normal development of international trade and investment.    Can the dual-track exchange rate be unified?    Another significance of the devaluing of the posted exchange  rate is that under conditions where the swap exchange rate is  stable and the differential between the two exchange rates is  quite small, achieving the unification of the dual exchange  rates, scrapping foreign exchange quotas and changing quota  management into spot exchange management so as to realize a  unified exchange rate, is one of the things which China has  promised to GATT as a condition for its readmission. This must  be achieved in the next few years. The end of 1993 is the best  opportunity for the merger of the dual exchange rates. The  price differential of the two tracks will be small, the  scrapping of quota prices will cause little disturbance and if  there is a desire to purchase quotas, the amount the state  financial administration will have to pay out will be small.  However, it should be noted that there exists quotas for 10  billion in foreign exchange, and that to purchase these will  still require a large volume of renminbi. At the end of 1992,  the posted exchange rate was 5.8 yuan, while the swap rate was 7  yuan. The quota price however was only 1.2 yuan. If they first  devalued the posted exchange rate to 6.8 yuan and then purchased  all of the outstanding quota on the basis of $1 of foreign  exchange quota converting to 0.2 yuan, the cost would have been  the lowest. Unfortunately, the reforms were too slow and the  opportunity was missed. The end of 1993 also provides an  opportunity. If the posted exchange rate is devalued to 8 yuan,  and quota are purchased at a quota price where $1 converts to  0.5 yuan, then it will be possible to achieve the unifying of  the two tracks at the 8 yuan level. This could still be  regarded as a good move. If, for fear of being unable to  guarantee foreign exchange income or in order to pander to the  interests of particular departments, this merger is again  deferred, a greater price will have to be paid in future.    The risk of implementing free convertibility of  renminbi.    Implementing a unified floating exchange rate does not mean  that the renminbi will be freely convertible. It will only be  basically freely convertible in the trade sphere. There will  still be strict restrictions on individuals and foreign  investors. The next step however will be to completely abolish  foreign exchange controls and allow free convertibility in  respect of foreign exchange. It is estimated that this will be  achieved in 3 to 5 years. However, the risks are very great.  If just 20 percent of the people's savings deposits of 1.2  trillion yuan were converted into foreign exchange, then 240  billion yuan would be converted into $20 billion. If we work on  the basis of a ratio of one to twelve, this conversion would  consume all of China's foreign exchange reserves. An even  greater problem is that the banks just do not have so much  renminbi to expend. If people become nervous, at any time a  bank run might occur. Then, if consumer goods are in  insufficient supply, foreign exchange will become the target of  panic purchasing. Thus, as renminbi heads toward free  convertibility, there is a need to be extremely careful.  <H3>  "Investment To Exceed 140 Billion [figure as published] Yuan  in 1994" by Lu Dacheng [7120 6671 2052] </H3>   Next year, the total value of fixed investment throughout  the  country will exceed 1.4 trillion yuan, a 24 percent growth on  1993. This high speed of growth will be achieved on the basis of  the 45 percent growth seen in 1993 as compared with 1992.    The statistics of the State Planning Commission show that in  1993 the total fixed asset investment in society will be over  1.14 trillion yuan, a 45.1 percent increase over the previous  year. In this, whole-people investment will grow 50 percent,  collective investment will increase 59 percent and individual  investment will grow by 8 percent. This trend of investment  inflation led to the implementation of macroeconomic regulatory  and control policies in the middle of this year.    The characteristics of fixed asset investment in 1993 can be  summed up in the following points:    1. There has been high-speed growth in investment in  state-owned enterprises and, in the first half of the year, this  reached 70 percent. Collective enterprises saw even greater  growth, with investment in the first half of the year growing  105 percent.    2. Local project investment has been higher than central  investment, with the proportion of local investment seeing  straight- line growth.    3. Investment clearly moved towards the southeast coastal  areas. The growth there was over 30 percent higher than growth  in the central and western regions.    4. The investment structure has not been rational. Apart  from transport and communications, the proportions of investment  in bottleneck sectors declined. Also, the proportion of  productive, constructive investment declined, but commodity  housing saw a very high rate of growth.    5. Investment performance has been poor and there has been a  decline in the fixed asset creation rate.    6. The rate of funds provision has not been ideal. The  annual investment plan arranged by the state only provided 44.79  billion yuan. However, the actual needs of construction on the  basis of rational engineering were 49.8 billion, meaning a  shortfall of 5 billion yuan, a figure representing 11.2 percent  of the estimate. Although retrenchment policies have been  implemented, due to the inertia of growth and other promotional  factors, China's investment demand is still growing and  expanding at a quite high rate. According to forecasts, total  social fixed assets investment in 1994 will exceed 1.4 trillion  yuan, and actually reach 1.417 trillion yuan, a growth of 24.3  percent. Of this, whole-people investment will see a growth of  25.5 percent, collective investment will see a growth of 27.3  percent and individual investment will see a growth of 12.2  percent.    The reasons for the growth of investment in 1994 can be  summed up as follows:    Policy-nature reasons include:    1. In order to reduce the economic development disparities  between the eastern, central and western regions, next year the  state will support the development of the central and western  regions and, to a certain degree, will increase the support it  provides for the development of these regions.    2. In order to increase the vigor of old medium-size and  large state-owned enterprises, the state will continue to  increase investment in them.    Economic-nature reasons include:    1. The macroeconomic regulation and control measures  implemented this year have brought about a soft landing for the  economy in the second half of the year. This has laid a  foundation for quite swift economic development next year.    2. This year, many investment projects have already been  commenced and a large amount of funds have already been put into  them. They cannot really be abandoned half way.    3. Prospects look good for the drawing in of foreign funds  in 1994 and there will need to be corresponding renminbi  investment.  <H3>  "State-Run Enterprises to Undergo Major Reorganization in  1994" by Jia Changlu [6378 7022 6424] </H3>   The third plenary session decided to increase the pace of  reform of state-run enterprises. China's state-run enterprises  face a major challenge and 1994 will be a crucial year for them.    An intense clash.    The stage of changeover from the old track to the new will  see some overlapping and a series of clashes. Next year, in  their production operations, state-run enterprises will keep one  eye on the market and will be guided by market signals and will  organize production on the basis of marginal patterns. They  will keep the other eye fixed on the government. They will put  efforts into completing the government targets and in this  respect will have to diverge from the laws of margins. In  resource deployment, they will have to consider economic  rationality, but will not be able to violate their loyalty to  the upper levels. Economic operations will have to be in accord  with lateral market relations, but will also have to be  coordinated with vertical administrative relations. The  enterprises will have to face the market and take responsibility  for operations and their own profits and losses, and will also  have to bear all kinds of social, administrative and policy  tasks. In this way, they will lose most of their autonomy in  operations and their right to assume responsibility for profits  and losses. The limits of enterprise property rights are hazy.  Sometimes, ownership rights are expanded and this eats into the  rights and interests of the operators. At other times,  ownership rights are reduced, and this produces an outflow of  state-owned assets and a flood of short-term activities by  enterprises. The operational rules for property rights are not  unified and administrative rights and economic rights are  overlapping and entangled. In the market, bureaucratic  practices prevail while in the bureaucracy, market practices  prevail. The two systems are locked together in confrontation  and it is thus difficult for state-owned enterprises to achieve  efficiency.    Thus, the reform of state-owned enterprises next year must  follow two principles. First, the noneconomic factors of  state-owned property rights must be given up. This principle  can be realized through the reform of government organs and  functional transformation. This will allow the separation of  economic rights and administrative rights and the separation of  economic functions and administrative functions. The second is  to promote the structuralization of property rights. If there  is a desire to form an economic environment in which there is  exchange at equal value and effective competition, then it is  necessary for there to exist many competitive property rights  entities, not ownership entities.    The three major trends in 1994.    On the basis of the above analysis, next year the  development  of state-owned enterprises will see three major trends: First,  the trend of separate streams. The majority of small and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises and some of the large  enterprises which are not suited to the implementation of a  state ownership system will be "transferred down" to collectives  or individuals through leasing or contracting, and they will  gradually be transformed into shareholding operations. Various  enterprises, which because of their serious losses and the fact  that they have long been unable to make enough money to cover  liabilities, will have difficulty avoiding the fate of  bankruptcy and elimination. Second, the trend of hybridization.  Not only will there be crossholdings among state- owned  property rights entities, but there will also be mutual  shareholdings among different types of property rights entities.  Jointly, they will establish enterprise groups and, through  pooling funds and technology with foreign businesses, they will  bring into play the superiorities of "hybridization." Third, a  competitive orientation. The state will control the property  rights of large enterprises which affect the national economy  and the people's livelihood, but the enterprises will have full  operational autonomy. The enterprises of different natures will  compete equally and state- owned enterprises will bring their  own superiorities into play through competition, and will guide  the healthy development of the market economy.    Thus, next year there will be a high tide of internal  autonomy in China's state-owned enterprises.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Barratt urges further interest rate cut SIR LAWRIE BARRATT, one of Britain's best-known housebuilders, yesterday called on the government to cut interest rates to 6 per cent and introduce other incentives to help the UK housing market, which remained in a deep recession. Sir Lawrie, chairman of Barratt Developments, was called out of retirement 14 months ago to rescue the company after it incurred an annual loss of Pounds 105.9m. Yesterday the group said it had made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 11.3m for the 12 months to the end of June. Sir Lawrie said in a letter to the prime minister and the chancellor, that much more needed to be done if the housing market was to recover. He contrasted the higher unemployment rate in Britain with that of the US, which was also suffering from high trade and budget deficits. 'A bold approach must be taken to effect a major reduction in interest rates more akin to the primate rate of 6 per cent prevailing in the US,' he wrote. He also appealed for a permanent end to stamp duty on house sales which he termed an 'iniquitous tax on home ownership'. He said: 'If it was right to remove this tax in December last year to stimulate the housing market, then it is even more essential to remove it again following the deterioration which has taken place in the housing market since then.' Sir Lawrie also called for the ceiling for mortgage tax relief to be raised from Pounds 30,000 to more than Pounds 50,000. He compared the failure to raise the tax allowance ceiling since 1983 with increases in MPs' salaries during that time of 102 per cent and increases in MPs' allowances of 225 per cent. 'The same treatment should be given to all homeowners entitled to mortgage tax relief,' Sir Lawrie said. He also called for a restoration of capital allowances to help the private rented housing sector, which had fallen to just 7 per cent of the UK housing stock. Barratt results, Page 23</p>

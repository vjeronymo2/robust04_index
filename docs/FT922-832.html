			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Signals in the smoke Nineteenth-hole talk at Turnberry - venue of a BAT Industries golf day  - was no doubt dominated last night by the long-awaited US Supreme Court ruling on liability claims against the tobacco companies. Fears that the verdict might open the floodgates to a spate of new civil suits initially knocked 7 per cent off the BAT share price - dragging a still jumpy UK market down with it - but the stock ended just 26p lower at 731p, as London took belated heart from Wall Street's less panicky response. Contrary to some early reports, it seems the Supreme Court has thrown out many of the potentially more damaging claims. At stake was whether plaintiffs can sue a company on the grounds that manufacturers had failed to give adequate warning of the risks - an issue on which federal law and three states had been in conflict. Yesterday's decision appears to imply that this will not be allowed in respect of claims arising after 1969, the date of an amendment to the 1965 US legislation which required health warnings to be put on every cigarette packet. Obviously, some suits pre-date that deadline - and it is possible that previously unsuccessful cases could be re-opened were a juicy award to be made - but it is hard to dispute the industry's early claim that it has scored a victory, not a defeat. Even where cases do proceed on this basis, plaintiffs still have to convince a jury, confront the reality that the causal link between smoking and cancer has never been established in a court of law, and overcome the ultimate defence that death or injury may have been caused by someone else's brand. The anti-smoking lobby will no doubt keep up the attack on other fronts - but even a gloomy scenario of 20 Dollars 10m awards a year would only cost a cent on a packet of cigarettes or a fraction of the industry's profits.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Little chance of pay rises for German chemical industry workforce The German chemicals industry has sent clear signals to its workforce that there will be little on offer in pay negotiations due to start next month, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. About 30,000 jobs would be lost this year and more would follow in 1994, according to a newsletter from the industry's employers' association. It pointed out that gross pay rates had increased 15.5 per cent between early 1990 and the first half of 1993, while productivity had risen only 6 per cent. Prices were falling, unit labour costs were rising in spite of job cuts, and overall production fell 4.5 per cent in the first seven months of this year, the letter said.</p>

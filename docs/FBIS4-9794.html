			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 1 Apr (DPA) -- Three other persons  suspected of participating in the assassination of Luis Donaldo  Colosio, Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] candidate for  president, have been arrested in Tijuana.    According to the radio station Radio Red, three or four  persons involved in Colosio's assassination were taken from  Tijuana to Mexico City in deep secrecy. The radio station says  that everything indicates the persons are Vicente Mayoral  Valenzuela and his son Rodolfo Mayoral, security agents during  Colosio's visit to Lomas Taurinas, a Tijuana neighborhood, and  witnesses to his death. Another person reportedly is Rodolfo  Rivapalacio, coordinator of Colosio's security in Tijuana, who  hired members of the group known as Tucan for security tasks.  The station went on to say that the group includes a fourth  person, whom the station has not yet identified.    Mario Aburto Martinez, a 23-year-old mechanic, and former  policeman Tranquilino Sanchez Vanegas, 57, accused of having  assisted the killer, are officially being held at the Almoloya  de Juarez Maximum Security Prison. In addition, the Mexico City  press today mentioned the possibility of the murder being  ordered by drug traffickers, who intended to divert public  attention.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAP WRAPPING  </P> <P> The word from malls, record stores and video arcades as well as the United  Nations, a Hollywood dance club, is that the heavy gold-chain Mr. T look is  out. Lately, street versions of rap style are instead inspired by the  Afro-centric accessories of Boo Ya Tribe, the camouflage gear preferred by  Public Enemy and the soul-rap style, with dreadlocks and African-print fabrics,  of Soul II Soul.  </P> <P> Rap fans, especially black teen-agers, picked up on these styles early and made  them a uniform. Now there are spinoffs, adapted by Latinos, Anglos and Asians,  that tend to eliminate a few layers of accessories for a more streamlined  effect.  </P> <P> A prideful, Third World fashion statement, the look relies on American  classics, especially T-shirts, jeans and high tops, as key ingredients.  </P> <P> Paul Freez Luv Farmer, dancing at United Nations, wears a custom-made toque of  African-print fabrics to which he has added a baseball cap bill. "Our hats are  modeled after Zulu crowns as a sign of pride," Farmer explains, adding, "We  created a style that's not just African, it's Afro-American."  </P> <P> T-shirts feature images of such '60s icons as human rights activist Malcolm X,  as well as such '90s stars as movie maker Spike Lee.  </P> <P> Accessories range from Zulu pendants, African masks and gold nose rings to  big-faced clocks worn as necklaces.  </P> <P> The fade, with its tall, squared-off top and sheared sides, is the haircut of  choice. Actor and rap singer Kid, of Kid 'n' Play, set the trend in this  spring's comic movie "House Party."  </P> <P> Young people creating this global-eclectic style say they hope the resurgence  of positive images rooted in black heritage will stir people's social awareness  and help them "wake up," as Spike Lee would say.  </P></p>

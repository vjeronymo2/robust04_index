			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Britain is to reestablish military contact with  South Africa after a break of more than 25 years with a visit of  a royal navy war ship and support vessel this month. The  British Ministry of Defense said in London that it hoped the  goodwill visit by HMS Norfolk, the first of the navy's most  up-to-date type 23 frigates, would boost Britain's chances of  selling military equipment, particularly naval vessels, to South  Africa. The Norfolk and its support vessel, Grey Wilbur, will  visit Cape Town and Simonstown from 27 to 31 January.</p>

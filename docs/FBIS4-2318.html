			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "We Must Let the Public See the Justice of the </F> Judicial Proceedings"]    [Text] Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang was found guilty of  "stealing and prying into secret information of the state" in  the first trial of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's  Court, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison and deprived of  political rights for two years. Since mainland China expanded  opening and allowed reporters outside the mainland to cover news  on the mainland, Xi Yang is the first to be sentenced to a stern  prison term for offending criminal law. Although he is not a  permanent resident of Hong Kong, because he was working with a  mass media institution in Hong Kong when he violated the law,  his case attracted close attention among journalistic circles  and the public of Hong Kong.    On 27 September, China's official news media dispatched a  report saying that Xi Yang was suspected of being involved in  the illegal activities of stealing and prying into state  monetary secrets in violation of the "PRC State Security Law,"  and was detained by the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau  for investigation that day. On 7 October, another report said  that the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate approved the  arrest of Xi Yang, and before that, Tian Ye, another accused  person in the same case and a cadre of the State Administration  of Exchange Control, had also been arrested according to law.  The report said: "The monetary secrets stolen by Xi and Tian  included the secret plan of the People's Bank of China for  adjusting interest rates of deposits and loans, the secret  decision of the same bank on participating in international gold  trading, and other major monetary secrets. This caused serious  consequences." The same report also quoted a responsible  official of the Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau as  saying that "the behavior of Xi and Tian violated PRC criminal  law and was not relevant to a reporter's normal news coverage."    After investigation, the procuratorate filed an indictment  against Xi Yang on 14 December, and the case was handled by the  Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court. Because the case  was related to state secrets, according to the relevant  provisions of criminal law procedure, it was decided that the  trial would not be an open one. The court completed the first  trial and passed sentence in late March. Xi Yang refused to  accept the sentence and lodged an appeal to the higher level  court. So far, the court verdict has not been officially made  public. Because the process of the trial was not open, people  on the outside knew very little about the case. Upon finding  out that Xi Yang was sentenced to 12 years in prison several  days ago, many people were shocked. Although the Chinese  authorities repeatedly stated that Xi Yang's case had no  relation to reporters' normal news coverage activities and  repeatedly stressed that the Chinese Government would guarantee  the rights of reporters from outside the mainland to engage in  activities related to their trade, journalists in Hong Kong  still expressed strong misgivings. There were various  conjectures as people were unaware of the facts. Members of the  "Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic  Movement in China," who are always trying to stir up trouble,  took advantage of this event to instigate unrest among the  people. In fact, they tried to seek a pretext to undermine the  confidence of Hong Kong people in the policy of "one country,  two systems."    From the very beginning, Xi Yang's case attracted extensive  and close attention, and Chinese judicial authorities also  obviously attached great importance to the handling of this case  and did not treat it recklessly. A responsible person of  China's Supreme People's Court answered the relevant inquiries  of the Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress  [NPC], and Chinese government officials also answered relevant  questions raised by overseas Chinese and foreign visitors.  However, the court had to independently conducted the trial  without being influenced by administrative organs and external  forces. In his work report to the NPC session last month, Ren  Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, stressed that  "people's courts at all levels must consistently base their  trials and sentences on facts and strictly take law as the  yardstick; and they must strictly follow specific and procedural  laws when handling cases, and properly handle every case in the  spirit of being highly responsible to the people's interests and  state laws." They "must persistently exercise the right of  independent trial and judgment according to law." He also said:  "Maintain the system of open trials, and put the activities of  trial and judgment under supervision of the people through open  investigations, open debates, and open announcement of sentences  and court judgments." Although Xi Yang's case could not be  dealt with in an open hearing because of its special conditions,  it is still necessary to let the public see the correctness of  the judicial decision. In the details of Xi Yang's case, the  most noticeable point for journalistic circles in Hong Kong was  whether the major secrets were all used for news reporting.  Some Hong Kong NPC deputies, some Hong Kong affairs advisers,  and some political organizations have urged the Beijing  authorities to appropriately make public the details of the case  as long as this does not affect the fairness of the judicial  proceedings in order to remove people's misgivings.    In order to safeguard state interests, China enacted the  State Security Law and the Law on Protecting State Secrets.  Public security and procuratorial authorities are on the alert  against the sabotage and secret-stealing activities of internal  and external hostile forces. On the other hand, the mainland of  China needs to introduce modernization, reform, and opening to  Hong Kong and overseas areas, and Hong Kong also needs to learn  more about the real situation on the mainland. Journalists in  Hong Kong are thus performing important duties of covering and  reporting news. The Chinese Government has also indicated many  times that it attaches great importance to the positive role of  the mass media in Hong Kong.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN INDICTED IN COMPUTER BOOKMAKING SCHEME  </P> <P> An Agoura man was indicted Friday in Las Vegas on charges he headed the  "Computer Group," a nationwide betting ring that netted millions in profits  before it was shut down by the FBI on the eve of the 1985 Super Bowl.  </P> <P> Federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging Ivan Mindlin, 61, with  managing the group and hiring individuals who placed bets on its behalf.  </P> <P> Charges against Mindlin and 18 others include conspiracy, interstate  transmission of betting information and use of interstate facilities in aid of  racketeering.  </P> <P> The betting ring was dubbed the "Computer Group" because members allegedly  designed a computer program that was fed information on a sporting event to  determine the betting line. The group then set up representatives in various  cities to bet various events, using the computer-generated lines to determine  the bets.  </P></p>

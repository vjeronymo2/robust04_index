			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Kishkin article under the "View on the Situation" </F> rubric: "Path to Accord Is Not Easy, But It Must Be Pursued"]    [Text] The Treaty on Social Accord was signed at the  Kremlin last Thursday. It bears the signatures of the  president, the government, the chambers of the Federal Assembly,  a number of parties, trade unions, public movements, and  religious faiths, and the representatives of the overwhelming  majority of Russian regions. How should this event be evaluated?    Here is the president's opinion: "The treaty will make it  possible to unite all society around our biggest problems. We  will resolve them if we are able to counter fragmentation and  mutual enmity with collaboration based on dialogue."    And here we have a diametrically opposed assessment, that of  Communist leader G. Zyuganov: The treaty "tries to preserve the  misguided tenedencies which have led to the destabilization of  society and state" and is an "ultimatum demanding the complete  capitulation of the opposition."    What kind of document is it, then, which can produce such  diametrically opposed assessments? Perhaps it proclaims  objectives which do not suit Russian citizens? Let us look at  what seems to be the most crucial section -- the section on  overcoming the socioeconomic crisis. Here the government  pledges in this current year to reduce inflation; to achieve an  increase in investment activity; to draft a tax blueprint which  will provide incentives for the development of production; to  develop the structural reorganization of the economy; to take  measures to clear budgetary arrears in the payment of wages; to  pursue a vigorous social policy to achieve stabilization and  then raise living standards; and to draw up an employment  program. None of this (if only it were actually realized) would  seem to be a cause for rejection on the part of citizens. Nor  are the pledges in the treaty to take measures to consolidate  the economic, political, and legal area of Russia, to organize a  single labor market, and ensure citizens' safety.    So what is the problem, then? Why did not all those invited  to sign the treaty do so? They did not sign because to a  considerable extent they expected from the treaty what it cannot  provide -- an accord not just on objectives but on ways of  achieving them. The treaty proceeds from a different premise:  Let us agree about the priority objectives and then seek the  ways and means in calm, respectful dialogue rather than mounting  the barricades and indulging in the mutual recriminations of  which the country is tired. Such an approach has not suited  everyone, albeit for different reasons. The Yabloko [Yavlinskiy  Bloc] faction in the Duma, for example, considered that the  objectives were formulated in such a general way that there was  nothing on which to agree. And if the members of the  faction have not gone to the barricades and nor do they intend  to, so their signing it would make no sense.    It is difficult to argue here: The formulation of the  objectives in the treaty is indeed very general. But the  problem is that you will not be able to make them specific while  those involved in the political process wield clubs and seek to  bludgeon their opponents. So, like it or not, the treaty signed  in the Kremlin is no more than a kind of "nonaggression pact."  Its point is simple: to place common interests above group,  party, departmental, and regional interests and rule out the use  of force to resolve problems in society. That is to say, the  accord is principally about the need for civil peace.    The treaty contains a minimum set of essential conditions  in development of this. The parties to the treaty consider  that only changes which will further the stabilization of the  situation in society should be made to the Constitution and that  the relevant proposals should be prepared via conciliation  procedures. A pledge is taken not to initiate early elections  to the federal organs of power. The organizers of rallies and  demonstrations and the organs of power and law and order at  local level assume not just legal but moral and political  liability for ensuring the peaceful nature of such actions. The  trade unions pledge not to carry out strikes which have no  direct bearing on questions of wages, working conditions, or job  retention, while state organs and entrepreneurs pledge to use  conciliation procedures to settle labor conflicts and to provide  trade unions with all requisite information. The parties to the  treaty oppose the creation of any armed formations whatsoever by  political parties, movements, or public associations.    At the moment of signing the treaty it emerged that this set  of conditions does not suit certain political forces. The  Communists, who aim to change completely the present  socioeconomic course and want to be free of all pledges, do not  agree with it. But let us note that the proposed conditions do  not bind the opposition and in no way exclude the possibility of  political struggle, they merely channel it within a civilized  context in order to reduce tension in society. The call for  peaceful means of political struggle in no way suits the sundry  extreme tendencies, which can operate only when a supercharged  atmosphere prevails in society. Already on May Day V. Anpilov  was calling at rallies for a general political strike, inflaming  his hearers with abusive criticism of the government. The  National Salvation Front, headed by I. Konstantinov, seems in  general to know no slogan more constructive than "Down with!"    But now is the right time to ask another question: How  should we regard the treaty signed in the Kremlin, what hopes  should we pin on it? First and foremost, we should not  overestimate it, and we should not be complacent. If  forces prepared to use any methods of struggle and ill-disposed  toward constructive work under the present conditions of reality  remain outside the treaty the danger of violence will loom over  society one way or another. There will be attempts to exploit  difficulties and stir up the mass of poverty-stricken people  to... And yet the act of signing a treaty is, as a rule, as S.  Shakhray correctly observed, "not the ceremonial outcome of the  achievement of accord but the start of a long and complex search  for it." From this standpoint, one has to agree with A. Sobchak  when he stated that the actual fact of signing the treaty is  more important than its text, as it shows society's desire for  accord. And it is precisely that desire, expressed in such an  authoritative form, which is to serve as the stabilizing factor.  Otherwise we will not be able to overcome the crisis. In a  situation where no single political force can impose its will on  another, there is simply no alternative to accord because, let  us repeat the words uttered in the Kremlin, "a fruitless,  exhausting struggle will allow no one to work and will prevent  even a single problem being solved."</p>

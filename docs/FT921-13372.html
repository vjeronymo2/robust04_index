			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Observer: Japan's turn Japan has been better at donating money, rather than its brightest civil servants, to international organisations. So Kumiharu Shigehara's career as the OECD's next chief economist will be watched with more than usual interest. The 52-year-old Bank of Japan official takes over from David Henderson, who has been doing the job since 1984. Until now, heads of economics at the Paris-based group have been either British, like Henderson, or north Americans. But the Japanese now contribute 24 per cent of the organisation's budget - a fraction less than the Americans  - and already one of the three deputy secretary generals is Japanese. Currently head of a BoJ think-tank called the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Shigehara has completed three tours of OECD duty, most recently in 1987-89, when he was director of the policy studies branch. A tall, donnish man, he is noted abroad for espousing a tough, autonomous and not excessively pro-American monetary policy at the Bank of Japan. He has frequently advocated greater deregulation for the Japanese economy and insists that he will not change his tune in his new post - even on the sensitive issue of liberalising the rice market. Fluent in English, he is said to be typical of the new breed of assertive and international-minded Japanese who are not afraid to speak their mind. In which case, his appointment will be welcome.</p>

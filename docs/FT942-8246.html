			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Industrial groups propose Pounds 100m Tees clean-up One of the UK's biggest estuary clean-up projects, intended to help transform the polluted Tees into a salmon river, has been proposed by Northumbrian Water and Imperial Chemical Industries. Northumbrian has this week submitted to Cleveland County Council a planning application for an effluent treatment works on a disused ICI waste-disposal site to deal with sewage from 400,000 Teesside residents and industrial discharges from ICI's Wilton petrochemicals complex. The eventual Pounds 100m cost of the two-phase project will be borne by Northumbrian from its capital programme. ICI will pay fees for each tonne of waste treated. Industrial development turned the Tees' lower reaches into one of Britain's filthiest waterways. It has improved since the 1960s due to environmental improvements by industry. But ICI, which has spent Pounds 100m since 1990 on environmental upgrading on Teesside, and Northumbrian are under pressure to do more. At present the National Rivers Authority, the watchdog, permits ICI's Wilton site a biochemical oxygen demand - a measure of river oxygen depletion due to pollution - of 80 tonnes a day, but has said it must be reduced to 50 tonnes by 1996. ICI hopes to achieve much of this cut by using the proposed plant to treat its pta (pure terephthalic acid) waste before discharge. To meet the authority's goal of bringing migratory fish back to the Tees by 1996, Northumbrian needs to change its Teesside sewage disposal methods. The first Pounds 50m stage of the project includes construction of a Pounds 35m underground transfer sewer along the Tees' south bank, so sewage is discharged nearer the river mouth. The second stage will include a higher standard of sewage treatment to meet the European Urban Waste Water Dir-ective, due to come into effect in the year 2001, and treatment of more ICI effluents. Mr Doug Shearer, Northumbrian's general manager of projects, said the plant would not involve incineration or the import of waste - both contentious issues on Teesside. It would use conventional biological treatment methods. 'Sewage is a wonderful food, the bugs love it,' he said. Cleveland County Council said there would be extensive consultation before a decision. The go-ahead is subject to the consent of the boards of both Northumbrian and ICI Chemicals and Polymers.</p>

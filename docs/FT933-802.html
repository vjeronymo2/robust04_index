			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Monday Interview: Society man of action - Tony Blair, UK shadow home secretary The party's 'foremost moderniser' or 'the next Labour leader' are the epithets most commonly applied by political commentators to Tony Blair. Kenneth Clarke, the Conservatives' own leader-in-waiting, regards the shadow home secretary as the most dangerous figure on the opposition frontbenches. Tory MPs have been caught out offering bewildered applause for Mr Blair's surprisingly tough plans to tackle the country's crime wave. But life for the fastest-rising star in British politics - he is 40 years of age and has been in parliament for barely a decade - has hit a rough patch. The government is in disarray, Mr John Major's premiership is under threat. Mr John Smith has an 18-point lead in the opinion polls. So the Labour party is threatening to lapse into its bad old ways. Mr Blair, along with Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, has become the target of a familiar and less-than-subtle whispering campaign. The 'one-more-heave' tendency, which spent much of the 1980s opposing Mr Neil Kinnock's attempts to restore Labour's links with electoral reality, is back in business. So, too, are the left-wing critics of 'modernisation' who blame Labour's fourth successive general election defeat not on the voters' fear of high tax and spending policies but on its refusal to offer a bold, socialist vision. Mr Smith's plans to modernise the party's links with the trades unions through the introduction of one-member-one-vote (OMOV) in the selection of parliamentary candidates could yet be defeated at this week's Brighton conference. Mr Blair is visibly frustrated. Flashes of exasperation show through an hour-long exposition of why Labour must change if it is not to remain in permanent opposition. 'One thing is very important for the party to understand. There is always a great risk in politics of delusion. There are those who say that Labour lost the last election because it was too cautious and too timid. The notion that Labour lost because the electorate thought it was too cautious and too timid is just one of the more alarming political eccentricities of modern times.' He warms to the theme: 'The voters did not go into the ballot box and say: 'I want something that is going to set my life alight, so I'm voting for John Major this time'.' The frustration shows through: 'We must remember what the election in April 1992 was really like and what people really felt, what their real worries were about Labour, rather than rewrite history.' He is similarly dismissive of those who believe that the Conservatives are now so badly wounded that they will lose whatever. Labour has been there before. And the Tories responded by dumping Lady Thatcher. 'What I find odd is that after four election defeats, and with Labour not having won over 40 per cent of the popular vote since 1970, that you have to argue the case for change.' So does, as his critics charge, this unself-consciously middle-class barrister want to swap socialism for social democracy? Is he the David Owen of the 1990s. No. In Mr Blair's view his opponents are confusing ends with means. It is perfectly possible to preserve the party's traditional values while disavowing the policies once used to apply them. He puts it bluntly: 'The old style-collectivism that sees the notion of community action simply through a centralised state has had its day. But that is not to say the notion of community or social action has had its day.' This is what Mr Blair is really about. Instead of arguing about whether to renationalise this or that industry or spend Pounds 1bn or Pounds 2bn more on the health service he is seeking a new philosophical framework which would render obsolete the traditional tests of loyalty to the past. Labour must distill its basic ideology: 'It stands for community. It believes individuals achieve success not just by their own efforts but within a strong community. Now that to me is the basic Labour message and always has been. What I am saying is that you must apply that message to the world as it is today.' Here is the core. The dominant phases in British politics during the present century had been first the collectivism which brought the post-war settlement and then the reaction against it during the Thatcherite 1980s. 'Now people are searching for, if you like, almost for a new settlement between community and individual which recognises the importance of social action but which recognises the aim is to advance the individual. What the Tories have ended up doing is saying to people you choose between a strong society and individual fulfilment. What we are saying is it is necessary to have a strong society for individuals to succeed.' But what about policies? The voters of southern England whose mistrust of Labour cost it the 1992 general election will not be much impressed by ideological frameworks. Mr Blair admits that his party has not reached the stage of turning the principles into a new set of policies. But he insists the direction is obvious. It points to forsaking grandiose economic intervention in favour of encouraging regional and community-based economic enterprise and regeneration. It underscores the importance of decentralisation and the enhanced local democracy. It signposts an approach to the workplace which guarantees the rights of individual workers through the law rather than simply through the collective action of trades unions. Mr Blair can also claim that the law and order policy which has won him plaudits this year is drawn directly from his theoretical framework. By staking out the responsibility of society to deter and prevent crime he has won himself the room for manoeuvre to demand tough and effective action against those who flout their responsibility. 'The purpose of social action,' he says, 'is to allow individuals to take responsibility for themselves, not to substitute for it.' Local communities should create partnerships to divert young people from crime but there must be 'sufficient secure accommodation in the community that if youngsters are out of control you must have the ability to put them under lock and key until they do behave'. But before it can address the electorate Labour must sort out the internal constitutional wrangle with the unions which has already cast a long shadow over this week's conference. The vote - on the superficially arcane issue of just how trades unionists should participate in the selection of Labour's parliamentary candidates - has become a litmus test of whether the party is willing to change. Mr Blair puts it thus: 'It is necessary to advocate change within Labour before we can win the opportunity to change the country.' He will not say it, but he is clearly furious with the refusal of many of the unions to back a relatively modest reform. The union leaders are clinging on to their institutional levers within the party but forgetting that real influence comes with government. Mr Blair leaves the impression that if he were leader, OMOV would be just the start. In his view, Labour's hope for the future lies in re-establishing its links with ordinary people by a determined drive to recruit more individual members. The model is his own Sedgefield constituency where an experimental membership scheme has brought the party hundreds of new recruits. He believes the cut-price membership proposed for union members would further tilt the balance in local parties away from the internal preoccupations of their activists towards the concerns of the wider community. It all sounds pretty convincing stuff, the more so because it is set out with a calm fluency and coherence all too rare these days in British politics. It is the sort of programme that might even win Labour a general election. But, as this week's Brighton conference will remind us, Mr Blair has as many enemies as friends in his own party.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1953    Born in Edinburgh.

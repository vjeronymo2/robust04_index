			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Programmes aplenty but few new ideas Every party in this campaign has gone through the motions of presenting a programme. This in itself is a considerable novelty. Italian parties have never previously bothered with programmes because it was taken for granted who was likely to win the elections. Thus people either voted for the five prospective government parties or the opposition. In the case of the government vote, the electorate knew there would be near complete continuity with the policies of the outgoing coalition. A vote for the opposition was never a credible endorsement of a programme of government. However, this time a large number of parties could form part of the next government. They have been obliged therefore to prepare policy proposals - but what is on offer bears all the signs of being hastily conceived. At the same time no one party has come up with original ideas to tackle the problems of Italy's huge debt stock, rising unemployment and inefficient administration. Nor, despite appearances, is it a real battle between a free market right and a statist left. The Progressive Alliance on the left has come to endorse the market economy and believes in the Maastricht criteria of convergence. Meanwhile, the right's Freedom Alliance contains an odd mix of Forza Italia's enterprise culture and the neo-fascist MSI's long-standing ideas of the corporatist state. Economic policy guidelines: The Progressives openly support a continuation of the present government's internationally approved policy of budget austerity, bringing inflation below 4 per cent and ensuring the debt stock as a percentage of gross domestic product peaks in 1996. The centre Italian Pact follows the same line but says so more discreetly. Forza Italia has played down austerity for electoral reasons and placed the emphasis on stimulating a rapid recovery. Taxes: All parties agree on the need to simplify the jungle of direct and indirect taxes. The most radical approach is that of Forza Italia which also favours a 33 per cent single rate of income tax. The main disagreement between 'left' and 'right' is over the role played by tax incentives. Mr Berlusconi sees tax breaks as an important stimulant of new investment. The Progressives are afraid to be seen lowering the tax burden on the rich. All want to avoid any further increase in fiscal pressure (currently at 42 per cent). The Pact talks of imposing a constitutional limit of 40 per cent; Forza Italia wants to reduce pressure by one percentage point a year over the next decade. Both the Northern League and the PDS want to reduce the excessively centralised tax system and make it more federal with greater power for the regions. Jobs: Employment is the electorate's biggest concern and the parties recognise they have to demonstrate a commitment to create jobs. This raises the most stark contrast in policies. The left is placing much hope on the Delors plan for stimulating Europe-wide employment through grand infrastructure projects. The Progressives also emphasise raising standards of professional training and channelling investment (public and private) into areas of high-technology. The right, especially Forza Italia and the League, believe the key lies in greater flexibility in the labour market, with easier rules on hiring and firing - coupled with fiscal incentives to hire personnel. Social security: There is a contrast between the left and centre's belief in the value of a revitalised and slimmer welfare state, and the right's pledge to create more room for private initiative in healthcare and pensions. The growing deficit in the state-operated pensions scheme has forced all parties to propose solutions. Forza Italia and the League want to create the conditions to permit a rapid shift towards private pension funds. The Progressives believe existing legislation on pension funds is sufficient and would ensure that the state continues to guarantee a safety-net for the less fortunate. Almost certainly the next government will be forced to speed up the gradualist move to raise the pensionable age to 65. Privatisation: Save reticence from the MSI and Reconstructed Communists at opposite ends of the spectrum, the parties endorse a slimming of state involvement through privatisation. The existing privatisation programme is likely to be respected. The main differences centre on the timetable and the residual control of the state in 'strategic' areas like telecommunications (Telecom Italia) and energy (Eni). Forza Italia wants the process to move more quickly and the state to withdraw more completely. The centre and left would respect the Ciampi guidelines but the left will be tempted to retain some control over telecoms and Eni. Foreign policy: Italy's commitment to the European Union is supported by the main parties. The degree of commitment will be determined by the strength and/or weakness of the next government. All parties are anxious to see Italy play an active role in resolving the crisis in former Yugoslavia. The right wants to see a more active overseas military role and is committed to raising the profile and professionalism of Italy's armed forces. All parties would be forced by budgetary constraints to cut foreign aid.</p>

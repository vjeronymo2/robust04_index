			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Belgian sale unsettles gold market NEWS THAT the Belgian National Bank has sold 202 tonnes of gold worth about Dollars 2bn unsettled the London bullion market yesterday. 'It is very difficult in such quiet times to pitch one's tent and say yes, it's bullish, or yes, it's bearish,' one trader said. The Belgian deal was completed two weeks ago. After this morning's announcement the gold price moved ahead on relief that such a large sale had been completed without disrupting the market. But fears of possible copy-cat sales from other central banks checked the advance. Gold closed at Dollars 342.35 a troy ounce, up 20 cents on the day. Mr Andy Smith, precious metals analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland, said the gold market had to ponder two variables: how much of the gold had come on to the spot market and over what period? The sale also raised questions about the role of central banks in the gold market. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst with Williams de Broe, pointed out that when the Belgians sold 127 tonnes of gold in March 1989 most of the trade had been done with other central banks and away from the spot market. Mr Wiktor Bielski of Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken said that the Belgian move had left about 50 per cent of the bank's total reserves in gold - which took it into line with its EC neighbours. It would be logical to see a shift of gold from the central banks of Europe and the developed countries to central banks of the developing countries in the Far East, where gold reserves are low, he suggested. There is speculation in the market over whether gold will be counted as reserves when a new European Central Bank is opened. 'If you are in any doubt that gold will be allowable, then you move it now,' said one observer. Another pointed out that while the sale had been handled sensitively, it was nevertheless a sale at low prices. 'Who's next?' he asked. The Belgian sale will yield about BFr5bn (Pounds 85m) of annual interest income for the treasury, according to a senior official, reports Reuter from Brussels. Extra revenue would be welcome for the Belgian state, struggling to reduce its budget deficit and saddled with a crippling BFr8,000bn debt, the highest in the European Community in terms of gross domestic product.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Employers round on A-level system A-level examinations in England and Wales came under strong attack from employers yesterday as it emerged that the numbers taking mathematics and physics had both dropped by more than 5 per cent for the second year running. Although more students passed A-levels than ever before, the reaction to the results increased pressure on the government to reform the examination system and invest in science teaching. The Confederation of British Industry said the economy's development would suffer as a result of the drop in school scientists. It said the overall failure rate in the exams, although only 17.1 per cent, still represented 'an avoidable waste of resources, time and money'. Almost 124,000 A-level entries resulted in failure, it added. The Institute of Directors said the 'flight from A-level science and maths' reflected 'a deep deficiency in Britain's basic education system' and was 'a competitiveness crisis waiting to happen'. The numbers only taking science and mathematics A-levels had already dropped 40 per cent over the previous decade. Dr John Williams, education executive of the Engineering Council, said companies were finding it increasingly difficult to recruit high quality maths and science graduates. The Engineering Employers' Federation complained of a 'culture bias' against industry which had been fostered by teachers. Miss Ann Parkin, chief executive of the Standing Conference on Schools' Science and Technology, which promotes science in schools, said that reform of A-levels was vital. 'By allowing children to take three subjects only after 16, we are effectively self-selecting people out from sciences from a very early age. The trends we are seeing now are the results of inaction in previous years,' she said. Earlier this week, Ofsted, the independent government inspectorate, recommended extra investment in school science facilities and in in-service teacher training. 'Not all science and mathematics teachers have the skills and talents required to do their job,' it said. Picture, Page 7</p>

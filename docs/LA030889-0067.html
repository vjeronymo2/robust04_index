			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRODOWY, HART BATTLE BACK TO TOP FONTANA IN GIRLS' PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Sara Wilson and Nikki Brodowy scored back-to-back baskets to break a 49-49  fourth-quarter tie and spark Hart High to a 68-57 win over Fontana in the first  round of the Division I state girls' playoffs before a packed gym at Hart High  on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Indians, who had trailed by 15 points in the first quarter, used Wilson's  spinning jump shot with 7:15 to play to key a 10-0 run that put the Steelers  away for good.  </P> <P> Hart outscored the visitors, 19-8 down the stretch. Fontana (27-3), the  runner-up in the Southern Section 5-AA Division, was held to 12 points in the  fourth quarter on five-of-14 shooting from the field.  </P> <P> The Indians' comeback began a quarter earlier as Brodowy -- who finished with a  team-high 18 points -- scored 10 in the third quarter to help pull Hart back  into the game.  </P> <P> Brodowy opened the second half by hitting a 15-foot jump shot, a 12-foot shot  from the baseline and a layup to cut Fontana's lead to 39-36. But she wasn't  finished.  </P> <P> About two minutes later she dipped under a defender and made an eight-foot bank  shot to trim the deficit to one point, 45-44.  </P> <P> With 1:51 to play in the third quarter, Wilson took a pass from Kim Posey and  scored underneath to give Hart its first lead, 47-45. Hart led, 49-45, at the  end of the period.  </P> <P> Hart Coach Pam Walker said that the home crowd played a key role in the  Indians' comeback.  </P> <P> "The crowd is the best thing about playing in a town like this," Walker said.  "We've been the only game in town for the last couple of weeks."  </P> <P> However, the fans didn't play much of a role early on.  </P> <P> Fontana center Danielle Carter, who averages a Southern Section-high 30 points  a game, stunned the crowd by scoring 15 points in the first quarter as the  Steelers built a 15 point lead and finished the quarter holding a 25-12  advantage. But as the Hart defense began to heat up, Carter cooled and scored  just eight points in the final three quarters to finish with 23.  </P> <P> Hart caught fire at the beginning of the second quarter. Freshman Anjanette  Dionne ignited the comeback with back-to-back three-point bombs that trimmed  the deficit to 26-20.  </P> <P> "They told me to slow it down and be patient," said Dionne, who finished with  13 points. "And if I was open I could hit it."  </P> <P> The teams traded baskets the remainder of the quarter and Fontana took a 36-30  lead into halftime.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ESCONDIDO-BASED CARVER CLOSED AT COST OF $58 MILLION  </P> <P> The Federal Home Loan Bank Board on Friday closed insolvent Carver Savings  &amp; Loan, an Escondido-based institution that reported a negative net worth  of nearly $10 million Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Federal regulators, who transferred Carver's insured deposits to two other  California institutions, estimated Friday that the transaction would cost the  FHLBB about $58 million. Regulators did not known how many deposits exceeded  limits of the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp., which covers accounts  of up to $100,000.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. has acquired  deposits originated through Carver's Escondido office. The branch will be open  for business under the California Federal name Monday morning, according to  Dave Barr, a spokesman for the FSLIC.  </P> <P> Irvine-based New West Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. has acquired deposits  originated by Carver's San Diego-based money desk operation, which "sold  brokered jumbo certificates of deposit by telephone," Barr said.  </P> <P> Carver had assets of $276 million and liabilities of $292 million Nov. 30, Barr  said. The failed institution's regulatory capital fell to a negative $16.2  million. Carver reported total deposits of $281.2 million Nov. 30.  </P> <P> Carver, formerly Escondido Savings, was purchased by Leroy Carver, a Newport  Beach businessman, in 1985. However, federal and state regulators pressured him  to leave the S&amp;L during 1988. He since has filed suit in Orange County  against two former executives at the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L's recent losses were in part generated by an imbalance between  interest rates Carver was paying to depositors and interest rates it charged on  loans to customers.  </P> <P> "On Sept. 30, 56% of its deposits were paying interest rates of 8.31%, but  (most of) its adjustable-rate loans carried interest rates of 8.13%," Barr  said.  </P> <P> Carver is the third troubled thrift to be resolved by the FSLIC this year. Last  year, regulators handled 205 troubled thrifts through liquidation, merger or  acquisition, and 18 others were stabilized.  </P></p>

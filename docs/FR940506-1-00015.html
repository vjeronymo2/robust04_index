Remittances must be in the form of a personal check, bank draft, or postal money order. Remittances are to be made payable to the Treasurer of the United States. Certified documents may be requested for an official government or legal function, and will be provided at a rate established by 32 CFR part 286 for each authentication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) When requests are denied in whole or in part in accordance with 32 CFR part 286, the requester will be advised of the identity of the official making the denial, the reason for the denial, the right of appeal of the decision, and the identity of the person to whom an appeal may be addressed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Facilities for the review or reproduction of records following approval of the request or appeal are available at the Defense Investigative Service, Office of Information and Public Affairs, 1340 Braddock Place, Alexandria, Virginia 22314&hyph;1651.

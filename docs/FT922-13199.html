			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: How Mr Major's wares are seen overseas Last Friday, UK equity and bond markets soared as investors scrambled to take advantage of the Tories' surprise election victory. This morning, overseas investors in particular will be taking a more considered look at the attractions of the UK under Mr John Major. Their conclusions could have profound consequences. International investors bought well over Pounds 15bn worth of gilts and equities last year, against Pounds 5bn in 1990. Also, their confidence in sterling will determine the new government's ability to cut interest rates. Convincing overseas investors that sterling will not be devalued within the European exchange rate mechanism is vital if buying is to continue. Losses from holding equities and bonds denominated in a depreciating currency can easily wipe out any gains from the investments themselves. 'It's a very good result,' said Mr Rudolf Enz, economist with Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. 'My impression is that interest rates could come down without endangering the value of the pound. There was a risk premium on UK rates because of fears a Labour victory would lead to a falling currency. Now the uncertainty has gone, the risk premium should be reduced.' Mr Anthony Pearce of Vontobel Asset Management commented there could be scope for half a percentage point cut in interest rates as early as this week, with another half a point cut possible if a strengthened currency permitted Britain to enter the narrow band of the European Monetary System. But while restoring confidence in sterling is vital to attracting overseas investment in UK stocks and bonds, international investors remain split about the wider economic outlook. Many remain sceptical that the new government can stimulate either the economy or the stock market in the near term. 'With the Conservatives back in power it is difficult to foresee any major changes,' said Mr Philippe Ithurbite, a capital markets economist at Societe Generale in Paris. 'There is still no sign of economic recovery in the UK and, until this comes, the markets will stay depressed.' Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist of Bayerische Vereinsbank in Frankfurt, said that it was too early to base investment decisions on the poll result, despite Friday's rises in the stock and gilts markets and by sterling. 'This is only an advance instalment of confidence. It provides a basis for Mr Major to work out policies to benefit the economy and develop more clarity over the party's attitude to Europe,' he said. Equally, Japanese businessmen recognise that the election alone will not change the condition of the UK economy. As the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, said this weekend, Mr Major has very little room for manoeuvre in trying to stimulate the economy by managing the country's monetary and fiscal policies. But others are less circumspect and are predicting a wider upturn in economic activity. Mr Harald Schmidlin, European stock market analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said: 'The Conservative victory is like a small economic package. For me, the recession is over.' Mr John Hickling, who runs a European fund for Fidelity, the US fund manager, believes the London market is still inexpensive by international and historical standards. The first glimmers of an economic recovery are apparent, and he thinks UK companies are geared for growth because they have taken the right action to cut costs and improve balance sheets. Mr Pelle Danielsen, UK equity analyst at Credit Suisse in Zurich, has been backing defensive quality stocks with a high American exposure. But he thinks the time is right to consider cyclical stocks, including capital goods companies and banks. Vontobel's Mr Pearce expects the equity market to continue moving up over the next month or so, but says further impetus will come only from real signs of economic recovery. Overseas buying of sterling bonds could be more important to Mr Major's government than overseas buying of equities. On Friday alone, the Bank of England showed its eagerness to fund as much as possible while sentiment is good by selling up to Pounds 4bn bonds. However, this pace of issuance will not be maintained. One negative factor is that Japanese investors, some of the biggest buyers of gilts last year, are now preoccupied with the weakness of domestic markets. Japanese investors invested Dollars 74bn in foreign securities last year, with the UK attracting 20 per cent of the total. Much of this cash went into government bonds, which were seen as attractive because of the high yields available compared with other leading markets. But last year's level of Japanese investment in UK securities was exceptionally high and is unlikely to be maintained. Mr Haruaki Deguchi, managing director of the London affiliate of Nippon Life, the life insurer, says: 'The flow of Japanese investments in securities does not depend on whether Mr Major or Mr Kinnock is in power but on the state of the Tokyo markets.' It remains to be seen whether overseas money from elsewhere can plug the gap. International investors remain nervous about the state of the government's finances and the amount which needs to be borrowed.

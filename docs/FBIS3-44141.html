The ADI, headed by Gabriel Costa, who is currently  President Miguel Trovoada's adviser for legal and political  affairs, had earlier participated in the 1992 municipal  elections as an "independent group" and won in the Cantagalo  district, south of the Sao Tome island. Cantagalo is an "area  of influence" of the head of state.    Mr. Costa's participation was challenged at the Supreme  Court  by the ruling the party, the Party of Democratic Convergence  (PCD-GR) whose arguments were rejected by the Supreme Court.    The People's Alliance was formed in Lisbon and its  supporters  are mainly Sao Tome immigrants in Portugal, as well as children  of Portuguese nationals of Sao Tomean origin who left the  archipelago at its independence in 1975. The AP is headed by  Carlos Espirito Santo, who is currently living in Portugal.    Multiparty politics was introduced in 1990. So far, the  country has four political parties, three of which are presented  in parliament.</p>

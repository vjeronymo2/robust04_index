			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: DM suffers further weakness THE D-MARK fell against the dollar and was under pressure against several European currencies yesterday, in spite of signals which diverted attention away from rate cut hopes and, consequently, should have helped the currency, writes Peter John. Initially, German data gave some lift to the D-Mark. M3 money supply growth came in at 7 per cent for September, against 7.2 per cent the previous month, but still above the market consensus of 6.9 per cent. As the Bundesbank has said it would not cut rates unless money supply was on target, the slightly higher figure saw the currency pick up by more than 1/2 pfennig from its close in New York. Then, the weekly securities repurchase was carried out with the lower level only reaching 6.77 per cent. There had been hopes that the Bundesbank would accept bids as low as 6.65 per cent from the commercial banks and the higher figure was seen as dampening hopes of easier rates. The market ignored a higher than anticipated injection of liquidity. However, this coincided with a large sale of D-Marks for dollars, believed to have come from a German corporation. That sell order set the tone of the day and ensured that the US currency rose above DM1.65, through its recent trading range. There was a flurry of excitement that the dollar, further boosted by Tuesday's encouraging figures on housing, had achieved a 'chart break-out'. But Mr Avinash Persaud, an economist with JP Morgan, reflected the considered view when he said: 'It was a rally largely built on sand.' By the end of the day the D-Mark had recovered to DM1.6450 to the dollar, still below the previous European close of DM1.6370. In New York it finished at DM1.6387. The D-Mark's early fall gave some respite for the beleaguered French and Belgian currencies yesterday, but any doubts on a German rate cut are bound to spill over into the franc economies, which desperately need easier monetary policy to stimulate growth. The Belgian currency reached BFr21.784 to the D-Mark at best, but worries over the social pact on wages and jobs were not dispelled by details released on Tuesday and the currency slipped back to finish at BFr21.86, down from BFr21.82. The French franc rallied to FFr3.5285 to the D-Mark but closed at FFr3.5350, against FFr3.5320 previously. Sterling received a boost from stronger retail sales figures than the market had forecast. A rise of 0.5 per cent in the sales volume for September helped the pound against several currencies, although a  3/4 pfennig rise to DM2.45 was largely a manifestation of a weaker German currency. The pound rallied from a low of Dollars 1.4850 to end at Dollars 1.49, against a previous Dollars 1.4920. The sterling exchange rate index, which measures the pound against a basket of leading currencies, rose from 79.7 to 79.9.</p>

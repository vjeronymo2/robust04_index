			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Government braced for escalation of strikes THE FRENCH government is bracing itself for an escalation of the strikes surrounding Air France this week, following the failure of weekend negotiations aimed at defusing the dispute. The strike by ground staff, protesting against an Air France recovery plan which includes 4,000 job cuts, is due to be joined tomorrow in a 24-hour strike by Air France pilots and cabin staff and by unions at Aeroports de Paris, the airport authority, and at Air Inter, the domestic airline controlled by Air France. The dispute, now in its second week, represents a dilemma for the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, which faces its first serious industrial dispute since taking office in March and which fears a spread of public-sector unrest. The government is seeking to restructure inefficient state-owned industry to ease pressure on the budget deficit - targeted at FFr317bn (Pounds 36.5bn) this year - and to enable the sale of state-owned groups it has slated for privatisation. But such measures threaten to fuel protests within the public sector and add to widespread anxiety about the unemployment rate, which is 11.7 per cent. A number of other public sector protests are planned. In addition to the Air France strike, unions have called for a day of mass action on November 18 which is expected to hit France's railways, postal and telecommunications services. France Telecom and the railways are not on the privatisation list, but a one-day strike earlier this month drew wide support from workers at these groups, reflecting fears about job cuts and opposition to the government's employment bill, which is aimed at increasing flexbility in French labour law. The threat of broader public-sector actions has prompted the government to step in quickly at Air France. In negotiations on Friday night and Saturday morning, Mr Bernard Bosson, the transport minister, offered a series of concessions to Air France's unions, including a proposal that pay cuts be limited to 1 per cent for the airline's lowest-paid workers and that reductions in overtime pay could also be revised. But the unions rejected the compromise offer and demanded renegotiation of the recovery plan announced last month by Mr Bernard Attali, Air France's chairman. 'This dispute cannot be ended unless Mr Attali's plan is completely redrawn,' a spokesman for the CGT said yesterday. The government and Mr Attali, however, argue that the plan is vital for the survival of Air France, which lost FFr3.8bn in the first six months of the year. The situation at Paris' main airports was relatively peaceful yesterday following the clashes between riot police and strikers on Thursday and Friday. But Air France continued to be severely affected by the dispute, with only a handful of medium- and long-range flights leaving from Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports. Air France said it hoped that tomorrow would see the peak in the dispute and that negotiations with the unions could be reopened following the planned 24-hour strike by Air Inter and Aeroports de Paris. The government took some encouragement at the weekend from a pay agreement with four civil service unions. Under the terms of the agreement, civil servants will receive a pay rise of 5 per cent for 1994 and 1995, slightly less than the expected level of inflation.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: The end of the house that Rachel built The best works of art are dynamic things, which can unleash effects undreamt of by their creators. Rachel Whiteread's 'House' was such a work and its destruction on Tuesday was sad to witness. The appearance of 'House' at the end of last year electrified the debate about contemporary art, bringing it into the public domain in the most direct way by erecting a large scale monument on a London street. For the artist, the piece was simply the logical next step in the development of her work, making casts of domestic objects and spaces. But casting a house, as much as building it, requires the permission of the relevant authorities, subjecting the normally independent creation of a work of art to certain outside controls. The lease granted on the site was temporary, the destruction of the work accepted as part of the conditions for its creation. Once revealed, however, the concrete cast of the living spaces of a former private residence in Bow took on a life of its own. An estimated 100,000 people visited it, and a petition signed by 3,500 called for it to be made permanent. It was not, and a remarkable and important work has been lost. The speeches made at the Turner Prize dinner (Rachel Whiteread of course won the award) referred to dunces and the embattled position of contemporary art, but they did not win over the authorities of Bow, nor open hearts and minds to the ready acceptance of contemporary art. Britain has produced wonderful artists and produces them still: Rachel Whiteread is one of them. But although the Turner Prize is rightly intended as an honour, the critical wrangling surrounding it reveals the unease with which we contemplate the art of our time. A cheque, however substantial, is not the same as a welcome in the heart, a secure place in the national bosom. Bow preferred an empty space to a unique monument to the experience of actually living there. The one winner of the Turner Prize has literally thousands of anonymous and struggling peers. Rachel Whiteread recognised this by handing over her second award, Pounds 40,000 from the K Foundation for the artist judged, by popular vote, worst of the Turner Prize candidates, to be distributed to ten other artists, selected from an open submission. This dignified solution to the acceptance of an 'award' intended only to humiliate was an object lesson in awareness and generosity, a lesson which those who mock our visual arts would do well to contemplate.</p>

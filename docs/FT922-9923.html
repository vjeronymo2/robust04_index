			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Tough challenge for LA's task force chief MR PETER UEBERROTH, named by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley to lead reconstruction efforts in the riot-torn city, is a man who thrives on challenges, but many see his latest undertaking as daunting. More than 1,600 businesses were destroyed or severely damaged in South-Central Los Angeles in three days of violence. A total of 5,200 buildings were severely damaged. Mr Bradley said that he chose Mr Ueberroth to head the task force because of the superb job he did as head of the committee that organised the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, winning unprecedented support from the private sector and ultimately recording a Dollars 215m surplus for the city. A keen sportsman, Mr Ueberroth also served as US baseball commissioner from 1984-89, and is credited with solving the financial problems of the sport. Mr Ueberroth, who is a staunch Republican, has been mentioned in some circles as a potential political candidate. He is reputed to be a smart, tough negotiator and a good organiser who is skilled at keeping the peace but mobilising support for his cause. He currently heads the Contrarian Group, an organisation that invests in troubled companies, aiming to turn them around. The son of a travelling salesman in aluminium siding, Mr Ueberroth, 54, began his business career in Hawaii, where he was hired by the financier Mr Kirk Kerkorian to help him establish a non-scheduled airline. At the age of 23, Mr Ueberroth founded his own charter airline service, but the venture failed. None the less, Mr Ueberroth went on to a successful career in travel-related services, founding and acquiring companies that provide reservation services, travel agencies and hotels. In 1989 he mounted a bid to acquire the now defunct Eastern Airlines. He has recently been in the public eye as head of the Council on California Competitiveness, which last week delivered a damning report on the state's business environment. which concluded that California is 'on the road to fiscal disaster'. 'Government in California is not working at any level; it is in a state of paralysis,' the report asserts. In Los Angeles, Mr Ueberroth must cut through government red tape and persuade the private sector to invest in what to many appears the most unlikely of 'turnrounds'. Although local government leaders welcomed Mr Ueberroth's involvement, many remain sceptical about his ability to revive parts of the city that were economically depressed even before last week's devastation. Despite the scale of the task, he exudes confidence. 'We are not going to put it back the way it was. We are going to make it better,' he said, after touring the riot-ravaged streets of South-Central Los Angeles over the weekend.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / People: IBJ's capital markets emphasis Toshiki Tobe has been appointed chief executive of IBJ International, the London capital markets operation of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's largest long-term credit bank. He replaces Yoshio Osawa, who is returning to Tokyo this month to take up a position as general manager of the securities business. He will be appointed to the board at next month's annual general meeting. Tobe has been based in London for 18 months, as managing director in charge of capital market operations. IBJ has a policy of creating an overlap between a current chief executive and his successor, unlike many Japanese institutions. Tobe says the firm plans to strengthen its presence in the capital markets, including the derivatives side of the business. For example, IBJ will soon put traders on the floor of the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe.) IBJ International has a staff of 300 in London, and is one of the most active Japanese financial institutions in the international capital markets. According to IFR Securities Data, which tracks bond financings, IBJ ranks 21st in the Eurobond league table, after Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko, but ahead of any other Japanese bank subsidiaries. The firm is not active in the equities business, from which the parent is excluded under Japanese law. IBJ also has a branch in London through which its corporate lending business is channelled.</p>

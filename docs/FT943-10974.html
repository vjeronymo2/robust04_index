			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Cattle prices hit by EU export curbs Cattle prices at UK livestock auctions have fallen by up to 30 per cent following last week's introduction of European Union curbs on British beef exports which are aimed at stopping the spread of 'mad cow' disease. Some butchers were also reporting a fall in beef sales, the Meat and Livestock Commission said yesterday. But it was unsure if this was a response to the latest publicity over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or the hot weather encouraging people to eat salads. Livestock prices have fallen even though many farmers are holding their animals back from market in the face of the new rules, which state that carcass beef for export must come from herds free of BSE for six years, rather than two years previously. The price falls mainly affect beef which is processed into meat pies and sausages and industry sources said it would be some time before there was any impact on retail prices. The Livestock Auctioneers' Association said yesterday it was seeking an urgent meeting with Mr William Waldegrave, the new agriculture minister, over the restrictions agreed by EU farm ministers two weeks ago. Mr Jim Watson, association president, said prices of cull cows, or old dairy cows, had fallen by 30 per cent, while those of young steers and heifers were down by about 10 per cent. 'It's because there's too much beef on the market,' he said. 'At a stroke, we've lost our export market overnight.' Carcass, or bone-in, beef accounts for 84 per cent of British beef exports to the EU. Of the 107,000 tonnes of bone-in beef exported last year, cull cows made up 70 per cent, with young cattle accounting for the rest. Because the cows are old, it is more difficult to trace their history and more likely they will have spent some time on a farm with BSE. Some 52 per cent of dairy herds have had at least one case of the disease. Mr Watson said the agriculture ministry was creating too much paperwork for farmers and delaying export of the minority of animals that could be given a clean bill of health. Mr Martin Burtt, chairman of the National Farmers' Union livestock committee, said a two-tier market had opened up, with animals that carry BSE-free certification commanding a 70 per cent premium in some markets. He urged the ministry to circumvent the Data Protection Act and give farmers names and addresses of BSE-free farms so they could trace the history of the animals they want to sell. He said the ministry received 7,000 inquiries from farmers last Friday. The agriculture ministry said its computer experts were looking at ways to help farmers trace animals' health history.</p>

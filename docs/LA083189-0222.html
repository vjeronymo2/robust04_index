			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NATION'S BIGGEST RETAILERS REPORT MIXED SALES RESULTS FOR AUGUST  </P> <P> The nation's biggest retailers today issued mixed sales reports for August,  with department and apparel stores benefiting from back-to-school business but  mass merchandisers suffering through another month of lackluster results.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said consumers continued to spend carefully.  </P> <P> "These are not boom times, and we see a cautious consumer," said Walter Loeb,  an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. "I believe we are heading for a  slow-growth period."  </P> <P> Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, and  retail sales are considered a key indicator of spending trends.  </P> <P> Consumers have cut back on purchases of what are called discretionary items --  as opposed to necessities such as food -- because of rising mortgage payments  and other credit costs.  </P> <P> Their caution has hurt big general storeowners such as the nation's largest  retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co.  </P> <P> Sears said its August sales were up 2.3% overall, but sales at stores open at  least a year -- known as same-store or comparable-store sales in the industry  -- fell 1.1%. K mart Corp. also had a disappointing August, with overall sales  up 4.8% and same-store sales up 1.5%.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Tehama County Sheriff Mike Blanusa's son is wanted in connection with two  murders and Blanusa says he would turn him in -- if he knew where he was. Rudy  Mike Blanusa Jr., 35, was cited Sunday on Fox Network's "America's Most Wanted"  program. He is wanted in the 1986 killings of brothers Gilbert Garza Flores,  26, and Joe Garza Flores, 29, whose bodies were found near Modesto, 190 miles  south of Red Bluff, the Tehama County seat. Sheriff Blanusa, 56, told a  reporter: "I'm not a parent that says, 'My kid couldn't have done it.' " He  said his son had not been a problem until he got a divorce.  </P></p>

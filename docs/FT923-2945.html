			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Candidates take tactical fight to timber heartland PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton both appeared in Oregon yesterday in an attempt to wrest some tactical advantage from a corner of the country riven by the debate over economic development versus the environment. Mr Bush was expected to use his visit to portray the Clinton-Gore presidential ticket as being in the pocket of ecological extremists. As a prelude last week he issued a federal edict making possible the logging of more dead timber. While the president tours the small towns at the heart of the timber industry, Mr Clinton's appearances are concentrated more on urban areas, where his message on the need to combat general economic deprivation is likely to be better received. He has also promised to mediate in the long-running dispute between the industry and environmentalists, at its most bitter in the controversy over preservation of the Northern Spotted Owl. But the candidates' twin focus on the west coast in the first part of this week illustrates a broader tactical purpose. For Mr Clinton it is to consolidate his strong position in the region, while for Mr Bush it is to tie his opponent down in a part of the country which is probably going to vote for the Democrats in any case. State polls show Mr Clinton ahead by wide margins in California, Oregon and Washington. Indeed, his lead in national polls - by 53-38 per cent in the latest Newsweek survey - in good part reflects his edge in California and New York, the biggest states. However, some analysts suggest this means Mr Clinton's potential vote in November is 'inefficiently' allocated and implies that the race in great swathes of the country, especially the industrial midwest and some of the border southern states, are closer than might appear to be the case. Both campaigns concede that these states, along with Florida and Texas, are more critical battlegrounds than the far west. But it would be hard for Mr Bush to write off California, in particular. According to the Los Angeles Times newspaper, former president Richard Nixon, a Californian himself, is urging Mr Bush to forget about the state, concentrate on the midwest, and stop associating with extreme conservatives. Mr Nixon, the newspaper reported, thinks the president's chances of re-election are 'about 30 per cent'.</p>

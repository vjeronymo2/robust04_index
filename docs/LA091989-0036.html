			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Everything Old Is New Again Department: New York is expecting a new production  of the old musical "The Band Wagon" to be on Broadway about this time next  year. The nearly 60-year-old show -- with a score that includes "That's  Entertainment" and "Dancing in the Dark" -- originally featured Fred and Adele  Astaire, and Fred Astaire later starred in a film version with Cyd Charisse.  The planned production will have a book by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, with  Gene Saks set to direct. Max Weitzenhoffer, co-producer with Don Black, told  the New York Times that "we're going to try for a musical that's fabulous in  sound, not masses of scenery falling around. It will be a lot of fun. It's not  going to be done for intellectual qualities." The cost: about $4.5 million.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Yalcin Dogan: "Cyprus Has Created Turmoil in </F> Ankara" -- punctuation as published]    [Text] Ciller has suspended Turkey's aid to north Cyprus,  including the transfer of funds.... In other words, she has  imposed an effective "embargo" on north Cyprus.... However, not  satisfied with that, she conveyed a message with Minister of  State Mehmet Ali Yilmaz to the effect that she "will solve the  problem. Therefore, Rauf Denktas must not create any  difficulty."    "Two separate lobbies" have been established in Turkey on  the  subject of Cyprus. A very high-ranking official has jokingly  said the following: "A U.S. lobby and a Turkish lobby exist in  Ankara on the Cyprus problem.... President Clinton and Prime  Minister Ciller make up the U.S. lobby and President Suleyman  Demirel, Speaker of Parliament Husamettin Cindoruk, Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin, and the TRNC [Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus] Government make up the Turkish lobby!" Two  opposing groups have confronted each other in the full meaning  of the word at the present time....    The promise Prime Minister Ciller made to President Clinton  in the United States last week to the effect that she will  resolve the Cyprus problem and the statement President Clinton  made later to the effect that "Ciller has promised that an  important development will take place in a few days" have  created a turmoil in Ankara. A TRNC parliamentary delegation  accompanied by Husamettin Cindoruk called on President Demirel  at about the time when Ankara was informed on President  Clinton's statement. The delegation arrived in Ankara to hold  contacts "within the framework of the parliament but not with  the government." The arrival of the TRNC delegation on the eve  of a possible development on the Cyprus problem brought to light  the existing rift in Ankara.  <H5>  General Session on Cyprus To Be Held Earlier </H5>   The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] decided to hold a  general session on Cyprus some time ago. A decision was made a  few weeks ago to hold the convocation on 3 May. A general  session would be held on that day on Cyprus... However,  Ciller's visit to the United States and the differing views in  Ankara prompted the TGNA to change that date. A decision was  made to hold it on Tuesday, 26 April.    The Cyprus problem suddenly became the focus of attention in  domestic politics and the difference of views in the higher  echelons of the administration came to light. According to the  information the TRNC parliamentary delegation has conveyed to  President Demirel and Husamettin Cindoruk, "Turkey suspended its  financial aid to north Cyprus during the past few months." "A  serious financial crisis exists in north Cyprus" because Ciller  has suspended Turkey's financial aid. The TRNC Administration  is unable to pay its employees. Although Ciller was informed of  the situation a few times, she responded by informing the TRNC  Administration that Turkey's aid will be "conditional." And,  the condition she put forward was as follows: "The transfer of  any kind of financial aid will be impossible until a political  solution is found to solve the problem."    Turkey's annual aid to north Cyprus has totaled $50 million  or $60 million so far. That amount was automatically  transferred to the TRNC. However, it was suspended in 1994 in  accordance with Ciller's instructions. That state of affairs  has placed the TRNC in a difficult situation.  <H5>  Tense Relations Between Ciller and Cetin </H5>   Ciller refused the requests the TRNC conveyed to Ankara  several times for the resumption of Turkey's financial aid.  Consequently, the TRNC Administration became inclined to  "replace the Turkish currency, which is used in north Cyprus,  with either the U.S. or the British monetary units." The TRNC  Administration is studying the question of which monetary unit  it should adopt at the present time.    The TRNC delegation briefed President Demirel on the  situation in detail yesterday. It has been reported that  Demirel and Cindoruk assured the visiting delegation as follows:  "Do not worry. Excluding Rauf Denktas is impossible. Solving  the problem without Denktas is out of the question." It has  also been reported that Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin shared  Demirel's and Cindoruk's views....    According to very high-ranking sources, "a difference of  opinion exists between Ciller and Cetin on the matters related  to the TRNC." In fact, it has been claimed that "Ciller and  Cetin have not been on speaking terms because of the tense  situation between them for some time now. It has also been said  that Demirel is trying to mediate to remove the tension between  the two officials, that Cetin informs Demirel instead of Ciller  on government affairs, and that Demirel later transfers the  information he receives from Cetin to Ciller."    All that indicates that Ciller has made a promise to  President Clinton "without consulting with anyone in Ankara."  Nevertheless, the question as to what extent her promise can be  fulfilled was unclear right from the beginning. What is crystal  clear, however, is the fact that the officials in Ankara have  clashed on the Cyprus problem and that a deep difference of  views exists among them....</p>

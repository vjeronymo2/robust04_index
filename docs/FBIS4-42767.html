			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] First we come to the D-Day celebrations in  Normandy. NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG notes: The events of the  past naturally formed the focus of the ceremonies. But it was  mainly Bill Clinton who bridged the gap between the past and the  future, saying that the fight for freedom was still continuing.  The Longest Day is not yet over, said the first U.S. President  to stem from the postwar generation. The victims of the  terrible fighting could not have been honored in a better way.  Clinton demonstrated the great impact that the victory of the  Allies continues to have to this very day, says NEUE  OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG.    KOELNISCHE RUNDSCHAU writes: There is no reason to glorify 6  June 1944, the Longest Day. Instead, today one must reflect and  ask oneself where cruel tyrants can and must be stopped, and  when one should carry the banner of freedom and democracy  further with determined action. These questions continue to be  faced by the Allies of World War II and those who have coalesced  with them since that time. The answers are more difficult to  find today than they were at that time, also because the number  of tyrants seems to be increasing without pause, says KOELNISCHE  RUNDSCHAU.    DEISTER UND WESER ZEITUNG, which appears in Hameln, notes:  D-Day, 6 June 1944, was a veritable death sentence for the  first Allied troops to land on the beaches. Under defensive  fire from German artillery and in close combat, a large number  of soldiers lost their lives. Some died for freedom, and others  in defense of the Nazi dictatorship. Fifty years have elapsed  since then, and although Germany in the meantime has returned to  the orbit of equal countries, also in a political sense, and has  undergone a reconciliation with its former enemies, no German  representative had a place at the D-Day celebrations in Great  Britain and Normandy. It is simply stupid to criticize Helmut  Kohl for not having made a greater effort to get invited to the  ceremonies, says DEISTER UND WESER ZEITUNG.    The DIE WELT daily writes: One can note in a critical tone  that the commemoration of the Longest Day on the coast of  Normandy was more than a mere taste of Hollywood. But who is  going to criticize the fact that the former war enemies are  using today's media resources to once again cast a favorable  light on the high quantity of blood spilt by their sons in the  vivid past? This is going to be the last time to do it in this  way. The number of those with memories of direct experience is  dwindling.    Thus, there can be no repetition in the future of the  senseless debate on whether or not the Germans should have been  present on the Channel coast. Where would Chancellor Kohl have  stood? At the bows of Queen Elizabeth's yacht, or on the bridge  of the U.S. aircraft carrier George Washington steaming toward  the former German positions? Or perhaps even in the ruins  there? DIE WELT asks.</p>

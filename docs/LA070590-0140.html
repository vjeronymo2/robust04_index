			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WALNUT;  </P> <P> ACTION ON MEADOWPASS ROAD  </P> <P> One of the city's last incomplete main thoroughfares moved a step closer to  completion last week.  </P> <P> The City Council tentatively approved a housing subdivision plan that includes  right-of-way for an unfinished link of Meadowpass Road just south of Amar Road.  </P> <P> But the council effectively put the plan on hold by delaying a vote on the  developer's request to put two of the proposed eight houses on lots that do not  meet minimum size requirements.  </P> <P> The recommendation from the Planning Commission was to deny the appeal, citing  no extraordinary circumstances. The council voted to rehear the zoning issue at  its Aug. 8 meeting.  </P> <P> City planning officials say the completion of Meadowpass Road would alleviate  traffic congestion along Pierre Road and Walnut Canyon Drive. But some  residents say the reverse would be true, with more motorists gaining access to  already-congested thoroughfares.  </P></p>

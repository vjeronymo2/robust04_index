			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> LOITERING LAW ADOPTED  </P> <P> The City Council has permanently adopted a controversial loitering law that  police say has been instrumental in increasing drug arrests in troubled areas  of the city.  </P> <P> The law, which allows police to arrest a person suspected of loitering to buy  or sell drugs, was adopted last March on an experimental basis, Police Chief  Joseph A. Santoro said.  </P> <P> He said he has met with community leaders and ministers to assuage concerns  that the law is unconstitutional and discriminatory against blacks. There was  no public opposition to the council's unanimous action Tuesday.  </P> <P> The law has has resulted in five arrests. In two cases the charge was upgraded  to felony sale of cocaine and in a third to possession of marijuana. The other  two people who were arrested pleaded guilty to the loitering charge and were  fined $705 and given three years' probation, Santoro said. The council asked  him to report every six months on how the law is working.  </P></p>

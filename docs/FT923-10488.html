			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls on selling of speculative stocks THE Nikkei average resumed its fall to set a six-year low as selling of speculative stocks by dealers depressed the market, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 330.69 to 15,095.95, the lowest level since April 8, 1986. The index moved up in the morning in response to Tuesday's sharp rally on Wall Street, registering a high for the day of 15,605.98. Subsequent selling by investment trusts and dealers pushed share prices down, and the Nikkei dropped to a session's low of 15,024.59 in the afternoon. Volume picked up to 250m shares from 166m but trading by institutional investors was minimal. Declines overwhelmed advances by 851 to 116, with 119 issues unchanged. The Topix index declined 19.48 to a low for the year of 1,170.93, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.45 to 928.17. Traders said although Monday's discount rate cut had lowered yields in the bond and money markets, liquidity failed to improve in the stock market. Short-term rates were led lower by the yield on three-month certificates of deposit, which fell below 4 per cent for the first time since June 1987. Mrs Mineko Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse, said a sustainable liquidity-driven bull market could not be prompted by cuts in the official discount rate: 'Investors are convinced that stocks cannot offer capital gains.' Active support from the Big Four brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - lifted the Nikkei from its intraday low. Analysts believe that if it falls below 15,000, hidden gains on stocks held by leading life assurers would be eroded. Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said the deterioration of assets at large institutional investors would disturb financial authorities. Dealers liquidated positions in speculative theme stocks. Meiji Milk Products, again the day's most active issue, dropped Y61 to Y831, and Okamoto Industries, the condom maker, fell Y110 to Y1,020. Clarion, a speculative favourite, plunged Y100 to Y431. Traders said investors who had bought the issue on margin in March, when the stock attained a high for the year of Y1,360, were unloading their holdings ahead of the margin settlement. Construction issues were weak on worries about loan guarantees extended to affiliates and other small contractors. Sato Kogyo plummeted Y73 to Y580, while Obayashi shed Y23 to Y482. Daikyo, the condominium developer, lost Y46 to Y499 on worries about its financial stability. The fall in short-term rates raised hopes of higher profit margins at banks. Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y10 to Y1,630 and Fuji Bank put on Y20 to Y1,280. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 440.29 to 17,136.39 in volume of 25m shares, as selling by margin buyers pushed share prices down. Roundup THE REGION'S markets were mixed yesterday as the renewed weakness in Tokyo weighed on sentiment. HONG KONG finished higher on late bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index appreciated 74.66 to 5,857.29 in turnover of HKDollars 2.7bn. HSBC Holdings led the actives list and advanced HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53, followed by Hutchison Whampoa, up 30 cents at HKDollars 16.30. Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53.50. TAIWAN remained weak, although there was some activity in the paper sector on forecasts of better earnings. The weighted index slipped 11.78 to 3,947.32 in TDollars 21.47bn turnover. Yuen Foong Yu, the leading paper maker, added TDollars 2.10 at TDollars 32.50 after reporting first-half pre-tax profits of TDollars 500m, and Taiwan Paper gained 80 cents to TDollars 28.90. MANILA gained ground on some positive news in the oil sector. The composite index rose 7.64 to 1,485.31 in combined turnover of 243m pesos. Philippine National Bank firmed 5 pesos to 302.50 pesos and PLDT put on 20 pesos to 1,070 pesos. AUSTRALIA came off earlier highs after Tokyo's fall, the All Ordinaries index ending a net 6.9 up at 1,612.3. Turnover was a low ADollars 352m. Sentiment was helped by the release of second-quarter inflation data showing a fall in the consumer price index. Advance Bank moved forward 40 cents to ADollars 5.60 after releasing better than expected earnings for 1991/92. NEW ZEALAND was dragged lower by a fall in Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE-40 index lost 2.94 to 1,528.48, having earlier risen to 1,541.68. Turnover came to NZDollars 25.6m. Fletcher shed 9 cents to NZDollars 3.17 on news that its Australian division will lose ADollars 44.6m on the sale of property in Melbourne. BANGKOK advanced as Thai Airways put on Bt4 to Bt57.50. The SET index rose 4.01 to 736.58 in turnover of Bt4.9bn. SEOUL's composite index fell 5.61 to 508.84 in turnover of Won99bn. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index rose 17.06, or 1.2 per cent, to 1,429.59. Sembawang Shipyard gained 40 cents to SDollars 7.05 after revealing good half-year results on Tuesday. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded after a four-day fall and the composite index closed 4.94 better at 590.71. BOMBAY reversed a two-day rally and the BSE index receded 75.32, or 2.6 per cent, to 2,755.25.</p>

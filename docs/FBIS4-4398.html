			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Thursday [31 March] reiterated his denial of  allegations that he obtained funds in a dubious way from a  scandal-wrecked trucking firm and through stock transactions.  Hosokawa was speaking at a meeting of the House of Councillors  budget committee.    Answering questions from Tatsuo Shimizu of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), Hosokawa denied suggestions that he had  not repaid 100 million yen he received in 1982 from the Sagawa  Kyubin trucking group and that the money was not a loan but a  secret political donation.    Hosokawa said he has collected as much evidence as he could  and submitted it to the Diet. The documents he has submitted  were enough to prove "the fact that I borrowed 100 million yen  and repaid it," he said.    The premier has said he has lost the receipt for the loan  repayment, and had the Sagawa Kyubin group submit related  documents, including a photocopy of the receipt, to the Diet  last December. Shimizu suggested the submitted documents are  fakes.    Hosokawa said the fact that he had offered his vacation  house  in Yugawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, as collateral and later had  the company return the collateral shows that he repaid the loan.    Shimizu, however, said collateral can be canceled upon an  agreement between the lender and the borrower, thus a  cancellation does not necessarily mean Hosokawa repaid the money.    The prime minister also denied allegations that he  personally  had a hand in the 1986 purchase of 300 shares of  telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.  (NTT). "Even supposing it was my deal, what's wrong with that?"  the premier retorted, prompting uproar and a temporary halt in  the Diet deliberations, which were held ostensibly to debate the  fiscal 1994 provisional budget program.    Hosokawa has repeatedly told the Diet that the share  transaction was conducted by his late father-in-law.    Stock consultant Shuzo Fujiki said Wednesday the NTT deal  was  Hosokawa's. The premier told the House of Representatives  budget committee on Wednesday that he has never met, nor sought  advice from, Fujiki.    Fujiki said he arranged a 418 million yen loan for a then  aide of Hosokawa's from a stock investment company to help  finance the purchase of 300 NTT shares in 1986, just after NTT  went public.    According to Fujiki, the stock investment financing company  agreed to allow Hosokawa to use the name of his father-in-law at  the request of Hosokawa's Financial Secretary Masatoshi Miyama.    Shimizu asked the committee to summon Fujiki as a witness.  He also reiterated demands to summon Miyama.    Hosokawa repeated his objection to summoning Miyama, saying  such testimony may violate the human rights of the former  secretary's family.    When Shimizu compared the Hosokawa allegations to the  Whitewater scandal afflicting U.S. President Bill Clinton and  his wife, Hosokawa responded by saying that the political  systems of the two countries are different.    Hosokawa commented that he is obliged to appear before the  Diet, while the U.S. presidential system does not mandate  comparable appearances by Clinton.    During the lunch break of the committee deliberations,  Hosokawa denied to reporters the truth of a statement by the  head of the LDP chapter in Kumamoto Prefecture who said he  received 1 million yen in 1982 from a campaigner for Hosokawa's  race for the prefectural governorship on the LDP ticket at the  time.    Hosokawa came to power last August, promising change in  Japan's money-driven politics. But his political foes in the  Diet have been relentless in their attempts to prove his alleged  involvement in a series of money scandals involving NTT, Sagawa  Kyubin and other businesses and parties.    Hosokawa has rejected demands from the LDP and the Japanese  Communist Party to produce more data pertaining to the Sagawa  Kyubin affair and other related cases.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 1600 GMT on 24 June carries a 15-minute edition of its  regularly scheduled "Straight Talk" program, with Renato Recio  from TRABAJADORES newspaper, and host Osvaldo Rodriguez from  BOHEMIA magazine, on the issue of differentiated incentives for  diverse sectors of the economy.    Rodriguez opens the debate by stating that he has received  many letters on today's issue, some in favor, some against, and  others urging further explanation.    Recio states that it is not strange to see disagreements on  differentiated incentives or material incentives given for  production work. He adds that the people have an "egalitarian  point of view" and that this is inadequate. Everyone agrees,  however, that the appropriate distribution formula for the Cuban  economy is the socialist formula: "Pay each person according to  the quantity and quality of his work." He goes on to say that  everyone agrees with this but that it is hard to put into  practice. Recio adds: "The problem is when it affects someone  who is not included among those that contribute the most in  quantity and quality of work."    Recio adds that Cuba had not been able to fully apply a  labor-incentive formula. He adds: "The situation now calls for  a policy of incentives by sectors and individuals. There are  other sectors that do not produce, materialistically speaking,  but are important, such as the education and health sectors."    Rodriguez states that Cuban society fairly distributes all  that there is to distribute but that, unfortunately, this cannot  be transferred to the production sector. He adds that some of  the letters received mention extraordinary efforts, but do not  mention results.    Recio states that Raul Castro has stressed that efforts must  be encouraged but only results must be rewarded. He adds:  "There is a certain mind-set in Cuba that praises the man that  exhausts himself in the effort, is seen uncombed, tired, and is  turned into a hero. In a certain sense, heroism requires that  exhausting effort, but that is not always synonymous with  efficiency."    Recio goes on to say that production must precede  distribution and that what little there is is being distributed  with egalitarian criteria. The prioritized sectors -- tourism,  sugar, petroleum, transport, mining, and others -- are to be the  engines of the Cuban economy and the ones that ought to receive  incentives.    Rodriguez points out that sectors involved in garnering  currency could be considered prioritized sectors and that he  believes that these incentives are not being utilized correctly.  He adds: "I am thinking, for example, of those chain stores  called shoppings. Some of the stores distribute equally among  their workers what has come to be called a bag, which is no more  than a monthly stock of products which are hard to come by in  Cuba. This is distributed equally among the workers."    Rodriguez points out the example of the incentive programs  implemented in the electric sector, where workers are rewarded  for meeting certain standards. He stresses that egalitarian  distribution of incentives "is once again dragging us back to  the same situation we are trying to fight."    Recio states that to give all workers the same incentive is  no incentive. He adds: "I believe incentives must be given  within a sector, within a sector to a specific branch, within a  branch to a specific enterprise, within certain enterprise to a  specific factory, and within a factory to specific workers. I  insist on the idea that the same incentive cannot be given to an  indirect worker than to a worker involved directly with  production." Rodriguez closes by stressing the importance of  differentiated incentives to specific workers.</p>

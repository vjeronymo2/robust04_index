			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Weng Hsu-yuan (5040 0647 0954): "Qian </F> Qichen Stresses Need To Reorganize Hong Kong's Three-Tier  Councils After 1997"]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun--Vice Premier and Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen met a delegation from the Hong Kong Federation of  Trade Unions in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today. During  the meeting he stressed that because the Sino-British talks on  the constitutional system had broken up, Hong Kong's three-tier  councils elected by the British Hong Kong Legislative Council  will terminate on 30 June 1997, no matter what methods are  adopted; these three-tier councils will be reorganized after 1  July 1997. He hoped that the Hong Kong Federation of Trade  Unions will, under the banner of loving the country and Hong  Kong, extensively unite people in all circles in Hong Kong and  make contributions to Hong Kong's steady transition as well as  its stability and prosperity.    Cheng Yiu-tong, deputy chief of the delegation, said after  the meeting that Qian Qichen stressed that China and Britain are  big countries and need to improve the current situation.  Although the talks on the constitutional system have ruptured,  there are still opportunities for both sides to cooperate in  other fields, including the economic field. Recent talks on the  new airport and military sites have made headway and the British  Government will send personnel to Beijing soon. These indicate  that there will be an improvement in Sino-British relations.  That the three-tier councils will be reorganized after 1997  does not mean there is anything wrong with the members but  because the electoral system was unilaterally decided by the  British side, Qian Qichen said.    Cheng Yiu-tong quoted Qian Qichen as saying that he agreed  that attention should be strengthened on the Hong Kong people's  livelihood, because this is beneficial to maintaining Hong  Kong's steady transition in the coming three years and the  continuous development of the mainland's reform and opening up  serves as a good guarantee for Hong Kong's steady transition.    Also present at the meeting was Lu Ping, director of the  State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.</p>

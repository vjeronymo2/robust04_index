			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Winning line for Ladbroke News that the government is to allow gaming machines in bookmakers' shops brought a cheer to both Ladbroke and Stanley Leisure. Shares in the former hardened 2 to 171p, while the latter moved 8 ahead to 344p, though with little market activity on the last trading day of the year, volumes in both stocks remained thin. Mr Roy Owens at Smith New Court said: 'Assuming two machines per betting shop, this could add between Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m to Ladbroke's profits and between Pounds 2m and Pounds 4m to Stanley Leisure's profits but it will be some time before we will see this impact.' Market watchers also pointed out the government move could have an impact on Bass, owner of the Coral bookmaker chain. Shares in Bass closed 1 1/2 lighter at 514 1/2 p. Shares in RJB Mining returned to the market yesterday after the company completed its Pounds 815m acquisition of the English mines from the coal board. Having been suspended at 348p, the shares returned at a deep discount at 329p, before regaining some momentum to close at 333p, in trade of 4.2m. The deal was partly financed through a Pounds 400m placing and open offer, and the new shares finished 4 ahead of of the issue price at 324p, on turnover of 3.3m. A recent circular published by Smith New Court said: 'The fact is that electricity generated from coal is the cheapest electricity in the UK, and that coal mined domestically is cheaper for the power generators to burn than imported coal. For these reasons we expect RJB to renew its contracts to supply the generators and with falling production costs it will be able to deliver strong and rising profits.' Among oil stocks, Burmah put on 3 to 815p and Lasmo added 1 1/2 to 147p but for the most part the sector barely flickered in reaction to the continued recovery in oil prices which has taken Brent blend up to within a whisker of Dollars 16.50 from a pre-Christmas low of Dollars 15.60. Stock market opinions on the outlook for oil prices are polarised with strong non-Opec production and mild winter worries about stock levels pitched against a number of more bullish views. These mostly revolve around hopes for flattening output growth and a reviving European economy. NatWest Securities heads the latter camp looking for a 1995 average price of Dollars 19 for Brent Blend (Dollars 3 better than 1994) and putting BP - down 1 1/2 at 425 1/2 p - at the top of their list of oil price sensitive stocks. Abbey National did its best to keep bank shares bubbling ahead of the 1994 results season which gets an early show of the betting on January 12 when TSB's preliminary figures are due. Abbey National gained 2 1/2 to 430 1/2 p while TSB was  1/2 better at 234 1/2 p. With 1.3m traded, NatWest was the most active bank share, holding steady at 514p. Lloyds, down 23 in the three previous sessions as Latin American worries in the wake of peso fall-out gnawed away at sentiment, eased marginally to 552 1/2 p. HSBC and Standard Chartered slipped as the Hong Kong market continued to wilt, dipping 4 1/2 and 2 to 706 1/2 p and 280 1/2 p respectively. Among merchant banks, Cater Allen retreated 13 to 445p and Gerrard National gave up 7 to 481p. S. G. Warburg, which called off merger discussions with Morgan Stanley of the US just before Christmas, added 2 to 691p as takeover hopes showed signs of limping on into the New Year. Interest rate uncertainties in Europe in the wake of Thursday's unexpected rise for French base rates continued to dog those building materials groups with a sizeable continental business. RMC retreated to 935p, down 5 for a two-day decline of 20 1/2 . Hepworth fell 6 to 313p while Blue Circle was 3 easier at 282p, although in every case activity was nominal at best. Hill Hire, the commercial vehicle hire company floated on Thursday at 94p, continued to make progress with a buy note from Albert E. Sharp helping to lift the shares a further 3 to 100p. Engineering group James Dickie, which this week appointed a new chairman, improved 11 to 196p on expectations of a favourable performance next year. Hopes of an improvement in the Mexican economy boosted Allied Domecq, which derives a sizeable part of its profits from the country. The shares put on 3 to 540p. Reports that Mr Maurice Saatchi is to stay on as chairman of one of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiaries gave a boost to the group's shares. They put on 5 to 149p. The lacklustre market activity did little to banish recent bid speculation in the regional electricity companies sector where several of the so-called takeover favourites continued to move ahead. The day's gains included Yorkshire Electricity which advanced 9 to 727p, South Western Electricity 4 harder at 882p and London Electricity whose shares closed 5 ahead at 746p.</p>

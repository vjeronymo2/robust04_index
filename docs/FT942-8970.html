			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / People: Non-executive directors - BP Michael Miles, 58, an executive deputy chairman of Barings, has been appointed a non-executive director of BP. His appointment to the board of Britain's biggest oil company continues its longstanding boardroom ties with Britain's oldest merchant bank. Miles, who remains an executive director of the family-owned John Swire &amp; Sons, one of the biggest Far Eastern trading houses, is the first non-executive director to be appointed to the BP board since it adopted the Cadbury committee's recommendations on corporate governance. BP played down the Barings' connection yesterday, describing Miles' membership of both companies' boards as a coincidence. The company had used headhunters to find its new director and said that Miles had been chosen from a list of four candidates all of whom had 'strong Far East business experience'. Miles joined Barings as a non-executive director in 1989, just as Lord Ashburton, the current BP chairman, was retiring after 15 years as chairman of Barings. Lord Ashburton, formerly known as Sir John Baring, resigned as a non-executive director of the merchant banking group in March but remains chairman of The Baring Foundation, a charity which owns the non-voting equity capital of Barings. Lord Ashburton, 65, is the longest serving director on the BP board and took over the chairmanship in June 1992 following the ousting of Bob Horton.</p>

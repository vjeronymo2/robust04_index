			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> FIREARM CRIME EFFORT URGED  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian said he will sign a bill making California the first  state in the nation to ban the sale of assault firearms. However, the  Republican governor -- a longtime opponent of gun control -- cautioned that the  state also needs to enact stricter penalties against criminals who use those  guns. "While these (assault weapon) bills will assist law enforcement officers,  we must continue to let criminals know that if they use any weapons in the  commission of a crime that we will take them out of society and put them behind  bars," Deukmejian said in his weekly radio address. The Legislature narrowly  approved the landmark assault weapons ban. The historic legislation will ban  the manufacture and sale of more than 50 models of semiautomatic assault  weapons. People who legally possessed the guns before June 1, 1989, could keep  them but would have to register them with the state by Jan. 1, 1991.  </P></p>

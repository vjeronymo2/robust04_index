			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Motoring: Life in the new Laguna - Renault is undercutting its rivals The new Laguna went on sale in Britain this week at prices and equipment levels that make it clear Renault is going for its rivals' jugular. At Pounds 10,570 the entry model RN 1.8 undercuts an equivalent 1.6-litre Ford Mondeo by almost Pounds 1,200; a Citroen Xantia 1.6i by Pounds 580 and a Vauxhall Cavalier by Pounds 425. Price differentials are just as great in the 2-litre class with a Laguna RT 2.0 listed at Pounds 12,275 compared with the cheapest Mondeo 2-litre at Pounds 13,275, Xantia (Pounds 12,900), Cavalier (Pounds 12,650) and Honda Accord (Pounds 13,795). A top trim level RXE 2.0 Auto (Pounds 14,645) is priced Pounds 585 under a two-pedal Mondeo 2.0 GLX. Remarkably, the flagship V6 3-litre Laguna Auto with absolutely everything - air conditioning, cruise control, heated front and rear screens, power-adjusted front seats, volumetric alarm and trip computer  - costs only Pounds 18,565, which is almost Pounds 2,500 less than a 2.5-litre V6 Vauxhall Cavalier Diplomat automatic. As a bonus, Renault says that, model for model, Laguna insurance groupings are one below those of its market rivals. Does this mean Renault is selling Laguna at 'loss leader' prices simply to gain market share? Competitors will be tempted to think so and Renault UK boasts of having an extremely aggressive pricing strategy. But, of course, the last thing fleet managers who order cars like Laguna by the hundreds, even thousands, think about is the retail price. They operate in a world of mega-discounts. Renault UK will be in there, fighting. Retail buyers, though, are bound to see a 1.8-litre Laguna RN as a bargain. Even this 95 horsepower entry model has power steering, rear wash/wipe, reach-adjustable steering wheel, electric front windows and remotely-controlled central locking. It is a quietly competent car with a good ride. Providing it does not have to make too many cold starts and short journeys, it should average 35 mpg (8.07 l/100 km). The most economical Laguna will be the 2.2-litre diesel, due to become available in the near future. This has a similar performance to the 1.8-litre petrol engined model but should average more than 41 mpg (6.89 l/100km). With diesel cars now taking 25 per cent of all sales in Britain, it will probably be a popular choice among fleet and retail buyers alike. Every Laguna has the same five-door hatchback body which bears a family resemblance to the bigger Safrane. It provides more passenger and luggage room than the Renault 21 which Laguna replaces. Laguna is by no means a mould-breaker among upper-medium sector cars; just rather a good one, selling at prices that will give the the competition no pleasure. Whether the V6, which according to Renault offers outstanding luxury and sophistication, will persuade BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Rover user-choosers to make a change remains to be seen. As value for money it is exceptionally attractive but this is an area of the market in which a car's perceived status is crucial. The big Renault 25 which the Safrane replaced was highly successful in France but failed to attract business motorists in Britain. True, the company car rules have changed since then. Now the taxman's take is based simply on price, not a formula combining price and engine size which, until this week, made cars of more than 2-litre cylinder capacity financially unviable to many who would have liked to run one. At Pounds 18,565 the fully-loaded, air-conditioned, 3-litre automatic Laguna looks incredibly cheap compared with a two-pedal BMW 325i (Pounds 24,860) or Mercedes-Benz C-280 Elegance (Pounds 28,462), on both of which air-conditioning is a costly extra. Even an Pounds 22,950 air-conditioned, 2.3-litre Rover 623GSi automatic is Pounds 4,385 dearer than a Laguna V6. So, will prestige be paramount? Or will financial objectivity rule? The traditional providers of lavishly equipped, multi-cylinder cars to business motorists will be watching the registration statistics closely. The answer will become clear later this year.</p>

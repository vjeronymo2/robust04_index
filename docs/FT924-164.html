			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Letter: Wrong impression of elections in Kenya Sir, Your article 'Flawed Kenya poll is set to resolve little' (December 22) gives the wrong impression of the Kenya general elections. The Kenyan general elections, due to begin yesterday, were set to enable the Kenyan electorate to pick leaders of their choice and not to bar a particular party or individual leader. That is what democracy is all about and, if President Moi and Kanu win, it cannot be largely by default. Surely if a party picks uncommitted candidates who subsequently defect it cannot be the fault of the winning party. It is known that the opposition political parties, because they were established only recently, have failed to find and field suitable candidates in all the constituencies in the country, thus leaving the long-established ruling party with candidates coming in unopposed. This cannot be seriously blamed on the ruling party. It seems to me that what is expected of the ruling party by the authors of the article is that Kanu should disqualify itself or make it easier for the opposition to win. This would create neither a level playing field for all nor democracy. It is incorrect to suggest that all members of the Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya communities were disillusioned with Kanu and that only weighting in favour of the ruling party will result in its victory. On the contrary, Kanu still has a fair amount of support from the three communities. As to the murder of Dr Robert Ouko, there is an ongoing High Court case which makes the matter sub judice. It is not known whether the killer was from within or without. It therefore seems to me that the bitterness referred to is misplaced.

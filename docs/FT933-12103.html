			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nestle sales growth slows down NESTLE, the world's largest food and mineral waters group, said consolidated sales improved by 4.5 per cent to SFr27.5bn (Dollars 18.2bn) in the first half-year. In the first quarter, the group's sales rose 6 per cent and in the whole of last year, they advanced by 8 per cent. Nestle indicated that the slower sales growth was largely due to the impact of the significant devaluations of the Italian, British and Spanish currencies on its Swiss franc-denominated accounts. The group said it expected that the sales growth for the full year would be higher than that in the first half and that 'a satisfactory consolidated net profit' would be achieved. First-half sales volume grew only 1 per cent, and the group cited 'a difficult economic environment, especially in most European countries'. It claimed good progress in Asia and Latin America, and said the Brazilian market improved. North American sales grew 'slightly'. The acquisition of the Source Perrier mineral water group had a favourable impact on sales as did price increases in some countries. Nestle said it had detected 'the first signs of improvement' in European markets, especially in the second quarter.</p>

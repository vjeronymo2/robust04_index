			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] It appears that the battle between the authorities  of Ukraine and Crimea has worsened. Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov says the situation that has taken shape on the peninsula  is due to provocations by the powers that be in Ukraine.    [Correspondent Vladimir Plotnikov] Kravchuk's decree  appointing a representative of the Ukrainian president in Crimea  has aroused particular opposition. The leadership of Crimea's  republican movement, Russian Society, [Russkoye Obshchestvo]  today called on citizens to rally in support of the Crimean  president.    [Begin Crimean President Meshkov recording] [Words  indistinct] that Ukraine's current leadership is the most  dangerous, from the point of view of maintaining peace and calm  in Europe. This leadership has relied on, and unfortunately  continues to rely on, extreme nationalist forces in Ukraine and  can only act within a framework designed by the nationalists.  [end recording]    [Plotnikov] It may be by chance, but the war of decrees  broke  out on the eve of the second round of elections to the Ukrainian  and Crimean parliaments. It might be expected that this war  will help consolidate Meshkov's supporters. Even the autonomous  republic's Supreme Soviet, with its current composition and  history of total subservience to Kiev, has spoken against the  appointment of a representative for Kravchuk in Crimea.

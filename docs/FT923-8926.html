			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: If law were changed on lettings it should be across the board Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, August 6) neatly sidesteps a simple truth, namely that when times were good in the property market tenants were happy with the leases they obtained, but with a downturn now wish to move the goalposts, blindfold the referee, unscore some of the goals and perhaps take the ball home and not play any more. Those leases freely entered into, which it is now said are so onerous, are the leases tenants were happy to sell at a premium when demand exceeded supply. Did those leaseholders who sold their leases or who obtained a profit by sub-letting share the profit with their landlord? When inflation was daily eroding the value of the rent how many voluntarily paid a higher rent? Every landlord experiences the leaseholder who stands by every dot and comma of his lease, and avails himself of every piece of retrospective legislation when it suits, but defaults and disappears when the going gets tough. Why should it be inherently unfair for the original leaseholder to be held responsible for the default of a subsequent leaseholder? Someone receiving a pension from a company would be justifiably aggrieved if that company were taken over and the new owner reneged on the company's obligations. If the market has fundamentally changed, new leases will reflect this. However Mr Brittan appears also to support the abolition of security of tenure where leases have expired. Surely if some existing laws protecting tenants from market forces are to go, this should include the abolition of all controlled tenancies in the domestic sector, now rent control has here been largely abolished for new lettings? In other words if there is to be legislation, why should it not apply across the board? Martin Philcox, Park House Properties (London), Delta House, 181-183 Romford Road, London E15 4JF</p>

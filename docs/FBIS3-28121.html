			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] said Thursday [3 February] it has  notified the Secretariat of the House of Councillors of the  departure of two nonparty members of its parliamentary group.    The defection of the two, Hideo Den and Masao Kunihiro, who  voted against the SDP when an upper house plenary session  approved the government's package of political reform bills on  Saturday, reduces the parliamentary group's membership from 73  to 71.    The party has yet to decide how to deal with a group of  other  SDP members who rebelled against SDP policy during the vote and  opposed the package.    Also on Thursday, former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  upper  house member Chinpei Nozue, now an independent, joined another  parliamentary group composed of governing coalition members of  the Japan New Party, Shinseito, and the Reform Coalition Party,  increasing the group's membership from 26 to 27.    Nozue's defection leaves the LDP with 95 members in the  upper  house.</p>

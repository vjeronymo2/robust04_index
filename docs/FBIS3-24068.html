The total amount of  all types of taxes that were paid last year both by enterprises,  organizations, and institutions in the kray and by the residents  of Maritime Kray came to 701,816,000,000 rubles. That is almost  ten times more than in 1992. Thirty-five percent of the  collected taxes were sent to the federal budget. The rest  (456,511,000,000) remained in the local budget. In the structure  of all taxes, the taxes with the largest weight are: profit tax  (44 percent); added value tax (29 percent); and income tax from  individuals (14 percent). Income from privatization in the kray  came to 18,366,000,000 rubles. A large part of that amount  remained in the local budget.    An additional sum of 83,357,000,000 rubles was paid into the  budget as a result of checking that was done by the kray's tax  inspectorates. Also, the economic situation in the kray and in  the country could not fail to have an effect on the quality and  the deadlines for paying the taxes, as well as the penalties in  the event of late payment or nonpayment. Thus, the increase in  the number of taxpayers, the increase in prices, and the  increase in the payment of labor led to a considerable increase  in the volume of payments. On the other hand, the unstable  financial situation of enterprises, the delay in the reciprocal  settlements among them, and the rise in the inflationary  processes and the indebtedness of enterprises inevitably led to  late payments and to the reduction or even cessation of tax  payments on the part of many taxpayers. The increase in arrears  is also linked with the taxpayers' low discipline. More than 70  percent of state enterprise, more than 50 percent of municipal  ones, and one-third of nonstate enterprises were found by the  tax agencies to have committed various violations in computing  and paying the profit taxes.    Frequently debtor enterprises, because of their complicated  financial situation, are given payment extensions. In the  remaining instances the tax inspectorates take steps of  financial or administrative punishment. More than 6000 officials  in 1993 were brought to administrative responsibility; almost  8000 times it was necessary to suspend the violators' financial  activity.    The following are a few examples. In Nakhodka the tax  inspectorate required the Korkhis TOO [Limited Liability  Partnership] to pay 45 million rubles as a fine for having  violated tax legislation. An audit conducted jointly with the  tax police revealed the concealment of income from the sale of  vodka behind the cash account at the Masmetna TOO; the violators  paid 32 million rubles. The Lakkhor TOO failed to enter as  receipts the proceeds from the sale of motor vehicles; the fines  came to 15 million rubles. The Vladivostok tax inspectorates, in  the course of audits, revealed violation of tax legislation at  the Rybvost, Mortransservis, Vostokvneshservis, and Avtoimport  joint-stock companies, the Rosich foreign-trade company, etc.    In dealing with the most serious violations, the materials  pertaining to the audits by the tax inspectorates were sent to  law-enforcement agencies. In 1993 there were 192 files of such  materials, with the overwhelming number of them (122) pertaining  to joint-stock companies, limited companies, and other nonstate  organizations. The Pervomayskiy Rayon tax inspectorate audited  the activities of the Shelf joint-stock company. As long ago as  1992 the Vladivostok Base of the Trawler and Refrigerator-Ship  Fleet (VBTRF) concluded with Shelf a lease contract in  conformity with which the latter had four fishing ships  transferred to it, with VBTRF bearing all the expenses for  maintaining, operating, repairing, and supplying those ships.  Since it did not have quotas or licenses for exporting fish  products, Shelf received at the expense of VBTRF 337.1 million  rubles simply in exchange for selling the fish abroad. The  founders of Shelf were VBTRF officials headed by N. Nikitenko.  It was they would received income from the activities of those  ships, but VBTRF bore the expenses. The tax services considered  these actions to be a violation of the law, and they lodged an  official request to the kray procurator's office to initiate a  criminal case charging the violators with malfeasance.  Subsequently an audit of the financial activities of VBTRF was  scheduled, and that audit has been completed at the present  time. The results will be reported separately.    The kray's tax agencies discovered instances in which the  enterprises violated the regulations for withholding income tax  from individuals. The largest amounts of funds that were  additionally computed by the inspectors were for such violators  as TURNIF, DVMP, Dalpushnina, Roliz, and the Russo-Japanese  Rikar [Riccar] enterprise. Over a period of several months the  Ussuriysk railroad-car and refrigerator-car roundhouse failed to  record the income taxes that had been withheld from citizens.  The violation was estimated to be a half billion rubles.    Approximately 5000 citizens were brought to administrative  responsibility for having committed violations in the payment of  taxes from individuals. For example, in Vladivostok, during the  documentary checking of declarations of income, tax inspectors  established instances of underreporting of income received by  two entrepreneurs in 1992, with a total amount of 400,000  rubles. A total of 153 files of material dealing with the  results of audits of tax payment by individuals were sent by the  Vladivostok tax inspectorate to law-enforcement agencies. A  criminal case involving an instance of concealing income was  initiated with respect to the director of a branch of the  Interfeys [Interface] SP [joint venture]. However, that case has  been currently suspended, inasmuch as the violator is hiding  from the law-enforcement agencies.    The kray's legal inspectorate considers that an important  aspect of its work is close cooperation with the customs  services and with the tax police. And a decisive factor in the  further improvement of the work performed by the tax inspectors,  in the opinion of its employees, is the serious reforming of the  tax system in the country.</p>

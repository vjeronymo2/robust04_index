A foreign office spokesman here expressed the Pakistan  government's "deep regret" at the escalation of fighting in  Kabul. He said the aerial bombardment was posing "greater danger  to civilians" living in the war-weary Afghan capital.    He fervently appealed to all the Afghan factions involved in  the clashes to agree to a temporary cease-fire for 24 hours  starting from 6:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) Friday "so that all  diplomatic and UN personnel living in Kabul and people wounded  in the six days of fighting could be evacuated on emergency  basis."    "The government of Pakistan hopes that all Afghan leaders  would respond positively to this appeal," the spokesman said in  a statement here.    Pakistan had earlier twice appealed for an immediate  ceasefire in Kabul, scene of the worst power struggle, and other  Afghan cities in the past few days.    It also urged all sides to hold political negotiations with  the object of reviving the process of conciliation for lasting  political settlement. The appeals have not yet been heeded.    Sources said the casualties in six days of bloody fighting  Kabul had exceeded 3,300 with hundreds trapped in their homes  awaiting medical asistance.</p>

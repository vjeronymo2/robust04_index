			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Gooda underwriting was unsustainable: Former chairman admits survival of agency depended on absence of catastrophes The underwriting policy adopted by Mr Derek Walker, the former chairman of the Gooda Walker managing agency, was 'unsustainable', he agreed in the High Court yesterday. Gooda Walker's syndicate 290, which specialised in high-risk insurance underwritten by Mr Walker, was unable to cope with a series of catastrophes, he admitted. Mr Walker was giving evidence in the High Court action brought by more than 3,000 Lloyd's Names who allege incompetence by the agents, who they are suing for Pounds 629m. Questioned by Mr Geoffrey Vos QC, for the Names, Mr Walker said the frequency of losses in the excess loss market - including Hurricane Hugo and a storm in the UK - was responsible for the substantial losses suffered by the syndicate in 1990. 'So, was your writing generally, your syndicate's business, really dependent on there not being catastrophes?' Mr Vos asked. 'Yes,' Mr Walker replied. 'And we see that when there are catastrophes, the business is destroyed?' 'Correct,' Mr Walker said. Later, Mr Walker agreed with the judge, Mr Justice Phillips, that he wrote lines of insurance assuming that they would not be claimed against. Mr Vos suggested that his underwriting strategy was therefore unsustainable. 'Correct,' Mr Walker said. Mr Walker agreed that in spite of experience with Hurricane Hugo, when claims exceeded reinsurance levels, he decided not to increase the reinsurance for syndicate 290. Mr Vos asked: 'You did not think there was any need to increase your reinsurance?' Mr Walker replied: 'I would not have been able to increase it.' Mr Vos: 'So, it was a matter of the cart driving the horse, in the sense that you could not have done anyway, even if you wanted to?' Mr Walker: 'I think that would be the position, yes.' Mr Walker agreed that in the case of syndicate 164, there was nothing in the published accounts from 1982 onwards to warn the syndicate was high risk. Mr Vos later accused Mr Walker of exaggerating when he claimed he and his family had been ruined when they lost Pounds 1.5m on the insurance market. Mr Walker agreed that in 1988, 1989 and 1990 he, his wife and son had been paid a total of Pounds 1.9m by Gooda Walker.</p>

Supreme Commander Air Chief  Marshal Woranat Aphichari said the military has been  coordinating with the Interior Ministry to identify the illegal  immigrants who fled from refugee centers to Tham Krabok.  Concerning General Vang Pao, the supreme commander said legal  action will be taken if he returns to Thailand to pursue  subversive activities. The supreme commander explained that the  measure taken by the military followed a government order, which  wants to preserve good relations with the neighboring country.    [Begin Woranat recording] We have filed charges against him.  This is aimed at preventing Gen. Vang Pao from entering our  country. He will be arrested at the immigration checkpoint if  he tries to enter the country. Concerning the next steps we  will take, I do not think we can reveal them because that would  affect the efficiency of our plan. [end recording]    Asked about the attacks on Thai fishing boats by Burmese  soldiers off Ranong Province which resulted in a number of Thai  fishermen being killed, the supreme commander said officials  concerned are gathering information about the incident for use  at the next meeting of the Thai-Burmese border committee.  Meanwhile, Thailand must try to solve its own problem by  preventing Thai fishermen from encroaching into the waters of  other countries.</p>

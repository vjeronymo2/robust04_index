			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United States has agreed to move its military headquarters in South Korea  from central Seoul to rural areas, the South Korean Defense Ministry announced.  It said the headquarters and other U.S. facilities in Seoul will be moved by  the mid-1990s. South Korea wants to relocate the facilities to provide space  for new offices and homes in the crowded capital. The headquarters of the 8th  U.S. Army and other American forces have been in Seoul since the Korean War in  1950-53.  </P></p>

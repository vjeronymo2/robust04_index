			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo shock The savaging of the final dividend and extent of the write-offs at Lasmo, the oil exploration and production group, shocked the stock market, triggering the biggest-ever single day's trade in the shares and a hefty 10 per cent decline in the stock price. The market had braced itself to expect bad trading news and a possible reduction in the dividend. But most oil analysts expressed surprise with the size of the dividend cut and the write-offs. 'Looking at the numbers and attending the post-results meeting was a numbing experience,' said one specialist. He said that 'if a potential predator decided to launch a bid for Lasmo it would, certainly in the short term, encounter very little opposition among institutions which are now extremely disillusioned.' Another analyst, adopting a slightly more generous view, spoke of the analogy with BP, in that Lasmo had 'thrown all the bad news in and that from now on things could only get better.' However, Mr John Toalster, one of the oil sector's most aggressive bears, said of Lasmo: 'It's now revealing the extent to which it has been disaster prone; overstating the oil price; overstating reserves; overvaluing assets; overpaying on dividends and underestimating costs; sell the shares down to 145p.' At the close Lasmo were 19 down at 173p with turnover reaching a record 22.5m shares.</p>

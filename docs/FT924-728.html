			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc fails to recover ground NEITHER the US dollar nor the French franc made much headway against the D-Mark yesterday, as trading on the foreign exchanges ground to a halt in the run-up to Christmas, writes James Blitz. After last week's dismal performance against the German currency, the French franc briefly rose above the level of FFr3.41 to the D-Mark yesterday morning, as short franc positions were unwound. However, there was a spate of selling of the French currency at around lunchtime, and the franc again fell back, to a close of FFr3.417, a touch weaker on the day. The market continues to believe that the franc will come under more concerted pressure in the new year, when traders will be starting with fresh balance sheets. The dollar gained ground against the D-Mark yesterday afternoon in Europe, rising to a peak of DM1.5705. The US currency was mostly moved by technical factors and there were no US economic indicators. It ended at DM1.5680, firmer by  1/4 pfennig on the day. Traders thought that today's final figures on third-quarter GDP would have scant effect on the market. In New York the dollar finished slightly higher at DM1.5685. Longer term prospects for the US currency remain unclear because of lingering uncertainty about the scale of the economic upturn in the US. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, also believes that dollar trading remains range-bound because of the potential impact European factors will have on the currency. In the new year, for example, the dollar could gain safe haven status if political problems in Russia intensify, or if there are systemic problems in the European exchange rate mechanism. But a speculative attack on the French franc could push the D-Mark's value upwards across European currencies and, hence, against the dollar, too. The inflation figures issued in recent days by the leading German lander do not bode well for the cut in German official interest rates which could take the steam out of the ERM tensions. The cost of living in the German state of Bavaria climbed 0.2 per cent in the month to mid-December for a year-on-year rise of 4.0 per cent. In the year to mid-November, prices were up 4.0 per cent for all western Germany. One other area of interest yesterday was the D-Mark/lira cross. The Italian currency continued to suffer from political uncertainties and rising expectations of a rate cut by the Bank of Italy. The lira slid through the L900 support level in early trading, bottoming out at L903 per D-Mark from a previous close of L898. But it later rallied to finish almost unchanged at L898.1. Sterling ended slightly higher against the D-Mark at DM2.4525 after a previous close of DM2.4500. Against the dollar, the pound closed a shade easier at Dollars 1.5645.</p>

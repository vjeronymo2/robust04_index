			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Poll comfort as parties see there is all to play for TODAY'S POLLS  - Gallop's 2 percentage point Conservative lead, even NOP's four point Labour lead  - must bring relief to the government. Reflecting on Labour leads of five points in ICM and Mori yesterday, the Tories could take comfort from three thoughts (in addition to Monday's 3 point lead in Harris): Easy come, easy go. If in two days the polls can move from a 1 per cent to a 5 per cent Labour lead, they can move back again. Never believe a trend until it's been confirmed for several days over several polls. Even then, keep in mind the volatility of the British electorate. Remember 1959. In the Macmillan election the Conservative government started 7 per cent ahead, slumped in the first 10 days of the campaign to a mere 2 per cent lead, and then in the final haul pulled back to a 7 per cent lead. In fact, with three weeks to go, Labour must be very pleased with the evidence of the polls. Everyone has heard of the height of the mountain that Labour has to climb. The 8 per cent swing needed for a clear majority is almost twice as great as the largest movement in any post-war election. To those who were in Walworth Road in 1987 it must seem incredible to be looking at a winning margin. Historical precedents are dangerous. The rates of the game change. But for 40 years no government has materially improved its poll position during the campaign. In 1951, the Labour government started the election 11 per cent behind in the Gallup poll and, although they lost the election in terms of seats, they emerged from the voting booths 1 per cent ahead. Such a movement could happen again. There are three special reasons why the survey figures are unlikely to remain constant. The electorate's convictions seem especially shallow rooted. Thirty years ago more than 50 per cent of voters felt 'very strongly' about their party preference; today only 20 per cent do. Party arguments and campaign events really can switch votes. The polls can change votes. The election may not offer much of an ideological choice but it remains a spectacular event. In a nip and tuck race, partisanship is excited. This is the first election in which the party lead has switched in the opinion polls during the campaign (leaving out one final poll in 1970). The public may be driven to focus its votes on the choice between the two leading contenders or, repelled by yah-boo politics and seeing a hung parliament as likely, they may give extra support to the centre party. Movements at the local, not national, level may affect party support. In 226 of the 376 seats won by the Conservatives in the last election the Alliance came second. But, as polls have shown, many electors are unaware that this applies to their constituency. For the next three weeks, and especially in Scotland, there will be massive efforts to educate the electorate in tactical voting. The Liberal Democrats have acquired great expertise at turning around the old argument 'a vote for the Liberals is a wasted vote'. Now, in more than a third of constituencies, they can say 'if you want the Tories out, vote for us'. It may not win them many seats and it won't take any away from Labour. But it may cut into the Labour percentages in the opinion polls. It remains all to play for.

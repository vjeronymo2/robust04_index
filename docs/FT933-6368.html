			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Euromark futures fall THE Bundesbank again surprised European money market dealers yesterday by refusing to lower its official interest rates when there had been strong expectations that policy would be eased, writes James Blitz. The German central bank left its discount rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent and made no announcement on next week's repo. Market expectations had been for a cut in the discount rate of up to  1/2 percentage point, in the belief that inflationary pressures in Germany had eased. There was no formal explanation of why the Bundesbank had left policy unchanged. Analysts said the central bank was concerned by M3 monetary growth after the intervention to support the French franc. The central bank might also have found it difficult to explain why it was cutting rates in August, when the failure to ease policy in July had brought the demise of the European exchange rate mechanism. The Bundesbank's move was followed by announcements of no change in rates from Austria and the Netherlands. France had announced before the council meeting that its intervention rate was unchanged. Portugal trimmed its emergency lending rate at the start of the day from 12.500 per cent to 12.375 per cent. Yesterday's Bundesbank move took many dealers by surprise, especially in the German cash market. There had been strong expectations of lower borrowing through the discount window. When these were dashed, banks tried to raise funds in the cash market, pushing call money above 7 per cent. One London dealer expected to see some Lombard borrowing next week at 7.75 per cent. Euromark futures also fell back. The September contract closed at 93.50, down 7 basis points on the day, and the December contract retreated 4 basis points to 94.07. French franc futures were also depressed, in the belief that France's policy easing might come more slowly than dealers had expected. September Pibor weakened 17 basis points to end at 92.99. Sterling markets were depressed by yesterday's Bundesbank move. The December contract declined 5 basis points to close at 94.54. In the cash market, three-month money was fractionally higher at 5 7/8 per cent on the bid side and 5 13/16 per cent offered. There was a shortage of Pounds 1.15bn.</p>

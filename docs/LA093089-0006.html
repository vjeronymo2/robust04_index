			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SONGWRITER IRVING BERLIN DIES  </P> <P> For more than three years, I have made weekly visits to a special care unit for  victims of Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders with my mother, who is  in her 80s and perhaps a bit senior to the average patient. One day, about two  years ago, my mother discovered that singing old songs like "School Days" and  patriotic songs was one activity many of the patients enjoyed and could join  in.  </P> <P> We began to hold informal sing-alongs and to expand our repertoire. Apart from  gaining an appreciation for Berlin's prolific talent and his legacy of melodic  tunes and witty lyrics, we came to recognize "Always" as being at the top of  the hit parade among our memory-impaired friends. It is a song that must have  been sung at a lot of proms, weddings and anniversaries over the years. It is  still deep in the hearts of many. More than once, I have seen animation creep  into a long-mute and expressionless face as a mouth silently formed the words  "I'll be loving you always."  </P> <P> ROBERT WOODS MANN  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P></p>

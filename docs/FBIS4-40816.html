			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksey Bukalov and Aleksey </F> Golyayev]    [Text] Milan June 20 TASS -- "Russia and Europe, Russia and  the world have the broadest prospects for the development of  versatile economic and political cooperation. We cannot live  without one another," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  said in his remarks at the opening ceremony of the 19th World  Gas Congress here on Monday.    The Russian premier emphasised that Moscow expects specific  proposals from the Group-of-Seven countries for cooperation in  regulating flows of investments and elaborating adequate and  specific mechanisms to encourage and insure them.    "Russia strives to be recognised a `country with a  transitional economy' by partners for the forthcoming G-7 summit  in Naples and expects G-7 countries to make new specific steps  to improve conditions for Russian commodities' access to  external markets," Chernomyrdin said.    "I am confident that the G-7 turning into a G-8 would lead  to  fundamentally important and positive changes in the geopolitical  balance and create new favourable conditions for Russia's  full-scale participation in the world economic system,"  Chernomyrdin pointed out.    The World Gas Congress is being attended by about 5,000  delegates from 67 countries. They represent leading gas  companies that determine gas-industry policy on a world scale.  Russia, which now accounts for 36 percent of the world's  reserves of natural gas holds a special place in this respect.  Experts, politicians and diplomats, whom the Russian delegation  meet at the congress, show a lively interest in the state of  affairs in Russia.    Russia accounts for about 30 percent of the world's trade in  gas, Chernomyrdin emphasised. The existence of large gas  resources in eastern Siberia and on the Shelf of Sakhalin opens  up possibilities for the export of gas to China, Japan, the  Korean peninsula, the shipping of gas by tankers to the United  States and other countries. Moscow is prepared to discuss  proposals about foreign firms' participation in the development  of gas and oil fields and in the construction of processing  facilities, Chernomyrdin said. He pointed out the importance of  reducing fuel losses during production and transportation, and  described plans to build steam and gas-fired power stations in  the European part of Russia.    Chernomyrdin toured the display stands of Gazprom and the  Italian ENI fuel company at a specialised exhibition which has  been timed for the World Gas Congress.</p>

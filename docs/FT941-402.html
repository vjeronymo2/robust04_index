			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Smiling as long as he can: After his election fillip, Silvio Berlusconi now faces a difficult job forming a government As befits a man who brought popular entertainment to Italian television, Silvio Berlusconi has a well-rehearsed smile. Throughout a bitter, and at times venomous, election campaign, Mr Berlusconi wore this smile like a badge of self-confidence. But early yesterday morning as he stepped onto the podium of his Forza Italia headquarters to acknowledge the extraordinary victory of his Freedom Alliance, he was tense and grim-faced. It was as though the 57-year-old media magnate sensed the real metamorphosis from businessman to politician. Forza Italia had won the largest number of votes and become the largest single party in parliament after less than four month's existence - a feat without parallel in the recent history of European democracy. 'It's probably quite a shock to realise that winning the elections is the easy part. Trying to put together a government is going to be much tougher,' observed one of his aides. Having masterminded the three-party Freedom Alliance, which has won an absolute majority in Italy's lower parliamentary chamber, Mr Berlusconi will be the first to be asked by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to form a government. But in his ambition to become prime minister, Mr Berlusconi has gathered some odd bedfellows who may find it impossible to cohabit in government. Thus there is a curious paradox in the election result. The composition of the winning coalition - Forza Italia, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini - may not be that of the next government. The Freedom Alliance has no common programme of government, even if its constituents represent a clear swing towards the right of the political spectrum after the many years of centre and centre-left governments. The biggest problem is the difference between the personalities and thinking of Mr Bossi and Mr Fini. Mr Bossi is a federalist and a free-marketeer who in the last decade has made a political career by founding a grassroots movement in northern Italy to supplant the abuse of power by the traditional ruling parties. Mr Fini, who describes himself as a 'post-fascist', is heir to the centralised and corporatist traditions of the Mussolini state. The election pact between the three parties was a marriage of convenience, and in no constituency did all three support each others' candidates. Mr Berlusconi forged a formal pact with Mr Bossi to pool resources in the north. Separately, Mr Berlusconi organised a deal with Mr Fini to join forces in the centre and south of the country. The League and the MSI/National Alliance were linked through the person of Mr Berlusconi and by their dependence upon Fininvest's media empire to back their campaigns. Repeatedly during the campaign Mr Bossi bad-mouthed Mr Fini and rejected the idea of governing with him. Mr Bossi said again yesterday: 'There's a reactionary right around; and I would never be party to a government with a reactionary right.' Part of this is bluff to maximise his bargaining position, which has been eroded by the loss of votes to Forza Italia in the north. But joining the MSI in government would undermine his credibility among supporters, and threaten the League with absorption by Forza Italia. Alternatively, the League could split, with some deserting to the Berlusconi camp - there are already reports of overtures to several leading League members. In any event, Mr Berlusconi will be hard pressed to find another grouping in parliament to form a coalition with the MSI. One way out of this impasse would be a Forza Italia/League government which excluded the MSI but had its explicit backing in parliament. Another scenario would be for Mr Berlusconi and the League to seek allies with the centrist Italian Pact, headed by Mr Mario Segni. This would have the attraction of helping to provide an absolute majority in the Senate, or upper chamber. The lack of such a majority is a serious handicap, since the upper house can block legislation. Mr Segni refused to make a pre-electoral alliance with Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia - a factor which forced Mr Berlusconi into the arms of the League and the MSI. But Mr Segni himself paid dearly for spurning a deal with Mr Berlusconi. He ended up being squeezed between the Freedom Alliance on the right and the Progressive Alliance on the left. Mr Segni may be more malleable after his disappointing performance in the polls. But if the centre joins Mr Berlusconi in government, Mr Bossi will be none too happy. He claims Mr Segni and his friends are no more than recycled members of the discredited regimes of the Christian Democrats and Socialists until 1992. None of these possible outcomes augurs well for the formation of a stable government capable of lasting the full five years of the next legislature. Indeed, President Scalfaro may find Mr Berlusconi cannot form a viable government and turn to an 'institutional' figure such as outgoing premier Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former governor of the Bank of Italy. The 'institutional' solution, however, could be foisted on the country only in extremis. This is because the electorate has expressed through this week's elections a clear verdict in favour of political renewal and against the old political system. In this respect, there is one common link between the parties of the Freedom Alliance: either they are untainted by previous government experience or they aspire to represent the majority of Italians who want the country to turn a new page. In contrast, the Progressives, dominated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), was weakened by being identified with the old political system. This link is the only common ground on which Mr Berlusconi can build. He has to demonstrate that victory can bring his partners closer, not push them apart. But even if an alliance can be forged, Mr Berlusconi has also to prove that he is not simply an invention of his own television network. Television launched him into an unbeatable lead. He and his advisers were smart enough to see the vacuum left by the traditional centre parties and sense that his audience, middle class Italy, was worried by a deep recession and wanted a simple reassuring message. His television exposure, coupled with the managerial talent of Fininvest, his debt-burdened media and stores group which set up the countrywide support network for Forza Italia, did the rest. He now has to move from the soft sell of campaign promises to the harsh reality of operating with a new parliament and tackling the serious issues raised by Italy's substantial budget deficit and the mounting state debt. His pledge to cut taxes and relaunch the economy will be hard, if not impossible, to square with the need to introduce a mini-budget in the summer. A shortfall in revenues will have to be corrected if he is to hold the public deficit below 10 per cent of GDP. Equally his pledge to shake-up the public administration and liberalise the labour market risks a confrontation with the unions. Until now, Italy has been governed, for better or worse, on a consensual basis with limited shifts in policy. If Mr Berlusconi forms a government by looking solely to the League and the MSI, this would mark a new departure, allowing the creation of a genuine opposition and a more confrontational style of politics. The obstacles in his path are immense, but Mr Berlusconi's style is to win and the election has shown that, despite his political inexperience, his capacity to come out on top should not be underestimated.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Two public opinion polls published  recently in Santiago LA NACION show high approval ratings for  the Patricio Aylwin and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle governments and  indicate popular concern about corruption and the transition to  democracy.  <H5>  CERC Poll </H5>   The results of a poll conducted at the beginning of April by  the Center for the Study of Contemporary Reality (CERC), of the  Christian Humanism Academy University, were published on 9  April. The report did not include any information on how the  poll was conducted.    Although 86.2 percent considered democracy the best  political  system, 75.1 percent expected it to be effective in solving  Chile's problems. Regarding the transition "from dictatorship to  democracy", 60.5 percent thought it has not been completed, with  16.7 percent saying its end depended on Army Commander in Chief  General Augusto Pinochet's retiring, 9.9 percent on solving the  problem of the missing persons and "finding out the truth," 5.4  percent on enacting constitutional reforms, and 5.1 percent on  "forgetting the past."    The approval ratings of both the Aylwin and Frei  administrations at the start of their terms exceeded their vote  percentages, which the CERC researchers explain as being due to  the public's positive attitude toward any legitimate government  rather than support for a specific government. In this poll, the  Aylwin administration received a retrospective approval rating  of 85 percent. Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley was considered  the best minister, with 25.5 percent, followed by Interior  Minister Enrique Krauss with 11 percent, while Defense Minister  Patricio Rojas was considered the worst with 7.6 percent.    For the Frei administration, 73.5 percent of the respondents  declared that they were supporters, and Frei received an  84-percent approval rating overall. The researchers note that  Frei's rating does not seem to be affected by the controversy  surrounding Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange's  alleged involvement in a case of human rights violations in 1985.    In answer to open-ended but unspecified questions about who  the most important leaders of the Coalition of Parties for  Democracy (CPPD) were, apart from Frei, Public Works Minister  Ricardo Lagos received 30.1 percent, followed "at a great  distance" by Senate President Gabriel Valdes at 8.3 percent and  Interior Minister German Correa at 3.4 percent. In the  opposition, National Renewal (RN) President Andres Allamand  obtained 32.3 percent, followed by former RN senator Sergio  Onofre Jarpa with 5.5 percent.    When asked questions about the issue of corruption, more  respondents thought there was corruption during the Pinochet  regime (60 percent) than during the Aylwin administration (52  percent). When comparing the public and private sectors, 82.9  percent responded that the problem of corrupion was "serious or  very serious" in the public sector, compared with 70.5 percent  for the private sector. When asked where there was the most  corruption in the public sector, 12.5 percent cited municipal  governments, followed by courts and judges with 11.2 percent,  and Codelco (Copper Corporation) with 8.8 percent.  <H5>  Adimark Poll </H5>   A survey taken by the Adimark polling company in the  country's major cities between 4 and 18 March and published in  Santiago LA NACION on 26 March revealed that optimism about the  economy had increased. Fully 58 percent of the respondents  thought their economic situation would improve in the coming  year, compared to 45.4 percent in the December Adimark poll.  Asked which problems the government should devote the greatest  efforts to, 55.8 percent named health care, with crime at 49.7  percent.    Aylwin received a 69-percent approval rating, compared with  51.4 percent in December and 73.6 percent in June 1990. His  approval rating was higher among women, those above age 55, and  independents. He received the highest scores for handling of  foreign relations, followed by management of the economy and  relations with the Armed Forces. The issues on which he received  the lowest ratings were crime, terrorism, handling of  corruption, and the health and environmental sectors.    With respect to the new Frei administration, 69 percent of  the respondents were optimistic while 10 percent were  pessimistic. Among the CPPD leadership, Frei received a  44.3-percent rating and Lagos 13 percent. Of the opposition  figures, Allamand received the best evaluation with 57 percent,  followed "very closely" by Independent Democratic Union (UDI)  leader Carlos Bombal. RN deputy Alberto Espina and UDI mayor of  Las Condes Joaquin Lavin were third with around 40 percent each.</p>

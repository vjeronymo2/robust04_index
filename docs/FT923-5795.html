			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Clothes factories 'more modern than in west' SOME RUSSIAN garment factories are more modern than their western counterparts, thanks to heavy investment until two years ago, said a report yesterday, writes Daniel Green. German, French and Italian clothing companies are using the factories to manufacture for their home markets, attracted by modern technology and low labour costs. However, poor supplies of raw materials meant the plants were assembling clothes from imported cloth, thread and accessories. Three of the five factories visited by researchers from Strathclyde Graduate Business School were making clothes for German, French, UK and Finnish markets. Labels included C&amp;A, Dutch-owned retail chain, and Littlewoods of the UK. They have been attracted both by labour costs of less than Dollars 25 a month and by the presence of machinery bought two or three years ago with export credits at artificially good exchange rates. Such credits are no longer available. 'Companies have very new and sophisticated western design and production equipment sourced from Italian, German or American manufacturers,' says the report. 'Some computerised design and layout systems would be the envy of many western companies.' Russian exports to the west are not subject to quotas under the multifibre arrangement, agreements between clothes importing and exporting countries designed to protect manufacturing in high cost countries. Furthermore, joint ventures with more than 30 per cent western ownership get favourable tax breaks. However, inflation and costs were very variable and therefore 'it is not surprising that all agreements (between western and Russian companies) we saw in action were for one to three month periods.'</p>

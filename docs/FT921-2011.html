			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Israeli poll puts Labour in front ONE OF the first national opinion polls conducted since an Israeli general election was called for June 23 has put the opposition Labour party ahead of the governing Likud party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. But the Likud and the parties it was in coalition with until recently would still together command a parliamentary majority. The telephone survey, conducted by the Dahaf institute in Tel Aviv for a daily newspaper, gave Labour, under its new leader, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, 41 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, with Likud slipping to 37. Labour's 'natural allies' among small leftist and Arab parties, to which it would turn for support in a coalition, shared 17 seats, while right-wing and religious parties which tend to support Likud shared 25. In theory, this would allow Mr Shamir to reconstruct his old coalition with a parliamentary majority of two. Although the poll confirmed anecdotal evidence that Labour is profiting from harsh economic conditions and the government's disputes with the US, analysts warn that much can change between now and June. Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian and imposed curfews yesterday in the worst unrest to sweep the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip this year, Reuter reports. Youths stoned troops and paramilitary police and set up roadblocks of burning tyres. The army put the West Bank towns of Ramallah and Hebron under curfew and sealed off the entire Gaza Strip, home to 750,000 Palestinians. Soldiers killed a 19-year-old youth from Silwad village in clashes in Ramallah. Military sources said he had thrown a firebomb at an army jeep. A 20-year-old Palestinian also died yesterday after being shot by security forces in the town of Jenin three days ago. The clashes marked an upsurge in the four-year-old Palestinian revolt, which had been virtually dormant since the Middle East peace talks got under way in Madrid last October.</p>

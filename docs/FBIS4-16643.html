			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "CIS: Politics Continues To </F> Impede Integration"]    [Text] The CIS is demanding fundamental reforms, since it  has still not proved possible to lay down common "ground rules."  But politics is impeding economics, and that is why the  principle chosen has been that there should be no abrupt moves  and that an attempt should be made to improve the mechanisms for  cooperating and resolving any disputes that arise. That was the  main gist of the Council of Heads of State and Government  session held in Moscow 15 April.    While the heads of state were meeting behind closed doors at  the Kremlin to sort out their political differences, the  premiers met at the President Hotel to discuss primarily  economic problems. Key among these are the formation of the  structures of an economic alliance and the provision of the  legal conditions for its functioning. In all there were around  30 points on this CIS leaders' "summit" agenda. But this  impressive package of documents should not serve as a screen to  hide the acute contradictions between Commonwealth members.  These are rooted in the continuing problem of the  redistribution of property and the fear on the part of certain  leaders of being bound fast to the Commonwealth by means of  compulsory decisions.    The most noteworthy point in this respect is the conflict  over the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the problems  relating to the creation of a single economic area. The latest  conflict in Odessa over the hydrographic vessel Cheleken, and  the Ukrainian assault troops' strong-arm actions against Russian  servicemen show that there are as yet no forcefully effective  mechanisms for resolving disputes in the CIS and that politics  prevails over economic expediency. The previous day the Russian  and Ukrainian foreign ministers had talks on this issue, but did  not reach agreement. Admittedly, A. Zlenko told IZVESTIYA's  correspondent that "there is hope of neutralizing this source of  tension. It may prove possible in Moscow to eradicate the  nervousness in relations between Ukraine and Russia [no closing  quotation marks as published]. According to unverified  information, there should be a meeting in the Kremlin between B.  Yeltsin and L. Kravchuk outside the framework of the general  heads of state meeting. In turn, Russian Defense Minister P.  Grachev also had talks with his Ukrainian colleague, but the  result was the same. "It has not yet proved possible to reach  an understanding on this issue," the minister said. "I see this  as being a seizure by force. The fact that the subunits that  were attacked were small in number and isolated on Ukrainian  territory was exploited. I made a resolute protest about this.  I am hoping for a meeting between the two presidents with the  defense ministers' participation."    As for the key problem (the single economic area), there too  the principle is clear -- to cooperate but not to be compelled.  On the eve of the opening of the summit it was decided at the  insistence of the Turkmen delegation and, it is claimed, certain  other countries to abandon the plan already agreed at expert  level to set up an Interstate Economic Committee (IEC) and to  create an Economic Community Commission. The difference is  obvious -- the IEC presupposes the formation of a common trading  regime binding on all, antimonopoly and customs regulation, the  convergence of corresponding legislation, and the free movement  of labor. The commission -- and it is being set up under the  existing Coordination and Consultation Committee, is seen as an  expert working organ which can only recommend similar decisions.  Although V. Mashchits, leader of the State Committee for  Economic Cooperation with the Commonwealth Member States,  believes that the Heads of State Council or the Heads of  Government Council could, if necessary, vest the commission with  the right to make supranational decisions on specific issues.    A more hopeful point in the relations among the CIS  countries  is the agreement on the free customs zone. This document  presupposes the gradual abolition of duties, taxes, levies, and  quantitative restrictions on trade, the creation of a system of  mutual accounting and payments for trade operations, and other  things.    The sides reserve the right to implement state regulation  only on issues relating to the arms trade or the trade in  precious metals and stones or fissionable materials. The free  customs zone agreement is seen as a transitional stage on the  road to the creation of a customs union.    At the time this newspaper was being put to bed the heads of  government had signed all the documents that had been prepared.  They supported proposals to replenish the peacekeeping troops in  Tajikistan and to provide material support to Kirghizia  [Kyrgyzstan] to remedy the consequences of its natural disaster,  and they also heard information about the work of a group which  has been studying the question of the creation by states in the  Transcaucasus and Central Asia of formations to safeguard their  borders.</p>

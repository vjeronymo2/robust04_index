			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AT SCHOOL PLAYGROUND WOUNDS BOY, 15  </P> <P> A 15-year-old boy was shot by youths in a car who fired toward a junior high  school playground in South-Central Los Angeles while dozens of students milled  around nearby on their morning break, authorities said.  </P> <P> The boy, wounded in the lower left arm, was in good condition at Martin Luther  King Jr./Drew Medical Center, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Dozens of students were in the playground at Mary McLeod Bethune Junior High  School at the time of the shooting, but there were no other injuries, Los  Angeles police said.  </P> <P> Detective Gil Herrera said the attack appeared to be gang-related, but he was  uncertain of the motive.  </P> <P> Herrera said he was also unsure whether the victim was the target of the attack  or an innocent bystander.  </P> <P> The incident occurred about 10 a.m., when three or four youths in a car drove  past the school on 67th Street near Broadway and began yelling obscenities,  Principal Louvonia S. Hall said.  </P> <P> Hall did not know what was yelled, or what sparked the outburst that, she said,  included two or three shots.  </P> <P> All of the school's 1,716 students were outside at the time, although only some  of them were in the large playground area, which includes a baseball field and  several basketball courts.  </P> <P> Hall said the shooting was the first at the school in her three years as  principal.  </P></p>

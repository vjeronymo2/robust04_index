			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: A question of class - Paying for private schools Social barriers to independent education are falling but finance is still a formidable obstacle for many parents, according to a survey published this week for the Independent Schools Information Service. It suggested that the hereditary class system said to dominate public schools had loosened greatly: more than half the pupils in private school now came from homes where both parents were state-educated. That, however, appeared more to reflect the distribution of wealth in modern Britain rather than any new open-door policy, the report indicated. School fee inflation has run ahead of retail price inflation consistently for the past decade. The Isis figures - produced by the polling organisation Mori - showed that, since 1989, the proportion of private school pupils from families in social class A rose from 15 to 22 per cent, while representation from the lower classes C, D, and E dropped from 37 to 30 per cent. Rising school fees seemed to be the main cause. Last year, average day school fees rose by 8.5 per cent following increases of 12.7 per cent in 1992 and 12.5 per cent in 1991, taking average term fees over that period from Pounds 995 to Pounds 1,368. Parents increasingly are realising they need to plan for this; the Isis survey showed that the proportion making advance plans to pay fees increased from 25 per cent to 35 per cent over the same period. This will have helped the financial services industry, which has used fee plans to sell life assurance endowment policies. But most parents (82 per cent) pay the fees using only their salary and other personal income. Unless more parents plan in advance, independent schools are likely to remain exclusive. The schools themselves now seem to realise this. The draw-down loan scheme run for Isis by Claremont Savile, the independent adviser, has been revised several times in the past few years and now offers parents loans from two different companies: Citibank Mortgage, the centralised lender which joined this week, and the Halifax. This scheme will be most attractive to those with a house worth significantly more than the outstanding mortgage and who have not built up savings plans in advance. Citibank offers a variable rate of 7.3 per cent, capped until the year 2000, at 9.99 per cent. It includes two years' free unemployment cover and allows monthly over-payments for those who can afford them and wish to protect their equity. The company will lend up to a level where 85 per cent of a property's value is mortgaged. Repaying the mortgage, even with interest rates at their present low levels by historic standards, often makes sense as it is difficult to get a return of 7.3 per cent on alternative investments. Citibank allows repayments in arrears and, as with the existing Halifax scheme, allows borrowers to draw down funds up to four times each year, when fees become payable. The arrangement fee is Pounds 195, with a minimum advance of Pounds 10,000 and a maximum of Pounds 150,000. Perhaps the most attractive feature is that borrowers may repay their loan using any savings vehicle. They are not restricted to endowment policies, which Claremont Savile does not recommend because they are tax-inefficient and inflexible. Instead, it steers parents towards free-standing additional voluntary contributions - if they have spare pension capacity - or personal equity plans. It should be noted, however, that Claremont Savile takes commission from any investments which it buys for clients. It is always better to avoid problems once your child is ready to go to school by saving in advance. Collective equity schemes, such as investment trust savings schemes, should allow strong growth over a long period. If, eventually, you send your child to a state school, you can always spend the money on something else. Apart from greater planning of finances, more parents are shopping around for schools. They visit more of them and apply for more prospectuses than when the last similar survey was carried out in 1989; and 15 per cent identify exam result 'league tables' - now published by the government and compiled separately by several newspapers, including the Financial Times - as a factor. State schools, which generally had a bad press last year, should not be ruled out, however; finding a good state school could save you thousands of pounds. But the best news for parents who do not trust the state sector could be that competitive pressures are forcing independent schools to keep the lid on their costs and fees. Isis believes the average rise in fees for this academic year, compared with last, is between 3.5 and 5.0 per cent: still above the inflation rate but representing a much lower real increase than in previous years. Bursars also seem confident that further cuts can be made next year.</p>

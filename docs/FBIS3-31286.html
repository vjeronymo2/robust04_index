The miners drop the "for" or "against" ballot sheets  into the ballot boxes when they are collecting their wages.  Preliminary data indicate that most of them support the strike.  In other concerns (such as in Bytom, Gliwice, and Rybnik)  negotiations are being held on wage issues and the heads of  plant "Solidarity" ["S"] sections condition the organization of  a similar referendum on their results. The strike readiness has  so far been limited to placing banners around the plants. In  this voivodship "S" has as many as 250,000 members; it also has  1,260 plant committees. The activists of other trade unions,  such as "Solidarity '80" (approximately 35,000 members) and  "Kontra" (30,000 members) have already announced strike  readiness.    Activists of the regional "S" are holding talks in the  plants; they explain the core of the protest. It boils down to  the following demands: Increasing the value of the real wages,  introducing an efficient program of combating unemployment, and  curbing the degradation of the Silesia-Dabrowa region. The  Silesian "S" has put forward some more detailed demands: Fair  distribution of the GDP, the statement that all Saturdays are  constitutionally free, and a 40-hour workweek. Demand No. 9  mentions changes in the tax laws that would eliminate the  excessive tax burdens that have been imposed on employees. In  demand No. 10 the miners want the Treasury to "compensate the  losses incurred by enterprises as a result of the blockade of  payments for exported commodities and services"; in the 11th  demand they suggest that legal acts be prepared which would make  it possible for trade unions to take a stand on employees'  affairs in commercial law partnerships. In the last one the  miners demand that the demands of the branches, which have been  submitted and agreed on, be implemented. The Silesian "S" is  also asking the parliament to adopt this year's budget in a  shape that would take into account the implementation of the  demands put forward by the Independent Self-Governing Trade  Union "S," especially the demands that aim to protect the  poorest.    Continuing is the protest in the Mining and Steel Work Plant  in Bukowno; 78 miners are underground in the "Pomorzany" mine;  on Tuesday [15 February] 46 miners went on a hunger strike. The  protest began two weeks ago. In the meantime, union activists  are holding talks on wages with the directors. In the Katowice  Steel Works, which is surrounded by banners, the people are not  thinking about a referendum yet; they are waiting for the next  moves of the region. "The atmosphere is tense, they say in the  Plant Committee of the steel works; however, it is not a matter  of today only--the wages are low and this is the problem." The  mines of the Bytom Coal Partnership are currently negotiating  new wages with the directors, so they do not expect that a  referendum will be held for the time being. Unless the  negotiations fail to yield any results. The same is happening  in the mines of the Gliwice and Rybnik partnerships; here the  referendum may be carried out early next week. In the Jasrzebie  partnership, where the strike has just been finished, "S" says:  "We are working; one needs a rest after a strike; then we will  think what should be done next."</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Maisie, that archetypal feminist from 'The Perishers' in the Daily Mirror, used to ask the boys acidly 'Are we in the hit-ball season or the kick-ball season?' but the question seems to be losing its significance. Today, well into the hit-ball season, television is dominated by kick-ball. Starting at 7.00 BBC1 devotes 2 1/2 hours to live coverage of England v Sweden in Stockholm with a look also at the Denmark/France game in Malmo. Then at 11.20 ITV begins 70 minutes of recorded highlights from the same matches. For those who find a sport that specialises in nil-nil draws less than electrifying, Radio 3 seems the best alternative. Third Ear (7.05) plunges into the debate about scientific theories on matters such as the origins of the universe and asks whether quasi-religious hogwash is replacing proper physics. Then in The World is Out of Joint (9.30) Peter Moore of King's College London attempts a summary of the world's ecological state after the Rio pantomime. Lovers of the classics can hear the William Tell Overture, Grieg's Piano Concerto, and Beethoven's Fifth in Radio Goes To Town at 7.30.</p>

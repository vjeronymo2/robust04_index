Usov (Nuclear Reactors Institute, RNTs  [expansion not given] ``Kurchatovskiy institut''); received Dec  29,1992; UDC 621.039.577]    [Abstract] Industrial scale material production in space  opens up the possibilities of manufacturing semiconductor and  optical materials, composites and medical preparations with  substantially better properties. At present the most promising  is space manufacturing of semiconductor materials for the  electronic industry. The article lists factors that give thermal  emission nuclear electric power units [NEPUs] advantage over  solar power units and make NEPUs promising for the above  applications and discusses possible concepts for using NEPUS in  industrial spacecraft operating in a radiation safe orbit.  Peculiarities of automatic loading and unloading, as well as  manual loading and unloading by cosmonauts are examined, and  possible radiation doses the cosmonauts could be exposed to are  estimated. Remote power supply of industrial spacecraft will  eliminate the radiation risk for the cosmonauts, and at the same  time completely eliminate the NEPU effect on residual overloads.  The analysis showed that if certain practically realizable  conditions are observed thermal emission NEPUs can provide the  required power supply for industrial spacecraft. References 4.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A new ordinance issued by the National Assembly  will lighten tax on those in the upper income bracket. The  higher level of minimum taxable income should also provide  relief. According to the new ordinance signed by the National  Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh on 19 May and taking effect on 3  June, a Vietnamese national is liable to pay tax on his income  when it exceeds 1.2 million dong monthly.    The percentage of tax will then rise to 10 percent increment  to a maximum of 60 percent. This represents a more liberal  figure as compared to the decree of 1st April 1991, when tax  started at 650,000 Vietnamese dong, and a top end bracket of 80  percent. The liberalization also applies to foreigners who will  be taxed 10 percent on monthly income of over 5 million dong as  opposed to the previous 3 million.</p>

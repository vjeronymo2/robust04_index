			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "New Negotiations Next Tuesday"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- While Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T.  Olsen was defending himself against accusations of broken  promises, the EU [European Union] last night abandoned its  attempts to reach agreement on fish and other internal problems.    The stage has been set for a serious crisis both within the  EU and in the Norwegian membership negotiations. After a  dramatic meeting at which angry words had been exchanged, the  EU's foreign ministers decided around midnight to abandon the  attempt to find a solution to their internal problems and to  reach a fisheries agreement with Norway. The EU ministers will  not meet again until Tuesday [15 March] next week. The chairman  of the Council of Ministers, Theodhoros Pangalos, said at a  press conference last night that Spain alone carries all the  blame for the delay.    "Norway has shown flexibility by trying as best it can to  achieve a solution," the Greek European affairs minister said.    However, the meeting of the EU foreign ministers did not  break up before they had formally concluded the agricultural  negotiations with Norway so that only fish -- and possibly the  minke whale -- remain for the next round of negotiations. This  morning EU Commissioner Hans van den Broek and Greek European  Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos were to give the European  Parliament a briefing on the situation and on the results  achieved in the negotiations with Sweden, Finland, and Austria.    "I do not think that the Parliament will accept this sort of  half-finished agreement," a Commission spokesman said last night.    "But if the Parliament does so, there is a great danger that  the Norwegian car will be uncoupled from the negotiating train,"  he added. However, the picture last night was unclear. German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, however, thought that Norway  would be able to keep up if agreement is reached on a formula in  the course of this week.    Before this dramatic development Fisheries Minister Olsen  had  been involved in an argument with the Association of Norwegian  Fishermen, among others, about what in quota terms he had  actually offered Spain and the others in the EU. Olsen denied  categorically that he had given away a single fish, but earlier  in the evening he made this reply to a question from NRK  [Norwegian broadcasting company] about whether he had broken his  promise: "That remains to be seen."    "Norway will use the EEA [European Economic Area] fish  [quotas granted to Spain and Portugal in the framework of the  EEA agreement] for all it is worth," Olsen said at a press  conference. He also said that with his proposal to the EU he had  wanted to counter quota demands from the other side.    But have you given any fish away?    "No, I have not given away a single fish," the hard-pressed  fisheries minister said.    "The fisheries minister has given away fish," Vigdis  Harsvik,  secretary general of the Association of Norwegian Fishermen,  said yesterday when she saw Norway's proposed fisheries  agreement with the EU. Others were less sure about the  interpretation of the complicated Norwegian calculations. The  drama further increased when it became known that Spain had  rejected the proposal because it did not give the country enough  fish.    The Spanish rejection led to sharp reactions from the EU's  Greek presidency and Germany. "Never before have I been so  angry," German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in a clear  reference to Spain. Kinkel pointed out that Spain would never  have become an EU member if Germany had not lent a helping hand,  and warned of the consequences if the EU fails in this major  project of enlargement.    "I am disappointed," Kinkel said before leaving Brussels in  the early hours. He said that the problem was the EU's and not  Norway's. "We were 98 percent in agreement with Norway on  fish," he said.    In the Norwegian paper, which was being freely circulated,  Norway stated first that the quota of 11,000 [units not  specified] which the EU will be allowed to fish in 1997 is to be  brought forward to 1995. This means that in total there will be  an additional 3,750 tonnes of fish for the EU in 1995 and 1996.  In addition there will be technical adjustments which,  according to Norway's calculations, will mean that the EU will  receive an additional annual quota of 2,000 tonnes after 1997.    The comprehensive fisheries package that was rejected by  Spain yesterday evening consists of a series of elements that  all aim at satisfying the demands from Spain and Portugal for  increased quotas and ending the current discrimination against  the countries within the framework of the EU's common fisheries  policy. A Norwegian source stressed that the EU now has an  understanding of Norway's argument that it is not fair to make  Norway alone bear the burden of putting right the error made  when Spain and Portugal joined the EU.    Norway is also offering to allow an unexploited cod quota  outside Canada's 200-mile zone to pass to the EU. Spain has  interests in this area, but Canada and the EU disagree on how  the fishing in the area is to be regulated. In addition, Greece  is offering to give away 500 tonnes of its quota, and there was  speculation yesterday evening that Germany too would consider  giving away some of its quota in Norwegian waters.    As far as the issue of market access is concerned, there is  now talk of a transitional period of three years for the planned  oversight mechanism. On the subject of the administration of  resources north of the 62d parallel and negotiations with  Russia, there will be a statement which in the Norwegian view  meets the Norwegian need for a defensible administration regime.  The EU accepts the Norwegian demand that Spitsbergen should be  kept out of the EU so that the current system of administration  can remain the same.</p>

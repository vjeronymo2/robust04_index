			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> A subsidiary of U.S. computer maker Atari Corp. has been indicted in Taiwan on  charges of using pirated copies of software programs.  </P> <P> A criminal indictment for copyright infringement was handed down against Atari  Taiwan Manufacturing Corp. and two employees this month, according to the  Business Software Alliance, a coalition of U.S. software companies.  </P> <P> A court-ordered search of the company in April turned up what prosecutors  allege were unauthorized copies of Ashton Tate's dBase III Plus software and  Lotus Development Corp.'s Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program.  </P> <P> Atari said the programs were used by the two employees against company policy.  Since the case involved only about a dozen allegedly pirated copies, the  company accused the Business Software Alliance of blowing it out of proportion.  </P> <P> "We fight this kind of (piracy) all the time," said August Liguori, vice  president of finance. "It would be foolish for us to cheat our own peers over a  few hundred dollars."  </P> <P> The case is part of a high-profile campaign by the alliance to crack down on  those who illegally copy programs for their own use or for sale. Software  piracy, which is particularly bad overseas, costs developers $16 billion a year  in lost revenue, according to the alliance.  </P></p>

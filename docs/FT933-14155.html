			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: AlliedSignal buys Data Control ALLIEDSIGNAL, the US aerospace and automotive group, is to buy the Data Control unit from Sundstrand of the US, for Dollars 195m. The deal is expected to close in September, Reuter reports. The business, with 1992 sales of Dollars 194m, makes avionics products for data management, ground hazard avoidance, general aviation communications, navigation and instrumentation. Allied said the deal would contribute to 1994 earnings, but did not elaborate. Separately, Sundstrand which makes aerospace components, said its second-quarter earnings, to be released this week, would be up from the second quarter of 1992 but the company was 'disappointed with the overall level of our earnings momentum.' It added that the sale of its Data Control business to AlliedSignal for Dollars 195m would result in a significant, non-recurring financial gain.</p>

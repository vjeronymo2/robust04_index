As Dasa announced  in Munich today, the Mitsui and Co. Ltd. corporation in Tokyo is  to safeguard the space interests of the largest German  enterprises specializing in aerospace and defense technology in  Japan. The already signed agreement represents an expansion of  the treaty concluded in 1981 between the Dasa enterprise Erno  Raumfahrttechnik GmbH (Bremen) and the Japanese trading company  on noncommercial aerospace projects.    Under the leadership of Dasa, a reusable space capsule  procured by the German Aerospace Agency (Dara) from Russia is  being equipped with German-Japanese pay loads and components  under the project name "Express." The capsule is scheduled to  be launched in the autumn of 1994 from the Kagoshima space  center on board a Japanese carrier rocket. This project is  being promoted by the German Research Ministry and the Japanese  Ministry for International Trade and Industry.</p>

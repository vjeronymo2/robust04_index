			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (6): Insight on sites - User view / Property portfolio management / Large retail chains need efficient property management. In the UK, Boots Properties uses a GIS to analyse its portfolio. The business is already benefiting In the UK retail property market, Boots Properties' retail portfolio is one of the largest, including high street and out-of-town sites, writes Claire Gooding. Boots believes that a key source of competitive advantage is the strong emphasis it places on research to inform its business decisions. 'We recognise that the retail property market is inefficient,' says Mike Dutton, business development and research manager. 'This presents a clear opportunity for well-informed investors to enhance the performance of their portfolio.' Site location analysis involves many different variables and indicators. Boots Properties needed a product that would work at postcode sector level, with a wide range of census data. Most important was the ability to forecast the performance of specific local property markets and properties in the portfolio. The chosen solution, CACI's InSite system, was PC-based, user friendly, and provided detailed population forecasts. Boots Properties deliberately bought a group licence to encourage widespread use of the system by other businesses such as Boots The Chemists, Halfords, and Childrens World, for their own market research and estates management. Using OPCS census data, other bought-in consumer analyses, together with in-house proprietary sales data, the GIS team looks at such factors as the balance of supply and demand in the local retail property market, whether the market is over-pricing or under-pricing a certain town, and determining the prospects for rental growth. The analysis is carried further using the SPSS analytical software, integrating data about supply and demand from a wide range of databases and different computers. Dutton is convinced that the GIS, in use since September 1992, has already benefited the business. 'We're concerned to maintain and enhance the asset value, and this system gives us the ability to do that more effectively,' he says. Better-informed decisions will result from the GIS, he concludes, and it should be much easier to exploit market inefficiencies, especially with the benefit of up-up-to-date census data.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario's Dollars 1bn global offering meets strong demand The Province of Ontario's Dollars 1bn of 10-year bonds - its first global offering in the current fiscal year - was launched yesterday and met with strong demand, syndicate officials said. Offering an indicated yield spread over US Treasuries of 67-70 basis points, the bonds were seen to offer good value and the lead managers reported strong demand from international investors. 'It was very encouraging that we saw not only American demand, but also a good bid from European and Far Eastern institutions,' said one syndicate manager. The deal, led by joint bookrunners Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers, will be priced today. Dealers expect the yield spread to be at the lower end of the indicated range. Also in the US dollar sector, Wal-Mart Stores launched a successful issue of Dollars 250m five-year bonds via Goldman Sachs. The deal met with strong demand from retail investors, traders said. 'It's one of those great retail-driven blow-out deals,' said a syndicate manager at another house. 'We would have loved to have led it,' he added. Priced to yield 32 basis points over Treasuries at the fixed re-offer, the spread tightened in after the issue was freed to trade and ended the day at 30 basis points over Treasuries on the bid price. In the D-Mark sector, DM300m of 7 1/8 per cent five-year bonds for the Bank of China got off to a slow start. Lead manager Commerzbank said it was confident the paper would get placed over time, aided by the fact that a double taxation agreement between Germany and China enables some investors subject to German taxation to increase their after-tax yield by an additional 15 per cent of the nominal coupon. However, officials at other banks were more sceptical, arguing that the deal's 105-basis-point yield pick-up over bunds at the price to investors was unlikely to attract retail demand. Undaunted by the recent slew of issuance in the Canadian dollar sector, three more borrowers tapped that market, all in the four-year sector: Commerzbank Overseas Finance issued CDollars 150m of bonds via IBJ International, Electricite de France launched CDollars 125m of paper via Paribas Capital Markets, and the Belgian savings bank ASLK-CGER issued CDollars 75m of bonds via Wood Gundy. The Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation is about to add to supply in the Canadian dollar sector, after announcing yesterday that it plans to issue a global bond soon. Dealers said that the deal could emerge as early as today if market conditions remained stable, and were calling for a CDollars 1bn five-year global offering from the government-guaranteed unit, which sold its first CDollars 1bn global bond last November. Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank was said to be taking bids for a Dollars 500m deal which could also be launched today, traders said.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Bundesbank member hits at move to soften Emu terms Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a leading member of the Bundesbank's decision-making council, yesterday attacked attempts to relax the terms under which European Union states could take part in economic and monetary union. Speaking as an informal meeting of European finance ministers was getting under way to discuss the issue in southern Germany, Mr Jochimsen said a big operation for softening the convergence criteria was already starting. In remarks at an Anglo-German university conference in Oxford, he opposed indications that European finance ministers may decide that Ireland meets the terms, in spite of its large government debt. Ireland's government debt was about 90 per cent of gross domestic product, well in excess of the 60 per cent level set by the Maastricht Treaty, Mr Jochimsen pointed out. 'This gives the wrong signal,' he said, adding that Belgium, Italy and Greece had even more acute debt problems. He welcomed as a contribution to debate last week's proposals from Germany's Christian Democrats on differing paces of European integration. However he doubted the wisdom of proceeding to monetary union with 'core members' at a time when the European Union had to open membership to the east. He underlined the Bundesbank's longstanding wish that monetary union should be embedded in a full-scale political union embodying the principle of subsidiarity - carrying out decision-making as closely as possible to the local level. 'If we want to take this powerful step of Emu we will need a federal order in Europe ..no one wants a superstate, but unless we have the right framework it might be necessary, as a last resort, to give up this project.' Mr Jochimsen expressed concern that acceptance was growing only 'very hesitantly' of the need for a 'common political roof' for monetary union. He said Germany's original request before the Maastricht summit in December 1991 for thoroughgoing steps towards political union had not been simply a bargaining tactic. Rather, it was a crucial precondition to make Emu work.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / French budget freezes spending and raises taxes The French government yesterday unveiled an austerity budget for 1995 which effectively freezes public spending and depends heavily on receipts from higher economic growth and privatisation to slash another FFr25bn (Pounds 3bn) off the budget deficit. The conservative prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, and his budget minister, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, described their own handiwork as 'courageous' in view of the looming presidential election. However, the opposition Socialist party criticised as 'unjust' the tax breaks for middle-class employers of domestic servants, while the Patronat employers' federation said the government's intention to prune a tax rebate to companies could render economic recovery 'fragile'. The government plans to reduce the budget deficit from FFr301.4bn this year, or 4.1 pe cent of gross domestic product, to FFr 274.6bn next year or, 3.5 per cent of GDP. It is banking on a 4.7 per cent rise in tax revenue, bolstered by raising indirect taxes on petrol and gas and electricity. as While making companies foot more of their local tax bills, central government spending will rise to no more than the 1.9 per cent anticipated inflation rate next year. Shaking off months of caution about over-stating the economic recovery, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, forecast real growth next year of 3.1 per cent, mid-way in a forecasting range of 2.7-3.5 per cent and commented that the final result might be 'closer to 3.5 per cent'. He based his confidence largely on resurgent household consumption and capital investment, which he forecast would raise internal demand in France to 3.2 per cent, the highest in Europe. The government's twin sales-pitch is that the 1995 budget will significantly rein in the deficit and debt servicing - stabilising for the first time the share of tax revenue devoted to interest payments - while significantly shortening France's record dole queue of 3.3m. Mr Alphandery also forecast that next year would see the creation of 260,000-300,000 jobs. Underlining the employment priority, Mr Sarkozy said of the FFr55bn in privatisation receipts planned for next year, FFr8bn would go to help other state companies, FFr27bn would be used to reduce the budget deficit, while FFr20bn would help finance job creation measures. Foremost among these would be a further FFr17.5bn reduction of welfare charges for lower-paid workers. Mr Alphandery said that despite the fact many prize assets of the French public sector have already been sold off, he was confident that the government would meet next year's asset sales target just as it had already fulfilled its plan to sell some FFr95bn in state assets in 1993-94. Reflecting the sensitivity inevitably surrounding the last budget before next May's presidential elections, the budget had been heavily leaked beforehand.</p>

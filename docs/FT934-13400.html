			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Compaq net income more than doubles COMPAQ Computer, which yesterday reported a sharp increase in profits, is reaping the benefit of its continued emphasis on cost control and product innovation. The US group is the only large personal computer maker that is consistently profitable and it could soon overtake Apple Computer as world number two after International Business Machines. Shares in the Texas-based manufacturer rose Dollars 2 1/2 to close at Dollars 64 7/8 , on third quarter profits which surpassed most analysts' expectations. It reported net income of Dollars 106.77m for the quarter to September 30, more than double last year's Dollars 49.37m. Revenues rose 64 per cent to Dollars 1.75bn. It is the fifth quarter in a row that Compaq has reported record sales. The results are all the more remarkable because the third quarter is traditionally its weakest. Earnings per share more than doubled to Dollars 1.25, fully diluted, compared with 0.61 a year ago. Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive and the principal architect of Compaq's turnround 16 months ago, attributed the results to continued product innovation, an emphasis on manufacturing efficiencies and effective management of distribution channels. Until the middle of 1992, the company's market share and profitability had been threatened by a strategy of charging a premium price for quality and distributing strictly through approved dealers. Mr Pfeiffer sought ways of manufacturing a quality product at lower prices and looked for new avenues to market. The ensuing price war seems to have hit Compaq's competitors while markedly improving the company's market share. Mr Pfeiffer said Compaq was one of the world's most efficient PC producers with revenues of Dollars 700,000 per employee. 'During the year we increased our strategic investments in product development, marketing, advertising and geographic expansion while successfully cutting operating expenses,' he added. The company had concentrated on broadening its product range and taking steps to avoid conflict in the complex of distributors, dealers and retailers that it uses to market its products. All geographic regions contributed to the sales growth. Europe and North America grew 37 and 75 per cent respectively although Mr Pfeiffer pointed out that, measured in local currencies, growth in Europe was closer to 70 per cent. Japan, Latin America and the Pacific Rim all grew at rates in excess of 100 per cent. For the first nine months, revenues were Dollars 4.99bn, up 86 per cent, while net income was Dollars 311.4m, up 152 per cent, equivalent to Dollars 3.68 a share, fully diluted. Inventory rose sharply to Dollars 1.3bn at September 30 compared with Dollars 834m at December 31 last year. Mr Pfeiffer said this was in anticipation of a good fourth quarter, traditionally Compaq's strongest.</p>

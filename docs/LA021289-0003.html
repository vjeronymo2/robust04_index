			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE COVER  </P> <P> As terrorism increases around the world, so it seems to have surged as the  theme of prime-time TV productions.  </P> <P> "The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro," a new TV movie airing Monday at 9 p.m. on  NBC, is the latest example. It recounts the 1985 terrorist takeover of a luxury  cruise ship in the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> Karl Malden and Lee Grant play the pivotal roles as wheelchair-bound Leon  Klinghoffer and his wife, Marilyn. They were among the American passengers  asserting themselves against the four terrorists, who ultimately took the life  of Leon Klinghoffer.  </P> <P> "The incident," says Grant, "shocked the world because of the terrorists'  brutality. They tried to strip the hostages of their humanity but were instead  faced with defiance."  </P> <P> "The passengers, inspired by the personal strength of the Klinghoffers and  other Americans," she added, "refused to surrender their dignity. It was a very  human triumph."  </P> <P> Also in the cast of writer-director Robert Collins' movie are Vera Miles, E.G.  Marshall, Christina Pickles and Susan Lyons.  </P></p>

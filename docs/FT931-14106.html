			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Jobs to go as Smith &amp; Nephew shuts 5 sites SMITH &amp; Nephew, the healthcare company, is withdrawing from its loss-making cotton spinning and denim cloth manufacturing with the loss of 574 jobs. The move marks the end of bulk manufacture of denim in the UK, priced out of the market by supplies from eastern Europe and Asia. Smith &amp; Nephew will close five sites in Lancashire and concentrate production of specialist fabrics at the main textiles site in Brierfield, Lancashire. The production of basic gauze will also end. Mr John Robinson, chief executive, blamed 'relentless and increasing competition from low-cost sources in developing countries' for the closures. He said that voluntary redundancies and early retirement would be offered to staff but that compulsory redundancies would be necessary. The five sites will be sold as industrial or retail units and the cash raised should pay for all but Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m of the costs of the closures, said Mr Robinson. A new medical fabrics division has been created at Brierfield which will employ the remaining 626 staff. The site will receive a Pounds 6m capital investment over the next two years to bring it up to the standard required for the manufacturing of bandages, dressing materials and other medical fabrics. The company is in its close season ahead of final results and would not estimate the effect of the closures on its profit and loss account. However, analysts said the closures would halve the Pounds 40m exceptional profit it made from the sale of its share of the Nivea skin care product brand last month. There would be an increase in operating profits because cotton spinning and denim weaving was losing almost Pounds 1m a year.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Tube strike talks MR ROGER STRAKER, chief negotiator for London Underground, is pictured arriving yesterday at Acas, the conciliation service, for talks aimed at heading off next Thursday's planned 24-hour strike on the Tube. London Underground said the discussions had been useful and it expected to be involved in direct talks with the RMT and TSSA unions today, writes Michael Smith. Yesterday Acas talked to the two sides separately. Union leaders said the strike would go ahead on Thursday unless London Underground dropped its plan to dismiss a total of 1,000 station staff. Mr Straker said there was room for some optimism that the industrial action might be avoided. The talks had given management 'food for thought'. Mr Vernon Hince, RMT assistant general secretary, said it would take more than London Underground simply reiterating its position to stop the strike. Nevertheless, he said the union was prepared for realistic discussions in an attempt to break the deadlock.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Newcastle zone strives to retain assisted-area status ASSISTED-AREA status at-tracted the Norwegian company Grorud to Consett, County Durham, in 1981, the year after the town lost its steelworks and became a symbol of the last manufacturing recession. Aided by grants, Grorud has since become one of Consett's biggest companies, with 330 employees, diversifying successfully beyond door and window fittings, its original business, into stair lifts and precision engineering. Thanks to Consett's development-area status Grorud has received aid totalling Pounds 1.5m towards a total capital spend of Pounds 5m. The company, whose Consett operations will this year turn over Pounds 20m, is expanding there and has bought land beside its factories for another development, pencilled in for 1994. Its target is to increase its Consett payroll to 500. Now it is waiting to see whether the Newcastle travel-to-work area, which includes Consett, wins its fight to remain a development area. If, as is locally feared, it is demoted to intermediate-area status, offering lower grants, the timescale of the Pounds 1m expansion would be affected, Mr David D'Arcy, Grorud's finance director, says. 'We'd have to defer it, we'd have to generate sufficient retained earnings to fill the gap,' he says. He would, he says, be looking to DA grants to cover 30 per cent to 35 per cent of the cost. Grorud exemplifies the pulling power of DA status. Its Oslo-based parent, wanting a British base to sell into the European Community, selected Consett from a number of DAs. Economic development bodies and local authorities in the Newcastle area estimate that regional selective assistance since 1984 has totalled Pounds 68m, creating or safeguarding more than 19,000 jobs. In 1984-89, the area suffered a net loss of 9,600 manufacturing jobs. In Derwentside, which includes Consett, Mr John Pearson, industrial development officer, estimates that four fifths of today's industrial jobs were created in the 1980s. The worry locally is that the government will base its review solely on a 'snapshot' of present unemployment rates. In that league table, the Newcastle travel-to-work area has slipped to about 60th place out of 322, as other areas have risen because of the recession. Newcastle area's case is that its structural economic difficulties are far from solved - it points to high long-term and under-25s unemployment. Demotion from DA status, it is argued, would undermine the job-creating potential of public-sector developments to which more than Pounds 600m investment has been committed.</p>

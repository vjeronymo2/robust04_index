			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Letter: More a criticism of British management than of quality Sir, The Economist Intelligence Unit report, Lessons from Europe's Leading Companies, and Paul Taylor's article, 'Why customers must come first' (Management, October 26), are much more a criticism of British management than of quality management. They implicitly reveal the reason for much of the failure of British management; its almost insatiable desire for the miracle cure, the latest fad and the quick fix. These 'star dust' or 'flavour of the month' approaches are introduced into the organisation by a senior manager in the hope that it will instantly cure all his problems, while he continues 'to get on with running the business' in exactly the same way that he always did. When, not surprisingly, the cure is treated with cynicism by the employees and does not deliver, the manager merely goes on to the next panacea. Total quality management (TQM) has fallen into this 'instant cure' category in the minds of many managers. Their damaging misconception has been pandered to and reinforced by many so-called management consultants who peddle easy, quick and glossy packages called 'TQM' which are claimed to achieve remarkable results almost without effort. As the report points out, they don't work. Total quality management is not quick nor is it effortless. The concepts are easy to understand and to explain but it takes continuous and personal commitment by managers to implement them. TQM is the effective and efficient way of running an organisation to satisfy all its customers and shareholders continuously, on the basis of continuous improvement. Successful implementation of such a continuous improvement process is not only possible, it is the prerequisite of being viable in the international market. It is a very sad reflection on British management that this minimalist requirement does, in fact, offer a major competitive edge in our home market.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Paul Stober] </F>   [Text] A mere month before the election, the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] has yet to finalise plans to secure  at least 9,000 polling stations across the country.    Security at the polling stations will be looked after by a  National Security Management Centre (NSMC) falling under the  IEC. This will co-ordinate a network of Joint Operating Centres  (JOCs), responsible for securing the stations and keeping an eye  on the security situation. These in turn will be largely  staffed by South African Police [SAP] and South African Defence  Force [SADF] personnel, but will be chaired by civilians  appointed by the IEC.    The only problem with the complicated structure is that  there  is no plan to implement it, as details of the massive security  operation have yet to be worked out. A month before the  election there is still confusion over a host of technical  points -- including who will carry the ballot boxes to counting  points and whether security forces will be positioned within the  perimeter of polling stations.    The final plan is the subject of wrangling between the South  African Police and the IEC. The SAP has been pushing a plan it  developed for policing the election late last year, but which  has come under fire from policing experts as "inadequate".    The IEC is trying to work out the necessary improvements  with  the SAP. "The commissioners are meeting frequently with the  police to ensure the safety of the elections and the monitors,"  said Peter Wilson, head of accreditation and logistics for the  IEC's monitoring directorate.    There is also a wrangle about who will command the state  security forces. The IEC does not have jurisdiction over the  SAP or the SADF, although they will form the backbone of  security operations and will have to operate under the banner of  the commission at the polling stations. The SADF dodged polling  station duty rather than place its soldiers under the command of  either the police or the IEC.    As with all security issues, the IEC can only make  recommendations to the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]  which must take the final political decision on how to order the  deployment of security forces. This means any plan the IEC  comes up with is likely to be the subject of time-consuming  political haggling in the TEC. Sources say the IEC has become  the TEC's chief source of information about what is happening on  the ground because the TEC cannot rely on its own intelligence  sub-council -- which is supposed to be keeping the TEC informed  about security problems.    "The members of the subcouncil are so busy keeping  information from each other, they cannot get a decent briefing  together on anything. The TEC has had to rely on the IEC for  objective information," said a security adviser. Without the  IEC to tell it where the problems are, the TEC would not be able  fulfill its main task of ensuring all parties are allowed to  freely campaign throughout the country.    The IEC has been able to feed the TEC with details of  problems on the ground because it is flooding the country with  monitors who will watch every step of the election process --  from the issue of identity documents to monitoring voting at  every polling station.</p>

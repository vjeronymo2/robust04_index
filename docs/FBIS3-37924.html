"We are worried for our guys and adopt all political and  diplomatic measures so that there are as few Russian troops  abroad as possible", Yeltsin said during a meeting with Moscow  teenagers studying in military schools.    The Russian Army would become in the coming years a "mobile,  well-organised (force), equipped with latest weapons and  armaments and with highly professional personnel", according to  the president.    Yeltsin called to accelerate the reform in the Armed Forces  which he said is going not actively enough.    He said that the structure of the Armed Forces would be  considerably changed. The number of major units and formations  will be reduced, while the remaining ones will be reinforced  with personnel and modern weapons and hardware.    "Only in this case they (units) will be able to localise any  conflicts", the president said.</p>

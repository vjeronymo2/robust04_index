			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Midland offers 'Pounds 10 an error' to win rival accounts Midland Bank, one of the UK's four largest clearing banks, launched an aggressive campaign yesterday to win personal customers from its competitors. It promised to pay customers Pounds 10 for each failure to meet four standards of service in transferring an account from another bank. The specific encouragement to customers to switch accounts is a new feature in UK personal banking, where banks have previously been able to rely on some reluctance among customers to move their accounts even if they are dissatisfied with the service provided. It comes less than a week after the prospect of a price war to attract personal customers was raised by the decision by Abbey National bank to halve the interest rate it charges on authorised overdrafts. Mr Keith Whitson, Midland chief executive, said the aim of the scheme was to persuade people that transferring a bank account could be fairly painless. He said research by NOP, the polling organisation, showed that while an estimated 8.4m people in the UK would like to transfer their accounts to a different bank, only around 500,000 actually did so in any one year. Midland promises to get the first cheque book and the first cash card to a customer within five working days; the personal number to use with the card within seven working days; and to pay correctly all standing orders and direct debits. The Pounds 10 payment will apply for each promise that is not kept, and will be in addition to any other refund to a customer as a result, for example, of a failure to follow a payment instruction. Mr Whitson said running current accounts was not especially profitable. But he highlighted the value to a bank of cross-selling financial services, such as insurance or mortgages, to customers with whom it already had a relationship. 'We want to be a high street supermarket for financial products,' he said. 'It is much easier to effect a sale to an existing customer than to make a cold sale.' With around 5m personal customers, Midland's retail base is about the same size as that of Lloyds Bank. Barclays has around 7m personal customers, while National Westminster Bank has 6.5m. Mr Whitson said Midland would review the scheme at the end of the year, but expected to have won 'tens of thousands' of customers by then.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Dresdner Bank chairman warns EC PRO-EUROPEAN sentiment in Germany could be put at risk if the European Community persists in treating the integration of the former GDR as a purely German problem, according to Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Dresdner Bank. 'Unfortunately, it is virtually taken for granted in Europe that the federal republic must deal with the economic integration of eastern Germany alone,' Mr Sarrazin said. 'But there is an inconsistency here: why, for example, should southern Italy, parts of Greece and Portugal, and French agriculture be seen as European problems, while eastern Germany remains a purely German affair?' the bank chief asked. Such questions had to be taken into account in the move towards European economic and monetary union, Mr Sarrazin told a Frankfurt journalists' club. He was responding to past criticism that Germany maintained high interest rates to the detriment of its recession-hit partners. He acknowledged the link between German unification and tensions in the European monetary system, which culminated in last month's widening of the fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism. Redeveloping eastern Germany required additional capital which could only be attracted with high interest rates, Mr Sarrazin said.</p>

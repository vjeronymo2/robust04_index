			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP ALBUM CHART;  </P> <P> ABDUL-JACKSON DUEL CONTINUES  </P> <P> In the long-running battle among dance-music divas Paula Abdul and Janet  Jackson for pop-chart supremacy, Abdul continues to reign on the Billboard  magazine pop album chart. But in the next week or two, Jackson could unseat  Abdul.  </P> <P> Jackson's "Escapade" single, currently No. 1 on the pop singles' chart, is  hotter than Abdul's "Opposites Attract" single, which is No. 6 and sliding down  the chart. Also, Jackson is getting a lot of publicity because of her first  tour. Buoyed by her Grammy haul, Bonnie Raitt's "Nick of Time" album vaulted  from No. 40 to No. 22.  </P> <P> * The Polish female vocalist Basia, who sings both soul and Latin-flavored  songs, is no flash-in-the-pan. "London Warsaw New York," the follow-up to her  hit debut album, entered the pop chart at No. 149 last week but took a  stratospheric leap to No. 34.BT 05,2L,27L,9R,9R,8RRankRank 2WeeksTitle  (Label)Last WeekWeeks Agoon Chart1."Forever Your Girl"1186Paula Abdul  (Virgin)2."Rhythm Nation 1814"2223Janet Jackson (A&amp;M)3."...

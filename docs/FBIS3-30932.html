			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By TANJUG editor in chief Dusan Zupan; "pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- If logic and evidence  still have any meaning in this world of ours, the Serb side has  provided more than convincing arguments to prove that it could  not have been responsible for the tragedy at a Sarajevo open air  market on Saturday.    Most of the allegations presented by the Muslim authorities,  from the allegations about the number of dead (68) and wounded  (197) to those about the causes of the explosion, have been  disproved by photos from the scene of the tragedy and subsequent  analyses of technical details by experts who have warned that  the incident has no doubt been stage-managed.    There is always a motive for every crime, including the one  in Sarajevo. It is completely overlooked that the effect of the  massacre has not been the same in the case of all the interested  sides.    Croats, who have been on the brink of coming under the blow  of international sanctions because of their military  intervention in Bosnia, now breath more easily. Zagreb is no  longer the focus of international criticism.    As for the Muslims, they have temporarily quieted the  mounting dissatisfaction in the world over their increasingly  clearer commitment to the continuation of the war and not peace  talks.    After the joint visit to Sarajevo of the Turkish and  Pakistani prime ministers, conceived as a political propaganda  attraction, failed to produce the desired effect, Muslim  strategists in Sarajevo once again decided to apply the earlier  tested formula -- blood and carnage -- as the most effective and  efficient means of the battle for domination in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The strong inclination of the Muslim leadership to resort to  the above formula was clearly recorded on July 14, 1992 by the  then U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander in Bosnia Lewis  Mackenzie in a letter to the then UNPROFOR commander, Indian  General Satish Nambiar and ranking U.N. official Marrack  Goulding, according to a decoded text of the letter, a copy of  which TANJUG has. Canadian General Mackenzie described in the  letter, among other things, his conversation with Bosnian Muslim  leader Alija Izetbegovic.    ``My conversation yesterday has convinced me once and for  all  that the president will only accept intervention or death for  `his' people as final solution (his words). There have been  many opportunities for negotiations over the past few days,  which he has rejected, including an overture by his SDA party,  who wanted to meet with the Serbs...he (Izetbegovic) indicated  that if the international community was not prepared to  intervene, than he was prepared to "die twice," rather than deal  with the "aggressor."    "Indications in Sarajevo point to a desire by the presidency  (Muslim) to perpetuate the current crisis."    General Mackenzie was compelled to withdraw from his post  and  go into retirement, among other reasons, because he wrote in the  letter, "They (Muslims) could target us, and try to make it look  like the Serbs did it." It is more than obvious that the Bosnian  Muslim policy has not changed and it is, therefore, not at all  surprising that Muslims prevented unbiased experts from  conducting a regular investigation at the scene of the event,  from performing autopsies, and examining wounds.    According to the latest indications by reliable sources,  UNPROFOR has this time again mustered the strength to send to  the U.N. headquarters a report saying that the Muslim side is  reponsible for the crime at the Sarajevo market. It remains to  be seen whether an extra effort will be made and the report be  published. If so, it will be a headway compared with the case  of the concealed report about the massacre in Save Miskin Street  (in 1992), which was used as a prelude to the introduction of  the sanctions against Yugoslavia. The concealing of the latest  facts, or their possible forging, could be used as a pretext for  air strikes against the Serbs.    Not only Croats and Muslims have emerged as "winners" from  the massacre in Sarajevo, but also western media, which have  again a priori and in chorus condemned the Serbs as the side  responsible for the crime. The tragedy at Sarajevo's Markale  market was given high priority by media, especially CNN TV,  which will bring new clients, higher circulation or rating, and  more advertisements to those advocates of war while they await  the next media attraction, if possible air strikes against  Serbs, which they have openly been calling for. It is most  likely for that reason that foreign news agencies on Tuesday  evening said nothing about TANJUG's report that there exists of  an UNPROFOR report which says that the Muslims are reponsible  for the latest massacre in Sarajevo.    What a paradox. The only losers have been Serbs, because,  even if they are not bombed, they have again been satanized  before a large part of the world public and have a priori been  charged as criminals and the guilty side. The only consolation  is that it is beyond doubt that "lies have short wings" and that  in the long run, no matter how long it takes, the anti-Serb  propaganda will boomerang.    It is up to the world public to decide whether the latest  Muslim-staged incident will, despite all the available facts,  including the UNPROFOR report, and without a serious  international investigation, be used to launch air strikes  against the Bosnian Serbs. If it is, many things could become  so complicated that they would get out of control.    It is for that reason that the United Nations, that is,  those  who rule the world organization, should at least this time  follow the advice of Canadian General Mackenzie that Izetbegovic  "must be forced to the table" to negotiate.    For as long as that it is not done, there will be new  Markalas and unnecessary innocent casualties.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Second-half improvement at Engen AN IMPROVED second-half performance helped Engen, the energy unit of South Africa's Gencor mining group, lift net income by 13 per cent to R480m (Dollars 139m) in the year to August, from R424m a year ago. Earnings, which were in line with market expectations, were helped by the higher volumes of crude oil processed at the Engen refinery in Durban following the successful commissioning of a R600m expansion project. The dividend was increased by 12 per cent to 154 cents per share, against 137.5 cents last time, on earnings of 309 cents per share compared with 275 cents. The company was reluctant to offer a specific earnings forecast, saying it depended on the economy recovering from recession and political stability. With the benefits of the refinery upgrade now available for a full year, however, they were optimistic that earnings should improve. Turnover rose by 17.7 per cent to R7.7bn, from R6.6bn, due mainly to two government-imposed rises in petrol prices during the year. There was no volume growth in the domestic market. Continuing benefits from overseas markets re-opening to South Africa in the wake of political reform helped boost export volumes by 70 per cent. Engen now exports to 26 countries, mostly in Africa. Margins on these sales are considerably lower than in the domestic market. Operating income rose by 47.1 per cent to R578m, but financing income fell to R16m from R140m in 1992 as rights issue cash was spent. As a result, pre-tax income was only 11.4 per cent higher at R594m (R533m). A R115m programme to convert the livery of petrol stations to Engen from Mobil (Engen was formed on the rump of the disinvesting Mobil in 1990) is nearly complete and has boosted market share, which reached 25.8 per cent in the gasoline market in the second half-year.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Body Shop wins back six stores BODY SHOP, the international franchise chain, won back control of six of its branches in the south-east yesterday. Sir Peter Pain, in the High Court, granted Body Shop an injunction removing Mrs Pauline Rawle from control of the branches - at Maidstone, Bromley and Canterbury, in Kent; Romford in Essex; and two at Croydon, south London. Body Shop has issued a writ claiming Pounds 340,000 from Mrs Rawle in respect of products supplied. Sir Peter said Mrs Rawle had become involved in a religious sect which was known as the Victory Church. She insisted on staff attending 'mystic violence courses' run by the church, and dismissed more than 50 of her staff, alleging they were disloyal to her. There was a clear case, on the face of it, that she had repudiated her contract with the organisation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Sunday the chairman of Russia's Agrarian Union  Vasiliy Starodubtsev told Interfax that he would not sign the  Civic Accord agreement. He said the Agrarians retained enough  sense to reject the document. The Agrarian Union brings  together all the major farms and farming facilities of Russia.    In April the Union's Council sent an open letter to  President  Yeltsin. According to Starodubtsev, it demanded the right to  join the conciliatory commission's efforts to polish the  document and devise a mechanism for its realization.    The Union was still waiting for an answer from the  president.    Although the Russian farmers welcomed every wise,  well-intended and long-term proposal, Starodubtsev said they  would never welcome moves to do them in and destroy Russia.    Starodubtsev saw the Civic Accord agreement as suicidal.  Even if Yeltsin invited the Union to sign the Civic Accord  agreement, Starodubtsev would not sign. He was confident that  the conclusion of agreements with those who worked to destroy  the countryside was immoral.</p>

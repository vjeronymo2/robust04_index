			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (23): Industry seeks political help - The UK's position as a global participant is at risk UK aerospace industry is pressing the government to adopt a new strategic initiative, to guarantee the future of the industry at a time when it is continuing to lose market share. Although companies have continued to restructure and consolidate their operations through partnerships and alliances with international groups, they warn that the sector's future will depend on a political consensus around a clearly stated public policy of support for the industry. In a written submission to the House of Commons trade and industry select committee, the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), the trade association grouping more than 200 UK aerospace companies, said that the government, in addition to providing a stable long-term investment climate, needed to develop with the industry 'a national technological strategy to make greater progress in maximising the efficient use of investment resources from private and public sources.' The call for greater government commitment comes at a time when UK aerospace companies are continuing to face the effects of the prolonged recession in the civil aircraft business and the decline in government defence following the end of the cold war. Until recently, the UK aerospace industry was second only in size to that of the US among western economies. But after peaking in 1990, its annual turnover has declined from Pounds 11.7bn four years ago to around Pounds 10.4bn. The impact of lower defence budgets has led to a marked change in the civil-military split, with civil activities now accounting for around 50 per cent of total annual turnover compared with only 25 per cent in 1980. Over the past 12 years, restructuring has led to a decline in employment, from nearly 230,000 people in 1980 to fewer than 150,000 last year. Other aerospace industries in Europe have fared better than the UK in terms of government support. By 1990, the annual turnover of the French industry had begun to match the UK, with France maintaining a stronger level of defence spending as well as adopting an active policy of backing what it considers a strategic industrial sector. The German industry has enjoyed even greater government support. Fierce competitive pressures, coupled with the growing costs of research and product development, have forced the UK industry - which is still second to chemicals in the UK trade balance league, exporting about 70 per cent of its turnover - to step up efforts to rationalise by forging new international partnerships, as well as shedding certain assets to focus on core activities. British Aerospace (BAe) has pursued its vigorous rationalisation and recovery strategy of returning the company to its basic defence and civil aerospace businesses. On the civil side, BAe is continuing to seek international partnerships for both its turbopropeller and regional jet operations. After failing to form a joint regional jet venture with Taiwan last year, the UK group has pinned its hopes on forming a regional jet alliance with Fokker,the Dutch manufacturer now controlled by Deutsche Aerospace of Germany. In the turbopropeller sector, BAe has also had lengthy discussions with the Franco-Italian ATR consortium. Rationalisation has also been intensified in BAe's space and missiles businesses. The UK company has agreed to sell its space systems division to Matra-Marconi, a joint venture between the French Matra company and the UK General Electric Company. BAe has also been negotiating with Matra to merge their respective guided weapons activities. BAe's core defence aerospace operations continue to be the company's main profit centre, on the back of the group's lucrative relationship with Saudi Arabia and the strong export performance of its Hawk fighter-trainer aircraft. BAe also expects its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus civil aircraft consortium to reap long-term dividends. But for BAe much will hinge in the future on the controversial Eurofighter 2000 programme, as well as on the company's involvement in the Future Large Aircraft (FLA) project, a European collaborative venture to build a new military transport aircraft. The UK has maintained its strong commitment to Eurofighter, although the programme for the new advanced fighter has been dogged by controversy in Germany. While there is broad consensus in the UK over Eurofighter, the FLA project has created deep divisions both within the government and the industry. The issue centres on whether Britain should buy the new US Lockheed Hercules C-130J or the European FLA to replace the Royal Air Force's ageing transport fleet. The Lockheed camp has argued that its aircraft will be ready to meet the RAF's needs by 1996, while the FLA still faces uncertain development costs and will not be available until the next century. Lockheed has also said that UK participation in the programme will be worth Pounds 2.2bn and secure 3,500 jobs in Britain. But BAe and its supporters have warned that the stakes are high, and that the consequences would be dire if the UK did not participate in the European FLA project. BAe has warned that its lead in wing design and production in Europe might be lost to Germany and France if it did not participate in the FLA programme. There could also be serious implications over BAe's role in Airbus, since the FLA could be built by the European civil aircraft consortium extending its activities into the military sector. In the UK aero-engine industry, the big challenge for Rolls-Royce is the development of its high-thrust Trent family of engines to power the new generation of large widebody airliners, which are expected to account for an increasingly large share of the total aircraft market during the next 20 years. While the Trent programme has been a technical success, the problem for Rolls-Royce is that it has had to continue investing heavily in the development of its new high-thrust engines at the same time as rationalising the company in the face of the industry's downturn and the increasingly tough competition from its two US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. Rationalisation has also been a main feature of the UK aerospace components sector. Lucas has been restructuring its US aerospace operations, while expanding through joint ventures in the fast growing Asia Pacific market. TI has absorbed Dowty, which in turn has forged an Anglo French aircraft landing gear joint venture with Messier Bugatti. Overall, however, the UK aerospace industry warns that rationalisation, greater international collaboration and significant productivity improvements cannot alone guarantee the sector's long-term future. Unless the government is prepared to match the support in R&amp;D in new aerospace technologies and materials given by other countries to their industries, as well as more active export backing, there is a growing danger that the UK may see its position as a leading global aerospace participant severely undermined. As the SBAC put it to the House of Commons select committee: 'Failure to sustain adequate R&amp;D investment to counter international competition could mean an inevitable erosion of UK capability - and once lost, the industry's leading position could not be regained.'</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Slovakia blocks privatisations The new Slovak government has blocked the privatisation of 13 projects approved by its predecessor between February 15 and March 13, the privatisation minister, Mr Milan Janicina, said yesterday. Mr Vladimir Meciar's government, ousted in a no-confidence vote on March 11, had approved 45 direct sales of state-owned companies. Many were approved after Mr Meciar lost the vote and before the new administration took over, government officials said. On March 18, Mr Rudolf Filkus, the new finance minister, blocked the account of the National Property Fund, effectively stopping any transfers of shares held by the agency which administers the privatisation of state-held enterprises. 'The projects in question are legally and technically imperfect,' he said. However, some of the 13 companies would be awarded to the original buyers approved by Mr Meciar's government 'when purified of legal and technical imperfections', he said. Mr Janicina added that some projects lacked authorisation by the anti-monopoly bureau and other legal requirements. Others undervalued property.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Frugal Christmas in store: Chris Tighe finds shoppers in widely separated retail centres sharing the same worries about their festive spending CAUTIOUS consumerism is the dominant theme of Christmas 1992 in two urban retail centres 297 miles apart. Croydon's Whitgift Centre and Newcastle upon Tyne's Eldon Square serve communities with different historic roots, but they are united by the impact of the recession and concern about Britain's economic outlook. In both centres the signs are the same - shoppers are shunning credit cards, are fearful of debt and are thinking hard about purchases. This is a Christmas when 'Pounds 1 off' matters. Christmas shopping at both began a week late. Extended evening openings and - at the Whitgift Centre - Sunday trading have probably exacerbated the trend, giving shoppers more last-minute buying time providing they have money to spend or the inclination to go into debt. After a difficult trading year and a slow start to Christmas, much hangs on this crucial last week. 'We take 12 per cent of our annual turnover in the last eight days,' says Croydon jeweller Mr Ray Lyons. The Whitgift Centre is a 1.25m sq ft, partly covered complex with 126 shops which opened in 1969 and is owned by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and the Whitgift Foundation. Mr Rod Wood, the manager, forecasts that pre-Christmas takings will be between 4 per cent and 7 per cent down on last year. 'Some shops are up, but they're the few,' he says. Eldon Square is a 1.5m sq ft covered complex with 160 shops that was completed in stages from 1976 and is owned by property development group Capital and Counties, Newcastle City Council and Shell Pension Trust. Mr Gordon Allanson, the manager of Eldon Square, expects trade to be '1 per cent to 2 per cent down on last year'. Retailers' dizzy days of dramatic turnover growth based on high inflation are over, he warns. 'We're going to have to get used to a different climate. We must come to terms with being cost-conscious and not expecting big year-on-year increases.' Realism has settled on shoppers as well. 'One could boringly call it a practical Christmas,' says Mr Brian Forbes Turner, chairman of the Eldon Square Merchants' Association and managing director of the Bainbridge department store. 'People are looking at the sensible purchases.' A Croydon shopper says: 'Last year we bought my dad a silver-plated lighter  -this year it'll be socks and boxer shorts.' Children are the last to suffer - toys are classed as essentials and both centres report strong sales in electronic items. The recession reached Croydon before Newcastle. Eldon Square has only felt the full effects this year with an unprecedented 10 receiverships. 'In terms of boom and recession Newcastle tends to be 18 months to two years behind the south-east,' says Mr Bill Black, Capital and Counties group manager. Extensive office developments and prosperous housing areas gave Croydon self-assurance in the 1980s, but now it is adjusting to harder times. Local unemployment has touched 10 per cent this year and the borough's rate of mortgage repossession actions is among Britain's highest. The recession and technological change have cost office jobs. Newcastle, on the other hand, suffered traumatic structural economic change in the recession of the early 1980s, but had hoped to withstand the present downturn. In contrast, Croydon has smaller mortgages, freeing up spending power. It does, however, have large pockets of deprivation and long-term unemployment. Newcastle, with 13.8 per cent unemployment, is fighting to remain one of the government's assisted areas - regions which qualify for financial support. Croydon is striving to become one.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NEWCASTLE BUSINESSES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The centre manager Gordon Allanson: 'People are being very much more careful. There are still a lot of people around but they aren't buying quite as much. They're very discerning shoppers this year.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The department store manager Brian Forbes Turner of Bainbridge, part of the John Lewis Partnership: 'We were up by 2% last week (on the same week last year). That was an increase for the first time in eight weeks. That's indicative it's been tough going. Last Saturday was excellent; it had a buzz about it. I'd think we will match last year or be slightly up.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The small businessman James Doyle, proprietor of Watch It, clock sellers, and former general manager of the Tick Tock chain with 32 shops which went into receivership in January: 'I took this shop over on November 21. It's a hell of a risk. I've now got a third mortgage on my house. We're doing as well as we thought we would.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The shop assistant Ann Dobbing in Gullivers, a national leather goods chain: 'It's very busy, I don't know if it's because of our sale. You can have the shop empty or chock-a-block; you'd think a train had tipped everybody off.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SHOPPERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The family Fireman Alan Henzell and his wife Pat live in Newcastle with their children aged 9, 8 and 5. He earns Pounds 16,000 a year. Mrs Henzell said: 'I think we're spending more this year, but we haven't bought it all at once. The Sega Megadrive (computer games console) - Pounds 120  -we've had for a few months and the portable TV's a 'buy now, pay cash in June' offer. We'll spend over Pounds 1,000 this year. I feel worse off.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The female shopper  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sharon Blackburn, 21, is a personal assistant in a Northumberland environmental consultancy, living in Tyne and Wear: 'I'm spending about the same, Pounds 200-300. My work's great; it's a small company, there were just four of us, now there's 10. But a lot of my family have been made redundant; two of my uncles and a cousin have lost their jobs.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The unemployed man Michael Cook, 32, is married with children aged 11,10 and 6. His wife isn't earning. They live in Stanley, County Durham. 'I've been out of work six or seven years. We'll spend Pounds 200 on the children. We began putting money away in June. You have to give up a lot of things as Christmas gets nearer.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The mother Jennifer Latimer is married with a six-year-old son. Her husband is a service engineer. They live in Chester-le-Street, County Durham. 'Nobody's bothering as much this year. My family are saying: 'Don't bother with me,' so I haven't. I feel worse off, mainly because we haven't had a pay rise. I've spent less, about Pounds 200.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The male shopper Nick Booth, a doctor, is a GP in Prudhoe, Northumberland, where he lives. He is married with three children. 'I'll spend about the same. How much? I haven't a clue. I think things are in a mess. I see lots of people (patients) who were hardly buying any food in November to have a good time at Christmas.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The pensioner Widow Jean Jackson lives in Newcastle. 'The pension doesn't go so far. I had to go for new glasses today - Pounds 122. That's taken a big slice out of my Christmas spending. My son could be out of work by tomorrow; he's an accountant. The firm's going bust. We're used to recession here.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CROYDON BUSINESSES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The centre manager Rod Wood: 'Shoppers have still got their wallets padlocked. They're taking their time and looking for the best deal. They're more discerning and long may it reign.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The department store manager David Batt of Allders, part of Allders Group: 'It's been slow to start. We'll be just ahead of last year. There are some signs the recession's abating. People seem to be spending generally less on individual gifts but ironically there appears to be a very noticeable trend where people are spending on better merchandise.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The small businessman Ray Lyons, the proprietor of Lyons Jewellers, has worked in the centre for 20 years: 'Building societies are bulging with money. The shops pushing it (Christmas) will do better because a lot have gone down the pan. I think we'll come out quite a lot ahead. I think lots of businesses are going to go.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The shop assistant Karim Pridmore is 23 and works in a family-owned business selling computer and electronic games and videos: 'People will cut on themselves, but the last thing they do is cut on the children.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SHOPPERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The family Ashley and Yvonne Tuck. Ashley is a self-employed dental technician in Brixton earning up to Pounds 25,000 a year. Yvonne is newly redundant. They have one daughter who is nearly two, and live in Croydon. Mrs Tuck: 'We've no money to spend; we've got a bank loan to be repaid in the new year. We'll spend Pounds 500-600. We tore our credit card up, we got ourselves into too much difficulty.' Ashley: 'With using credit cards we spent more.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The female shopper Juliet Graham, 23, is a tour operator in London and lives in Croydon. 'I'll spend about Pounds 150, not as much as last year. I'm buying more practical things. The company I work for (American Express) have made a few redundancies here; it looks as if there'll be more. I'm paying by cash. Last year I had a big splurge on my Visa card.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The unemployed man Michael White, 29, is a decorator. He is married with children aged three and nine months. His wife isn't earning. They live in Crystal Palace, south London. 'We get a giro every fortnight; we've saved Pounds 300. We'll spend that for Christmas; when it's finished, it's finished. I think next year will be a bit better.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The mother Jane Lockwood, a housewife has children aged five and two. Her husband, a printer, has not been much affected by the recession. They live in Eltham, south London. 'We aren't buying for as many people as we used to. Our mortgage has been big. We've neglected ourselves all year so we need a little bit extra to spend. We'll spend Pounds 600. We'll pay cash.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The male shopper Raymond McConnell, 44, a Cellnet radio engineer, whose wife isn't earning. has children aged seven, four and 18 months. They live in Crystal Palace, south London. 'We're spending the same - a hell of a lot, about Pounds 300. I'm paying by Switch; the credit card's far too dangerous. An overdraft is financial discipline.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The pensioner Winifred Feeney, a widow, has a small occupational pension. She lives in south London. 'Things have got so expensive. I'll spend Pounds 500 this year. I use my Access and Barclaycard and Marks and Spencer card  -you don't want to walk through here with Pounds 200. I work it all out and pay the bill in January.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

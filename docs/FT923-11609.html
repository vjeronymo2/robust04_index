			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: German money supply figures bring unease WORSE-than-expected figures on the German money supply further knocked confidence in European bond markets yesterday, though an easing of pressure in the German money markets allowed bunds to recover their poise by the end of the day. The keenly-awaited June growth rate for M3 came in at 8.7 per cent, down from a revised 8.8 per cent for May (previously also recorded at 8.7 per cent). The news undermined a rally in the bund market, which had been prompted by speculation early in the day that the M3 data would show a growth rate of 8.3 per cent. The latest figure was largely disregarded as a guide to the future direction of German monetary policy. Last week's move by the Bundesbank to raise the discount rate while leaving the key Lombard rate untouched would have been taken with full knowledge of the latest money supply position, analysts said. 'The key number will be the July figure, which comes out in August,' said one economist. 'At the moment, it's too close to call.' In the meantime, the Bundesbank's actions at its weekly repurchase tender confirmed its apparent intention since last week's rate rise to alleviate tension in the money market. 'They're giving the impression that the market has taken their move last week too seriously,' said Mr Neville Quie, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in London. The authorities injected a net DM7.7bn into the market, at a general rate of 9.7 per cent. That helped money market rates to fall to below 9.7 per cent, further below the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. The bund futures contract on Liffe traded in a range of 87.05-87.41, before coming to rest at 87.27, up on the day. THE UK government bond market was shaken temporarily by the the German money supply figures, but it recovered later. Fixated by events in Germany, the news that retail sales in June had fallen by 0.2 per cent had little effect on the market. 'People are now waiting to see what comes out of the cabinet about public spending,' said one observer. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, has given stern warnings that public spending will have to be contained to prevent the fiscal deficit rising, and the market is now waiting to see whether he can deliver. Gilt futures, which had opened at 98.23, ended the day lower at 98.17, though up from the 89.09 they touched after the news from Germany. ANOTHER decline in equity prices worldwide and speculation that the Federal Reserve was in the market buying bonds provided US Treasury securities with a boost. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/2 at 104 3/8 , yielding 7.618 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/16 at 101 3/8 , to carry a yield of 4.235 per cent. The main influence on early trading was the fall in Japanese, European and US stock markets. Hopes that lower equity prices would persuade investors to move out of stocks and into government securities gave a lift to the long end of the Treasury market. The second day of congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, was mostly ignored.</p>

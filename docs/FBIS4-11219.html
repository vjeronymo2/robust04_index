			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz -- Sources linked to the national Defense  Ministry and the military high command on 14 April announced  that "a national strategy document" for the defense of national  "sovereignty and security" will be delivered next week to the  president of the Republic and captain general of the Armed  Forces, Gonzalez Sanchez de Lozada, for its "immediate  implementation" in the attempt to safeguard the Bolivian state's  physical integrity.    The sources explained that for this purpose a meeting of the  Defense Ministry, the National Security Supreme Council [Consejo  Supreme de Seguridad Nacional, COSDENA], and the Armed Forces  command was called during the past few hours. The meeting's  purpose is to start drafting the document that will be submitted  to the chief of state.    The sources commented: We are going to adopt a definite  stance -- in our capacity as the government -- regarding reports  that revealed the "internal and external weakness" shown by the  country in view of the "interference and imposition" of the  foreign forces acting in the national territory.    They also said: "Our rule will be to propose basic  guidelines for its defense."    This information was disclosed a few hours after former  President Jaime Paz Zamora accused the United States of  interfering in domestic affairs through the financial  cooperation it offers for the fight against drug trafficking.    To prove the pressure exerted by the United States in "many  fields" of cooperation it grants Bolivia, Paz Zamora said: "I  took our flag and went out to defend national dignity."    The proposals the national organizations directly charged  with security will make will include precise suggestions on  subjects related to the presence of foreign troops in Bolivia,  the existence of technical cooperation commissions for the  struggle against drug trafficking, and the Armed Forces' actions  to guarantee external and internal security.    The sources pointed out that "the president of the Republic,  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, now has to call COSDENA to assess, as  a whole, the discoveries disclosed these past weeks as a result  of the investigations into the government authorities' links to  drug trafficking."    In the meantime, National Defense Ministry sources today  asserted that the drug trafficking scourge during the past 10  years has become a "destabilizing factor" for the Bolivian  state's institutional system.    They also pointed out that the illegal business of drug  trafficking had infiltrated "the state's most sensitive security  structure" and, consequently, there is a risk -- if this scourge  is not eradicated -- of "irreversibly enslaving" the Bolivian  state with consequences that, so far, "have not been truly  determined."    They also said they would make proposals designed to review  agreements Bolivia has signed with the United States that  "endorse a constant presence of foreign troops" in the national  territory because -- they said -- it violates Bolivian  sovereignty and the country's laws.    They pointed out that the national government will have to  do  something similar about the "technical cooperation commissions"  such as the DEA that act "with complete freedom and autonomy" in  Bolivia.    The sources added: "We must establish an explicit difference  between the functions of the U.S. missions that give  humanitarian aid to given regions of the country and the U.S.  logistical support in the war against drug trafficking. Rules  for this sort of aid must be established."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii on Wednesday did not rule out including a tax reform  promise in a package of market-opening measures now being  compiled.    Fujii indicated no objections at a regular news conference  to  including the government's commitment to overhaul the tax system  this year in the market measures due this month.    He was asked about a suggestion Tuesday by Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to include the tax reform plan in  the "voluntary" market-opening steps to address Japan-U.S. trade  disputes.    Fujii repeated that the governing coalition has already  vowed  to enact in this Diet session a permanent tax overhaul that  shifts the tax burden away from direct taxes, such as those on  income, toward such indirect levies as the consumption tax.    Washington has called Japan's fiscal stimulus steps too  paltry to boost domestic demand to help curb Japan's trade  surplus. U.S. officials fault the one-year nature of the 6  trillion yen in income and resident's tax cuts decided on last  month.    Fujii refused to comment on reports that the fiscal 1994  budget might be delayed or that his ministry is preparing a  provisional budget as opposition lawmakers are blocking the  budget debate by wrangling over a questionable loan to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The finance minister repeatedly stressed that the ministry  wants the budget debate and enactment to proceed as quickly as  possible but would not offer a time frame.    He said quick enactment would be "a plus for real demand"  but  would not say whether delays would hurt the economy.    He repeated that Japan does not plan to offer any new trade  measures to the U.S. when Fujii meets U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen this weekend at a conference of Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum members.    Whether he will meet separately with Bentsen at the Hawaii  meeting has not been decided, Fujii said, repeating that the  APEC conference is for discussing regional economics and "is not  a place for negotiating."</p>

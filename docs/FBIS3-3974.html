			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "The Key Lies in Leadership"] </F>   [Text] The objective of a socialist market economic  structure and how it affects the military in the new period is a  question currently facing national defense and army building and  is also a new situation facing military legislation. The key to  gaining a clear understanding of the new situation, facing up to  the new topic, and speeding up the pace of military legislation  lies in leadership.    First, we should deepen our understanding, upgrade our  conceptions, and consider military legislation as an important  item on the agenda of the party committee. In the course of  reform, the tried and proven methods of doing things should be  affirmed in the form of laws, the achievements of reform and  opening up to the outside world should be consolidated, and  decisionmaking on reform should be closely combined with  decisionmaking on legislation. Before establishing or reforming  things, we should try to enact and apply laws. We should ensure  the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization, as  well as laws. To put it another way, we should "enact laws as  far as possible before we act." This is a major change not only  in China's legislative thinking but also in its leadership  conception and method. Military laws and regulations, which are  the embodiment of the will of the state and the Army, are highly  authoritative, mandatory, and stable and have great significance  in guiding, promoting, and ensuring the state and army building.  Leaders of all departments should regard the enactment of  military laws and regulations as an important task.    Second, we should do a good job of three things: Tasking,  organization, and ensuring completion of the task within the  time prescribed by the legislative plans. The Standing  Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress stated: "The  units assigned the task of drafting laws which failed to  accomplish their tasks by the scheduled time should promptly  submit a report to the Standing Committee with explanations."  This requirement is also applicable to the Army. Once  legislative projects are determined by the legislation plan, the  drafting departments should ascertain the task, organization,  and time limit, play close attention to the drafting of laws,  and submit the draft laws to the higher authorities for  examination and approval. Those which fail to do so should  write a report to the Military Commission with explanations.    Third, we should select cadres and assign them the task of  drafting military laws and regulations and place great stress on  improving the quality of drafting military laws and regulations.  Drafting military laws and regulations is an important task  dealing with theory, practice, policy, and professionalism. The  drafted articles should be in line with the party's line,  principles, and policies, complementary to the national  condition and the reality of the Army, and should be made, as  far as possible, practical, clear, detailed, and easy to  implement. As such, the personnel drafting military laws and  regulations should be strong, have a good mastery of  professional work, and an intimate knowledge of laws. At the  same time, they should have a desire to work and be good  writers. Law drafters should adhere to an important principle:  Proceeding from the overall situation of national defense and  army building, submitting local interests to overall interests,  and conscientiously safeguarding the unity of socialist legal  system. Some military laws and regulations should remove  departmental confinement, ensure that one law is enacted for the  same or similar issues, and refrain from letting departments  enact their own laws.    Fourth, we should place great stress on bringing the role of  experts into play in legislative work. Military departments  which have the task of legislation should invite experts to aid  in the drafting of military laws and regulations and earnestly  heed their opinions and suggestions. This will help avoid  detours and improve work efficiency and quality.    Fifth, we should strengthen investigation and study, do a  good job of consultation and coordination, fully understand the  arduousness of legislation work, and make herculean efforts to  conduct investigation and study in a down-to-earth manner. For  some complicated issues, we should conduct repeated  investigations and study and, for the issues which have to do  with local authorities, we should conduct investigation and  study in relevant localities. Meanwhile, the process of  legislation is also a process of democratic policymaking. When  it comes to issues which have to do with departments concerned,  the departments should coordinate with one another. With regard  to some important and complicated issues, leading comrades  should take up and solve the issues satisfactorily through  consultations. Only in this way can the contents of laws and  regulations be practical and really applicable.    Sixth, we should study and use as reference the useful  experiences of foreign countries and armies in legislation.  Laws are the common cultural wealth created by mankind. The  legal systems of some developed countries are relatively sound.  We can use some of their useful practices to serve our own  purposes. In the course of drafting military laws and  regulations, we should extensively collect and sort out the  legal materials of foreign countries and armies so as to use  them as a reference in drafting military legislation.</p>

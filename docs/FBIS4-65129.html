			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ulla-Marie Johansen in Oslo] </F>   [Text] The Norwegian Government wants to investigate the  background of the fascist members of the newly appointed Italian  Government before meetings are held between the two countries'  ministers. Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal says  cooperation will not be successful if direct links to  Mussolini's supporter organizations are discovered in the past  of the four ministers concerned.    [Johansen] Socialist Left Party Chairman Erik Solheim  stressed in parliament today that fascism in Europe is not a  common phenomenon but a criminal ideology and he wanted to know  what attitude the government intends to take toward the four  fascist ministers in the new Italian Government. Solheim asked  whether the government intends to meet with the Italian  ministers of culture, environmental protection, agriculture, and  transport at ministerial level.    Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal announced that the  Norwegian Government intends to assess the ministers concerned  on the basis of the replies they have given. If they are  fascists without any direct line to Mussolini, then they pose no  problem. Should one of them belong to this gang, links will be  out of the question, Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal  stated sharply in a reply given in parliament today.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Feb 1O (AFP) -- Croatia and the Bosnian  Government agreed here Thursday to call for UN surveillance of  Bosnia's borders to monitor arms and troop movements, amid  renewed hopes for improved bilateral relations.    Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said "constructive"  talks with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the  sidelines of the all-party Geneva conference had focused on "a  model of organisation of Bosnia-Herzegovina after a general  normalisation" of relations between the two sides. In a joint  statement both men said separate letters would be sent to the UN  Security Council calling for border surveillance.    Zagreb has denied repeated accusations that regular Croatian  troops are fighting in central Bosnia, where Bosnian Croat and  mainly-Moslem Bosnian Government forces are engaged in a bitter  territorial conflict.    Granic said military chiefs from the two warring parties  were  scheduled to meet next week in Sarajevo. He added that he and  Silajdzic would step up efforts to ensure the unconditional  exchange of prisoners of war and the repatriation of refugees.    Bosnia's ambassador to Bern, Muhamad Filipovic, told AFP  that  the bilateral talks offered "a very good chance to improve  relations and stop the fighting in central Bosnia." UN-led  controls on Bosnia's borders were desirable to prevent Belgrade  from equipping Bosnian Serb forces with extra men and weapons,  he added.    Zagreb's ambassador to the United Nations, Mario Nobilo,  said  border controls would staunch the flow of arms from Serb-held  areas of Bosnia to Krajina, the self-declared Serbian republic  inside Croatia. Nobilo also stressed the need to avoid "further  misunderstandings" over the nature of ZAgreb's support for the  Bosnian Croats.    He added that Bosnian Government and Croatian officials were  also discussing the make-up of the future Bosnia-Herzegovina.  "The Moslems would like to see a more centralised form of  government, with cantons," he said, while the Croatian side  favoured a three-way union also incorportating a Serb mini-state.    Earlier Thursday Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said  the all-party Geneva talks aimed at securing a negotiated  settlement to the Bosnian war had stalled because the Moslems  were refusing to investigate Saturday's bloody mortar attack in  Sarajevo which has been widely blamed on his forces.    "We could not go further until we resolve this," Karadzic  told reporters, referring to establishing responsibility for the  mortar attack that killed 68 and sparked a NATO ultimatum to the  Bosnian Serbs to remove their heavy weapons from Sarajevo by  February 21 or face air strikes.</p>

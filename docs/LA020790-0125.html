			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SILVA REVERSES VOTE; MAYOR ROTATION DIES  </P> <P> Councilman Jim Silva this week reversed an earlier vote, nullifying the  council's plan to rotate members into the mayor's seat.  </P> <P> Silva said he reconsidered his position, and on Monday night voted against the  proposal.  </P> <P> Consequently, the measure failed without debate. Three of the five present  council members favored the proposal, but under the City Charter, four  supporting votes are required to adopt an ordinance. Both of the absent council  members, Jim MacAllister and John Erskine, had previously voted against the  proposal.  </P> <P> The measure, which Mayor Pro Tem Peter M. Green had proposed, would have  eliminated the council's system of electing its mayor and mayor pro tem.  </P> <P> Under the proposed rotational system, the sitting mayor pro tem automatically  would become mayor at the council's first meeting each December; thus, Green  would have become mayor later this year for the first time in his six years on  the council. The council member with the next most consecutive years of council  experience would have succeeded Green as mayor pro tem, moving next in line to  become mayor.  </P> <P> Green said he favored the system because it would have enabled him to plan his  1991 work schedule were he to become mayor. He also said he believes the  current election method breeds "back-room" political maneuvering and bickering  among council members. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

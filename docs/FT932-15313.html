			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Thatcher attacks Hurd on Bosnia: 'Accomplice to massacre' accusation threatens Conservative party unity BARONESS Thatcher last night launched a scathing attack on government policy towards Bosnia, accusing the UK and other western countries of acting like 'an accomplice to a massacre'. The former prime minister also condemned Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, of using 'terrible and disgraceful' phrases to justify not arming Bosnian Moslems. She was 'ashamed' at the European Community's reluctance to intervene. Her outbursts, in a series of television interviews, provoked anger among ministers and fractured the fragile unity within the Conservative party over action against the Bosnian Serbs. Last night, Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, said Baroness Thatcher's comments 'reflect almost worldwide concern about what is happening but they go a whole lot further and propose very much stronger measures than most people think are necessary. But I think something has to be done. The present situation is clearly untenable'. Mr Patrick Cormack, Tory MP for South Staffordshire, said: 'While I don't always agree with Baroness Thatcher I think that on this she is plumb right.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, accused her of 'emotional nonsense' and said arms for Bosnian Moslems 'would be used to prolong the war'. If the west armed one side, Russia might decide to help the Serbs, he said. Most Tory MPs have so far been reluctant to see British troops further involved in the conflict - and Mr John Major has won a consensus within the party for a policy based on providing humanitarian aid and urging a negotiated peace settlement. Conservative MPs are used to intemperate attacks on Mr Major by his predecessor, particularly over Maastricht. But Baroness Thatcher's emotional calls last night could rally Conservative MPs who have been horrified at recent atrocities - including Monday's killing of at least 56 people in a Serb artillery attack on the east Bosnian town of Srebrenica. Tensions could erupt when the Commons returns today. Labour is pressing for a statement on Bosnia. Speaking on BBC television, Baroness Thatcher said: 'We can't go on with this policy - namely feeding people but leaving them to be massacred.' United Nations resolutions should be overturned, she said, so the Bosnian Moslems could arm themselves: 'Everyone has a right to self-defence - that is far older than the UN's charter.' Mr Hurd, who was last night travelling to Japan, has previously said such a policy would lead to 'level killing fields'. But Baroness Thatcher responded: 'I thought it was a terrible and disgraceful phrase. There is a killing field now where the innocent haven't the requisite arms properly to defend themselves.' A policy of arming Bosnian Moslems should be backed by air cover and possibly ground attacks, she said. An alternative was to issue an ultimatum backed by the threat of greater military intervention to the Serbs to accept the peace plan drawn up by UN negotiators Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance.

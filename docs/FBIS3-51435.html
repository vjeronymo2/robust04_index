They also noted that the coordination of macroeconomic  policies is an essential condition for the sucess of the  integration process.    They pointed out that the fulfillment of the timetable  established in Las Lenas [Argentina], as well as the  instrumentation of the decision of the Common Market Council on  the common external tariff, measures, and instruments for  structuring Mercosur, are a firm commitment of the four  countries. They also agreed that the progress on the different  priority areas must be made symmetrically and simultaneously.    Recognizing that the main challenge is to promote the  prosperity of their people and to reach the highest standard of  living, the presidents expressed their special satisfaction in  face of the substantial trade increase within Mercosur which  went from $3.6 billion in 1990 -- before the Asuncion Treaty was  signed -- to more than $8 billion in 1993.    This accelerated trade growth is the result, among other  reasons, of the fulfillment of the commercial liberation program  which currently has a tariff preference of 82 percent between  the states.    They also expressed their satisfaction over the technical  progress reached on the common external tariff, and asserted  their determination to conclude the definition of the common  external tariff on 30 June 1994 as the basic instrument for  structuring the customs union which is a significant stage for  establishing the common market.    They also emphasized the importance of the special meeting  to  be held this year to establish the institutional structure of  Mercosur. The meeting will serve to create the permanent  institutions that will start operating on 1 January 1995. They  also recognized the importance of the current and future works  of infrastructure which are the basis of physical integration  that also includes the water way.    In the joint communique the four presidents also recognized  the importance of strengthening the Latin American Integration  Association. They pointed out that it is essential to maintain  the integrity of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty which made important  projects possible.    They also expressed their safisfaction over the presence of  Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and reiterated  their pleasure at the Bolivian Government's willingness to  strengthen its links with Mercosur. They also noted the  institutional cooperation provided by the EC with Mercosur as  well as the cooperation given by the Inter-American Development  Bank.</p>

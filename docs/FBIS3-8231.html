			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview by F.B. with Mustafa Ceric, "spiritual leader of </F> the Bosnian Muslims," in Sarajevo; date not given: "You Have  Handed Us Over to the Russians"]    [Text] Mustafa Ceric, 42 years old, is venerated in  Sarajevo with the title "Leader of the Wise Men." He is the  highest religious authority in Bosnia. The Muslim faithful turn  to him like Catholics to the pope. He received us at the  "Careva Djamija," the city's oldest mosque, built on the banks  of the Milijecka by Isak Isakovic in 1461, one year before the  Turks occupied Sarajevo.    [F.B.] NATO has not bombed the hills around Sarajevo. The  Serbs are controlled by the UN forces. How do Muslims feel  about this result of the ultimatum?    [Ceric] I do not know what NATO has done for us in 22  months.  I do know, however, that we now have a double occupation.  First, there was only the Serbian occupation. Now there is  also the occupation by the Russians, who came solely to legalize  what the Serbs have accomplished. In fact, they have  consolidated the partition of the city. Therefore, thanks to  the United Nations and NATO our position has worsened. Now we  are slaves forced to live in a ghetto. The reason for this lies  in the fact that as far as the international community is  concerned the true problem does not lie with the Serbs, but with  the Muslims.    [F.B.] That is a harsh opinion, one which combines pessimism  with ill feeling.    [Ceric] We have survived so far, and we will survive in the  future. However, Europe and the world have bound our hands, and  now they are obliged to untie them. They have stopped  blackmailing us with humanitarian aid and pushing us to  surrender. We will not commit suicide. Therefore, I am neither  pessimistic nor optimistic. I am realistic and I know that if we  had been animals instead of human beings, the world would have  taken a greater interest in our cause.    [F.B.] Just a few days ago, French President Mitterrand  forcefully defended you.    [Ceric] Mitterrand should stop talking about human rights:  Rather, give us arms to survive. We know the Serbs well and we  know how they have to be treated.    [F.B.] Many people in the West fear an Islamic state.    [Ceric] Why? We have no fear of Christianity. We Bosnians  are used to living in a pluralistic and diverse society.  Believe me when I say that I truly wish the Bosnians were  fundamentalists so that we could find the strength and cohesion  needed to fight.    [F.B.] What kind of model are you thinking of for the  Bosnian  state?    [Ceric] Nothing innovative. The models are those which are  already known. They are all subject to international laws. For  example, laws cannot be passed to institutionalize ethnic  cleansing. We live according to the laws of the international  community. That is not true of the Serbs. They have overturned  the principles of morals. So the right question to ask is this:  Is it possible not to be multicultural? Or not to live in an  international context? That is the question which Europe must  answer.    [F.B.] But?    [Ceric] But Europe is putting the aggressors and those who  have been attacked on the same level. However, if the world is  unable to answer this question about the need to be  multicultural, it will be the Serbs who bring their morals to  the streets of Paris, Berlin, and London. And the question will  arise as to whether the idea of a united, multinational, and  multicultural Europe has not died right here in Sarajevo.    [F.B.] Many Muslims have fled Sarajevo. Will they return?    [Ceric] Anyone who has fled will return. War is not made up  of soldiers alone. Often, the side effects are the most  dramatic. Look at the UN soldiers who are here: They have no  feeling for this land, they do not identify with the people,  they do not see themselves in the culture. They are merely  occupation troops. As for the humanitarian organizations, there  is a legitimate suspicion that they want the war to continue.  Indeed, for them the war has become the only reason for their  existence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Hajric from Geneva] </F>   [Text] Despite the great efforts by cochairmen Owen and  Stoltenberg to make some progress, this evening's plenary  session has failed. The reason is perfectly clear: After  months and months of excuses and stalling for time, of yielding  to aggression and genocide, the peace process has faced the very  reason for its existence -- the aspiration of the creator of  Greater Serbia for the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There  can be no progress in reaching a peace agreement until Serbian  President Milosevic orders the withdrawal from the minimum of  territory that used to be the majority Muslim regions.  Karadzic, leader of the Serb extremists, reiterated again this  evening that he would not give those territories back, while  Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia- Herzegovina  Presidency, stressed that there could be no peace without that.    Our delegation came under great pressure to sign a very  vague  peace plan. In fact, this is a trick by which the sanctions  against the rump Yugoslavia would be lifted if an agreement was  signed that would not guarantee us what we must have. The  Bosnian state delegation, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said,  cannot separate the organization of the state from the  territory, since we are forced to speak of the minimum. In  other words, the two create a whole, which we will not and  cannot give up.    Even though there were meaningless calls for signing not  only  a cease-fire but a lasting peace as well, Owen himself rejected  that, saying that we had had hundreds of cease-fire agreements  and that there was no need to waste time on them any more until  something is done on the maps. Owen had a proposal in which he  presented 15 disputed towns. These are: Bosanska Krupa,  Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Bugojno, Busovaca, Donji Vakuf, Kiseljak,  Kresevo, Novi Travnik, Sanski Most, Ustikolina, Visegrad, Vitez,  and Zvornik. The cochairman's proposal was to reduce that  number as much as possible so as to reduce the number of  disputed issues if the international arbitration commission is  formed, which is supposed to solve each problem on its own. It  was also proposed for acceptance that the Bosnian republic has  to have 33.33 percent of the present territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian republic 17.5 percent but  not at the detriment of the Bosnian republic.    Even though no solution is visible from this position --  although we keep talking about minor concessions on the side of  the Serb extremists -- cochairman Owen demanded that the peace  conference continue until at least another round of bilateral  talks between the Bosnia-Herzegovina state delegation and the  Serbian and the Croatian sides be held. The Bosnian state  delegation is expecting the first meeting with the Serbs.</p>

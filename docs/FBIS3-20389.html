			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias by </F> unidentified correspondents in Athens--recorded]    [Text] [Papoulias] The prime minister received Matthew  Nimetz, the U.S. President's envoy to The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and held a discussion in a  friendly atmosphere. The prime minister explained the Greek  position. President Bill Clinton is greatly interested in a  solution; Nimetz will divide his time between Skopje and Athens  at this time. I believe I cannot say anything more because it  would only be predictions.    The climate is positive. There is U.S. interest and the  personal interest of President Clinton. I hope in the next few  weeks we will have some positive results.    [Correspondent] Did Skopje make any conciliatory moves?    [Papoulias] I do not know if Skopje gave any indications of  being conciliatory. Certainly, though, there are people in  Skopje who believe that a solution is necessary.    [Correspondent] Did Nimetz bring any new proposals?    [Papoulias] Nimetz did not bring any new ideas. He listened  to the views of the Greek Government. We exchanged views on how  we can overcome some obstacles. I believe the next few days  will be more productive and effective because Nimetz intends to  visit Skopje very soon and then return to Athens.    [Correspondent] When will he return?    [Papoulias] I do not know about this, but I have told you  that Nimetz will visit Skopje and Athens in the next few days.    [Correspondent] Did Mr. Nimetz ask that the measures be  unilaterally lifted?    [Papoulias] No, Nimetz certainly discussed the sanctions but  both the prime minister and I explained to him the reasons why  Greece adopted these measures.    [Correspondent] Does the United States view the measures as  political or economic?    [Papoulias] Look, there has been no evaluation on how they  view the measures. The measures are certainly included in the  negotiations package.    [Correspondent] Did he ask for a unilateral lifting of the  measures?    [Papoulias] No.    [Correspondent] Did Mr. Nimetz set the prime minister's  visit  as a deadline for progress?    [Papoulias] He considers that the prime minister's visit is  a  framework within which some progress should be made.    [Correspondent] Are there any ideas on lifting the measures  temporarily?    [Papoulias] No, I have told you that.</p>

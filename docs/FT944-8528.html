			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: An educational challenge Sir, In his article 'The old school lie' (November 10), John Authers's comment, 'Parents place increasing weight on exam results', attracted my attention. As parents who have sacrificed holidays abroad, etc, to finance education, our aim has been to prepare our children for life rather than just university entrance. My wife and I want our children to be successful with their relationships with others as well as contributing with their professional expertise. As an employer I do not look for the candidate with the highest academic achievement, I seek the candidate who will achieve the results I need. This often requires a range of qualities, particularly those dealing with people successfully - customers, suppliers, subordinates, peers and others. May I challenge the FT to produce surveys showing the value of schools in producing contributors to our community while at the same time leading rewarding and happy lives.

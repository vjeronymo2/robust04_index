On behalf of the provincial  people's government, here I deliver the government work report  to the congress; please deliberate it. At the same time, all  provincial CPPCC members are invited to air their opinions.    In 1993, under the guidance of the 14th party congress  spirit, people of all nationalities in the province earnestly  implemented the spirit of Eighth Qinghai Provincial Party  Congress and the first session of the Eighth Provincial People's  Congress, emancipated minds, braced up, seized the opportunity,  and blazed new trail to make progress. Consequently, new  accomplishments were scored in the national economy and social  undertakings in national construction, with new progress made in  reform and opening up; macroeconomic regulation and control were  augmented; the pace of exploitation of resources was  accelerated; and production, construction, and circulation  developed in a comprehensive way. The entire economy began to  be included on the track of sustained, rapid, healthy  development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816  6643 0256 1660 4099 1455].

The province's output in grain and edible oil topped records.  In the wake of overcoming serious flood, recovery in production  of animal husbandry was far better than expected.

Dealing with the main tasks for 1994, Governor Tian  Chengping  said that governments at all levels must have command of a  guiding concept, namely, adhering to promoting development with  reform, continuously readjusting and optimizing structures,  exerting efforts to realize and maintain a considerably high  level of input, and persisting in the common development of  diversified economic factors. Under this prerequisite, we  should grasp the following work in a down-to-earth way:    First, with building the socialist market economic structure  as the goal, we must meticulously organize implementation of  reform tasks.    Second, we must do substantial work in real earnest to  promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development [chi  xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099  1455].    Third, we must earnestly implement the principle of  reinvigorating enterprises and institutions with science and  education to steadily develop social undertakings.    Fourth, we must adhere to the principle of doing two types  of  work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both;  prolonging and developing the political situation of social  stability and nationality solidarity.    And fifth, we must strengthen building of clean government  and make efforts to improve work style of government  organizations.    In conclusion, Governor Tian Zhenping said: Delegates, the  tasks of government work in 1994 are very heavy; however, we are  full of confidence. Under the leadership of the Central  Committee, the State Council, and the provincial party  committee, we shall unite people of all nationalities across the  province to work hard in concerted efforts to do a good job of  continuously pushing forward the province's reform, opening up,  and economic construction to score still greater victory.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Mortgage repayments fall to lowest level for 15 years The cost of monthly mortgage repayments in relation to average earnings has fallen to the lowest level for 15 years following yesterday's interest rate cuts, reports Andrew Taylor. Nationwide, Britain's second largest building society, reduced its mortgage rate by 0.25 percentage points to 7.74 per cent. Mortgage rates were last this low in 1968. Most other societies are expected to make cuts, but are waiting until after next week's Budget. As a result, monthly mortgage repayments as a proportion of first time buyers' average gross monthly income are expected to fall to below 13 per cent for the first time since 1978 - when repayments accounted for less than 12 per cent of average earnings. In 1990, first time buyers were spending more than a quarter of their monthly income on mortgage repayments, according to figures compiled by the Council for Mortgage Lenders and the Environment Department. The figures take account of house prices, which have fallen sharply in recent years, as well as salaries, interest rates and mortgage tax relief. In spite of the fall in prices and interest rates, the housing market remains at a low ebb. Fear of unemployment and concern about the economy are continuing to inhibit potential buyers and depressing prices, say mortgage lenders, house builders and estate agents. House sales this year are likely to have risen by about only 5 per cent from last year's low of 1.14m, according to conveyancing figures published by the Inland Revenue. This compares with about 1.5m transactions in an average year and a peak of more than 2m sales in 1988. Average house prices, which have fallen by up to 30 per cent in East Anglia and southern England since the late 1980s, will have recovered by only about 2 per cent this year, according to a forecast by Halifax, Britain's biggest building society. A sharp fall in inflation, which previously reduced the real cost of mortgages, has also eroded the long-term financial advantages of home ownership. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said: 'The initial cost of monthly mortgage repayments may be the cheapest for more than a decade but people no longer have the benefit of high inflation which rapidly reduced the real cost of mortgage payments.' In 1978 an average house cost Pounds 16,297, against more than Pounds 63,000 in the first quarter of this year; the average annual salary was Pounds 4,749 against more than Pounds 18,000; the mortgage rate was 9.55 per cent and the retail price index rose 8.2 per cent.

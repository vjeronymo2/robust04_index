			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps Marley advance 75% to Pounds 25m A REDUCTION in overhead costs helped Marley, the building products manufacturer, report a 75 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 25m, for the year to end-December. Operating profits increased to Pounds 37.2m (Pounds 35.2m) on turnover down 10 per cent from Pounds 639m to Pounds 574m. Mr George Russell, chairman, said a 'worldwide blast' against a level of overheads that could not be sustained brought savings of about Pounds 30m. As part of the cost cutting exercise the group yesterday announced the merger of five UK companies - Marley Roof Tiles, Marley Brick, Marley Paving, Marley Transport and Thermolite - into one new group entitled Marley Building Materials. Provisions totalling Pounds 2m in respect of the restructuring, charged as an exceptional item, were offset by surplus provisions and the sale of a collection of paintings. Extraordinary charges of Pounds 5.5m reflected costs and losses associated with the closure and sale of the North American roofing operations. Plumbing, mouldings and flooring increased operating profits to Pounds 27m (Pounds 19.3m) boosted by strong performances in Germany. Marley benefited from the growth of DIY stores in eastern Germany. From nil at independence there were now 200 DIY stores, a number which could double by the end of the year. Roofing increased profits to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 7.5m) in spite of a fall in sales from Pounds 196m to Pounds 158m, benefiting from the group's cost cutting exercise. Across the company the workforce was reduced by 1,500 to a total of just under 10,000. Bricks, blocks and pavers were worst affected by the recession, reporting a Pounds 5m loss compared to a Pounds 1.5m profit. Automotive components suffered a fall in profits to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.8m), while property was down at Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 5.1m). The group also announced the sale of a group of buildings for Pounds 6m. Net borrowings were reduced by Pounds 18m to Pounds 91.7m, giving gearing of 41.3 per cent. Mr Russell said the group was well placed to make acquisitions to fit into the growing areas of the business. Earnings per share rose to 6p (3.5p). A final dividend of 4.25p gives an unchanged total of 6.35p. COMMENT If Marley is proving a recovery stock with turnover down it is not surprising that analysts are predicting further earnings growth as sales increase. Although last year's figures included an exceptional Pounds 7.7m relating to redundancies and business rationalisation, the profit increase was still impressive in the midst of a recession. Few at the centre were untouched by the cost-cutting programme; the central personnel department was axed and more than half of the 100 employees working at head office lost their jobs. The dividend is barely covered. But it could easily have been if the group chose to be less conservative about its accounting policies and take a Pounds 3.5m currency gain below the line instead of through reserves. With 1992 pre-tax profit forecasts of about Pounds 32m, giving earnings per share of 7.6p, the shares are trading on a prospective multiple of 16, indicating that the recovery is already in the price.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan agrees to  the concept at the heart of the (?Russian) peace plan and CSCE  program for a settlement to the Karabakh conflict, which  envisages discussion of Nagorno Karabakh's status after a  cease-fire, lifting of the communications blockade and  withdrawal by forces from occupied territory, the acting press  secretary for the Armenian president, Zurabyan, told a briefing  in Yerevan.    He said that Azerbaijan also agrees to this approach, but at  the same time is not recognizing Nagorno Karabakh as an equal  party in the negotiations and thus not accepting the political  [word indistinct]. Zurabyan stressed that Armenia believes that  the CIS can considerably influence a Karabakh settlement. The  best guarantee of peace in Karabakh will be troops and observers  to supervise demarcation, who should be deployed in the conflict  zone.</p>

V. Stevko, vice president of the Confederation of  Trade Unions, said that the KOVO trade union does not feel bound  by the agreement because its council placed it under a different  obligation. "Unfortunately, at the time of negotiations, when  the terms [of the agreement] had already been agreed upon, it is  very difficult to speak about new talks," Stevko said,  commenting on the decision of the KOVO Council.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Indonesia accused of rights abuses A human rights group yesterday accused Indonesia of human rights abuses including torture and the arbitrary use of power, in a wide-ranging report, Reuter reports from Jakarta. The 83-page report, 'The Limits of Openness', focused mainly on Indonesia's ban on three magazines in June, the troubled territory of East Timor, worker rights and a crackdown on members of a Christian church in Sumatra. 'All these cases involve major violations of internationally recognised human rights,' the report by Human Rights Watch/Asia, formerly Asia Watch, said. 'But more to the point, these cases illustrate the pervasiveness of the harassment that ordinary Indonesians suffer on a daily basis. Torture is used routinely to punish and intimidate as well as obtain information. 'If there is a constant in Indonesian politics today, it is the arbitrariness inherent in periods of tolerance or crackdown.' The detailed report comes two months before Indonesia hosts an informal summit of the 17-member Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) group. It called for a public statement explicitly outlawing torture at all times, while welcoming Jakarta's move to invite UN officials to visit East Timor and some reforms on worker rights.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Financial Problems in the Spotlight"] </F>   [Text] On 28 April Russian Federation First Deputy Minister  of Defense Andrey Kokoshin spoke at a training conference of  executive of the financial and economic services of the RF Armed  Forces.    Elaborating on the positions stated by General of the Army  Pavel Grachev, the defense minister, in a speech the day before,  Andrey Kokoshin noted that today the role of budget and  financing organizations and of economic services of the armed  forces has risen noticeably.    A maximally careful attitude toward every ruble provided by  the state at the expense of the Russian taxpayer is important as  never before. Vigorous activity by specialists on financial and  economic problems in regard to setting the prices of products  and services used by the armed forces has enormous significance  today. A constant effort is required to optimize the structure  of expenditures on maintaining the armed forces, on purchases of  military equipment, and on scientific research and experimental  design work. There are many examples here of such successful  work, as was discussed during the conference, Andrey Kokoshin  said.    In the opinion of the first deputy defense minister, far  from  everything possible has been done so far in the armed forces and  in the Ministry of Defense. The latest information processing  equipment and methods are being introduced too slowly. The  forces of inertia still prevail in decisions of commanders of  all ranks and executives of financial bodies of the Ministry of  Defense, and many are slow in adapting to the new conditions.    A commission to effectively develop proposals for  determining  the priority directions of financial support to the vital  activities of the armed forces, created by an order of the  Ministry of Defense, is operating in the Ministry of Defense  under the chairmanship of Andrey Kokoshin. The membership of  this commission includes the chief of General Staff, deputy  defense ministers, and the chiefs of a number of main  directorates, including Colonel-General Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief  of the Main Directorate of Military Budget and Financing.    Andrey Kokoshin illuminated the general status of the  Russian  economy. In his speech he noted the keen interest the army has  in stabilization of the country's economy and its sociopolitical  situation. Successful progress in military reform is, in the  words of the first deputy minister, problematic in the absence  of a stable economy, and of adequate solutions to the problems  of financing the armed forces and enterprises filling defense  orders. A very complex situation is developing here today,  carrying the danger of a social explosion in a number of cases.    Andrey Kokoshin singled out the nonpayment problem as one of  the most acute and immediate of the Russian economy. Unless it  is solved, the objective of halting the decline in industry and  the decrease in the income side of the federal budget, in which  the armed forces are keenly interested, cannot be reached. The  problem of nonpayment cannot be solved by a single thrust:  Planned, purposeful work is required. At the same time measures  of an emergency nature are also needed. One of them, upon which  the first deputy defense minister insists, is immediate  repayment of the state's debts pertaining to military and  civilian products manufactured on the basis of state orders, and  to services based on state orders. Kokoshin estimates the amount  of such a one-time injection through state clients at 5-6  trillion rubles.    Tight control over passage of budget resources along the  entire chain is also necessary today; financial bodies of the  Ministry of Defense have an important role to play in this  control.</p>

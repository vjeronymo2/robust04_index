			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The foreign minister dismissed a report about the  UNHCR protesting to Thailand about the repatriation of Cambodian  refugees to the zone controlled by the Khmer Rouge. Squadron  Leader Prasong Sunsiri said the note sent by the UNHCR thanked  Thailand for temporarily granting the refugees shelter during  fighting in Cambodia.    [Begin recording] [Prasong, in progress] ... I cannot figure  out. When he was here, Prince Sirivut did not say a thing to me  concerning that. I explained to him our policy -- we have no  centers for the refugees; we allow them here for a short period  of time and they must return when there is calm. The UNHCR  should consult with the Cambodian Government and arrange things  together. There is a large area in Cambodia. If they plan an  offensive, they should prepare a site to which their people  could be moved. [End recording]    Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said that the action  taken by Thailand was not an abuse nor did it contradict  international norms. Thailand provided shelter for refugees who  crossed into the country and sent them back when the situation  improved. Those people were sent back on a voluntary basis.    The spokesman of the Prime Minister's Office added that the  foreign minister had reported to the cabinet about the  repatriation of refugees and said it was carried out under  government policy. The refugees were sent to a safe area on a  voluntary basis. He also noted that he already made everything  clear to the Cambodian foreign minister. As for a report about  the United Nations expressing concern about the issue, he said  he had made a clarification to the United Nations and offered to  provide facilities to it if it wishes to be here to take care of  the refugees.    Commenting on this subject, Defense Minister General Wichit  Sukmak said that Thailand generally is praised for its help for  the distressed. Thailand upholds its commitment to the UN  principles. He said the United Nations should take the refugees  with it if it wants to protest against Thailand.</p>

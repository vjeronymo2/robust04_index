			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Molins makes Pounds 28m buy and Pounds 12.2m placing Molins, the tobacco and packaging machinery group, is acquiring a Nottingham-based maker of specialist packaging machinery for a maximum Pounds 28m and is placing 2.46m shares at 498p a share to help pay for it. Sandiacre is being acquired for an initial Pounds 27m plus a profit-related Pounds 1m. The initial consideration is being met by the issue of 521,236 new shares and Pounds 12.2m in cash plus the Pounds 12.2m proceeds of the placing. Yesterday the shares closed at 515p, down 3p. Sandiacre, with net assets of Pounds 3.5m, makes machinery which forms bags from rolls of plastic material, fills them, and seals them. Typical goods packaged using the machinery are coffee, sugar, powder detergent, and crisps and snacks. Molins has long sought an acquisition outside cigarette making, which accounts for most of its profits. 'We have been very picky,' said Mr Peter Greenwood, managing director. 'We were looking for a specialist machinery maker with world potential.' He believes Sandiacre, which made operating profits of Pounds 3.8m on sales of Pounds 9.7m in the year to the end of July, is 'almost an ideal fit' with Molins' strategy of concentrating on machinery that handles delicate materials at high speed. Sandiacre would benefit from Molins' engineering experience, but more importantly Molins' worldwide sales network would take it into new markets. 'We expect to provide service and support in markets where Sandiacre has barely scratched the surface,' said Mr Greenwood. Half of Sandiacre's sales are in the UK, with most of the rest going to Europe. Molins expects to sell the machinery in the US, South America and south-east Asia. The company is at present 100 per cent owned by the founding Davison family and their interests. Mr Clive Davison will stay on as managing director.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Observer: Jurassic jitters To listen to France's culture minister, Jacques Toubon, you would think that Stephen Spielberg's 'velociraptors' were about to step off French screens and devour their audiences. At last weekend's Deauville festival of American films, Toubon cited Jurassic Park - released in France next month - as the latest example of Hollywood's cultural invasion of his country. Such is the dominance of US film-makers and distributors that one in every five French cinemas will be showing it, he complained; the dinosaur spectacular 'is very impressive, but not at all moving nor human, because of its special effects, and it threatens the French identity'. But, despite the fears of Toubon, many French seem to be happy to let their identity be threatened. A poll last month for the Nouvelle Economiste magazine showed that 80-83 per cent of those in the prime cinema-going age group of 18-34 considered American productions as good or better than French films.</p>

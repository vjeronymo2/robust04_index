			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Butte Mining plans to rebuild through litigation DAMAGES CLAIMED by Butte Mining from former directors, advisers and investors now total about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 637m) reported Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman. This compares with the company's market value of about Pounds 3.4m. Mr Lloyd-Jacob said litigation in Montana would be 'vigorously pursued and, in the opinion of the board, our prospects for significant recovery are good.' However, he said the cases are not expected to come to trial for some time. The UK Serious Fraud Office is also investigating the matters which form the subject of the company's US lawsuit with a view to possible criminal charges, he pointed out. Butte's audited accounts for the year to June 30 will show write-offs, write-downs and losses attributable to shareholders totalling Pounds 10.5m, which sharply reduce but do not eliminate the company's net worth. 'Management intends to rebuild net worth in the next few years, primarily by litigation,' said Mr Lloyd-Jacob. Net assets are less than half of the called-up share capital and an extraordinary meeting will be called to consider how to deal with this. 'Directors believe that the course of action already commenced and, in particular, the US litigation give the best opportunity for the company to recover its losses,' he added. Butte incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 336,000 (Pounds 52,000 profit) for the half year to December 31 on turnover down from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 80,000. The loss was financed in part by asset sales.</p>

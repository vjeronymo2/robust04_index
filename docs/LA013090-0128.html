			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR FAMILY PLANNING BILL URGED  </P> <P> County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder urged support of a state bill Monday that  would restore most of a recent, $24-million cut in state assistance to family  planning centers.  </P> <P> Wieder told a crowd of about 100 people at Leisure World that "you are going to  be missionaries" to help pass AB 99, an effort to restore $20 million to the  family planning budget.  </P> <P> "You are going to be the squeaky wheel that gets the attention of legislators."  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed budget unveiled Jan. 10 would slice more than  $1 billion in services to the poor. In Orange County, the family planning  budget dropped from $500,000 to about $86,000 with the cuts, Wieder said.  </P> <P> "Nobody is looking at what the loss incurred by these cuts will be in the long  run," she said, adding that the budget reductions "could create $190 million in  additional costs."  </P> <P> Assembly Bill 99 was written by 31st District Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan  (D-Fresno).  </P></p>

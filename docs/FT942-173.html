			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / McDonald's accused of trying to silence critics The McDonald's fast-food chain was yesterday accused of using the libel laws to censor and silence its critics. Mr Dave Morris and Ms Helen Steel, who have accused McDonald's of poisoning its customers, exploiting third-world countries and employing cheap labour, told the High Court in London that the world's biggest food-service organisation threw writs at anyone who dared criticise it - no matter how small. McDonald's has sued Mr Morris and Ms Steel for libel over a 'malicious' leaflet. The company's QC, Mr Richard Rampton, has told the court it was 'completely false in every material respect'. Mr Morris and Ms Steel, members of the London Greenpeace group - which has no connection with Greenpeace International - claim their allegations are justified. The unemployed campaigners are conducting their own defence. They told Mr Justice Bell yesterday it was an 'outrage' that the company was prepared to go to such lengths. Mr Rampton has said it was completely untrue that McDonald's was involved in 'economic imperialism' or in 'wrecking the planet' by destroying rainforests to provide packaging materials and create grazing for beef cattle. The company had not seduced children into eating poisonous food and was not responsible for the torture and barbaric deaths of animals to provide meat. Nor had it paid low wages, got rid of pro-union workers, or exploited disadvantaged groups. Ms Steel said the company, in refusing to disclose documents, was engaged in a 'massive cover-up'. McDonald's had taken so long to bring the action because, in the wake of the leaflet, it took steps to 'polish up' its image. Neither she nor Mr Morris was the author or printer of the leaflet. 'But we do believe it is true, and that we have absolutely nothing to apologise for, so we have no choice but to fight this action.' The company's claim that it did not to use beef from rainforest countries was an 'out-and-out lie', she said. McDonald's was suing over the assertion that it used only a tiny percentage of recycled paper in its packaging, and yet in the US in 1989 - at the time of the alleged libel - its packaging contained just 7 per cent recycled paper. The company's own documents supported the assertion that its food was high in fat, sugar and salt, which was linked by health education bodies with cancer, Ms Steel said. The hearing was adjourned until today.</p>

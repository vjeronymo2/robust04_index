			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Bosnian refugees to be offered shelter in west: Bad weather interrupts resumed Sarajevo airlift THE FIRST group of Moslems released from Serb-held detention camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina will be offered sanctuary in the west, mostly in Scandinavia, the United Nations said in the Croatian capital Zagreb yesterday. In Sarajevo, the resumed aid airlift to the besieged city was interrupted by bad weather. Four US and Canadian aircraft carrying food and radar equipment needed to keep the airport functioning during winter landed yesterday in the city before poor weather forced the suspension of the operation. Five other scheduled flights were cancelled. Mr Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Zagreb, said western countries had pledged to provide sanctuary for most of the 1,600 mainly Moslem men released on Thursday from the Trnopolje camp in northern Bosnia. These, the most recent arrivals in neighbouring Croatia, which has some 700,000 refugees already, have been given shelter in abandoned army barracks in Karlovac, southwest of Zagreb. Croatian authorities have allowed the released detainees to remain in Karlovac for two weeks. Relief organisations at the run-down barracks worry however about visits by Croatian and Bosnian army officers who, despite a ban, are trying to recruit fighters. Meanwhile, stories of cruelty by Serb forces against Moslems in Bosnia continued to emerge. One man, allowed to speak by international relief organisations on condition his identity was not revealed, yesterday corroborated earlier reports of how Serb forces in August shot some 200 Moslem detainees in a ravine outside Travnik in southern Bosnia. He explained how he had survived by lying for several hours under a dead body. Other men considered themselves fortunate. Serb forces had released their wives and children in July. Some were in Zagreb. But no one believed Moslems would ever again be able to live with Serbs. They told how neighbours had turned against neighbours. Serb forces control about two-thirds of Bosnian territory. Some 2m people have been displaced by the six-month war and at least 8,000 are believed to be held in detention camps throughout the republic. 'They burnt down our houses. We were ordered to turn over all our possessions. Money, watches, cars, whatever they could get,' said one man, who, like many of the Moslem detainees, was from Kozarac. 'When we left the camp and drove through Kozarac, I did not recognise it,' he said. 'The Serb forces moved the sign post to pretend it was another place. It is like Vukovar (the devastated city in eastern Croatia which fell to Serb forces last autumn).' The UN Protection Force Headquarters in Zagreb yesterday protested to the Croatian government and Ministry of Defence after two UN helicopters came under fire while approaching Zagreb on Friday. The helicopters, on a medical evacuation mission, landed safely at Zagreb airport. The incident followed a similar attack last Monday.</p>

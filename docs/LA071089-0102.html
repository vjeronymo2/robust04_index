			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CUOMO 'OPEN' TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT  </P> <P> New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, reopening a door that he closed last year, said  today that as a public servant he is "obliged to be open to the possibility" of  running for President.  </P> <P> "Of course, you have to be open," said Cuomo in an appearance before the New  York State Broadcasters Assn.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the New York Democrat said all such talk about his political  future is speculative. Cuomo was widely expected to run for President in 1988  but decided against it.  </P> <P> Cuomo has said that he expects to run for reelection as governor next year. In  his speech today, he reiterated that he does not believe that a person can run  for President while serving as governor. Cuomo also said, as he did in 1987,  that the Democratic Party will be able to find excellent candidates for the  presidency in 1992 without turning to him.  </P></p>

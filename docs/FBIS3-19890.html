			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ter Beek Calls For Close </F> Cooperation Between Armed Forces"]    [Text] Defense Minister Ter Beek has called for closer  cooperation between the Netherlands Army, Navy and Air Force.  The PvdA [Labor Party] spokesman also emerged as an advocate of  the extension of military cooperation with Germany to all three  armed forces.    Closer cooperation with other European armed forces is also  called before, because the Netherlands must become more  "continental" on the long road to some form of European defense.  Ter Beek emphasized all this on Monday evening [21 March] in a  speech given to the Atlantic Council in The Hague. Entitled  "Past Analysis and Future Outlook," his speech provided a rough  outline of defense policy in the near future.    According to Ter Beek, closer operational and logistic ties  between the three armed forces are in the interests not merely  of efficiency, but also of peace operations, which are demanding  an increasing amount of cooperation. These advantages are more  important than "the maintenance of independence and the specific  culture of each of the armed forces."    Minister Ter Beek is of the opinion that the latest report  by  the Advisory Council on Peace and Security (AVV), entitled  "Germany as a Partner," contains "valuable suggestions" with a  view to extending Netherlands-German cooperation. The First  Army Corps is already merging into a German-Netherlands Army  Corps, confirmed the minister.    The AVV believes that the military links with neighbors in  the East must be extended to the air force and navy. In the  first instance this must involve far-reaching integration of  both countries' naval and air forces and submarine services.  Foreign Minister Kooijmans recently said he was less  enthusiastic about selective links with the Germans in the area  of the common foreign and security policy.    Ter Beek's speech before the Atlantic Council was, above  all,  a call for the continuation of the security policy he launched  back in 1990, a policy of internationalization and  Europeanization. "The choices we made were the right ones," he  said.    Completion of the restructuring and rationalization program  for the Armed Forces, from 130,000 to 70,000 men, is the central  objective. "This requires that it is all quiet on the financial  front," said the minister. He reiterated that with a 20-percent  reduction in the defense budget since 1989, "the peace dividend  has been paid out." In this, Ter Beek has the support of a  majority in the Chamber, but his own party, the PvdA, wants to  see a further 800 million guilders saved on defense during the  following cabinet period.    The Netherlands will continue to participate in  international  peace operations, although there can be no question of it doing  so automatically. Like Kooijmans, Ter Beek is not at all in  favor of establishing criteria for deciding whether the  Netherlands will or will not take part in peace operations.  "There is no yardstick for doing so," claims the defense  minister. "Strict criteria all too quickly turn into a  straitjacket. Whether the Netherlands can and wants to  participate will be decided on a case-by-case basis. The fear  of some kind of `limitless interventionism' is unfounded," he  continued.    Yesterday evening it was conspicuous that Ter Beek, contrary  to current pessimism, appeared optimistic about international  strategic developments. Although the situation in Europe is  unstable, there are opportunities and bright spots: With the  exception of Yugoslavia, the transformation process in Central  and East Europe is running without too much violence; the shadow  of a major military threat hanging over West Europe is a thing  of the past; and reports on a swift death for NATO have proven  to be premature.    According to Ter Beek, the Cold War now belongs  "definitively  to the past," even if the reformers lose out to the nationalists  in the long run. If Russia becomes a military threat to its  neighbors, "then the countries of Central Europe can be admitted  to NATO in the short term."</p>

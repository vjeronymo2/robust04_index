			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Publication better than legislation on debts Sir, The debate continues as to whether commercial overdue accounts should be subject to statutory interest. Nothing has altered our belief that, if such legislation were imposed, it would be a bureaucratic nightmare to administer and could be viewed by many debtors as an invitation to take more credit from their suppliers rather than approach their banks. We firmly believe that the simple alternative suggestion would be sufficient: that all companies be required to publish in their statutory audited accounts the amount owed to creditors beyond (say) 60 days overdue. Thus, at a glance, all potential suppliers could quickly judge if they would be likely to be paid promptly. The larger the corporation, the more frequently are the accounts published so the situation would be well regulated. The really bad payers would soon gain the notoriety they deserve. There is no doubt that if more capital were released into circulation rather than tied up in overdue accounts it would benefit the British economy enormously.

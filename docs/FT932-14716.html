			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Palestinians to seek peace talks postponement PALESTINIANS said yesterday that they would seek a delay in the resumption of Middle East peace talks scheduled to open in Washington on Tuesday. The proposal, in protest at Israel's deportation of 415 Palestinians, was put to a meeting of the four Arab delegations to the peace talks who gathered in Damascus yesterday for a two-day meeting aimed at reaching a joint response to the US-Russian invitation. Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all expressed their desire to return to the negotiating table, but are reluctant to resume bilateral talks with Israel in the absence of the Palestinians. Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, who heads one of three PLO factions directing the Palestinian negotiators, said in Damascus: 'We did not say we are leaving the peace process. We are not quitting. All we are saying is let us postpone for a short period of time - we insist a short period of time - in order to reach a compromise.' He added that Israel's recent closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which had caused serious hardship by stopping 100,000 Palestinians crossing to work in Israel, had added a further obstacle. 'We have not received any clear and concrete answers,' Mr Abed-Rabbo said. 'There are various promises and ambiguous suggestions which do not convince us or convince Palestinian public opinion.' In the occupied West Bank, two Arabs died and seven Israeli soldiers were wounded yesterday when a bomb exploded in a roadside cafe. The attack appeared to be timed to increase tension in the run-up to the peace talks. Security forces said that an Arab had driven a truck at the cafe and had died when it exploded, causing serious damage and setting fire to vehicles parked nearby. The Palestinians whose expulsion from the West Bank and Gaza in December provoked the crisis in the peace process, launched their own protest yesterday by marching from their makeshift camp in south Lebanon towards Israeli military positions. Israeli troops responded with artillery and tank fire and the march was called off several hundred metres short of the positions after a shell injured one of the marchers. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, said in Washington after two days of talks with US officials that it was not possible at this stage to recommend a resumption of the negotiations. The Palestinians have been pressing Israel to accelerate the timetable for allowing the men expelled to Lebanon to return home. They also want a commitment from Israel that it will not again carry out mass expulsions. President Bill Clinton has promised that the US will become more closely involved in the peace talks and together with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, has expressed hope that substantial progress can be made this year. All sides have also agreed that no time limit will be placed on the next session, the ninth since the inaugural meeting in Madrid in October 1991.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Vard package may save US arm VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, yesterday unveiled a debt restructuring package which should secure the survival of its troubled Miami-based Kloster Cruise unit. The package aims to reduce the heavy financial pressure which has been weighing on Kloster for more than a year, by extending its debt maturity profile to about six years from three years. It will also allow Kloster to re-focus on improving earnings from cruise operations. Kloster agreed the deal with a group of qualified institutional investors who are to take up Dollars 300m of senior, secured 10-year notes with a 13 per cent coupon. The notes were secured against mortgages on two of the company's 12-strong cruise ship fleet. Vard's shares closed NKr2 down at NKr25.50 on the Oslo bourse yesterday on news of the highly-priced debt. The company has an option to redeem the notes in whole or in part, on or at the beginning of the sixth year at redemption rates starting at 105 per cent and declining thereafter. The issue, which closes on May 12, was sold by Salomon Brothers and the First Boston Corporation to the limited number of investors, who were warned that Kloster was likely to suffer a loss for 1993. The unit lost Dollars 12.6m in the first quarter, against a loss of Dollars 2.7m last year. With the group's Scandi and Larvik ferry lines suffering losses, the Vard group plunged to a loss of Dollars 18.7m in the first quarter of this year. Vard said yesterday the note and new agreements establishing long-term credit to replace existing short-term facilities would enable the company to meet debt servicing requirements of Dollars 230m in 1993. Total interest-bearing debt is estimated at Dollars 1bn, while annual interest payments are set to rise by an estimated Dollars 10m to Dollars 80m. Another part of the package calls for conversion of the company's French franc debt into dollar debt. Vard said talks were continuing with a group of investors led by a Vard board member, on the disposal of the ferry operations. The company hoped to conclude the talks by the end of the month.</p>

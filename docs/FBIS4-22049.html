			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["p. re." report: "`We Accomplished the Massacre'"] </F>   [Text] Tirana -- Those responsible for the serious  terrorist attack last Sunday morning [10 Apr] in the village of  Peshkepi near the Albanian-Greek border have now become known.  An ultranationalist Greek group, the self-styled "MAVI"  (Northern Epirus Liberation Front), has claimed responsibility  for the victims -- two dead and three wounded -- at the Albanian  military barracks. The motives behind the massacre are explained  in a communique sent last Sunday evening by the previously  entirely unknown MAVI to the Athens newspaper ELEFTEROTHYPIA,  well-known as the leading mouthpiece of Greek nationalist  circles.    The link between the slogans shouted by the members of the  terrorist group and the motives behind this serious incident has  also become entirely clear. According to the ultranationalist  group, the attack was a response to "the criminal indifference  of the Greek state," which, according to them, "has failed to  act properly to prevent the expulsion of Greeks from Albanian  territory, thus helping Tirana in its ultimate objective of  eliminating the Greek element from Albania. Our action was  intended to change the disastrous attitude of the Greek  Government toward Vorioepiros [Northern Epirus]," the communique  concludes.    The news of the serious border incident prompted a wave of  protest from the Albanian authorities and political forces. In  a statement addressed to the international community, an  Albanian Foreign Ministry spokesman held the Greek Government  responsible for the attack: "It is beyond all doubt that the  attack was prepared by special Greek forces." President Berisha  and Prime Minister Meksi also responded with indignation.  Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador in Athens was urgently  recalled to Tirana on Monday for consultations. Kastriot Robo,  first secretary of the Albanian Embassy, confirmed this news,  calling the incident "very serious and unprecedented."    For their part, the Greek authorities have disclaimed all  responsibility for Sunday's attack. Athens spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos called the charges in the Albanian Foreign Ministry's  protest note groundless. "Greece will not accept any  provocation or charge without documentary evidence. Greece is  against any kind of act of violence." Just a week earlier, the  Greek Government had addressed a warning to Tirana, reminding  the Albanian capital of the "inviolable nature" of the rights of  the Greek minority, who are "indissolubly" tied to Greece.    The Greek press has to some extent left Sunday's news in the  shade. Some newspapers, such as the progovernment Athens daily  TA NEA, have even put forward a theory that this was an action  by "the Albanian mafia." Only LAIKO VRIMA, the newspaper of the  Greek minority in Albania, has come out against the attack. A  letter sent urgently by its editorial board to President Sali  Berisha expresses sorrow over the victims of the tragedy.    Greek nationalism and the problem of Northern Epirus have in  the past led to a deterioration in relations between the two  countries, but the incident last Sunday was the most serious  since the fighting on the border in August 1949. Greek  nationalist groups have for a long time been agitating for the  union of "Vorioepiros" with Greece. Greek political figures,  including former ministers such as Sotiris Kouvelas, have called  this area "unliberated territory." Sebastianos, the Orthodox  bishop of Konitsa, has had a radio station with five repeaters  installed at the border; these send nationalist messages to the  Greek minority in Albania. All this activity has not led to the  slightest response from the Greek authorities, which are on the  contrary always ready to make a fuss about the "irredentist  propaganda" of neighboring countries such as Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Turkey, and  Albania.</p>

An appearance of impropriety or an apprehension of bias is created where a reasonable person, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances that a reasonable inquiry would disclose, would conclude that a candidate's or member's ability to carry out the duties with integrity, impartiality and competence is impaired. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These disclosure obligations, however, should not be interpreted so that the burden of detailed disclosure makes it impractical for persons in the legal or business community to serve as members, thereby depriving the Parties and participants of the services of those who might be best qualified to serve as members. Thus, candidates and members should not be called upon to disclose interests, relationships or matters whose bearing on their role in the proceeding would be trivial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout the proceeding, candidates and members have a continuing obligation to disclose interests, relationships and matters that may bear on the integrity or impartiality of the dispute settlement process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Code of Conduct does not determine whether or under what circumstances the Parties will disqualify a candidate or member from being appointed to, or serving as a member of, a panel or committee on the basis of disclosures made. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. A candidate shall disclose any interest, relationship or matter that is likely to affect the candidate's independence or impartiality or that might reasonably create an appearance of impropriety or an apprehension of bias in the proceeding. To this end, a candidate shall make all reasonable efforts to become aware of any such interests, relationships and matters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The candidate shall disclose such interests, relationships and matters by completing an Initial Disclosure Statement provided by the Secretariat and sending it to the Secretariat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

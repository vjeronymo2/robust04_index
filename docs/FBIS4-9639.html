			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian </F> Justice and Life Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not  given: "List Leaders Give Interviews -- Csurka: We Can Feel the  People's Quiet Sympathy"]    [Text] In our election series, list leaders of parties  that have set up a national list give interviews on their  party's typical program points and concepts. This time we are  interviewing Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian Justice  and Life Party [MIEP].    [Szombathy] On what points does the MIEP's program differ  markedly from the goals of other national conservative forces?    [Csurka] The major difference is on the economy. We can  clearly see that the Antall government is responsible for the  current situation to the extent that it did not change the  20-year-old economic and financial program of the communist  nomenclature, which had been based on the constant  centralization of funds and restrictions because it had to pay  the interest [on foreign loans]. The economic policy of the  government led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] was a  direct continuation of the budget plans of the communists and  reform-communists. The implementation of this is very  interesting: Formally, the government is in power and the  finance ministers -- who for the most part have not been  replaced in this cycle without reason -- dictate, but the  processes in the financial administration and the banks are all  in communist or liberal hands. Therefore, it cannot be claimed  that the national forces or the government was in power between  1990 and 1994. The MIEP wishes to change this situation, as  this is where order has to be made first. While foreigners are  rooting about in our pockets we cannot talk about independent  Hungarian policies. The MIEP also differs in that it wants  justice by further prosecuting the crimes of the past. We also  want firmly to represent the national interests in culture and  the dissemination of information. The current work of the  public service media is intolerable, and I am saying this in  spite of the fact that my party supports the two deputy chairmen  leaders [of radio and television] who were appointed by the  president but who are under concerted attack. A nation has the  right to direct its own media and culture.    [Szombathy] What was the reason for your suggestion that  those who support the national side should form a forum before  the elections? To what extent do you share the MDF's fear of  the left-wing danger?    [Csurka] The real danger is that of ignorance, rather than  that of the left wing. The only reason we can talk about a  left- wing danger is that a section of the masses is uninformed:  They clearly place the responsibility on the national  Christian- conservative forces, including the least involved  MIEP, which was founded by people who had left the MDF.  Dissatisfied people living in difficult conditions believe the  fairy-tale that the left wing will bring back the golden age of  [former Communist leader] Kadar, which never existed. This  gross exaggeration is being hammered into people by the press,  the radio, the television, and NEPSZABADSAG. Publicity should be  made even before the first round of the elections, which would  explosively give the light of recognition to people who are  living in the dark. A pan-national conference would be suitable  for this with a statement and with the participation of parties  and mainly intellectuals. It is a misinterpretation of my words  to say that I have come closer to the MDF through this: I have  opened up toward all good intentions, and an example of this is  my joint appearance with Jozsef Torgyan [chairman of the  Independent Smallholders Party]. I am expecting the  participants of the Szarszo meeting [August 1993], Hungarians  living abroad, and smallholders to come to the conference. I do  not want this event to be seen as a MIEP initiative.    [Szombathy] How do you see you party's numerical chances at  the elections?    [Csurka] The MIEP has a good chance because it has massive  lists in Budapest and in Pest county, and we have great  popularity in the central parts of the country. This will  certainly be enough to get into Parliament, and our individual  candidates give us hope for a good result. We can feel people's  quiet sympathy.    [Szombathy] Are you preparing for electoral cooperation  between the two rounds of the elections?    [Csurka] Naturally. We will try to enter negotiations on  this issue sensibly and honestly. We will look at who has the  best chance: We will give and take. Give as good as one gets.  We are willing to make an agreement with all national Christian  parties that turn to us with honesty.    [Szombathy] What role do you envisage for the MIEP in the  next Parliament?    [Csurka] It would be distasteful for us also to get involved  in the pre-bargaining on ministerial chairs and coalition  conditions. The MIEP's task is to be a compass for national  Christian conservative forces. Guarantees have to be created  that this conservative coalition would never lean toward the  left, will never make pacts, and will not fall into marriages of  convenience.    [Szombathy] If we can believe the opinion polls, we can  expect a social-liberal victory. What will the MIEP do in such  a situation?    [Csurka] One cannot believe opinion polls, and this has to  be clearly stated once and for all. These surveys serve party  propaganda purposes. However, should we be so unfortunate as  for this to happen, then the MIEP will not despair: It will  continue its consistent nation-organizing work.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BOB COOPER TAKES VICTORY SOLO LAP  </P> <P> It was a big night for Bob Cooper, and he made the most of it. Honored by the  Los Angeles Jazz Society with its Annual Tribute Award, he was the featured  soloist at the group's seventh annual awards concert and dinner Sunday at the  Hyatt Regency Hotel.  </P> <P> Typically, Cooper said most of what he had to say via the expressive medium of  his robust tenor saxophone. Working with the sterling rhythm section of Ross  Tompkins on piano, John Leitham on bass and Larance Marable on drums, he  charged through a group of familiar standards, peaking with a thoughtful but  swinging take on the less familiar "Nobody Else But Me."  </P> <P> When a scheduling problem forced Tompkins to depart, his role was filled by the  gifted young Eric Reed, a pianist who clearly has the potential to do great  things. Trumpeter Conte Candoli also joined the ensemble for a vigorous be-bop  set.  </P> <P> Gerald Wiggins, a perennial at the society's programs, followed with a brisk  sail through the challenging chords of "Cherokee," highlighted by Ralph  Penland's beautifully modulated drum solo. Bassist Red Callender laid down a  sturdy foundation.  </P> <P> The revolving door of musicians continued to turn, with Monty Budwig replacing  Callender as guitarist John Collins joined Wiggins and Penland for a somewhat  bland but mellow interpretation of "Like Someone in Love." The pinnacle of the  evening, however, was reached with the arrival of trumpeter Harry (Sweets)  Edison. Wasting no time applying his trademark riffs to the proceedings, he  played only one piece, "Sunday," but it was more than enough to certify his  still-remarkable jazz powers.  </P> <P> The long program wound toward a close with a set of vigorous improvisations by  the always-at-their-best vocal duo of Don and Alicia Cunningham. Then, finally,  Reed came back on stage to accompany guitarist Steve Gregory, who received the  Society's Shelly Manne Memorial New Talent Award.  </P> <P> Other honorees included saxophonist Vi Redd (Lifetime Achievement Award),  pianist Horace Silver (Composer/Arranger Award) and Joel Leach, the society's  educator of the year.  </P></p>

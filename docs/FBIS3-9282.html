			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, March 22 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs have held up  a convoy of humanitarian aid for the Moslem enclave of Maglaj in  northern Bosnia for at least 24 hours, the UN High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR) said here Tuesday.    The convoy, which left the Croatian capital Zagreb on Monday  morning, was forced to turn back the same day by Serbian forces  controlling the bridge at Gradiska, which links Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, said UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler.    The convoy arrived back in Zagreb on Monday night and left  again on Tuesday morning. It reached Gradiska again at noon and  was undergoing checks, Kessler said, blaming the delay on  "bureaucratic difficulties."    Bosnian Serbs on Saturday lifted a nine-month siege of  Maglaj.    The town's population of around 25,000, plus up to 75,000  others in the surrounding enclave, had been forced to rely on  air drops for food since October.    He said he hoped the convoy would get to Banja Luka, the  main  town under Serbian control in northern Bosnia, in time to spend  the night there before continuing its journey to Maglaj.    The convoy is made up of 30 trucks, 10 of them bound for  Maglaj, and the rest for Banja Luka, Doboj, to the north, and  Zenica in central Bosnia.    On Sunday, nine UNHCR trucks loaded with 80 tonnes of food  and medicine managed to get into Maglaj without hindrance from  Zenica, 70 kilometres (45 miles) to the south.    Bosnian Serbs gave the go-ahead the same day for the second  now delayed convoy.</p>

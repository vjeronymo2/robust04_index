			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> XENAKIS WORKS, OUT OF DOORS, ON SALK INSTITUTE'S NORTH LAWN  </P> <P> An expanse of green lawn, the size and shape of a city block, overlooking the  Pacific Ocean at sunset. Overhead, a blue, cloudless sky. Rising from the East,  a near-full moon.  </P> <P> Arranged around a central seating area are 16 loudspeakers, broadcasting a full  spectrum of electronic sounds, from under-whispers to full industrial blasts.  </P> <P> In this setting, on the north lawn of the Salk Institute at UC San Diego on  Sunday afternoon, Iannis Xenakis' "La Legende d'Eer" (1977), a work originally  incorporating laser technology and mirrors, was revived.  </P> <P> The 5 p.m. concert -- including a meal break at intermission -- offered also  the U.S. premiere of "Voyage Absolu des Unari vers Andromede" for electronic  sounds and kites, and "Rebonds" for solo percussion.  </P> <P> At this penultimate event of the now-concluded "Xenakis at UCSD" festival,  "Legende" made a stunning impression, aided in no small way by the physical  situation.  </P> <P> Eight minutes into the 45-minute sound-construct, the sun set. The remainder  was heard, with only natural lighting, in the quickly darkening twilight. The  audience, an informal group of about 100 rapt listeners, sat, stood and lay  down on the grass through the work. Their concentration seemed total.  </P> <P> Xenakis' pieces have this kind of effect on listeners. After one accepts his  concept of grating, sometimes pain-approaching noise, as well as ambient sounds  as apprehendable music, the ingenuity of his creations can become clear. The  mathematical planning and minute detailing lavished on each work certainly  obviate any haphazardness; this the listener senses.  </P> <P> In a spoken program note before the performance, Xenakis said the piece had its  premiere at the opening of the Pompidou Centre in Paris, later traveled to  Germany and Marseilles.  </P> <P> "Now, it is dying on the (California) shore," the composer/architect commented.  </P> <P> Hardly. Vitality, not death, is the subject of the piece, which recounts the  story of Eer, who was killed in battle, but came to life again, days later, and  told of visiting the other world, from where he was sent back.  </P> <P> Even without lasers and mirrors -- the production team, headed by Joe Kucera,  put on the piece without extra technology, when the price of such technology  reached $10,000, a spokesperson for UCSD said -- the sound essay itself makes  sense. To be surrounded by varied, contrasting, colorful and  imagination-resonant sounds in a natural environment can become an  extraordinary event.  </P> <P> The year-old "Voyage," created last year for a kite festival in Japan, turned  out to be more visual, similarly stimulating. It is an electronic score  accompanied by two large super-kites -- each incorporating a dozen individual  flying parts, with tails of perhaps 20-foot length. These are operated by kite  masters -- at this event, Hyper-Kites of San Diego -- who improvise to the  sound-score.  </P> <P> In full sunlight, "Voyage" sounded and looked perfectly engaging through its  quarter-hour length.  </P> <P> Steven Schick, the virtuoso percussionist who had played two works on the  Saturday-night program, moved outdoors Sunday afternoon for "Rebonds," another  demanding showpiece that he performed from memory, and with fascinating  theatricality.  </P> <P> Schick has an actor's concentration and a dancer's physical control. He makes  no motion without motivation, describes the music with his body, and yet does  not distract from the aural experience. "Rebonds"is neither very long nor  inordinately complex; it seems, instead, perfectly constructed. Schick played  it with a wondrous and projected sense of its genuine importance.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Indirect use.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining whether an issue meets the private business use test, indirect as well as direct use of the proceeds is taken into account. For example, the issuer's use of the proceeds to engage in a series of financing transactions for property to be used by nongovernmental persons in their trades or businesses may cause the private business use test to be met. In addition, proceeds are treated as used in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person in situations involving other arrangements, whether in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions, whereby a nongovernmental person uses property acquired with the proceeds of an issue in its trade or business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ultimate and intermediate use.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining whether an issue meets the private business use test, both the ultimate and intermediate uses of proceeds are taken into account. For example, a facility is treated as being used for a private business use if it is leased to a governmental person and then subleased to a nongovernmental person or if it is leased to a governmental person and subleased to a governmental person, provided in each case that the nongovernmental person's use is in a trade or business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aggregation of private business use.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of proceeds by all nongovernmental persons is aggregated to determine whether the private business use test is satisfied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General definition of private business use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proceeds are used for a private business use if they are used in a trade or business carried on by a nongovernmental person. For this purpose, any activity carried on by a person other than a natural person is treated as a trade or business. See &sect;1.141&hyph;1(e) relating to certain partnerships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use of proceeds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As further described in this paragraph (b) and except as otherwise provided in this section, a person uses proceeds, for purposes of the private business use test, if it (i) owns or leases financed property, (ii) is loaned those proceeds, or (iii) has actual or beneficial use of financed property under a management or incentive payment contract, output contract, or other arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agents and employees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Use of proceeds by nongovernmental persons in their capacity as agents or employees of a governmental person is not use for purposes of the private business use test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ownership.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, ownership of financed property is treated as use of their property for purposes of the private business use test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Leases. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) or (f) of this section, the lease of a financed facility is treated as a use of that facility for purposes of the private business use test. For this purpose, any arrangement, such as a management contract, that is properly characterized is a lease for federal income tax purposes is treated as a lease. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management contracts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A management contract (as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section) results in use of the financed property if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The contract is not a qualified management contract (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The service provider is treated as the lessee of the financed property for federal income tax purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Output facilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See &sect;1.141&hyph;7 for special rules under which contracts for purchase of output of output facilities result in use of the financed facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discharge of primary legal obligation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, a nongovernmental person is treated as a user of a financed facility if the financing of that facility discharges a primary and unconditional legal obligation of that nongovernmental person, even if the nongovernmental person has no possession or control of the facility. Further, the use resulting from the discharge of a primary legal obligation is not use as a member of the general public within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section. A primary legal obligation does not include a law of general application (for example, an ordinance requiring that all businesses properly dispose of hazardous waste). An obligation imposed on the owner of a facility is not the primary obligation of any other user of that facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (b)(8) (see also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of paragraph (e) of this section): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As a condition to obtaining a permit to construct an industrial development, Developer N unconditionally agrees that it will construct governmentally owned streets and sidewalks in its development. N and several other developers undertake to create District, a political subdivision. District issues its tax assessment bonds, the proceeds of which are used, in part, to construct the street and sidewalk improvements that N is obligated to construct. N's obligation to construct the improvements is unconditional and, therefore, the discharge of that obligation results in private business use of the proceeds used to construct those improvements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Deficiencies in technical skill teaching seen THE TECHNOLOGY syllabus used in English schools is much less effective in preparing pupils for industry's needs than equivalent courses in other European countries, a report published today by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research says. The researchers - who include Mr Sig Prais, the institute's senior research fellow - say practical subjects taught in schools can lay the foundation for vocational training and the acquisition of industrial skills. Schools in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands use practical subjects such as woodwork, technical drawing and domestic science to instil basic work skills. These include care, precision, perseverance and responsibility. In England teaching of these subjects has been replaced with the technology syllabus of the national curriculum. The report says this syllabus places strong emphasis on creativity and imagination at the expense of basic skills. The English syllabus devotes much of the pupil's time to speculating and writing about a general theme, the report says. In the European countries studied, school time was largely devoted to the making of useful objects working from precise drawings. Earlier studies by the institute have shown that the shortage of craft skills is the principal deficiency of British industry when compared with European competitors.

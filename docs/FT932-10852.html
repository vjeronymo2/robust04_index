			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (14): City widens its horizons - Tax incentives for new businesses have been agreed NOT so long ago, Geneva, like most cities in Switzerland, turned up its nose at the notion of industrial promotion. Jobs were plentiful and more businesses wanted to come to the city than there was space for, writes Ian Rodger. Would-be newcomers were invited to locate in industrial and technology parks that were springing up in neighbouring communities across the French border. Work permits were severely rationed. But times have changed. Following a speculative property boom in the mid 1980s, the canton of Geneva was particularly hard-hit by the early 1990s slump. It has an unemployment rate of six per cent, with 12,500 people out of work. Geneva's leaders have been quicker than most of their Swiss cousins in joining the rough and tumble international competition among governments to lure new jobs. Two years ago, the cantonal government decided to develop an industrial promotion policy, but it took some time to convince people of the need - 'it was difficult to wake up. We had it so easy for so long,' says Mr Robert Kuster, head of economic promotion. Whereas it used to take months to get approval for work permits for businessmen, it can now be done in less than a week. Even tax incentives for new businesses have been agreed. The canton's promotion campaign is based on Geneva's status as an international centre and on the quality of life in its region. The main focus has been on international companies wanting to establish European headquarters. Geneva already has a fair stock of these, notably Du Pont de Nemours and Hewlett Packard. The other targets are international organisations. The city has long been an important centre for the United Nations, with 15 UN organisations based there. Competition among cities to attract UN agencies has become more intense in recent years and self-satisfied Geneva was slow to respond. Last year, it lost the battles for the secretariat to administer the UN treaty outlawing chemical weapons and for the Commission on Sustainable Development, arising out of the Rio de Janeiro environment conference. It is spending SFr60m to turn Palais Wilson, the former home of the League of Nations, into a House of the Environment, aiming to attract various UN and non-governmental organisations, (NGOs). The financial community is doing its bit. Last August, it set up Fondation Place Financiere to promote Geneva's standing as a European financial centre. And last month it convinced the European Federation of Financial Analysts to set up its new institute in Geneva. At the outset, only two new jobs will be created but, coming at a time when Geneva's bourse is preparing to close in favour of a national electronic exchange, it is welcome. 'It's a first step,' says Mr Thierry Lombard, a partner in the private bank Lombard, Odier and chairman of the Fondation Place Financiere. 'But now we have to develop it. I will be happy in three years time when there are signs that European competence in this area is catching up with the Americans.'</p>

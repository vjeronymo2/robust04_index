			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian vice premier and minister of  foreign affairs, today sent a letter to UN Security Council  Chairman Karel Kovanda rejecting accusations by  Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic about  Croatia's alleged intervention in the war against  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The letter stresses that it would be  illogical and inadequate for the Republic of Croatia, which is  proposing and advocating a peace solution, to undertake a  military offensive in the most critical phase of the peace  negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, let alone to engage in open  military intervention. Minister Granic recalls that the Croat  areas in central Bosnia, and around Zepce in particular, have  been exposed to constant, relentless attacks by the Muslim army  which did not even observe a tripartite Christmas truce.    He also recalls that UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] reports  did not confirm Bosnian government accusations of military  intervention by the Croatian Army and that the UNPROFOR report  said there was no proof of a significant deployment of the  Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Taking these objective  facts into consideration, Prime Minister Silajdzic's accusations  ought to be treated as unfounded, Minister Granic said.    According to him, the form, sharpness, and timing of  Silajdzic's obviously unfounded accusations against my  government make me believe that the Muslim side is neither ready  nor willing to accept peace negotiations in good faith at the  moment.    In his letter to the Security Council chairman, Minister  Granic reiterated his invitation to Silajdzic to return to the  negotiating table, even before the new round of the Geneva  negotiations to be held on 10 February, and to get involved in  fresh efforts in order to find a tenable political solution  based on already accepted principles and solutions for an  alliance of the three equal constituent nations.    In conclusion, the minister recalls that Croatian President  Dr Franjo Tudjman has twice so far asked for complete  international supervision of all borders of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. He has also on several occasions asked for  the complete demilitarization of the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has been and will be the policy of my  government, Granic's letter says.</p>

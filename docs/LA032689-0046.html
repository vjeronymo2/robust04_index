			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> IT'S SIMPLY NOT ALL HOG WILD FOR KENTUCKY  </P> <P> It is one of those magical datelines: Lexington, Ky. For anyone who cares  deeply about college basketball, it is something of a shrine. As serious  golfers need to visit The Augusta National, as a baseball life is not quite  complete without poking around Yankee Stadium and as football fanatics must  explore Packer Country, more than four very good basketball teams are drawn to  the University of Kentucky this weekend.  </P> <P> The fascination with Kentucky basketball is excess. Good and bad. No team in  Division I history has won as many games (1,469 in 86 years) or amassed a  higher winning percentage (75). From 1943 through 1955, or 129 games, the  Wildcats did not lose at home. The five starters who helped win the 1948 NCAA  championship also participated, as a unit, in the London Olympics and averaged  more points themselves than all but one opponent scored in any game against the  United States.  </P> <P> On the sour side, listed in the all-time records section along with so much  glory, between a team that went 29-3 and another that was unbeaten in 25 games,  is this:  </P> <P> "1952-53 -- No Schedule  </P> <P> "(Under suspension by NCAA)"  </P> <P> During the early part of the point-shaving scandal about 40 years ago, oach  Adolph Rupp boasted that gamblers couldn't get within "a 10-foot pole" of his  players. Some did. Rupp may have run off better players than many coaches ever  attract but was sinfully slow in recruiting blacks.  </P> <P> Whispers among NCAA insiders the last 15 or so years were that Kentucky escaped  probation not by being clean but because its methods of cheating were so  sophisticated. Nobody will ever nail Kentucky, Jerry Tarkanian once cried. It's  too big. Too sacred.  </P> <P> As Virginia and Oklahoma, North Carolina and Michigan were arriving for the  Southeast regional, Kentucky was reacting to the resignations earlier in the  week of Coach Eddie Sutton and an assistant, Dwane Casey. And waiting to see  how that impacts on NCAA enforcement of 18 charges against Wildcat basketball.  </P> <P> Ironically, each of the schools involved in that regional has reason to examine  Kentucky and learn something from it. Many Virginia fans, for instance, dream  of the chance for an NCAA title more often than when a wonderchild (Ralph  Sampson) happens to grow up at its doorstep. The bitterness and embarrassment  evident in Lexington should cause renewed respect for Virginia's gentleman  coach, Terry Holland.  </P> <P> Michigan basketball is getting too much sympathy these days. The timing on Bill  Frieder's jumping to Arizona State was terrible, but perhaps could not be  avoided. Arizona State, after all, had a football coach snatched away by Ohio  State a year ago at an inopportune time. And what of the mood at Michigan that  caused Frieder to leave?  </P> <P> Let's say Frieder did the morally proper thing, told Arizona State he could not  disrupt his team at this critical moment. Let's say Arizona State, already  jilted by Purdue's Gene Keady and recalling the football experience, simply  wished Frieder well and grabbed somebody else. Frieder is left to endure all  those can't-win-the-big-one taunts that would eventually erode his program.  </P> <P> Better coaches than Frieder couldn't get past Dean Smith.  </P> <P> Carolina slipped by Michigan in the NCAAs the last two seasons. Getting to the  round of 16 last weekend enabled Smith to tie John Wooden for total career  victories (667) and move within about eight seasons of Rupp's all-time mark of  875. Smith's staggering success over 27 years allowed Carolina three seasons  ago to match 23,000-seat Rupp Arena as a college showpiece.  </P> <P> Smith has had Final Four teams in the '60s, the '70s and the '80s, having  overcome an under-.500 record his first season and being just 35-27 after three  years. He may well be the most cautious coach in all of college sport, but does  leave clues about his success now and then.  </P> <P> During the on-court celebration after Carolina won its 10th Atlantic Coast  Conference tournament title under Smith, two weeks ago, the coach was given a  long and affectionate ovation. As he walked back toward the bench, Smith  suddenly affected a gunslinger in suit and tie, pointing a finger of each hand  toward his players and mouthing: "Thank you. Thank you."  </P> <P> Smith has the final word about everything but does allow his seniors  considerable say in team policy. A former senior, Mitch Kupchak, said  seldom-seen David May and the Tar Heel manager undoubtedly have as much input  this season as stars Jeff Lebo and Steve Bucknall.  </P> <P> "No one knows how he's stayed so competitive for so long, or how much longer  he'll stay on," Kupchak said of Smith. "It might be one or two years; it might  be five or 10."  </P> <P> The fourth team in Lexington, Oklahoma, the one picked to leave victorious,  also leans the most toward Kentucky-like excess. Coach Billy Tubbs dreams of  the Sooners scoring 200 points in a game and refuses to lower his head an inch  after keeping his starters on the court during 45-point victories. If  Oklahomans ever grip basketball half as enthusiastically as they do football,  some sort of Tubbs Tub will be built.  </P> <P> No matter how exciting the games, thoughts this week in Lexington and elsewhere  about college basketball ought to include a once-gifted player and the man who,  20 years ago, inherited him his first season as a head coach.  </P> <P> The player was Cyril Baptiste, whose talent and drug-related sadness were  enormous. Those near him, including the young coach, suspected Baptiste played  his sophomore and junior seasons at Creighton on drugs.  </P> <P> "When I was shooting heroin," Baptiste later said, "that's all I thought about.  ... The school carried me through on some grades, especially when I got strung  out."  </P> <P> "I probably will never get another ballplayer with that much ability," said the  young and ambitious Creighton coach, Eddie Sutton.  </P></p>

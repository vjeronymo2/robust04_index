			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Would you believe that the two Los Angeles pro football teams -- the surging  Raiders and fading Rams -- have the same won-loss record? . . .  </P> <P> So much for the notion that the position of head coach is strictly honorary  when Al Davis is your boss. Art Shell must be doing something different than  predecessor Mike Shanahan. The Raiders are 4-1 under Shell after going 1-3  under Shanahan. . . .  </P> <P> As long as a dozen years ago, John Madden told writers that Shell, his All-Pro  tackle in Oakland, some day would make a great coach. . . .  </P> <P> "Art loves to tell old Raider stories at our team meetings," linebacker Jerry  Robinson said. "We sit there and want him to go on and on." . . .  </P> <P> Bo Jackson's first touchdown run of seven yards, when he bulled his way through  heavy hitting Cincinnati free safety Rickey Dixon, was more remarkable than his  franchise record 92-yard sprint Sunday. . . .  </P> <P> Time of possession remains the most overrated statistic in football. The  Bengals led the Raiders, 31:44 to 28:16. . . .  </P> <P> The post-Halloween weekend was more trick than treat for teams wearing orange  and black in the Coliseum. Oregon State and the Bengals were outscored, 76-13,  by USC and the Raiders. . . . Look for a shakeup in Terry Donahue's coaching  staff next season at UCLA. He misses former offensive coordinator Homer Smith  most of all. But Smith, who left after the 1986 season, is happy at Alabama and  will remain a member of Bill Curry's staff. . . .  </P> <P> How Soon They Forget: On the Coliseum message board all season, Cliff "Brandy"  has been listed as the Raiders' second leading all-time receiver. . . .  </P> <P> Is it my imagination or are fewer quarterback in-the-grasp calls being made in  the NFL this season? . . .  </P> <P> Easy Goer vs. Sunday Silence is Alydar vs. Affirmed all over. Like Alydar, Easy  Goer has more natural ability than his rival. But, like Affirmed, Sunday  Silence is the tougher competitor. . . .  </P> <P> Nobody fits Al McGuire's description of an "aircraft carrier in the middle"  better than David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs and U.S. Navy. . . .  </P> <P> If Alex Stewart can rock Evander Holyfield, what is Mike Tyson going to do to  him? . . .  </P> <P> Junior Seau, who happens to be a junior, dominates a game like no other USC  linebacker since Chip Banks. . . .  </P> <P> News item: Several Oregon State players say they were flat Saturday against the  Trojans. Reaction: It really must have been tough to get up for still another  big game after all those key Pacific 10 Conference contests the Beavers have  played in recent years. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Todd Marinovich and Boris Becker. . . .  </P> <P> Marinovich should become the first freshman to be named player of the year in  the Pac-10. . . .  </P> <P> What is so difficult about finding regular linemates for Wayne Gretzky? Robbie  Ftorek never could last season and new King Coach Tom Webster isn't doing a  much better job now. Shucks, I'll volunteer to skate on a wing opposite The  Great One. . . .  </P> <P> The one word athletes hate to hear more than any other is "choke.". . .  </P> <P> Jimmy Vaccaro, the oddsmaker at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, has established  Notre Dame as a modest 57-point favorite over SMU. "It would have been more,"  Vaccaro said, "but Lou Holtz probably will call off the dogs early because he  has two big games at Penn State and Miami coming up." . . .  </P> <P> Coach Jerry Berndt has proven that his 18-game losing streak at Rice was no  fluke by going 0-9 at Temple. . . .  </P> <P> Honesty in crowd counts went out the door years ago when the attendance meter  was taken down from the rafters above the north basket at the Los Angeles  Sports Arena. . . .  </P> <P> Thumbs down on Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy for keeping running back  Mike Pringle on the bench when he was only five yards away from the NCAA  single-game rushing record Saturday against New Mexico State. If Murphy were a  baseball manager, he would lift a pitcher going for a no-hitter in the ninth  inning in order to give his bullpen some work. . . .  </P> <P> Have you ever heard anyone praise a prevent defense? . . .  </P> <P> Only trouble with the "Two Geezers at Caesars" line about the George  Foreman-Gerry Cooney fight is that it will be held at the Convention Hall in  Atlantic City Jan. 15. . . .  </P> <P> Among those cheering on the Clippers against the Houston Rockets from courtside  seats Friday night were Tracy Austin, Danny Manning, and Ira Reiner. . . .  </P> <P> This is the kind of year when a superstar defensive player could win the  Heisman Trophy, but there simply isn't one around. . . .  </P> <P> I'll watch anything on ESPN except the tractor pulls. . . .  </P> <P> Benoit Benjamin's agent, Henry Holmes, tried to reach a couple of members of  the Clippers' negotiating team by phone at owner Donald Sterling's office late  the other night. After having no luck, Holmes asked for the name of the person  on the other end of the line. "I'm the janitor," said Donald Sterling, who then  hung up.  </P></p>

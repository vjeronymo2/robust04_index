			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Vance talks lead to accord on ceasefire in Croatia THE Yugoslav federal army and the breakaway republic of Croatia yesterday agreed on a ceasefire, to take effect from 6pm today, after four hours of talks with Mr Cyrus Vance, the United Nations envoy. If the ceasefire - the 14th such accord - were honoured, the way would be paved for the dispatch of UN peace-keeping forces to Croatia. Mr Vance called the agreement 'an important step forward'. Under the accord, signed by Colonel General Andrija Raseta, deputy commander of the Serb-led federal army in Croatia, and Croatian defence minister Gojko Susak, neither side would return fire in the event of a violation until joint liaison teams had investigated the incident. The talks took place in Sarajevo, capital of the central Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, which also appealed yesterday to Mr Vance for peace-keepers. The deputy prime minister of Bosnia, Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, said troops should be sent to Bosnia, 'not only to preserve the peace, but to preserve the territorial integrity of the republic'. Last month, Bosnian Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, declared a 'Serbian Bosnia', in a move which confirmed suspicions that certain Serb-inhabited regions of the republic would try to form the boundaries of a greater Serbia. Bosnia, despite Serbia's opposition, has asked - along with the republics of Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia - for recognition by the European Community. The EC will grant this on January 15, subject to respect for human and ethnic rights having been established, and to no forcible change being made to any of the republics' frontiers. Bosnian Moslem officials yesterday said they feared that any carve-up of the republic by Serbia and Croatia would lead to bloodshed between its three largest ethnic communities of Moslems, Serbs and Croats. The 734,000 Croats, organised under the Bosnian equivalent of Croatia's ruling Croatian Democratic Union, are divided between those living in western Hercegovina, who are considering long-term unity with Croatia, and those in multi-ethnic communities in the republic who want to retain its unity.</p>

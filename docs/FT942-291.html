			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (22): Notable newcomers - Inward Investment / Roland Adburgham looks at the Japanese in Wales Working for the Japanese: The Economic and Social Consequences of Japanese Investment in Wales by Jonathan Morris, Max Munday and Barry Wilkinson Athlone Press, Pounds 32, 156 pages With some justification, Wales has prided itself on its success at winning inward investment to help to counter the contraction of its traditional heavy industries. Notable among the newcomers have been Japanese manufacturers. It is more than 20 years since the first of these, Takiron, arrived. Today, they number more than 40, including names such as Sony, Sharp, Matsushita and Toyota. From the start, they sparked controversy with their novel (at the time) single union and no-strike agreements and innovative management practices. They were criticised for being assembly-type operations exploiting the labour surplus in Wales to create a largely female, low-skilled workforce. While such issues stimulated broad debate, there has been less analysis of the overall value to Wales of the newcomers. This book, by three members of the Japanese Management Research Unit of Cardiff Business School, is a useful assessment of their impact. The authors conclude that, although Japanese companies employ only 1 per cent of the Welsh workforce, the effect has been both considerable and beneficial - 'Undoubtedly, Wales would be a poorer place without the Japanese.' One consequence, they say, is that Welsh employers have been spurred to develop a 'Japanese-style' of working, 'centring on individual responsibility for product quality, team working and functional flexibility'. Over the years, the nature of the plants has changed: the second wave of newcomers saw fewer assembly-only plants and more original equipment manufacturers. Later arrivals included component manufacturers, supplying the existing plants. The authors find that 'plants are developing away from the assembly-only stereotype and are employing, in some cases, large numbers of managers and engineers'. But they point out that only a minority of plants carry out research or design work and investment remains concentrated in a narrow industry segment  -consumer electronics and office automation. And, they say, 'it is clear that the boom in Japanese investment that occurred during the mid to late 1980s is largely over'. The authors' researches throw up many intriguing facts. Government aid has worked out at about Pounds 7,500 per worker. Although one company reported 1,500 people on its recruitment waiting list, many businesses reported difficulties in finding engineering staff and technicians. Younger employees are becoming a smaller proportion of the workforces, as their employers realise the value of more mature staff. The companies are beginning to play a corporate-citizen role in the community. Managers from Japan say they much appreciate the warm welcome received in Wales and enjoy the working environment. The negative factors for them are education of children, language problems and their wives' integration into the local community. One manager complained: 'No hot springs, no bar hopping, no ladies]' In spite of the book's title, there is little about the attitude of the workers. The Welsh workforce, we are told, 'has adapted with remarkably little resistance or complaint to a Japanese style of working', a fact attributed to personnel and industrial relations practices. But we do not learn whether the Welsh prefer to work for the Japanese.</p>

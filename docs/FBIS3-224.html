About 80 percent of the force went on strike on Tuesday, and  many left the base because they did not receive the top scale  for their rank as promised earlier. A force spokesman said many  of the deserters have returned. He said every day lost could  have a disruptive effect since it was affecting the training of  the troops, which was now in its final stages.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with former South Yemeni President 'Ali </F> Nasir Muhammad in Damascus, by Shadiyah Riyad in Cairo; date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, a real catastrophe may be  threatening not only fraternal Yemen but also the entire Arab  region. What are your views on how to avoid this disaster?    [Muhammad] First, it pleases me to address the Arab people  on  the Cairo Radio. I would like to greet the fraternal Egyptian  people and their leadership. I salute President Husni Mubarak,  who has stood by the Yemeni people from the beginning of the  crisis. He has actively made telephone calls and held meetings  to contain the crisis that threatens national unity, security,  and stability in Yemen and the security and stability of the  region. Yemen is a littoral country on the Red Sea and the  Arabian Sea, and so our country affects and is affected by what  takes place around us in the region. In my view, the problem in  Yemen is the responsibility of our brothers and friends. I am  making efforts to help Yemen overcome this ordeal.    [Riyad] You say that the brothers and friends should  shoulder  their responsibilities. You met in Damascus with a number of  envoys from Sanaa and Aden; do you sense that they are ready to  accept Arab mediation efforts to address the crisis?    [Muhammad] In fact, the efforts by brothers and friends have  not ceased; they are continuing. However, frankly speaking,  what has happened and is happening in Yemen is the  responsibility of the brothers there. The meeting of the Yemeni  leaders in Amman and the signing of the Pledge and Accord  Document there, their meeting in Salalah, and other meetings  provided opportunities for direct dialogue between the political  leaders in Yemen. Regrettably, numerous Arab and international  overtures clashed with certain positions, prompting certain Arab  leaders to balk.    Personally, I played a humble role last year and this year  by making certain overtures and proposals to contain the crisis.  Regrettably, my proposals and overtures contradicted certain  positions, and thus failed. I acted out of my concern for the  security and stability in Yemen and the region. I am following  up on my efforts with my brothers and envoys, both in Yemen and  abroad. I am following developments and am concerned to stop the  bloodshed and halt the deterioration and collapse in Yemen.    [Riyad] Does this mean that there are mediation efforts by  the Yemeni sons to address this crisis?    [Muhammad] As I noted, I already put forward certain  overtures. I think that if the brothers there had responded to  my overtures, they might have borne fruit and led to a  relaxation of the situation. I held contacts a week ago with a  number of Yemeni figures who are concerned about stability and  want to contain the crisis in Yemen. They responded positively  and welcomed my overture and the proposal to hold a meeting.  They also welcome my readiness to go to Yemen.    I am holding contacts with the Yemeni leadership. If the  Yemeni leadership and figures in the Arab homeland and outside  agree, I am ready to go to Sanaa and Aden to help the Yemeni  leadership contain the crisis, because the danger threatens  everyone inside and outside Yemen and even the region and the  Arab nation. Unity is not the exclusive province of the two  Yemeni parties nor of certain individuals. Yemeni unity  concerns all Yemeni people, for they and the Arab nation,  particularly Egypt, made sacrifices for it. I consider that  Yemeni unity is the fruit of the struggle by the Yemeni people,  in both north and south.    [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, as you said, unity was the result of  all the Yemeni people's struggle. But what is the future of  this unity since the break caused by the war between the two  sides? Can it be maintained when weapons are being used?    [Muhammad] I do not keep my view secret; very frankly, I  support unity. I have said that I am opposed to fighting and to  secession. The bloody events inflicted on the Yemeni people and  their gains, on the army, the economy, and the citizens' morale  could leave a deep rift in the people and in Yemen's unity. But  there is no alternative. As for secession, Yemen cannot revert  back to the 1990 borders, the year when unity was established.  I have said this repeatedly and on several occasions, even to  officials. I met yesterday with [name indistinct], who used to  be foreign minister, and told him that it is impossible to go  back to the 1990 borders. If Yemen is partitioned, then  possibly more than one state and more than one entity will be  established, and a series of conflicts and wars will break out  between these entities in Yemen. This could affect Yemen's  future.    [Riyad] Do you believe that dialogue is still possible?    [Muhammad] There is no other path than that of the dialogue.  The doors to dialogue remain open amid all the wars that happen  in the world. There are in fact bloody and painful battles  today, but there is no path other than dialogue. Continuing the  war means the complete destruction of everything. That is why I  underlined the need to go back to the dialogue and to persist  with it in order to stop the shedding of blood and to protect  Yemeni national unity.    [Riyad] Do you think that the two sides are willing to stop  the fighting and bloodshed?    [Muhammad] Everyone talks about going back to the dialogue,  about a cease-fire and a disengagement. Everyone is talking,  but the battles are in fact still raging even while I am talking  to you. This is why I call again on the leaders to rely on the  dialogue, the Constitution of the unified state, and the Pledge  and Accord Document.    [Riyad] Thank you 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former president of  [South] Yemen.    [Muhammad] Thank you for continuing to follow the situation  in Yemen.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Cesar Castellanos, Honduran National Party </F> leader; place and date not given; from "The Morning Paper"  newscast -- recorded]    [Text] Good morning, Hondurans. The rumors that are  spreading are truly alarming. Two days ago I spoke on another  radio network, and [words indistinct] told me about this rumor  that is spreading nationwide. I think that all Hondurans must  support the constitutional government. The National and the  Liberal Parties have had to pay a high price to bring democracy  back to Honduras. Ours is a democracy that must be broadened and  strengthened.    In addition, rumors of this kind, especially if they are  promoted by various national sectors, substantially undermine  the country's economy vis-a-vis the international community. I  believe and reiterate: We cannot let this government fail, but  this government must also act to prevent this from happening.  There are no doubts. We sensed it when we spoke with fellow  party members and many Liberals. They all agree that people are  very disappointed. The government lacks leadership and often  improvises because it is not prepared to rule. There is a  general feeling that the government makes hasty decisions, and  we must find a solution to this. We must unite to find a  solution to national problems. This is not about whether the  government fails, it is about the system losing its credibility,  which might lead people to seek other mechanisms to govern.    I do not think a military coup d'etat would change the  country's economic situation because such a forceful action will  not bring food or money; it would do more harm. The  international condemnation following a coup d'etat would be  serious, widespread, and our country would be faced with even  worse problems. We have also been in touch with the military on  various occasions, and they have expressed their concern  regarding the country's economic situation and willingness to  cooperate.    I think we should disregard these rumors. Regarding the  presidential adviser and Liberal Party spokesman, who commented  recently about feeling pressured, I know many people will go out  and rush to sell their things because there is a high level of  disappointment. I am positive, however, that all Hondurans  reject the possibility of a coup d'etat. I reiterate that we  must hold a national dialogue. All Hondurans must be aware of  their positions. If ordinary people must make sacrifices,  businessmen, producers, industrialists, and banks, which have  fared well and have increased their wealth substantially, must  make even greater sacrifices.</p>

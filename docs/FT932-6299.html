			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (1): Key factor is labour - Inward investment has fallen back from recent high levels as a result of the economic slowdown worldwide. The UK benefits from relatively low wage rates but it faces growing competition from eastern Europe IF RELOCATION is an industry, it is suffering from the recession like any other industry. There are two aspects to this. First, the UK economic slowdown is having an impact on domestic firms. Second, inward investment by foreign multinationals has dropped sharply, mostly because of recession worldwide. The domestic effect is explained by Mr David Rees, a relocation specialist with the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. 'What drives relocation,' he says, 'is mostly cost pressures, such as labour and rents. In a recession, these pressures are lower.' As for inward investment, the fall in activity must be put in the context of the extra- ordinarily high levels of recent years. According to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), inward investment in the UK in 1990 was Dollars 33.8bn - more than a fifth of the OECD total, and nearly 40 per cent of all investment into the EC. In 1991, the figure fell by 38 per cent. In the first half of 1992 it fell a further 29 per cent. The reasons were twofold. First, industry worldwide was investing heavily in the boom conditions of the late 1980s. This was particularly true of Japan, which was a vitally important investor in the UK over the period. The Japanese stock market bubble of the late 1980s provided Japanese manufacturers with virtually interest-free finance, and encouraged excessive investment both at home and overseas. The new Japanese plants in the UK turning out cars and consumer electronics have done much to assist the UK's faltering balance of payments. They may be the last of their kind for a while. The second reason has to do with the establishment of the European single market. This encouraged foreign manufacturers to move into the EC, with the UK proving an obvious home on grounds of cheapness and the English language. It also caused upheaval within existing European industry, as manufacturers sought to rationalise production in the face of new competitive pressures. As the celebrated case of Hoover showed earlier this year - whereby a plant making vacuum cleaners in Dijon is being shut and production moved to Glasgow - the UK benefited here as well. The Hoover case brought to the fore an issue which now dominates the outlook for relocation into the UK: the social chapter. The UK has been accused - for instance, by the French government - of trying to make itself into the Taiwan of Europe. It has been accused of social dumping  - seeking an unfair advantage within the Community by keeping its employment costs artificially low. On the other side of the argument, UK employers - Nissan of Japan included - are vocal in the pleas that the UK's natural advantage of cheap labour should not be taken away from it by Brussels bureaucrats. In fact, some of the argument is misplaced. The social chapter has only a limited amount to do with employment costs, nor is it by any means clear that the UK's sole advantage as a location within the EC lies in the cheapness of its labour. Nevertheless, the argument will continue to run. One or two economists are already suggesting that if the UK is basing its employment strategy on cheap labour, it is running a serious risk in the long term. The fall of the Berlin wall opened up a vast potential reservoir of cheap labour to the east. At present, the transitional upheaval in central European economies and the poorness of their infrastructure mean the threat is limited. But both those problems will surely be overcome in time. The nature of the threat is illustrated by a firm such as ABB Lummus Chemoprojekt, a western-owned process engineer based in the Czech city of Brno. Mr Gernot Gross, managing director, says that for the qualified engineers used in his industry, the UK is the cheapest source in western Europe. 'If German costs are 100,' he says, 'UK costs are only 70. But Czech costs for the same quality of work are 40.' In the end, as Mr Rees of Ernst &amp; Young remarks, labour is the key to most relocation decisions: either it is cost, or it is availability. This applies within the UK as well. In cost terms, there are still significant differences between the south-east of England and the rest of the country. Indeed, according to Mr Rees, there is less difference between the other regions than between them and the south-east. Within the UK, though, many other factors come into play. For an office location, the deciding question may be whether it is within two hours of London by rail. For a manufacturing operation, much will depend on how much of the output is shipped locally and how much exported. Another important aspect, of course, is government incentives. Some 35 per cent of the working population of Great Britain, according to Mr Rees, live in so-called assisted areas. At present, the map of these areas - last drawn in 1984 - is being drawn afresh. The work was supposed to be completed by January this year, having been promised by the government as an election commitment. It has been held up, however, by the debacle over coal closures, which has complicated the picture on employment levels in various parts of the country. The government has proved unhelpful in another respect. The Budget sprang un unwelcome surprise: a change in the tax breaks allowed on relocation expenses, designed to raise Pounds 200m a year for the Inland Revenue by 1995. In essence, the plan is to limit tax relief on relocation expenses to Pounds 8,000 and to prevent employers indemnifying employees free of tax for losses on property sales. The Relocation Solicitors' Group, based in London, says: 'Many in the relocation industry believe the proposals amount to a tax on mobility and will prevent companies from taking full advantage of the opportunities presented to them as they emerge from recession.' Not everyone takes such a gloomy view. Mr Rees says: 'It's not a serious impediment. It affects the economics slightly, but in the context of the whole cost of relocation - closure and set-up costs, training and so on - it's not significant.' In any case, as Mr Rees points out, most relocations occur not between regions, but within them. Often, this is precisely so that the workforce can be retained. A company may have outgrown its premises, or aim to find somewhere cheaper. Very often, it will end up staying within a 20-mile radius. But to the extent that relocation between regions does go on, which are winning and which losing? The question cannot be answered with any precision, since no statistics are available. The one clear pattern still seems to be that the south-east is losing out to the rest of the country. 'As for the other regions,' says Mr Rees, 'Leeds has been doing well for some office projects lately, and south Wales on manufacturing. And within the last month or so Glasgow seems to have picked up several good ones - not just Hoover.' Despite the pressures of recession, it seems the relocation industry continues to thrive. From a broad economic viewpoint, this is to be welcomed. One of the abiding paradoxes of the UK economy is that the so-called equilibrium level of unemployment - the rate below which inflation starts to accelerate - should be so much higher than in most developed countries. A decade ago, that was commonly blamed on the power of the trade unions in forcing up wages. But the unions are now a spent force, and still the equilibrium level of unemployment has continued to rise. Whatever the answer to the puzzle, the mobility of labour must have something to do with it. In general terms, the more relocation is going on, and the more flexible and mobile the labour force, the better the outlook for employment.</p>

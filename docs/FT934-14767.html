			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / EC warning on cost of medicines GOVERNMENT price controls on medicines have not worked and should be abolished, Mr Martin Bangemann, the European Community's industry commissioner, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'Free pricing is not only good for normal products and services, it is also good for products and services in health care,' Mr Bangemann said at a reception sponsored by the European Proprietary Medicines Manufacturers' Association. Pricing should be separated from the question of social security reimbursements, he said, and low-income citizens should be protected through other arrangements. Mr Bangemann is drafting an EC Commission report on pricing in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

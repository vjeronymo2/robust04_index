			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Violence in the US: Insurance losses may reach Dollars 1bn INSURANCE losses from riots in Los Angeles and other US cities could reach Dollars 1bn, according to early estimates. Farmers Group, one of California's biggest insurers, provisionally estimated its losses at Dollars 50m, much less than the Dollars 130m it paid out in the recent Oakland fire disaster near San Francisco. Other insurers said it would be next week before they had an accurate picture of the situation. Allstate, one of the country's largest property-liability insurers and a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck, said claims had started to trickle in, but it was often impossible to get close enough to buildings to assess damage. Mr Nicholas Balcombe, of loss assessors Balcombe Group, the UK affiliate of Adjusters International, which has offices in Los Angeles, expects insured losses, including the cost of consequential losses, to reach Dollars 1bn. A second firm of loss adjusters, Maxon Young, also expects insured losses at this level. The London insurance market, which provides reinsurance for a number of US companies, could also be affected. An executive of one leading international broker, said: 'We have already identified some severe impact to London.' The Insurance Information Institute, a New York-based industry grouping, said more insurance was in force in urban areas today than at the time of the riots in the early 1960s.</p>

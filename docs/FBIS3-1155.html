			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] has (?issued) a  statement concerning the start of the process of destroying  ammunition and explosive devices in government and Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] troop assembly areas.    At a meeting in Maputo yesterday, the CCF found that the  pace  of government and Renamo troop confinement has dropped slightly.  The United Nations has called on the two sides to replace  troops as they are demobilized.    At a meeting to analyze the evolution of the troop  confinement and demobilization process, Renamo presented  complaints that men were allegedly being trained in Goba, in  Maputo Province, and that Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, soldiers  were allegedly selling weapons to civilians in Tete Province.    The CCF promised to investigate on the ground the  allegations  that have been presented by the movement led by Afonso Dhlakama.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lookers 'off the bottom' as margins recover LOOKERS, the Manchester-based motor dealer, was again affected by recession in the year to the end of September but has started to see signs of recovery. Mr Ken Martindale, chairman, said sales in the first quarter of the current year were 'somewhat higher' than the 14 per cent increase reported by the motor industry. He said margins, which have been depressed by stock overhangs and manufacturers selling nearly new cars, started to recover in December and have maintained the trend this month. 'We're certainly off the bottom,' he said. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.21m to Pounds 1.81m in the year to September 30 as a result of volume and margin losses. Turnover dropped from Pounds 359.6m to Pounds 332.7m. Mr Martindale said gearing had fallen from 115 per cent to a little less than 100 per cent, of which half was held in the contract hire division. Looker was proposing to sell 51 per cent of that operation to Woodchester Credit Lyonnais, a subsidiary of Woodchester Investments, for between Pounds 1.52m and Pounds 1.77m. Proceeds would be used to reduce borrowings. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 146,000 to cover the costs of closing a subsidiary after the year end. Earnings fell from 2.1p to 0.9p. The directors decided to maintain the final dividend at 4.2p for an unchanged total of 6.2p, on the grounds of prospects for recovery and the expected fall in gearing.</p>

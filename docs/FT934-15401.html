			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Papandreou's health casts shadow over election victory GREECE woke up yesterday to an uncertain political future under a government headed by Mr Andreas Papandreou, the 74-year-old socialist leader whose frail health means he can work no more than a few hours a day. The return to power of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) is a personal triumph for Mr Papandreou over his health and the financial and marital scandals that brought down his government in 1989. But doubts about his ability to withstand the stress of running the country loom larger than ever. To protect his fragile health, he is expected to run the country from his villa in an Athens suburb rather than from the prime minister's office. But instead of appointing a deputy premier, who might be tempted to plot his political demise, Mr Papandreou plans to keep a firm grip on his cabinet. Loyal followers from the past rather than talented, but possibly troublesome, younger socialists will get top jobs. Mr Papandreou will oversee committees of ministers and advisers who will carry out routine government tasks, say socialist officials. The 'kitchen cabinet' principle of Mr Papandreou's previous term in office seems certain to be revived. The prime minister's heart specialist, Dr George Kremastinos, who has accompanied him on rare trips abroad since his recovery from heart surgery in 1988, is tipped to become minister of health. Socialist policies are still unclear, although Mr Papandreou's priority is the deficit, the result of a shortfall in revenues and a rise in interest payments on domestic debt to Dr2,200bn (Pounds 5.9bn) this year, some 11 per cent of gross domestic product. Greek bankers and businessmen have been waiting in vain for evidence that Pasok, committed to abandoning the conservatives' privatisation programme, will not undo their efforts to maintain fiscal discipline. Moreover, the choice of Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, Greece's most popular politician, as economy minister suggests that political concerns are paramount for Mr Papandreou. Near-final election returns gave Pasok 46.9 per cent of the vote and 170 seats in the 300-member parliament. New Democracy, led by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, suffered a worse defeat than forecast, winning 39.3 per cent of the vote and 111 seats. Political Spring, the conservative splinter group, won 4.9 per cent of the vote and 10 seats. The Greek Communist Party won 4.5 per cent of the vote and nine seats.

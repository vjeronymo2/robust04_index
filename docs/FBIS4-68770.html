			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Declaration of the Russian Union of Local </F> Self-Government": "Russia, Our Home"]    [Text] The adoption of legislative acts on local  self-government, initially in the USSR and then in the Russian  Federation, set the foundation to the process of forming the  legislative base in the sphere of self-government and provided  the impulse for development of the system of self-government in  Russia. In addition to securing certain guarantees with respect  to the rights of self-government, the laws adopted provided an  opportunity for a number of Federation entities to adopt  legislative and normative resolutions determining proper  jurisdiction of organs of local self-government and deciding  issues in the formulation of local budgets, land use, and the  composition and management of municipal property.    The natural process of formation and development of the  system of local self-government was cut short by the events of  September-October 1993, as a consequence of which the  representational organs of local power were dissolved. Among the  first edicts signed following these events, however, were the  edicts of the Russian Federation president regarding guarantees  of the rights of local self-government. As these edicts emerged,  we were able to trace a certain evolution in the views of  presidential structures on the system of self-government. In  particular, the change in status of the head of local  administration may be considered a positive factor. Whereas in  the initial variant the head of a local administration was  recognized as the head of local self-government, later edicts  reflect the elected head of local self-government as becoming  the head of local administration. Unfortunately, some of the  issues in these edicts were resolved not in favor of the  development of self-government. Thus, the budgetary rights of  population centers were significantly encroached upon, the  quantitative composition of representational organs was  determined by presidential volition, not the will of the voters,  and the scope of authority of these organs was restricted,  thereby restricting the ability of citizens to adopt one form or  another of self-government in their territory.    The Russian Federation Constitution adopted 12 December 1993  devotes a separate chapter to questions of self-government, in  which its presence is acknowledged quite definitively and  guarantees are presented with respect to its rights and the  separation of organs of local self-government from organs of  state authority. But despite the thorough preparation that went  into this fundamental document, certain wordings make it  possible, on its basis, both to create a developed system of  self-government and to in fact eliminate this entirely.    Based on the historical experience of foreign countries and  Russia as reflected in the European Charter of Local  Self-Government and the Declaration on Local Self-Government in  the Russian Federation adopted by the Union of Russian Cities  and supported by the Russian Union of Local Self-Government, we  consider the following as necessary features of the presence of  self-government:    --acknowledgement of the population center and its  surrounding territory as the primary entity of local territorial  self-government;    --presence of a general infrastructure securing the vital  activity of the populace;    --opportunity for the populace to effect realization of  direct and representational democracy (specifically--elections  of the organs of self-government);    --possession by the organs of local self-government of their  own jurisdiction, including fundamental jurisdiction in the  sphere of municipal property, local taxes and budgets, and use  of land in their territory.    In accordance with the edict of the Russian Federation  president, elections of organs of local self-government should  take place prior to June 1994. In this regard, Federation  entities are afforded the right, taking historical, ethnic, and  other traditions and particularities into account, to adopt the  Statute on Self-Government and Statute on Elections to Organs of  Local Self-Government in their territories. Even a cursory  analysis of the above-mentioned statutes in a number of Russian  oblasts leads to the depressing conclusion that self-government  has been curtailed, and rigid, centralized rule has been  reestablished. Models of pseudo-self-government are being  proposed for implementation that are not only far distant from  the views of self-government recognized throughout the world,  but are even remote from the progressive provisions contained in  the president's edict. Here a departure from the Constitution  justified on the principle of "revolutionary expediency" is not  recognized as any serious violation.    In order to return to the civilized path of development of  local territorial self-government, we consider it necessary as a  measure of first order to review a number of existing  legislative acts and adopt new ones, in particular--the Russian  Federation Laws "On Principles of Local Self-Government," "On  Principles of Administrative-Territorial Structuring," and "On  the Budgetary Rights of Local Self-Government," and we appeal to  the deputies of the Federal Assembly of Russia with proposals:    --to legally secure the basic principles of local  self-government in Federal Law as soon as possible;    --to review presidential edicts on matters of local  self-government over the period September 1993 through the  present, verifying their conformance with the Russian Federation  Constitution and repealing provisions that contradict it;    --to conduct parliamentary hearings dedicated to the course  of reform of local self-government in Federation entities,  engaging the participation of all-Russian and regional social  and political organizations, representatives of the organs of  self-government, and all other interested parties.    We appeal to the residents of cities, settlements, and rural  villages.    We appeal to the CITIZENS of Russia!    Self-government is the business of citizens themselves--it  is  a job for you and us.    It is necessary that we stand up for our right to establish  the power of authority in the localities. There is only one  solution--to attain the REALIZATION of what appears in words in  existing legislation: the principle of ELECTING and REPLACING  AUTHORITY on a systematic basis. In the cities, settlements, and  villages, everywhere our lives are in process, everywhere that  is our HOME.    And if we can influence living conditions in our own home,  in  our own city, then all of Russia will become our home.    The interests of Russia are first and foremost the interests  of the people of Russia.    We are up to the task, if we just get to work!

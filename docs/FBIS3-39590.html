On the left, the Left Democrat-led progressive front  announced agreement on candidates -- with the Greens, in  particular, saying their demands had been fully met -- and the  Left Democrats unveiled a government programme to "rebuild  Italy" via job-creation-through-growth, "fairer" taxes, a  further reform of the electoral system to introduce a double  ballot and facilitate "a clear choice of parliamentary majority  and premier," and the attribution to local government of "all  the functions not expressly given to central government."    The 32-page programme of the Left Democrats thus made  important concessions to regionalist urges by envisaging "tax  autonomy" for local and regional governments. It also proposed  the transformation of one of the two houses of parliament into a  regional assembly. Expressly ruling out one of the fears raised  by the right, it said there would be no tax on Treasury bonds  (BOTs).    After the electoral accord on the right between the Northern  League and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy) in  northern Italy and between the latter and the far-right National  Alliance in the rest of the country, the centre thus remains the  one "pole" still to agree on candidates.    Segni indicated this evening that he would not be pressing  for a veto on some candidates who have been seen as too closely  identified with past political ways, by saying that he would  only issue an "overall" judgement on the People's Party lists.    People's Party leader Mino Martinazzoli rejected the view  that the two centrist forces had been on the verge of breaking  apart, saying that "if demands are not too excessive and there  is an awareness of the political validity of the accord, things  can be sorted out."    The deadline for naming candidates is tomorrow; the deadline  for presenting them is Monday [21 February] -- provided that 250  signatures are collected for each candidate.</p>

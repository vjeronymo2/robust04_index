			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (7): Striking departures for market leaders - German luxury carmakers: Kevin Done finds BMW and Mercedes-Benz undertaking radical strategy changes Swatch watch boutiques have run a special offer at some European airports this year. 'Buy three Swatches, get a fourth free.' It is an approach to marketing that might help to sell millions of cheap watches a year, but until recently it could hardly have been further removed from the refined world of Mercedes-Benz. But the joint venture announced earlier this year between the prestigious German luxury carmaker and SMH, the Swiss pioneer of cheap and cheerful watches, to develop a micro compact car is one of the most dramatic signs yet of the radical change of strategy embarked upon by Mercedes-Benz. In a striking departure from corporate tradition the German group has mapped out a future for itself as a maker of a full range of cars from flagship limousines to two-seater micro city cars. BMW, its arch domestic rival, is demonstrating a similar ability to rethink its position in the world car industry. The Munich-based producer has previously built its reputation on a fierce independence and a profound reluctance to enter alliances with any other carmaker. Yet this year it has moved to broaden substantially its industrial base with the takeover of Rover group from British Aerospace. Through the acquisition of the leading UK vehicle maker, BMW has doubled its production capacity and has become the foremost European maker of four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicles with Land Rover. It has acquired several new brand-names - most importantly Rover and MG as well as Land Rover - along with a position in the European market for small and medium-sized frontwheel drive cars. Both Mercedes-Benz and BMW have accepted that their car operations can no longer be dependent solely on a German manufacturing base. They are moving fast to establish foreign assembly plants, most importantly in North America, but also in developing markets. Last month the first BMW rolled off the assembly line at the group's Dollars 400m plant at Spartanburg, South Carolina, making it the only European carmaker with an assembly plant in the US. Mercedes-Benz is not far behind, however, and is developing its first North American passenger vehicle plant in Alabama, where production should begin at the end of 1996. The shake-up at Mercedes-Benz is one of the most surprising in the world auto industry. The group has embarked on a far-reaching re-alignment of its new product strategy after admitting publicly the unpalatable truth that the company's luxury cars were 'over-engineered', and that if it persisted with such a policy for developing new models, it would end up being 'priced-out' of world markets. Mercedes-Benz's new strategy means that by the late 1990s it will have launched a whole series of vehicles into new segments of the world market including: a multi-purpose vehicle called Viano, to rival models such as the Renault Espace and to be built in Spain, a modern four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicle that will be assembled in the new plant in the US, a small family car sized between a Volkswagen Golf and a Ford Fiesta, to be produced in Germany, and most surprisingly the micro compact car, a two-seater for urban commuting, that is under development with SMH. Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, claims that the group's traditional customers are on the move into new markets, and the executive and luxury carmaker must be there to meet them. Referring to the plan to create the so-called 'Swatchmobile' he says boldly: 'We intend to create a market segment which has hitherto not existed in this form yet provides substantial growth potential . . . The micro compact car is ideally suitable to re-define urban mobility.' Mr Werner expects to decide by the end of the year on the location of the first assembly plant for the minicar in Europe, which is likely to have a capacity to produce about 130,000 cars a year with a workforce of only 1,000 to 1,200. Output is scheduled to begin in 1997. The engineering and manufacturing strategies for the minicar will break new ground for Mercedes-Benz with the extensive use of outside automotive engineering consultancies and 70 to 80 per cent of the components purchased from outside components. The Mercedes-Benz transformation is not being achieved without pain, although the car operations have broken back into profit this year after last year's heavy losses. The recovery this year has been helped by severe measures to cut costs and jobs, to boost productivity and to rationalise operations, but it has also been supported by an improvement in Mercedes-Benz's car sales and the successful launch a year ago of the new C-Class executive car range. Car production in the first half of the year jumped by 44.3 per cent to 302,076, while car sales volumes increased by 40.3 per cent to 296,770 and turnover rose by 22.8 per cent to DM21.2bn. The new projects under development are expected to increase Mercedes-Benz car production to around 1m units a year by the end of the decade according to Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Daimler-Benz group management board. Mercedes-Benz is planning to increase the share of its car production outside Germany to 10 per cent in the medium-term from only 2 per cent at present with production growing in countries such as the US, Mexico, South Korea and India. With the marketplace fragmenting BMW, too, has accepted that it must move into new segments to add to its niche of high-performance executive and luxury cars. It could have continued to go it alone and develop the necessary products itself, but that would have taken time and would have been much more expensive. Instead, it has chosen the riskier fast track of acquisition. It believes that with Rover it has also found a viable way of entering the small car market without diluting its own precious brand image. Rover is to be its centre for small car development. 'You must not over-stretch the core brand values of BMW. A small BMW would not comply with the hard core BMW image, that we have worked for 20 years to achieve,' says Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW management board chairman. Mercedes-Benz and BMW are both striking out in bold new directions, but they have chosen very different routes to enter the small car market. 'I told Werner he was wrong,' Mr Pischetsrieder said earlier this year. 'Clearly he does not think so.'</p>

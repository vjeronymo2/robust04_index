			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television The BBC continues to dominate the younger sector of the comedy market. From today their three-deep Thursday night line-up begins with Dawn French in a new series of Murder Most Horrid (9.00 BBC2). I was not the greatest fan of the first series, though French can be very funny. That is followed by Absolutely Fabulous written by her partner, Jennifer Saunders, who also stars as the awful fashion PRO, Edina (9.30 BBC1). Then comes Ben Elton with his frenetic stand-up routine in The Man From Auntie (10.00 BBC1). In preparation for a new series about one of television's most memorable characters, steeplejack Fred Dibnah, BBC2 repeats the 1987 programme A Year With Fred (8.00). Channel 4 screens the second episode of Phil Agland's series about life in a Chinese city, Beyond The clouds (9.00) and then begins a serial adaptation of Joanna Trollope's best selling novel The Rector's Wife. Lindsay Duncan plays the title role in a story which is like a cross between a novel by the author's namesake and ancestor, Anthony Trollope, and 'The Archers' (10.00).</p>

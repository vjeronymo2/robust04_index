Malafeyev; UDC 621.039.526]    [Abstract] The operation of fast neutron reactors and the  associated accumulation of spent fuel presents several problems  in the reprocessing of the fuel. Some of the main problems are  the high activity of the working solutions, and the possibility  of the formation of a second organic phase during extraction  reprocessing due to the high concentrations of plutonium against  a background of significant quantities of uranyl nitrate. A  previously presented process is unique in that it combines  uranium-plutonium extraction at a high temperature (55 C)  and up to 2 grams/liter and 20 mg/liter, respectively, of  uranium and plutonium throw off. Full saturation of the  extractant and a high temperature provide high efficiency in  separation from splintered elements. However, the process was  presented as a general plan only and a technological layout and  working conditions are lacking. In the present work results are  presented on the mathematical modeling of a single cycle scheme  for extraction refining of spent nuclear fuel from fast neutron  reactors with simultaneous extraction of uranium and plutonium  at high temperature. An optimum configuration with stable  operating conditions was found. The possibility of automating  the process was demonstrated. Figure 1; references 5: 2 Russian,  3 Western.</p>

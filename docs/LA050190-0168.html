			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PRESIDENT WILL MEET WITH LITHUANIA PRIME MINISTER  </P> <P> President Bush will meet on Thursday at the White House with Lithuanian Prime  Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, the White House announced today.  </P> <P> She is visiting the United States on a "private visit" and the President's  decision to meet with her does not change the U.S. policy of not recognizing  the rebellious Baltic republic, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater  said.  </P> <P> Still, the session represents Bush's first meeting with an elected Lithuanian  official since that nation declared its independence from the Soviet Union last  March 11.  </P> <P> "She's here, she's in the country. She can give us a firsthand account of  what's happening there, what their attitude is, what the status of the  embargoes are, what's the impact of the current situation, the pressures being  put on them," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> He called it "a rare opportunity to get a firsthand analysis of the situation."  </P> <P> Although the United States has never formally recognized the 1940 incorporation  of Lithuania and the other Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia into the Soviet  Union, it has not formally recognized its newly asserted independence.  </P> <P> Instead, Bush has urged Lithuanian and Kremlin officials to work out their  differences peacefully.  </P> <P> He has also held off on imposing any economic sanctions against the Soviet  Union, saying he remains hopeful for a settlement of the crisis.  </P> <P> Fitzwater, asked how Bush will address Prunskiene during her visit, said the  President will probably call her "prime minister," since that's her title in  Lithuania.  </P> <P> However, he said, the name the President calls her by does not alter U.S.  policy.  </P></p>

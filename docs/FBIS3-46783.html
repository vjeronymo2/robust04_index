Korea will become a committee member in 1996, when  negotiations for opening the world maritime market wrap up,  according to KMPA officials.    KMPA will hold a public hearing either next month or March  with maritime-related organizations, including the Korea  Shipowners' Association, to collect opinions from businesses and  research institutes, and establish an OECD maritime information  center at the Korea Maritime Institute to gather information.    Joining the committee will enable the government to  coordinate its maritime policy with major maritime countries and  considerably reduce friction with them.    The government will be able to apply pressure through the  committee on countries with protectionist policies, enhancing  the international competitiveness of the Korean maritime  industry, the officials said. However, Korea will experience  various difficulties following the joining.    The government will have to repeal protectionist systems,  including obligatory use of Korean freighters for designated  cargoes, ahead of schedule and allow foreign advances into the  domestic maritime transportation sector.    The OECD Maritime Transport Committee was established in  1961  to contribute to promoting international trade through free and  fair sea transportation, and 24 countries, including the United  States, Japan, Britain and New Zealand, have joined the  committee so far.</p>

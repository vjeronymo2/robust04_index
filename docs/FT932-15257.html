			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Dust settles after turmoil at Placer Dome - The mining group's new chief will focus on gold and copper SCARS are only just beginning to heal at Placer Dome, Canada's biggest gold mining group, after a boardroom battle that kept the Canadian financial community enthralled for months. It resulted in the departure of several long-serving directors - including Mr Tony Petrina, formerly the president and chief executive, and Mr Peter Crossgrove, a vice-chairman who for some time seemed likely to succeed him. There is also an injection of new blood. After a worldwide search, Mr John Willson has been recruited from a smaller gold company, Pegasus, to be chief executive. The turmoil at Placer started in February last year when the group announced write-downs totalling CDollars 328m (USDollars 260.7m) after tax - including the entire CDollars 266m investment in the Mount Milligan copper-gold venture in British Columbia, acquired in 1990. This seems to have been a catalyst which brought simmering personal conflicts to the boil. Analysts had warned of trouble ahead when Placer was formed in 1987 by a three-way merger between Placer Development, Dome Mines and Campbell Red Lake Mines. The merger was welcomed as bringing together some of the best gold mining properties in North America and the South Pacific. Nevertheless, some wondered why Placer, a fast-growing, Vancouver-based group with mines in Australia and Papua New Guinea, would want to join with two rather conservatively-managed Toronto companies. Placer, it seemed, believed it was a takeover target. Among those mentioned as potential aggressors was Mr Bob Needham, who once headed Placer's Australian operations and is today advising the government of Papua New Guinea on minerals policies. Mr Needham and New Zealand entrepreneur Mr Bruce Judge were thought to be stalking Placer. The friendly Canadian merger went ahead, but London brokers in particular raised doubts about the wisdom of running three such different companies simultaneously from Toronto and Vancouver. Nevertheless, the new Placer group seemed to be coping even though, as Mr Crossgrove said recently, 'it remained an unsettled mix of two diverse corporate cultures'. Then came the Mount Milligan writedowns, coupled with the news that CDollars 50m of the CDollars 106m carrying value of Placer's investment in the Eskay Creek gold project in British Columbia, another interest acquired in 1990, would be written down. Placer said a mine at Mount Milligan would produce a positive return but not enough to justify the CDollars 500m to CDollars 600m required to develop it. At the Placer annual meeting, Mr Petrina told shareholders: 'Let me be blunt. We should have taken more time to develop more information on which to make the decision (about Mount Milligan). We relied too heavily on analysis that did not go far enough. It must not happen again.' The Placer board obviously felt the same way. Last May, Mr Crossgrove, 55, a board member and president of Itco Properties, was appointed to a new position of vice-chairman and sent from Toronto to Vancouver, where Mr Petrina had his base, to head the company's mergers and acquisition activities. Placer said he would 'complement the strengths of the president, Tony Petrina'. Instead, according to insiders, it led to a row about executive responsibility because Mr Crossgrove was to report directly to the board, not to Mr Petrina. This led to the resignation of Mr Petrina, seen by the investment community as a skilled mine operator, who had been 32 years with Placer and its predecessor. He announced on June 14 that he would step down in September, but would stay on the board. Mr Crossgrove stepped in as acting chief executive and quickly gained a reputation as the man most likely to repair the group's reputation. He seemed to be a front-runner to succeed Mr Petrina, or perhaps take over when the chairman, Mr Fraser Fell, 64, retired. Mr Crossgrove was soon claiming there had been a change of culture at the company, a change that emphasised teamwork and shareholder value. He said he had redefined Placer's growth strategy and ended the private fiefdoms within the group that caused managers to work at cross-purposes. Growing in confidence, he criticised Mr Petrina's management style during a newspaper interview in a way that upset many other members of the Placer board. 'This left him at odds with so many people it was obvious it would be best for him to leave,' one insider recalls. So Placer turned to Mr Willson, a British-born, 52-year-old mining engineer, who in three years as president of Pegasus was credited with turning the low-cost gold producer into a stock market high-flyer. He took over at Placer in January as chief executive of a group with interests in 17 gold mines in five countries, USDollars 500m of cash in the bank, virtually no debt, and a market value of more than USDollars 2bn. Placer last year produced a record 2.3m troy ounces of gold and generated net profit of USDollars 111m on revenues of Dollars 1.1bn. It reported that production costs had been cut by 17 per cent to Dollars 186 an ounce, making it one of the lowest-cost producers among the big gold groups. In spite of the increase in gold output, Placer's reserves rose from 16.8m to 18.4m ounces. The group also has a new non-executive chairman based in Toronto: Mr Robert Franklin, 46, president of Signalta Capital Corporation and a director of Placer and, previously, Campbell Red Lake. Analysts suggest the Placer board has been envious of the high market rating given by investors to its rival Canadian gold group, American Barrick Resources, and will want Mr Willson to ensure the share price is maximised. This calls into question Placer's recent strategic move into base metals mining. How far should diversification go? The most important step so far has been its purchase of half the Zaldivar copper deposit in Chile for Dollars 100m (Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group, owns the rest). Placer will spend about Dollars 400m over four years to develop the project, which is expected to have a life of 50 years. It is scheduled to produce about 200m lbs of copper annually at a cost of less than 50 cents a lb. Mr Willson says Placer is engaged in a 'pragmatic, intelligent, internal debate' to determine the group's approach to copper investment. 'With gold prices drifting down we must be in a position to show good earnings from elsewhere. Copper and gold is fine. But spread the company's interests too widely and you are in danger of losing the high value the market puts on gold companies. If you want to be the best you must focus, concentrate, and devote most of your energies to your focus.' And what of the Mount Milligan project that proved such a catalyst for change at Placer? Mr Willson says: 'The solution to Mount Milligan is higher copper and gold prices. It is getting low priority but we are still working on it.'</p>

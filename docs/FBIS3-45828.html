Some 30 civil airports, which will cost more than 20 billion  yuan in all, are now either being built, or soon to start  building, in central China's Henan, Hubei and Hunan provinces  and south China's Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan.    Seven of them will become operational this year or next.    Nine other airports have been built in central and south  China since the country started to carry out the policy of  opening up and reform in the late 1970s.    In addition, military-turned-civil airports were enlarged to  alleviate the pressure on the Chinese aviation industry.    These changes are due to reforms of the investment system  concerning airport construction.    In all the airports, local funds account for the bulk of the  investment, which used to be entirely provided by the central  government. Local authorities managed to collect construction  funds through land leasing, shareholding system, overseas funds  and international loans.    To date, 25 civil airports are operational in central and  south China, with 137 international and domestic air routes.  About half of the 24 Chinese cities which have opened air  routes to Hong Kong are located in the region.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WIRETAP TRANSCRIPTS INDICATE PETE ROSE LIED  </P> <P> Transcripts of a Massachusetts police telephone wiretap indicate that Pete Rose  lied to baseball investigators when he said he did not know that a  Massachusetts individual was a bookmaker, according to a published report.  </P> <P> A Nov. 12, 1984, conversation between Joseph S. Cambra and Manuel Fernandez  indicates that Rose wanted to bet every day, according to a report in today's  editions of the Boston Globe.  </P> <P> According to the paper, the transcript indicates that Cambra told Rose that he  would not accept bets more than once a week. The transcript was made a day  before Cambra, Fernandez and 41 others were arrested in gambling raids in  southeastern Massachusetts.  </P> <P> Last April, Rose told baseball investigator John M. Dowd that "he did not know  Cambra was a bookmaker," according to a Dowd deposition.  </P> <P> "Rose denied ever betting with Cambra," Dowd said in the deposition.  </P></p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Snow threat to 1m NZ sheep HUNDREDS of volunteers, supported by the New Zealand air force and army, are mounting a big exercise to help farmers save more than 1m sheep, 10,000 cattle and thousands of farmed deer which have been caught in freak snow drifts blanketing much of the central part of the South Island. However the snow, said to be the worst since 1946, promises a break in the power crisis, caused by a drought, which has led to concern about possible job lay-offs. The drought has caused nationwide power cuts, with Comalco, the aluminium producer, shutting down a third of its giant smelter at Bluff, on the southern tip of the South Island. State-owned Electricorp says that provided consumers take care, there should now be sufficient water in the lakes that supply the hydroelectric stations to see the country through the winter months. With no thaw in sight, the snow threatens the sheep, cattle and deer, most of which are breeding stock, and the livelihood of farmers. Canterbury, the worst affected province, is a centre of New Zealand's sheep industry, and farmers say they expect a disastrous lambing season. Air force helicopters are flying volunteers into mountainous areas to help muster the animals and provide them with hay. Sheep are suffocating as they try to stand on one another's backs in the four- to six-foot drifts, and cattle are dying of thirst, because they appear unable to take moisture from the snow. Farmers have been told they will not get government assistance for the stock losses.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Further Gibraltar talks planned THE first Anglo-Spanish ministerial meeting in two years on the future status of Gibraltar ended yesterday without significant progress. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary said 'difficulties remain but we have charted a possible way forward.' Mr Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, said: 'We have taken a small step but one in the right direction.' Officials from the two countries are to hold further talks in the coming months in the hope of arranging another ministerial meeting before the end of the year. Summing up yesterday's events, Mr Hurd said: 'We have been talking essentially about procedures for possible talks about matters of substance in the future.' At the centre of the Gibraltar dispute lies Spain's claim of sovereignty over the three-mile long peninsula that lies at its southern tip, and Britain's commitment to stand by the enduring opposition among the colony's 20,000 inhabitants to any deal with Spain. Mr Solana restated his policy mix of 'persuasion and pressure' which aims at waking Gibraltarians up to the realisation that 'their best interests lie in the normalisation of the situation' - this being Madrid's code for progress towards returning the Rock to Spain.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Lawsuits make US groups publicity-shy - Patrick Harverson examines the background to a trend in corporate self-defence US companies are becoming increasingly reluctant to keep investors fully informed of their prospects because of the threat of costly legal action. The threat comes in the shape of class-action securities fraud lawsuits filed by shareholders aggrieved that the value of their stock fell when information proved inaccurate, and the increasing number of these suits has caught the eye of the regulators. A study released last week by the American Stock Exchange found that more than 75 per cent of the companies surveyed said they had been forced to curtail the amount of information they provided to investors because of concern over lawsuits. Companies which cut back on information to investors often do so following legal advice. Mr Bob Profusek, head of the corporate department at the law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, says: 'Most lawyers now discourage companies from making anything like traditional projections.' Fighting class-action lawsuits can also cost companies a lot of money. The National Economic Research Association says the average cost of settling such lawsuits has risen in the past three years from Dollars 5.8m to Dollars 7.4m. Securities Class Action Alert, a New Jersey-based newsletter, recently estimated that companies paid Dollars 1.55bn last year to settle shareholder lawsuits, compared with just Dollars 324m in 1988. Although any company can be the target of a shareholder lawsuit, high-tech and biotechnology companies are particular vulnerable because they need to keep investors constantly updated on technological development, patents and product innovations. In addition, young, smaller companies are especially at risk, because their shares are more likely to fall sharply on disappointing financial news, and because they are more likely to settle rather than fight lawsuits. In California, where there is a concentration of high-tech industry, shareholder lawsuits filed under Section 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Act - relating to false or misleading information - are particularly common. According to the Coalition to Eliminate Abusive Securities Suits (CEASS), a business pressure group, Californian companies paid out a total of Dollars 502m between 1990 and 1993 to settle 10b-5 lawsuits. Public companies are not the only ones affected by such suits. Take the case of Mr Bob Gilbertson, chief executive of CMX Systems, a small but fast-growing Connecticut high-tech company eager to raise funds on the public markets. Mr Gilbertson says he was recently advised by investment banking firms that if he took the firm public, he would have to allocate at least Dollars 2m of the flotation proceeds to cover the almost certain possibility of having to settle a shareholder lawsuit within 12 to 18 months. He says: 'The investment bankers effectively told us to write Dollars 2m off to pay the lawyers to go away.' Mr Gilbertson decided against taking the company public. Many chief executives on the wrong end of class-action lawsuits do not blame the shareholders so much as the lawyers, who know they can force companies to settle quickly. In the ASE study, a clear majority of the 17 per cent of the companies which said they had been sued during the past five years on disclosure issues settled out of court rather than fight the suit. Ms Lynn Zempel, a spokeswoman for CEASS, says: 'Companies say that most of the time their lawyers tell them its cheaper to settle than fight, and (the shareholders') lawyers know that.' The financial incentive for the lawyers is considerable: the ASE survey found that nationally, the plaintiffs lawyers receive 30 cents for every dollar sought in these lawsuits, compared with just six cents for every dollar the shareholders themselves receive. But the growing instances of shareholder lawsuits has attracted the attention of regulators and legislators. The Securities and Exchange Commission, concerned that companies may be shying away from fuller disclosure because of the lawsuits, is considering bolstering the 'safe harbour' provision of US securities law. The provision protects companies from fraud claims unless the information they release is 'without a reasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith'. In recent years, however, companies claim the safe harbour provision has not been working effectively. Its weakness is that companies usually have to go through an expensive and time-consuming pre-trial process before a judge rules on whether the information is protected by safe harbour. Consequently, companies can rack up huge legal fees even if the lawsuits are ultimately dismissed. While the SEC does not want to deter shareholders from seeking legal redress if they genuinely believe they have been deceived, it is keen to ensure the system is quick to weed out meritless cases. Ms Linda Quinn, director of the SEC's corporation finance division, says: 'We're exploring what can be done so that the type of information intended to be covered by safe harbour is covered, and that the safe harbour works to the benefit of companies. 'Right now, what they will argue is that even if the information is ultimately decided to be within the safe harbour (provision), you have to litigate through an entire case to get there. The question is: are there ways to make the rule work so that it could be decided earlier in the case?' While the SEC reviews the safe harbour provision, legislators in Washington DC are also seeking ways to give companies more protection. Bills which would give companies greater help in their defences against frivolous shareholder lawsuits have been tabled in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The bills include measures to allow judges to make quicker decisions on the merits of individual cases, to halt the use of 'professional plaintiffs' with only nominal shareholdings and to cut attorney's fees. Introducing any legislation that protects corporate defendants from lawyers is always going to be an uphill task in the US, however, and securities lawyers have vowed to fight the Dodd bill. They claim shareholders need all the protection they can get from deceptive companies.</p>

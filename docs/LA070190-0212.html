			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GAMES ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GOALKEEPER THOMPSON LEADS ROYAL INTO SOCCER FINAL AGAINST ORANGE  </P> <P> Royal High soccer Coach Peter Schraml said he was "a bit nervous" when starting  goalkeeper Steven Hambly set out for an Olympic development soccer camp at  Stanford University, leaving the Highlander skipper with incoming freshman  Brent Thompson to tend the cages.  </P> <P> Any doubts about Thompson's ability vanished when he and Royal posted  consecutive shutouts in the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds of the L.A. Games  on Saturday at El Camino College.  </P> <P> Thompson made one save in a 3-0 quarterfinal win over North Torrance and had  three stops against Bell Gardens to help spark a 2-0 semifinal victory.  </P> <P> "I was a bit nervous because I hadn't seen Brent play at all," Schraml said.  "He practiced with us in one practice before the tournament. It seemed to work  out well."  </P> <P> Thompson also kept alive Royal's perfect defensive record in the 64-team  tournament. The Highlanders have not allowed a goal in five matches.  </P> <P> In today's final Royal will meet Orange, which defeated Pasadena Muir, 3-2, in  a semifinal shootout. The championship at El Camino College will be a rematch  of the 1989 title game, which ended in a 1-1 tie.  </P> <P> "They're a very skillful team," Schraml said of Orange, which won the Southern  Section 2-A Division title last year.  </P> <P> Forward Dan Morris led Royal's attack Saturday, scoring twice against North  Torrance and once against Bell Gardens.  </P> <P> Midfielder Troy Burley and forward Ryan Campbell also added goals for Royal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD  </P> <P> Howard Schrier of Birmingham High cleared 13 feet 8 inches to win the pole  vault at El Camino College.  </P> <P> Schrier's mark was just off his personal best of 14-0.  </P> <P> Bobby Wiley of Monroe and Robin Heidt of Canyon posted comfortable wins in  their 1,500-meter finals. Wiley timed 4 minutes 23.3 seconds. Heidt ran away  from Locke's Brenda Stewart.  </P></p>

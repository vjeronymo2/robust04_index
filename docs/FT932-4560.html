			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Turkish economy minister quits TURKEY'S economy minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, resigned yesterday, freeing her to stand as a candidate to become Turkey's new prime minster at a convention of the conservative True Path party (DYP) on Sunday. Mrs Ciller, a 47-year-old former Istanbul economics professor - famous for having forced her husband to assume her maiden name - is one of the leading candidates seeking to be elected chairman of the DYP. Whether she wins or not, Turkey will now have to choose a new economy minister as Mrs Ciller's office made clear yesterday that she would not return to the cabinet if unsuccessful in Sunday's poll of 1,154 DYP delegates. President Suleyman Demirel has declined to interfere in the election, although his old party colleague Mr Ismet Sezgin, interior minister, is also expected to announce his candidacy. Education minister, Mr Koksal Toptan, may join the contest. Whoever emerges winner will have to reforge the coalition with the Social Democratic Populists in the wake of the shock announcement on Monday that Prof Erdal Inonu, the SHP leader and current caretaker prime minister, would stand down in September. An academic economist, Mrs Ciller has had a brief if chequered political career since becoming the coalition's economics minister in November 1991. She has been criticised for continual sparring with Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, central bank governor and a key figure in the economic reforms of the 1980s and one of the few senior bureaucrats to survive the change of government. Her anti-inflation policy has centred on bringing down interest rates, which she blames for the persistently large public sector deficits. The inflation rate for May increased to 4.7 per cent from 4.4 in April. For all that, Mrs Ciller is doing well in the polls which suggest she is leading candidate for party leader, while Mr Sezgin, her main rival, has slipped up after being held responsible for the killing by Kurdish rebels of 35 army conscripts near Bingol last month. Mrs Ciller was elected a member of the party general assembly in 1990 and entered parliament for the first time in 1991. She once claimed she polled more votes than Mr Demirel, whose accession to the presidency created the current contest.</p>

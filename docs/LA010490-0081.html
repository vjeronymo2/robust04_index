			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> VACANT REDONDO RIGHT OF WAY A STEP CLOSER TO BECOMING PARK  </P> <P> Despite continued resistance from commuters who believe Redondo Beach needs  more roads, the Lilienthal right of way -- once considered as a potential  street -- moved a step closer this week to becoming a neighborhood park.  </P> <P> On the recommendation of the city's Recreation and Parks Commission, the City  Council approved plans to install a bike lane, sandbox, restrooms and grassy  slopes on the vacant lot between the end of Lilienthal Lane and the beginning  of Anza Avenue at 190th Street.  </P> <P> The $200,000 project, expected to take three months to complete, will break  ground this summer. Initially, the 1.5-acre park site was acquired by the city  as a right of way for a street that would link Anza Avenue to the smaller  residential streets north of 190th Street.  </P> <P> That latter plan still has some supporters, who persisted Tuesday night in  their attempts to persuade the council to make the vacant lot into a street.  </P> <P> Pat Jackson, who lives on nearby Rindge Lane, argued that a new thoroughfare  would be the only way to funnel commuter traffic away from his congested  residential street, and Richard Houser, who also lives near -- but not on --  Lilienthal Lane, accused the city council of being "park-happy."  </P> <P> But another longstanding park opponent, Councilman Terry Ward, said Tuesday he  had changed his mind and now supports a park there. Ward said he has been  convinced that a new road in the area would only encourage out-of-town  commuters to continue short-cutting through the narrow and already gridlocked  neighborhoods of North Redondo Beach on their way to work at TRW.  </P></p>

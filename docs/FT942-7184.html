			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Poseidon Gold plans Aztec asset transfer Poseidon Gold, the Adelaide-based metals group which earlier this year won a ADollars 287m (USDollars 211.15) bid battle for Aztec Mining, is proposing to transfer two of Aztec's assets to Normandy Poseidon, Posgold's parent, in exchange for ADollars 62.5m in cash, writes Nikki Tait. The assets involved are a 20 per cent interest in the Golden Grove joint venture project, and full ownership of the Woodcutters zinc mine, south of Darwin. Posgold had said it was putting the assets up for auction, but yesterday announced no outside bidders had emerged for Golden Grove and only one other interested buyer of Woodcutters.</p>

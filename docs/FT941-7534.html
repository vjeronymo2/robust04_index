			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Nice benefits, whatabout the borders: Andrew Adonis asks if the performance of the UK telecoms industry offers an example for other countries Britain is Europe's telecommunications laboratory. For the past decade it has pioneered policies of privatising and promoting competition far in advance of the rest of the European Union. Even US companies, generally considered to have more advanced telecoms systems, regard it as a test bed for new services they may introduce back home. Other EU states - most immediately Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany - are embarking on telecoms privatisations. Deregulation is also advancing across Europe; competition between providers of basic voice services will be allowed by 1998 in most EU states. A sound assessment of the UK's experience is therefore important. That makes a government-sponsored study of the international competitiveness of UK telecoms infrastructure, published this week, essential reading. The study, prepared by Mr Robert Harrison of the London-based PA Consulting Group, is not an unqualified paean of praise, though some of the shortcomings it identifies are as much Europe-wide as British. Its findings have significant implications, however, for other countries going down the UK route. Overall, the report ranks UK telecoms performance 'consistently a good second', often to the US. It does not put the UK out in front in any field. But that may be unfair in the case of regulation, given the UK government's innovative decision to license combined cable TV and telephone operators, a move which has demonstrated the economies available from dual provision and stimulated competition in a field - the local network - previously regarded as a natural monopoly. The US looks set to proceed down a similar road, and several US Baby Bell companies will be able to apply back home the experience they have gained investing a total of nearly Pounds 5bn in urban cable networks in the UK. Britain also scores well in the areas of network investment and mobile communications. In cash terms its network investment for 1990 is ranked behind the US, Japan and Germany but, after adjustments for differences in equipment prices paid by different operators, the UK's investment per line ranks second only to the US. UK network operators boast open procurement policies. In any case, all or part of the UK's largest domestic equipment suppliers have been sold to overseas companies in the last decade, weakening old ties. The implication is stark: the incestuous relationships between the state-owned European tele-coms operators and indigenous equipment suppliers are lead-ing operators to pay excessive prices for equipment. Similarly, in cellular communications, the UK policy of encouraging competition from the mid-1980s, and limiting the role played by BT, the former monopoly operator of fixed-wire services, has paid dividends. Penetration of cellular mobile services is far higher in the UK than in Germany, the Netherlands and France, although it still lags behind the Scandinavian countries. Looking ahead, how well placed is the UK in the race to realise in Europe the 'super-highway' vision of high-capacity networks, providing interactive entertainment and communications, trumpeted by Vice-President Al Gore in the US? Mr Gore is determined to leave the new networks' construction to the private sector. Telecoms companies appear to be responding: several Baby Bells have announced upgrading programmes in the past few months, aiming to replace copper wires with fibre in local networks. At least three of them - Nynex, US West and Bellsouth - are also undertaking commercial experiments with fibre connected not just to businesses, but to homes, schools and hospitals. In the UK, BT has until now appeared keener on spending sprees abroad than on upgrading its network at home - witness its Dollars 5.3bn splash last year on a stake in MCI, the second-largest US long-distance carrier, while its UK investment was bottoming out. BT has claimed that a government ban on it providing entertainment services over its own network until at least 2001 made it uneconomic to lay fibre in the local network. Some observers feared that the government was promoting competition in basic telephony at the expense of network modernisation. However, Mr Alan Rudge, BT's director of development and procurement, indicated yesterday that BT might be on the verge of launching a massive programme to extend fibre to the local network. BT is coming to recognise that its future depends on developing a high-capacity network akin to that envisaged in the US. If it goes forward, it will be the largest network investment programme since digitalisation, and will make Britain one of the first European states to go fully down the local fibre route. 'It's all about timescale: we might even take fibre right into the home,' said Mr Rudge. If consumers are ever to use the new 'super-highways', operators will not only have to invest in new networks, but make the services affordable. Unfortunately, the DTI study gives only cursory attention to the crucial area of pricing and the impact of competition in driving down margins that have historically been kept high in many countries, as a surrogate form of national taxation. One study cited in the report suggests that in 1992 BT charged higher residential prices than six other large national operators (see graph), while its business prices were significantly lower than those of France, Germany, Japan and the US. However, a 1993 survey, comparing calls of set distances and charge bands between the seven countries, shows BT in a more favourable light, although still more expensive than the Netherlands, Sweden and the US. The comparisons, though tentative, lend weight to the argument that competition has driven down prices. Significantly, until recently competition in the UK centred almost exclusively on the business market: Mercury, BT's sole rival until the abolition of the post-privatisation duopoly in 1991, has about two-thirds of the City of London's outgoing long-distance telecoms traffic, but has only just started pitching seriously for large-scale residential traffic. It has taken Mercury nearly a decade to take a 10 per cent market share in the UK telecoms market. Compared with new competitors in US, Australia and New Zealand, its progress has been glacial. Differences in national regulation may account for Mercury's slow development, but the effect has been to allow BT to safeguard its margins and profits, checked only by a price cap set by Oftel, the regulator. A telling comparison can be made between BT's pricing policy and that of New Zealand Telecom, forced into aggressive, almost weekly price-cutting last summer and autumn to fend off a new competitor, Clear Communications, which had gained an 18 per cent share of the long-distance market in barely two years. However, competition in Britain can achieve only so much on its own. The DTI highlights two areas where European prices are uncompetitive compared with the US. First, on leased lines. The differential between internal long-distance and cross-border public call charges has been a long-standing grievance. But it applies also to leased lines, critical to the business market. According to the DTI study, a leased line between France and Germany costs nearly twice as much as the same line leased within either of the two countries, and about 16 times as much as a 200km leased line in the US. Second, the cost of very high bandwidth leased lines - capable of carrying far greater telecoms volumes - is equally distorted. In Germany, the costs of such leased circuits can be five times as much as in the US. Mr Harrison, the report's author, said: 'This difference in tariffing policy between the US and other countries means that users in the US tend to regard bandwidth as a commodity, and face a far lower cost penalty in experimenting with broadband applications.' Though benefits from liberalisation in Britain appear considerable, and may give the country a competitive edge in the EU, a clear lesson from this week's study is the limitations of liberalisation in one country. To maintain a competitive edge against the US in telecoms, England's borders must extend to the Rhine.</p>

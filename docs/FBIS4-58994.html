			<p>BFN     [Text] India has expressed its desire to develop closer and  stronger bilateral relations with Israel and Palestine. This  view was expressed in separate meetings the vice president, Mr.  K.R. Narayanan, had with the Israeli president, Mr. Weizman, and  the PLO chief, Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, in Johannesburg yesterday.    In his meeting with Mr. 'Arafat, Mr. Narayanan offered  India's support in the reconstruction and development of  Palestine after the situation settles down in the region. India  has already pledged $1 million in kind during the international  donors meeting in Cairo.

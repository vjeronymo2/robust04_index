			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Chief Abiola disappeared  yesterday while under house arrest and the police are looking  for him. Well, Fred Eno is a personal assistant to Chief Abiola  and was with him when he gave security personnel, who had  surrounded his house, the slip. On a mobile phone to Lagos,  Mustapha Ibrahim asked Fred Eno how Chief Abiola had made his  escape.    [Begin recording] [Eno] Well, they (?surrounded) the more  obvious entries and exits of his house, but there are several  other exits which apparently there was policeman there, so we  used it. [sentence as heard]    [Ibrahim] Now, what sort of vehicles did you use when you  left the house to go to your destination?    [Eno] We used one of his cars, a private car.    [Ibrahim] Where did the chief go next?    [Eno] He went straight to the venue where he made his  declaration.    [Ibrahim] Where was this venue? Was it in Lagos or somewhere  outside Lagos?    [Eno] Yes, it was on Lagos Island. It was at the Eleganza  Plaza, at the sports center, and this was done at the back [word  indistinct] yesterday in the evening.    [Ibrahim] Now, at that time of the night how was it possible  that there were people at such a lonely place.    [Eno] We are used to that. We used to campaign during the  whole night during campaigns. We used to campaign at 10, 11, 12  o'clock at night, so I don't think there is a problem getting  people there. Chief Abiola is not any other name in Nigeria....    [Ibrahim, interrupting] How was the atmosphere? How many  people were there?    [Eno] Electric, electric. By the time we got there the place  was crowded and by the time word got out to... [pauses] There  are markets and other place around there, so everybody in the  market abandoned their wares and trooped down to the venue.    [Ibrahim] What exactly did he say in his speech.?    [Eno] It is an eight-page statement. I cannot release all of  it to you right now, but I think he made the pertinent point in  which he declared himself the president, considering his victory  in the 1993 election and all the other democratic structures,  particularly the Senate, which is going to reconvene and then  consider his cabinet list, which still remains confidential.    [Ibrahim] So after this declaration, he left?    [Eno] Oh yes, we didn't stay there. We left....    [Ibrahim, interrupting] And where is he now?    [Eno] And went back home, his home.    [Ibrahim] You came back to his home, but where is Chief  Abiola himself?    [Eno] He is having meetings with other colleagues of his at  different venues.    [Ibrahim] It is being alleged that Chief M.K.O. Abiola is  hiding at one of the Western embassies and that he is going to  seek recognition from these other countries.    [Eno] I will suggest you check that because it is not  correct.    [Ibrahim] A price has been put on the chief's head. He has  been declared wanted by the police, is he not going to give  himself up?    [Eno] That is an abuse on the Nigerian people. You don't put  a prize to somebody they elected to be their president. We have  a due process in which he is going to take an oath of office,  where he will be sworn in [word indistinct] a declaration  accepting the mandate and considering himself the legitimate  winner of the elections and the president of the Federal  Republic of Nigeria. I don't think there is any controversy in  that.    [Ibrahim] When is this going to take place?    [Eno] When the democratic structures go to ratify the entire  process I will give you a program.

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADIO REALITY  </P> <P> Mourning the death of KEDG, Carolina P. Briones lashes out at "myopic  capitalistic greed" (Letters, May 21). I have a suggestion: Let her take out a  license, buy a building, fill it with a transmitter and other electronic  equipment, buy the records she likes, hire a staff and go on the air.  </P> <P> I'll look forward to her next letter, in which she explains exactly how she  accomplished her first year of successful programming.  </P> <P> MERRILL E.

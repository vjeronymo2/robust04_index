			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Analysis by Panrutti Ramachandran, Tamil Nadu MLA (Member </F> of Legislative Assembly): "Election-Epilogue: The Victory of the  Common Man]    [Text] The world had expected that the elections in four  states in North India would usher in an important turning point.  The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] has been playing up Hindu  religious fundamentalism, spreading hatred against Muslims and  labelling theirs as the true nationalism, was said to be poised  for a great victory in these elections.    But only in Delhi and Rajasthan did the BJP come into power  with a narrow majority. But in the states of Himachal Pradesh,  Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the party was driven out of  power.    Now the BJP says, 'what if we are out of power? We have  secured a larger percentage of the votes. But they forget that  it was the same electoral system that elevated them to the seat  of power. The argument seems like a drowning man clinging on to  a straw.    The BJP aroused emotions among the people but did not  respect  truth at all. Emotions may flare up suddenly and also disappear  all of a sudden. It was by arousing religious sentiments that  they came into power so suddenly and in the same way lost it too.    It has been an accepted fact all over the world that  everybody is an equal to one another and that every person is  entitled to equal opportunity. The BJP failed to respect the  truth and proceeded to emphasize differences and neglected to  concentrate on vitally basic issues like poverty, joblessness,  soaring prices of essential goods and this, in fact, brought  about the downfall of the party.    Janata Dal stands for social justice. This party had made  sacrifices for that cause. Mulayam Singh Yadav when he was Chief  Minister of Uttar Pradesh, mobilized the people to put up a  stiff fight against the BJP. He was ridiculed by the BJP which  called Maulana Mulayam Singh Yadav. As a result of these factors  the people of the state believed that the best alternative to  the BJP is Yadav's coalition and they elected his party to  govern the state. It is not enough to feel there is an  injustice. But one should stand up and fight against it and for  this cause undertake any kind of sacrifice. Only such kind of  people could command respect--this is the lesson learned from  these elections in Uttar Pradesh.    The Congress Party's victories in Madhya Pradesh and  Himachal  Pradesh are the result of the dissatisfaction among the voters  against the BJP ministries there.    The election results in these four states have shown, to put  it in a nutshell, that the true victory belongs not to any  party, but to the common man.    The Bharatiya Janata Party with its stand on Ayodhya issue  demolished the Babri Masjid and carried on a vigorous campaign  of hatred and the common man in Uttar Pradesh, searching for an  alternative leader, found the right person in Mulayam Singh  Yadav.    The BJP regimes in Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and  Rajasthan failed to solve the day-to-day problems of the common  folks and the common man decided to teach a lesson to the BJP.  If only the Congress had waged a vigorous campaign against the  BJP, it could have won more seats.    So far as the Janata Dal was concerned, it was a party  coming  out with good ideas. But it did not grow to be a party that  could be an alternative to form a ministry. The common man also  realized if he supported the Dal, votes against the BJP would be  scattered away. This factor was not realized by the Janata Dal.  Hence it met with defeat.    These election results convey loud and clear one message:  Whether a ruling party or a party that aspires to get into  power, in order to secure a majority of seats, the party should  instead of promoting politics of hatred, work hard in finding  solutions to the people's problems and improving their standard  of living.    The very fact that these election results demonstrated to  the  world at large that an Indian citizen is superior to their  political leaders, is a significant turning point in itself, is  it not?</p>

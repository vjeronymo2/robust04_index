			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Bank chief sees more cash needed for Palestinians INTERNATIONAL financial support for the West Bank and Gaza Strip could be as high as Dollars 2.5bn in the next five years, according to senior Israeli and World Bank officials Speaking on the eve of an international conference in Washington to co-ordinate support for the occupied territories, Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, said yesterday he believed the Palestinian regions could require about Dollars 500m annually over five years. Mr Jacob Frenkel, Israeli central bank governor, told the Financial Times that the territories' needs could be Dollars 400m-Dollars 450m a year in that period. Also, the international community needed to find a mechanism to inject resources into the territories in the short run, so as to provide support for the peace process, he said. These estimates mark a considerable increase in the medium-term, compared with earlier World Bank estimates of a Dollars 3bn financing required over 10 years. The scaling-up reflects the anticipated higher costs of absorbing refugees returning to the territories, as well as spending on new infrastructure and institutions. Mr Preston told a news conference that a World Bank mission will go to the territories next week to identify specific projects that need support. In the next two weeks, the bank's executive board will be asked to authorise a Dollars 50m two-year programme of concessional finance for the territories through the International Development Association (IDA), the bank's soft loan facility. The board will also be asked to approve Dollars 4m technical assistance over two years. Moves to bolster the economies of the territories shift into a higher gear today when officials from more than three dozen countries meet in Washington to pledge support to an international aid effort. It is understood that the US is prepared to provide Dollars 500m. The European Community has promised Dollars 600m over five years. Japan has said it will provide Dollars 200m over two years. Mr Frenkel said that Israel would also provide finance for the territories. Mr Preston yesterday said the World Bank was willing to take over co-ordination of the aid effort. However, there are legal problems to be overcome before bank funds can flow to the Palestinians. The World Bank can only lend to entities with a government guarantee. This rule would seem to exclude lending to the territories, but there are precedents for other countries guaranteeing loans. Some years ago, the bank lent to Papua New Guinea on the strength of an Australian government guarantee. Vietnam should obtain its first loan from the World Bank since 1978 in the course of this month. Mr Preston told a news conference at the end of this year's annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that the bank expects to make a Dollars 71m loan, as part of a total Dollars 350m lending programme to Vietnam this year.</p>

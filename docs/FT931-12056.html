			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Inflated expectations What a pity the government handled Tuesday's rate cut so badly. Lower interest rates and a cheaper currency are probably both necessary if growth is to be restored while the balance of payments remains in such large deficit. It looks increasingly as though a steeper yield curve and a lower pound are also needed to fund next year's PSBR. Only if the pound is seen to have room to appreciate will foreigners be inclined to buy gilts in any size. By springing the cut as a surprise in the middle of a gilts auction, though, the government seemed to have taken fright over the short-term course of the economy rather than to be implementing a carefully-planned strategy. This only adds to the sense that the end result will be inflation. Indeed, the prospect of lower rates and currency depreciation have left institutional investors feeling remarkably comfortable with equities. They see little incentive to switch to gilts. No wonder a rush of rights issues emerged this week. Presumably there are more to come. That may put a brake on further equity market advance, but the government appears as stuck with its funding dilemma as ever. Whichever way one cuts the figures, there seems no way the 1993-94 PSBR can be funded without a substantial inflow of foreign money and a much larger shift into gilts than domestic investors have hitherto been prepared to contemplate. A significantly weaker pound may be needed to produce the former. Given the perceived inflationary implications, sharply lower gilt prices may be needed to stimulate the latter. That could mean long yields closer to 10 per cent than 9.</p>

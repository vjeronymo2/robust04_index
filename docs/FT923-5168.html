			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (24): Waiting for 'big brother' Boeing - Japanese fear they may be frozen out of large new US and European projects JAPAN'S three leading aircraft producers are going flat out as partners responsible for about 21 per cent of Boeing's 777 programme and in co-developing the F-16-based FSX fighter with General Dynamics. But the executives at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries face big questions: what will their research and engineering staffs focus on once these development programmes wind down in 1995-96? how will they prepare for future partnerships with Boeing or European aircraft makers? The answers largely depend on the path Boeing takes. If Boeing seeks to develop a 600-plus seat super jumbojet, the Japanese will probably be pursued as key partners. However, should Boeing and Airbus pool their efforts after deciding athat two separate groups could not profitably build super jumbojets, Japan could be left without a suitor. Because any super jumbo will cost at least Dollars 10bn to develop, even Boeing-Airbus collaboration is not impossible. A 'fall back' plan for Japan is the 'YSX'. The proposed 50-100 seat jet has been discussed for a few years. So too has the so-called 'YXX', also known as the 7J7, a proposed 150-seater that Boeing decided not to develop few years ago due to marketing headaches. While the Boeing-led YXX-7J7 may still be built in some form, Japan's YSX appears to have more momentum, at least in Tokyo. If it is built, actual development will not begin before 1994-95, for an initial flight by 1999 or 2000. Already Japan Aircraft Development Corp. (JADC) has finished a first-phase feasibility study on the YSX, under funding from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), says Hideo Suzuki, deputy director of MITI's aircraft and ordnance division. JADC, which coordinates Japan's partnership with Boeing in the 777, is now conducting a follow-up study that examines detailed aspects of the YSX proposal. Officials at JADC suggest the aircraft could have relatively high-performance and contain up to about 130 seats. Or it could be a smaller, low-cost aircraft with economical operating costs that would be highly attractive to airlines. Of the two main possible configurations, the lower-cost model appears more in line with reality. Preliminary discussions with air lines - including Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways - have forced JADC to focus on the lower-cost version. Its main target markets are Japan, Asia and North America. Design is not the only variable. The YSX also involves partnership choices. Nobuyuki Fujita, senior YSX manager at JADC, says 'one of the fundamental policies of the YSX programme is international collaboration'. Japan could either develop the YSX with advanced European or American partners, or with Asian partners such as those from China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore or South Korea. Perhaps the most pragmatic reason for cooperating with Asian partners would be to keep down the price tag. Building it entirely at home would reflect Japan's astronomical labour costs. Japan could play the quasi-political role of benevolent programme coordinator, under a scheme that would enable Asian nations to sell more value-added aircraft components to Japan. But building the aircraft with Asian partners would result in more difficulties in getting US FAA type certification, Japanese aerospace specialists admit. They would also prefer to work with experienced European or US aerospace companies as they are not quite confident enough to lead a group of Asian aircraft makers. British Aerospace has already informally approached the Japanese on the idea of developing an aircraft about the same size as the YSX. As for the engine to power the YSX, studies are under way at Japan Aero Engines Corp. to examine choices. Japan Aero Engines is a consortium that coordinates the nation's work share for International Aero Engines' V2500 jet engine, led by Rolls Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney. The Japanese consortium comprises Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. A de-rated V2500 turbofan engine is one major possibility for the YSX. Additionally, Snecma of France made recent inquires about Japanese participation in a programme to build an engine for a 75-100 seat plane. What might come after the YSX? It could conceivably later lead to bigger and better Japanese aircraft, supported in part by the Japan Development Bank and other MITI affiliates. However, according to a MITI official, Japan has no intention to develop its own midsized and larger commercial aircraft, because it prefers partnerships with proven leaders. One thing is certain about the proposed YSX. Japan possesses the capabilities, both technical and financial, to develop it. Still, it would be a challenge to cultivate the required marketing expertise to sell it overseas. It may not be a profitable venture, but the YSX is technically feasible. Nevertheless, a ghost from the past haunts Japan's aircraft industry. It is the YS-11. Nihon Airplane Manufacturing Co., a special consortium, that produced the 64-seat YS-11 from the early 1960s through 1974. A total of 182 twin-turboprop YS-11s were made. But the programme lost money. Even MITI calls the YS-11 a failure. However, it did enable Japan's aircraft industry to nurture sufficient know-how to get an invitation as a major supplier for the Boeing 767 twinjet. Dozens of workhorse YS-11s are still flying in Japan, and they will soon need to be replaced. The YSX fits the bill. Japanese aircraft specialists realise they cannot just conduct studies on aircraft. Some type of commitment will have to be made soon. This is necessary because the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) estimates that aircraft production (including repairs) will decline 9.3 per cent to Yen 783bn in fiscal 1992, which started in April 1992. This projected decline is largely due to falling orders from the Japan Defence Agency, which account for about 75 per cent of the nation's aircraft business. Beyond the YSX proposal, SJAC is even investigating the idea of a supersonic transport. Much of this work centres on positioning Japan for an invitation to join an American or European supersonic aircraft programme a few years down the runway. Japan is setting its sights high. But those sights are not one notch higher than those of Boeing, its 'big brother'.</p>

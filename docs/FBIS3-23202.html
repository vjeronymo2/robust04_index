			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques Maurice Cler in Noumea: "New Caledonia: </F> Two Gun Caches Found in Noumea"]    [Text] Several dozen handguns, assault rifles, heavy  weapons, explosives, a large stockpile of various-caliber  ammunition, radio equipment -- all adding up to a veritable  arsenal fit for urban guerrilla warfare -- have been seized by  Noumea police. The seizures were made possible by searches  conducted as part of an investigation into the theft of a number  of passports in the premises of the General Regulation and  Administration Directorate (DIRAG) at the High Commission of the  Republic in New Caledonia.    In a communique, the state prosecutor said that the  operation  stemmed from the arrest, in France, of "two Caledonians in  possession of securities stolen in Noumea as well as forged  identity papers." Investigations revealed "the existence of two  caches supposedly containing merchandise of shady origin.  Investigators discovered the booty of several burglaries  committed in the territory."    Most administrative documents stolen from the DIRAG, as well  as about 10 handguns, 50 rifles, and various explosive  substances, have been recovered during a flagrante delicto  procedure. Three people are being held for questioning and  investigations are in progress in order to ascertain the exact  origin of the seized items as well as the identity and motives  of the persons behind all this.    According to various sources and witness accounts from  residents of the area (the Ducos industrial area and Ouemo  residential community) -- including a video filmed unknown to  the investigators and broadcast by television station RFO --  there were also heavy weapons, two-way radios, and ammunition  among the weapons seized. Parts of the arsenal reportedly came  from the United States and were paid for through the sale of  passports which were part of the "administrative documents taken  in DIRAG's premises" (2,000 passports had been stolen there).  Worth pointing out however is the fact that the number of  handguns and rifles indicated in the state prosecutor's  communique match the number of arms stolen on 2 December 1986 in  a local department store.    The exact circumstances of the arrest of the "two  Caledonians" have not been divulged. Sources close to the  investigators say the two men were arrested in Metz on their way  back from Luxembourg, where they had attempted to negotiate a  400,000-French-franc treasury bill.    The bill came from a burglary committed in New Caledonia.  One of the two men quickly made a confession and, probably to  imbue his activities with a political dimension, reportedly  confessed having been party to bombings in Noumea and told  investigators about the two caches of weapons and war equipment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khabarovsk, April 6, RIA -- A public committee to  assist the demarcation of the Russian-Chinese border on the Amur  and Ussuri Rivers has been established in Khabarovsk territory.  "We have been forced to establish such an organisation to  counter the attempts by other states to tear away Russian Far  Eastern lands," learned Secretary of the Amur Geographic Society  Valeriy Simakov told a RIA correspondent. "In particular we are  concerned by the fact of the publication of an atlas of China's  Heilungkiang Province where as Chinese territories are marked  the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarovy Islands, and also by  their not being included in the plan of demarcation of the  border."    Among the committee members are leading public and political  figures of the territory, including geographers and historians.</p>

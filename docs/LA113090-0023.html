			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> BUD'S PURE GIRL-POP  </P> <P> From Blondie and the Go-Go's in the '70s to contemporary groups like the  Primitives and Voice of the Beehive, pure girl-pop, mid-'60s vintage, has cast  an enduring spell.  </P> <P> It usually comes with an ironic angle these days, but the Darling Buds take it  on their own terms.  </P> <P> At the Whisky on Wednesday, singer Andrea Lewis' neo-'60s look evoked the era  without re-creating it, and the young Welsh band's music rested on period  values -- exuberance, innocence, sunny melodies, catchy hooks -- without  sounding overly retro.  </P> <P> But fundamentally, it is retro, and while the Buds are a little too inventive  to be cast as revivalists, they aren't bold enough to become innovators. On  their album, "Crawdaddy," they thicken the pop with dense, twisted textures,  lending it an off-center quality. At the Whisky, though, they mainly rocked --  about a hundred times harder than they do on the album.  </P> <P> But as much as the band put into its music, it's ultimately an unambitious  endeavor, lacking the great songs and the compelling stance to make it more  than a genre exercise.

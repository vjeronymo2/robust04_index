			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to the Federal Government,  the Swiss referendum for an "Alpine Initiative" that is supposed  to transfer transit of goods traffic to railroads beginning in  2004 considerably complicates the Alpine country's negotiations  with the European Union (EU). As Bonn's Transportation Ministry  spokesman Veit Steinle reported on Monday [21 February], transit  traffic is a European problem. The Federal Government realizes  Switzerland's special traffic situation, but a purely national  solution cannot be justified.    The Transportation Ministry, however, does not think that  current transit traffic in Switzerland is endangered by the  referendum. There is a treaty binding under international law  according to which truck transit has been guaranteed since 1993  for another 12 years. However, the EU bodies have to deal soon  with the result of the referendum, it was stated.    Michael Mueller, environmental policy spokesman of the  Social  Democratic Party [SPD] Bundestag Group, said the result of the  Swiss referendum is a victory for ecological reason. The SPD  Group called on the Federal Government to support the "Alpine  Initiative" and follow it by reorienting its traffic policy.  The vote also met with agreement from ecologically oriented  groups.</p>

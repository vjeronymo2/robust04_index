			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: ON DUMB DOGS, DUMB BIRDS AND DUPLICITOUS CATS  </P> <P> It should be of little consolation to us that other animals are not as smart as  we are.  </P> <P> I do not mean to write another essay on the intelligence of animals; whole  libraries have been written on it, and I have contributed my share.  </P> <P> Anyway, given the superior intelligence it obviously has, our own species acts  in such self-destructive ways that it has, in the long run, little to  congratulate itself for.  </P> <P> We take addictive drugs, we have children we don't want; we rape and murder one  another; we neglect our children, we overeat, we kill ourselves in our cars, we  poison the air and our lakes and streams, we make war, we steal, and,  compounding it all, we believe in reincarnation, the notion evidently being  that if we had a second chance we'd do better.  </P> <P> I mean to comment on the stupidity of other animals only as it has been  revealed to me by creatures of my own acquaintance in the past few weeks.  </P> <P> Oddly, we like to wonder at the intelligence of dogs and horses, and are  constantly making them the heroes of our myths. But horses are among the  stupidest of animals, and dogs aren't much brighter. I haven't made up my mind  yet about cats. Perhaps it is because they have so many human characteristics  that one thinks of them as being smarter than they are.  </P> <P> For example, cats are duplicitous, greedy, insolent, predatory, selfish,  pugnacious, lazy and utterly without morals; to that degree they are more human  than most other species, but still not very bright.  </P> <P> That suggests to me that most of our human traits do not derive from our  superior intelligence, but from our ignoble instincts. I don't want this to  degenerate into a pseudo-scientific paper. My conclusions are based only on my  own observations, and to that extent they are scientific.  </P> <P> Take birds. For the last several days a bird has been pecking at the window  just beyond my computer. I keep the blinds closed, to shut out the light, but  that mirrors the window's outside surface.  </P> <P> Why does this little bird spend hours every day pecking at the window?  Obviously, it sees itself reflected in the mirrored surface and imagines that  its image is another male, intruding on its territory. I assume the bird is a  male because males are usually territorial, which causes male human beings to  make war.  </P> <P> The point is, this little bird is too stupid to realize that there is no other  bird. He is merely pecking at himself. Wouldn't you think that this bird would  sooner or later realize that he's pecking at his own reflected image? After  all, every time he pecks at the window his beak hits a hard surface, not  another bird. I have an idea he will not give up until mating season is over.  </P> <P> Now take our dog, Suzie. She is a large light brown German shepherd type with  black markings. Someone put her in our yard a few years ago. She is healthy,  strong and alert. I assume that, for a dog, she is smart.  </P> <P> However, we have a problem with her that I think we wouldn't have if she had  even a minimum of self-preserving intelligence. Our entire yard is fenced,  including a smaller portion that used to be the dog yard. But she keeps  escaping. A couple of years ago I found that she was squirming under the  chain-link fence around her yard. I paid $280 to have the fence extended  underground. That stopped her for a while.  </P> <P> Now she is getting out again. We have given her the freedom of the main yard,  thinking that might deter her. She gets out. We don't know how. Neighbors are  always phoning and telling us to come and get her. She can't be trusted.  Sometimes she seems to be getting out just for the hell of it. She doesn't go  anywhere -- just turns up on the front porch.  </P> <P> In desperation we have had to tie her to a long cord in her yard -- within  reach of water and her doghouse. She doesn't like it. At night we let her in,  then tie her up again in the morning.  </P> <P> The point is, if she were intelligent, wouldn't she realize that getting out is  what causes her to be tied up?  </P> <P> Maybe she thinks she's a cat.  </P></p>

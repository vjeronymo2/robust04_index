			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 10 (XINHUA) -- More than 95,000  households of Beijing residents will move into new homes this  year, the city Mayor Li Qiyan said.    Li said that renovation of dilapidated houses and  construction of new residential buildings will be accelerated so  that a total of 6.50 million sq m of houses will be available by  the end of the year.    The "Kangju Project," aiming to provide more housing for  lower-income families with small living space, will be one of  the key projects in the housing blueprint, according to Li.    One sq m of the "Kangju Residence" would cost 700 yuan,  according to Zhang Baifa, a vice-mayor of the city. Currently,  one square meter of commercial housing typically costs 3,000 to  4,000 yuan in Beijing.    "If that price is still out of reach for the lower income  families, they will get help from the government and their  employers," Zhang said in a recent press conference.    The vice-mayor said that Beijing will continue to carry out  the fund-accumulation system, something like the mortgage system  in the west, and carry out reforms in commercializing housing.    Some 8,000 sq m in residences in the construction project  begun last year have been put into use. Another 300,000 sq m of  residences will be completed this year. Some one million sq m  of dilapidated houses will be rebuilt.    Statistics show that Beijing now has a total residential  space of 110 million sq m, with 8.3 sq m for each citizen.  However, there are still more than 200,000 lower-income  households living in cramped houses with less than 4 sq m of  living space per capita.    In an attempt to quicken the pace of housing construction,  Beijing began to make use of overseas capital last year. Dozens  of contracts to jointly renovate old houses were signed with  overseas investors, including Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, May 28 (AFP)--Northern Yemeni tribesmen have  released three Dutch hostages they kidnapped two months ago, a  Yemeni leader told AFP Saturday [28 May].    The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said two were  released late Friday in the Ma'rib region, east of Sanaa and  were due to leave Yemen for the Netherlands late Saturday.    A third was freed 10 days earlier because he was in bad  health, he said.    The three, Wilbert Elderhorst, Gerard Jeuissen and Jac van  der Gun, were working on a project supplying drinking water to  the capital Sanaa, when they were seized on March 25 by the Jihm  tribe.    More than 20 foreigners have been kidnapped in the past two  years in Yemen by different tribes, who use them to put pressure  on the government to win material gains.    All have been released unharmed.    Fighting has been raging between rival north and south  Yemeni  forces since May 5.</p>

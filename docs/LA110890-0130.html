			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READING FOOD;  </P> <P> THE MAKING OF "CITY CUISINE"  </P> <P> When Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger started out they had one tiny  restaurant, City Cafe. Now they've built an ethnic food empire: Their Border  Grills serve Mexican cooking influenced by yearly visits to the marketplaces of  Mexico. At City, their world view expands. When it came to cooking, they found  instant success doing things their way. But they found cookbook publishers have  their own ideas:  </P> <P>  FENIGER: When we started talking about doing a book we both felt sure that we  really wanted a book that would represent us, the restaurant. We wanted a book  that would work in the kitchen, that would be really functional, that would lay  flat, that people could use in their homes.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: But there were a lot of battles to be waged. The publishing business  is so different from being a cook. The agents we talked to wanted to sell a  cookbook, but they didn't want to sell our cookbook. Finally, Susan and I went  to New York and we met with 12 publishers, just the two of us. We had Mike  Fink, who does all the graphics for us here, do a comp-up of what we wanted. It  had a spiral binding and acetate covers . . .  </P> <P> FENIGER: It was wonderful.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: You could go in the kitchen and lay it down on the counter, and it  wouldn't get all scummy. You could just wash it off.  </P> <P> TIMES: What were the reactions of the publishing people?  </P> <P> FENIGER: Absolutely terrible.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: They laughed us out of their offices.  </P> <P> TIMES: And said what?  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: This is ridiculous . . .  </P> <P> FENIGER: This is way too expensive. They didn't ask us about the food; the  issue was the design.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: We were willing to work with the budget and make it work. But it  didn't make sense that it couldn't be spiral bound. Everywhere you go there's a  junior league with a spiral-bound cookbook. When we met Anne Bramson, who  became our editor, she was more interested in convincing us to do a little  paperback Border Grill cookbook. We were able to convince her though and she  really believed in us, she was great.  </P> <P> FENIGER: But we had to convince her . . .  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: At least she was open to it.  </P> <P> FENIGER: What ended up really surprising us, was the actual process of testing  the recipes. I think we really both felt that . . .  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: . . . it would be a lot easier than it was.  </P> <P> FENIGER: We thought we'd test the first five, six, maybe ten recipes. After  that we thought we could have one of our strong people in the kitchen test the  rest. We would just taste. Well, after we did the first ten we thought, there's  no way.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: We're very control-oriented people anyway. It was just really  apparent that no one else could make those decisions about a quarter teaspoon  of salt, or whatever. Since it's going to be something that's around and living  for years and years, the recipes had to have exactly the flavor we wanted.  </P> <P> FENIGER: The cooking process was a lot slower than we're used to, just because  you have to keep track of everything. We couldn't just throw stuff in.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: And then also, because there are two of us, we'd say, "Do you like  this?" "Yeah I like it." "Well I don't like it." We had to both agree that we  liked it. I remember with a couple of dishes it was like, "but this is  delicious . . ." And then, "No, I don't like that. And I was shocked at how  much cream we used in some things. Our collaborator Helene (Siegel) kept  saying, "No more cream! No more cream! But we're always automatically just  pouring more in. I think the rigatoni and the gnocchi had the most cream.  </P> <P> TIMES: How did the publisher react to the finished book?  </P> <P> FENIGER: Everyone liked it. But they wanted us to come up with those words.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: We had the cover designed just as it came out, but the marketing  department had these strips of white going across that said, "Over 250  mouth-watering recipes!" like some used car salesman.  </P> <P> FENIGER: Or else, "Thai! Japanese! Indian!" It was like, are you kidding? We  argued it and argued it.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: For two hours we were in the office at Morrow. We lost the argument.  But then, we get into the elevator to go downstairs, and we're dejected --  really , really . . .  </P> <P> FENIGER: . . . disgusted.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: Upset. And the elevator door opens and our editor says, "Oh, this is  the vice president, or the president of the company, and Susan, she's so  brilliant, she goes up to him and says, "What do you think about the cover of  this book? Do you think this is good like this?" And he says, "Yeah, I think  that looks pretty good." Then she says, "Well, do you think it needs like a tag  line? And he says, "No, absolutely not, it's good just like that."  </P> <P> FENIGER: So I looked at Anne and said, "Anne, that's the answer. He said we  don't need it." So we didn't have it. It was really great.  </P> <P> MILLIKEN: We were lucky. But you know, even still, Williams-Sonoma won't carry  the book. They think the cover's too ugly . . . they said it doesn't match  their store.  </P></p>

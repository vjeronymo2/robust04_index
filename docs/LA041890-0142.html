			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: HART'S WEIL TOPS FORD'S WIN MARK  </P> <P> Kym Weil had a terrific baby-sitter -- always a lot of fun, never too strict  about bedtime and just about the best softball pitcher any would-be windmill  whipper could hope to emulate.  </P> <P> As a child, Weil went to bed when Samantha Ford said so. Last week, Weil put  Ford to bed in the Hart High record books.  </P> <P> Weil recorded four victories last week, surpassing Ford as the winningest  pitcher in school history while leading Hart (15-2) to the championship of the  Righetti tournament.  </P> <P> As she has been throughout her four-year career, Weil was nearly flawless,  throwing two one-hitters and a pair of two-hitters. She shut out Santa Barbara,  6-0; Cabrillo, 4-0; Lompoc, 1-0; and Simi Valley, 1-0. Weil's efforts did  wonders for Hart, which batted only .211 in the tournament.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, she was selected the tournament's most valuable player.  </P> <P> Combined with Tuesday's two-hit 7-0 win over San Gabriel, the tournament  victories raised Weil's career record to 75-15, eclipsing Ford's school record  of 71 career wins from 1982-85 and moving Weil to within six of the Southern  Section record.  </P> <P> "Goals are always important to reach," Weil said. "But I don't want to be too  concerned with statistics."  </P> <P> That's too bad because her career numbers are noteworthy. Weil has recorded 36  shutouts, 10 no-hitters, 12 one-hitters, 874 strikeouts and an 0.43 earned-run  average in 588 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> This season, Weil is 14-1, has nine shutouts and has struck out 172 in 108  innings. She has not allowed an earned run in her last 59 innings. At one  stretch last season, Weil pitched 101 innings without allowing an earned run.  </P> <P> In the Righetti tournament, Weil struck out 43 in 29 innings while holding the  opposition to an .064 batting average. And to cap off the week, she signed a  letter of intent to attend Hawaii on a softball scholarship.  </P> <P> "It's been a lot of hard work and determination," Weil said. "I wouldn't  consider it natural (ability)."  </P> <P> Weil didn't start slinging softballs competitively until she was 13 -- long  after the days of 9 p.m. bedtimes. But Ford, who pitched for UCLA from 1986-89,  was still around to offer advice.  </P> <P> "I thought she was really good when she was younger," Ford said. "I'm really  happy for her. I think it's great. But I wouldn't want to take any credit for  her accomplishments."  </P> <P> Weil, however, shuns the spotlight, repeatedly emphasizing the contribution of  teammates. Catcher Stephanie Keeler, who also has signed with Hawaii, leads the  Indians in nearly every offensive category, including batting average (.500),  hits (21), doubles (three), triples (three) and home runs (one).  </P> <P> "Stats don't mean that much to me," Weil said. "Records will always be broken.  I think what's most important is not so much your numbers but how you perform  and how people think of you as a person. I don't just want to be remembered as  the girl who beat out Sam."  </P></p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Chief constables reject main elements of Sheehy report BRITAIN'S chief constables yesterday resoundingly rejected the central elements of the government-appointed Sheehy committee's recommendations for changes in police pay and conditions. Mr John Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), said proposals in the report would damage the morale and ethos of the police service. The association is seeking immediate discussions with the government to express its concern. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, has until now drawn comfort from the fact that the chief officers reacted with more reserve than other ranks when the proposals were published a fortnight ago. But Acpo's formal response now places all the service's representative organisations in opposition to the Sheehy report. The opposition will be expressed forcefully tomorrow evening when more than 11,000 officers are due to gather at Wembley arena in London for a demonstration organised by the Police Federation, which represents ranks up to chief inspector, and the Superintendents' Association. Organisers say the meeting will demonstrate the 'outrage' felt by rank-and-file officers. Radical proposals in the report, produced by a committee chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, include introducing 10-year fixed-term contracts subsequently renewable every five years, performance-related pay and lifting the retirement age from 55 to 60. In its response, Acpo supports fixed-term contracts for senior officers but not for constables, sergeants and inspectors who make up the majority of police officers. It also opposes relating junior ranks' pay to performance. Acpo says the proposed retirement age change, combined with recommendations on pensions, would prevent mature entrants gaining full pensions. And, say the chief constables, 'we doubt that the stresses and strains of operational policing can be effectively carried out by officers approaching their 60s'. While Acpo wants more flexibility in the management structure, it opposes a recommendation to abolish the ranks of chief inspector, chief superintendent and deputy chief constable. Mr Howard will consider responses to the Sheehy report until September before making final decisions. Breaking into the criminal justice market, Page 10</p>

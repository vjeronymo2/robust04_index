			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Clarke attacks Euro-sceptics AN ALTERNATIVE vision of the Conservatives as positive Europeans was spelt out by senior ministers yesterday as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, led the counter-attack on the Euro-sceptics with a call for the party to recover its self-confidence and convictions. At an evening fringe meeting organised by the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group, Mr Clarke insisted that Conservatives would not be driven into schism by the debate about Europe. He was unequivocal in stressing that the party must rediscover clear aims and policies, and recognise that 'we are all Europeans'. He recalled as 'the golden years of Thatcher's Britain' the mid-to-late 1980s when the government was cohesive and the party was not weakened by the doctrinal divide between 'wets' and 'dries'. Mr Clarke argued that the Maastricht treaty was not an exercise in damage limitation, but represented an improvement in the way the EC worked. The EC would continue to evolve and, he warned: 'We must decide quickly what we do want, and we cannot do nothing.' The community had always had a political dimension, and the Tory government since 1979 had not opted out of that development, he said. Mr Clarke emphasised that political co-operation paved the way for greater economic liberalism, about which the party continues to be enthusiastic. 'It is not possible to have a genuine free-trade area without any political strings.' A more combative strand of the argument had been developed earlier by Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, who accused the Euro-sceptics of being selective in their approach to EC discussions. Within minutes of the main conference debate on Europe finishing, Mr Gummer used a debate on farming to argue that the lesson of Napoleon's and Hitler's domination of Europe was that Britain's 'eternal interest' was to preserve the balance of power in Europe. Mr Gummer did not mention Lord Tebbit, former party chairman, but the target was clear in his attacks on 'the people who thought we could opt out; that it was nothing to do with us'. He told the conference: 'I say to the Euro-sceptics that you can't do that on an 'in-and-out' basis. You can't pick and choose. You can't play only when you think you are going to win.'</p>

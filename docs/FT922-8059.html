			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (9) - Football's year to remember / Sports, The Columbus festivities in 1992 include international cycling, water polo, athletics, roller skating and sailing events IN A COUNTRY totally dominated by football, Genoa is certainly no exception. It was here in 1893 that a group of British subjects founded the first Italian sporting society, the Genoa Cricket and Athletic Club, at the local British consulate. The cricket and athletics gave way to association football, and today the city is divided between Genoa, the club that descended from the society of yore, and Sampdoria, the side that brought home the Italian championship title last season. The title was captured by a team revitalised through the investments of chairman Paolo Mantovani, who in just over 10 years pushed what had long been considered 'Genoa's other team' to success against clubs backed by the largest business empires in Italy (Agnelli's Juventus and Berlusconi's Milan). Whether sustained by a prestigious past or more recent successes, the Genovese are first and foremost grandstand 'supporters': impassioned, sometimes even sombre, always extremely fair - and rather satisfied with results in 1992. For the first time in their history, both teams have been involved at the highest levels of international tournaments at the same time. While the Genoa club missed out on the UEFA cup, it had the consolation prize of playing in the semi-finals and achieving two historic victories against Liverpool. Meanwhile, the Sampdoria fans are busy organising their expedition to Wembley, where their team will battle Barcelona for the Champions' Cup. But the 1992 sporting year in Genoa will not be dominated by football: the Columbus festivities include international cycling, water polo, track and field and sailing events. The Genovese have become aware that the Columbus festival offers an opportunity for relaunching the city, and that sport can encourage the process. So they have partly overcome their traditional reluctance to embark on relatively risky investments. In the case of sports, the financial caution of public authorities and private sponsors even went so far as to penalise activities in which the city was once outstanding. One of the chronic problems afflicting sports in Genoa is a lack of management, facilities and space in which to build arenas and playing fields. The city is now trying to remedy this problem which, for example, resulted in the loss of a basketball team, Emerson, and the shift of the water polo centre to the nearby Riviera, which has better facilities. Other lost opportunities include a world swimming tournament, the baseball World Cup and international boxing, motorcycling and sailing events, and probably the finals of the volleyball World League. So, while the Genovese await new facilities (which will include a new sports arena and the new 'Sciorba' multisports centre), they are seeking to make the most of what they have. In the events that did not escape in 1992 they have demonstrated a new enthusiasm: speed of execution and managerial capacity on the part of organisers and a great deal of interest from the public. The big sport in February was track and field, first with the CUS Genoa Trophy, which attracted international athletes such as Leroy Burrell, the American runner, and Jamaica's Merlene Ottey, both favourites to win sprint gold medals at this year's Olympic Games to be held in Barcelona. This was followed by the three days of the European Indoor Championships, a testing ground for the Olympics, marked by the first participation of teams from Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. The latest event, following the World Under-20 Fencing Championships last month, was the departure of the Columbus '92 Quincentenary Grand Regatta, with the participation of Spain, Portugal, the UK, Puerto Rico, the United States and, of course, Italy. One hundred and fifty veteran ships, including 25 school vessels, will undertake six legs from Genoa to Liverpool, where they are due to arrive between August 13 and 16 after covering 9,300 miles of ocean sailed in the name of Columbus. One of the organisers of the regatta is the Yacht Club Italiano of Genoa, one of the world's prestigious sailing clubs, which for more than a century has been helping to uphold the city's maritime tradition. Founded in 1879 with the patronage of King Humbert I, the YCI has provided outstanding figures in world sailing, such as the late Beppe Croce, who succeeded Peter Scott as president of the International Yacht Racing Union. With Giovanni Novi at its helm today, the club boasts around 1,000 members who were able to meet the rigorous membership requirements. The most illustrious include leading businessmen such as Raul Gardini, Carlo Bonomi, Gianni Verasi and Giorgio Falck. Genoa will also be the scene of an international cycling competition this year: in addition to the Apennine Tour earlier this month, the Tour of Italy will once again start out from Genoa (May 22-25) after a 12-year absence, with the first pink jersey awarded in the name of Columbus. The APT tennis tour will be in Genoa from June 15 to 21 with the IP cup (won last year by Carl-Uwe Steeb). Thereafter the city will host the World Rollerskating championships (September 3-6), thanks in part to Ingrid Van Marie, the multiple international title winner and Genovese by adoption. Young athletes, ranging from six to 14 years of age, will take part in the national finals of the Youth Games from October 4 to 10; there are 8,000 Italian participants (plus 1,000 Spanish and American guests), who will compete in events scattered throughout the Ligurian region. The final awards ceremony of the Games will be held in the new Expo area inside the port.</p>

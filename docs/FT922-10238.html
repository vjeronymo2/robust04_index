			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Acil expects to reject NZ bid AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (Acil) says holders of 60 per cent of its shares will reject an ADollars 127m (USDollars 96m) takeover offer from Rossington Holdings, a bid vehicle owned by two companies associated with Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, writes Kevin Brown. The board did not identify shareholders who have undertaken to reject the offer. However, about 60 per cent of the company is effectively controlled by Australian banks.

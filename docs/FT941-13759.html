			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Nestle Despite their strong rise in recent weeks, Nestle shares have been thrown into the shade on the Swiss market as financial stocks have surged ahead. But Nestle's forecast of a 5 per cent increase in 1993 sales confirms its solid progress. Trading momentum has picked up since last autumn and Nestle will report a 1.7 per cent increase in volume growth for 1993. That falls short of its target rate of 4 per cent a year but compares favourably with most international food groups. Nestle has been making good volume gains in higher value-added areas, such as pharmaceuticals, which will help protect group margins. But its markets in Europe have remained tough. Delays in dealing with Perrier threaten to dilute earnings, but restructuring at its US operations appears to be bearing fruit. However, Nestle's great appeal stems from its exposure to fast-expanding economies in Asia and Latin America. With 23 per cent of sales coming from emerging economies, Nestle is the best placed food group to ride the wave of global growth. Nevertheless, the company has much work left in the old world. It has yet to make sense of weak market positions in European pet food, canned products, and frozen foods. This suggests higher restructuring charges may disfigure its accounts in years to come. Despite its prodigious cash flow, Nestle may also be temporarily constrained by year-end gearing of around 55 per cent. That hardly bothers it in the normal run of events, but suggests it would have to use paper to consummate any grander designs on L'Oreal.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Tarmac Selling holes in the ground is not as profitable as it used to be if Tarmac's sale of Econowaste is any guide. When Wimpey and NFC sold their landfill sites, they emerged with stinking profits. Tarmac's Pounds 44m sale smells far less sweet. This may owe much to the negotiating power of Hanson. It also reflects the hazards of starting disposal programmes late in the day. Shareholders may simply be relieved that Tarmac has completed two-thirds of its targeted Pounds 300m of asset sales. They may prove less sanguine, though, if Tarmac again trails Wimpey and taps them for more funds.</p>

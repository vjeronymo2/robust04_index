			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Luis Fernandes in Beira] </F>   [Excerpt] President of the Republic Joaquim Alberto  Chissano repeated in Beira today the message he had conveyed  during his tour of Gaza Province: that we must all work to  rebuild the country and to create better living conditions for  the people. The Mozambican head of state conveyed that message  -- which we perceived to be conciliatory -- when he commented on  the report presented by the Sofala Provincial Government now  that he is touring that province. Chissano said that, quote, if  we have the understanding that that is a common goal, we will  always see our ideas as contributing toward the resolution of  problems, unquote.    [Begin Chissano recording] It is true that we have reached a  stage when there are two issues that are talked about in such a  way as to be made to look contradictory. That should not be the  case. Much is said in connection with political competition and  there is also a lot of talk about national reconciliation. This  has caused some confusion -- namely, the perception that  political competition can be destructive. Others believe that  political reconciliation is tantamount to scrapping political  competition. That should not be the case. We have decided that  political competition is desirable, so we have created a  multiparty system. Let us compete politically, but let us do it  constructively. We must not think, however, that reconciliation  means we all toe the same political line and we all share the  same views concerning national reconstruction. There is  opposition. That has to be recognized. There is opposition.  Reconciliation means that we are going to engage in serious  political fighting, but that we will do so with respect, so that  it will not interfere with the economy, in the sense that it  could be sabotaged. [end recording]    The report presented by the Sofala Provincial Government  generally deals with the impact of war, natural disasters, and  political and economic developments over the last two years.

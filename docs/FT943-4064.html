			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Markets: Bowater's supermodel image - The Bottom Line The image of US supermodel Cindy Crawford, chosen to demonstrate Bowater's media imaging technology at its interim results this week, was appropriate - even if David Lyon, chief executive, looked somewhat bemused posing alongside it for press photographs. A 15 per cent increase in underlying profits for the six months to June 30 confirmed that the packaging, print and coated products group has become something of a supermodel among companies. Few manufacturing businesses can match its progress, even through the depths of recession, since new management took over in 1987. First-half profits, excluding exceptional items, have increased every year, from Pounds 17.3m to Pounds 109m over the period; operating margins have increased every first half except one, from 3.8 per cent to 9.2 per cent; the interim dividend has grown at a compound rate of 15 per cent. The story for the full-year results is similar. In spite of this record, however, Bowater's shares had fallen after its two previous results presentations, as it warned last autumn of falling demand for packaging, and in spring this year of a possible squeeze on margins as raw materials prices began to rise. There was no such problem this time. Bowater said raw materials prices - mainly paper and resin - had indeed risen about 20 per cent between April and June, thanks to increasing demand in key markets. But the company had passed on the rise to customers, and believed it could pass on the further increase of up to 10 per cent expected by the end of the year. The shares gained 19p on the day to 492p. In 1987 Bowater was a ragbag of relatively unconnected paper and packaging businesses. Through a series of acquisitions it has developed strengths in three sophisticated, value-added sectors of packaging and printing - food and drink, toiletries and cosmetics, and healthcare and pharmaceuticals, as well as in the coated products sector. It has operations in North America, Europe and Australasia. The restructuring began in 1987 with the acquisition of Rexham Corporation, the custom coatings and laminates group, followed in 1989 by Release Technologies, the release films and papers manufacturer. In 1992, Bowater bought DRG, a food and healthcare packaging supplier, and Cope Allman, a cosmetics and pharmaceuticals packaging group. The buying spree was completed last year, with Specialty Coatings International, the US coated products group. The most recent acquisitions were funded by two successful rights issues, allowing Bowater to keep borrowings down - gearing is a moderate 43 per cent. Now, David Lyon says, Bowater is entering a new phase. Restructuring is over, and the group plans to expand through organic growth, with some 'bolt-on' acquisitions to strengthen its position in certain markets. It has formed a team of 'free spirits', roving senior executives who are experts in particular technologies, to spot technological developments in one part of the group that could be used in other parts, and merit investment and joint development. Capital spending this year is projected at a record Pounds 150m. One important growth area is healthcare packaging, with Bowater building a new Pounds 30m factory in Bristol and trying to establish joint ventures in South America, India and Poland. Bowater also wants to expand its share of the beauty packaging market outside Europe, and parts of its coated products operations into the Americas, Europe and East Asia. This week's results prompted analysts to upgrade their profits forecasts for the full year from about Pounds 225m to at least Pounds 230m. That puts Bowater on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 13.8 - only a small premium to the packaging sector. 'With Bowater's growth prospects, the shares are looking quite cheap,' says David McCrossan, packaging analyst at Kleinwort Benson. For investors, that could make it almost as attractive as Cindy Crawford.</p>

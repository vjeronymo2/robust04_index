			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / EU ministers agree on foreign workers European Union justice and interior ministers agreed yesterday on a joint approach to keeping foreign workers out of the EU, and that no member state should relax this policy without reference to its partners. At the same time, the ministers shelved discussion on a European Commission proposal that non-EU nationals legally resident in one member state should be able to seek work in other member states, a central Brussels proposal to help integrate foreign workers. The ministers, operating under the so-called 'third pillar' of the Maastricht treaty - concerning home and justice affairs - noted that none of the 12 was pursuing an active immigration policy. Yesterday's move was therefore a first step towards ensuring that all member states were going about barring entry to foreign workers in compatible ways. Mr Louis Tobback, the Belgian interior minister, warned the measure would project an image of 'Fortress Europe' to the world. But Belgium joined its partners in unanimous agreement, confining its reservations to a statement in the minutes. The Luxembourg meeting also voted to go ahead with a feasibility study on setting up a so-called EURODAC network. This is a long-mooted system for finger-printing asylum-seekers and suspected illegal immigrants at point of entry. The information would then be circulated among member states to enable them to detect illegal immigrants travelling inside the supposedly border-free EU. A contract to study how best to set up the system was awarded yesterday to an international consortium made up of Bossard Consultants, Team Consult, and Organotecnica. Yesterday's restrictions 'may not be relaxed by member states in their national legislation', which must conform to them by January 1996, the resolution states. There are several exemptions from the harmonisation principles. These cover nationals of European Free Trade Association countries that are party to the European Economic Area free trade zone which came into effect this year; refugees and asylum applicants; personnel transferred within companies operating in the EU; investors; and a range of people covered by 'youth exchange' schemes ranging from au pairs to training programmes. Mr Jurgen Storbeck was confirmed by yesterday's meeting as the head of the Europol anti-drugs squad, the only unit the Europol cross-border police so far operating. The force is being set up by the 12 to combat organised crime within the border-free internal market. The appointment places the German policeman as likely future head of Europol as a whole.</p>

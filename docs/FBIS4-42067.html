			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Schmid: "`Red Heidi' To Become </F> Commissioner in Brussels"]    [Text] A new job for Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] politician Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul (51). As of January  1995, she is to become a commissioner at the European Union [EU]  in Brussels. Seventeen new commissioners will start working  there. The previous German representatives, Martin Bangemann  (Free Democratic Party) and Peter Schmidhuber (Christian Social  Union), will be replaced.    The Christian Democratic Union and the SPD may appoint one  commissioner each. The SPD deputies in the European Parliament,  which must approve the appointment, want a candidate with  European experience. Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Bundestag  deputy and vice chairwoman of the party with the nickname "Red  Heidi," fulfills the conditions. The SPD leadership wants to  send the former Young Socialists chief to Brussels. She was in  the European Parliament from 1979 to 1987 and she knows the EU  inside out. The desired candidate is emphatically restrained:  "I have not yet been asked. The decision will be made by  Rudolf Scharping alone." In Bonn, she would have liked to  become minister of European affairs. However, if Rudolf  Scharping wins the elections, he wants to reduce the government;  Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul would then be left with the post of  state secretary. As EU commissioner, she can achieve more, and  the salary is not bad either: about 28,000 marks per month.  Finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier and Kiel's European  Affairs Minister Gerd Walter do not stand a chance of being  appointed.</p>

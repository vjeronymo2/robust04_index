			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Concessions on deportees 'soon' THE US expects further concessions soon from Israel on the difficult issue of the fate of the 400 Palestinian deportees, according to Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state. In a TV interview yesterday, Mr Christopher, just back from his first Middle East tour as secretary of state, said the deportee problem was 'on its way to resolution.' He refused to disclose any details but added that the new developments 'will give reassurance to the Palestinians' and, in his opinion, would make all the more likely the attendance of the Palestinian delegation at the Middle East peace talks due to reconvene in April. He was particularly encouraged that those Arab leaders to whom he had spoken and who had influence over the Palestinians all thought there was now 'a moment of opportunity' for the peace process to get under way again. This had been brought about, he said, by the fact that the US was now seen again to be willing to play an active leadership role as an 'honest broker'.</p>

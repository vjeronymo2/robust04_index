			<p>CSO     [Text] If Colombia continues to base its exports on the  advantages afforded it by inexpensive labor and a strategic  geographic location and on the tariff breaks that other  countries are giving it, then soon our products will no longer  be sold on major world markets.    The fact is that the natural competitive advantages that  sustained the country's basic exports for years no longer  suffice. Therefore, Colombia needs to create a competitive  environment that will keep its external sector alive into the  next century.    In view of the above, the government must urgently establish  a series of tax breaks for export firms, promote investment in  companies that sell on foreign markets, boost domestic savings,  and invest seven-figure amounts in training national human  resources. Sizable amounts must be appropriated on a priority  basis to improve domestic infrastructure (ports, air terminals,  roadways, and communications).    This is a summary of the conclusions reached by the study  that the Monitor company conducted on competitiveness in  Colombia.    The research project, which went on for more than a year,  was  directed by Michael Porter, one of the most prestigious  economists in the United States. The final document, entitled  "Creating Colombia's Comparative Advantage: Patterns of  Competitiveness and Sectorial Analysis," focused on specific  sectors of the economy such as capital goods, fruit juices,  flowers, graphic arts, leather goods, and textiles. The  conclusions were presented yesterday at the forum entitled  "competitiveness: the new name of the game."    The study offered the following general recommendations for  the aforementioned sectors:     -  Give tax breaks in the form of accelerated depreciation to  companies that export more than the average in their respective  industry as a percent of total earnings.    -  Give permanent  investment tax breaks to companies whose overseas sales are  outstanding in their sector.    -  Allow all Colombians to have  tax-free savings accounts and individual retirement  accounts.    -  Encourage banks to boost the amount they lend to the  industrial sector as a percentage of their total portfolio.    -  Give  special tax credits for investment in computers and other  information-technology assets. Such incentives must exceed the  current 14 percent deduction from the sales tax.    -  The president  of the republic should call a regular monthly or at least  quarterly meeting so that he and his economic advisers and the  representatives of Colombia's leading companies and trade  associations can analyze export trends.    -  Unions and marketing  firms should gather and disseminate information on the available  technology licenses that are pertinent to their industry.    -  The  authorities should offer permanent tax credits to promote  research and development.    -  Develop enforceable  intellectual-property laws to protect patents, copyrights, and  other innovations.    -  Create a research and development  institution, together with other Latin American countries,  similar to Europe's Eureka.    -  Found a university that specializes  in science, technology, engineering, and research.    -  Industries  and unions ought to set up institutes that focus in particular  on technology for developing skills and innovations in each  sector.    -  The government should establish a prize for the company  that invests the most in people, promotes the training of human  resources, and encourages the development of its employees'  abilities.    -  Tax breaks must urgently be created for investment in  specialized training.    -  The Executive Branch must provide  scholarship funding for companies interested in sending their  employees overseas for commercial or technical  programs.    -  Establish more advanced degrees in the Colombian  universities that focus on science and technology in their  curricula.    -  Unions should set benchmark prices for their  companies that can be compared with those of their foreign  competition, using factors such as customer satisfaction,  relative costs, capital structure, and investment in  innovations.    -  The government should award annual prizes to the  trade associations that further the success of exports.    -  The  authorities should finance the development of private cargo  airports and all of the infrastructure needed to achieve greater  competitiveness.    -  Multimodal transport should also be started,  and roads ought to be made safer and improved substantially.</p>

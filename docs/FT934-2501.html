			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Portillo indicates tough spending stance will stay The government's public expenditure control totals for 1995-96 and 1996-97 will almost certainly be adopted as the ceilings for next year's round of public spending negotiations between the Treasury and other government departments, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday. Signalling a continuation of the government's rigorous approach to public spending, Mr Portillo told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that he expected the cabinet next summer would confirm the figures as the remit for next autumn's spending round. His reply indicated that non-cyclical expenditure, which has been set at Pounds 251.3bn in 1994-95, will not be allowed to exceed Pounds 263bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 272.3bn in the following financial year. That would hold the control totals to real increases of 0.9 per cent in 1995-96 and 1 per cent in 1996-97. Mr Portillo agreed with the committee that the tax increases planned in this year's two Budgets would play an ever greater role in reducing the public sector borrowing requirement over the coming three financial years. But he said that some of the spending curbs announced in Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget last month would produce savings beyond the April 1997 limit to the government's present spending plans. Proposals to restructure invalidity and unemployment benefit would produce savings after 1997, while more savings could emerge from the fundamental reviews of spending priorities in large departments such as social security, he said. He disclosed that during the first half of next year the Treasury would be investigating issues that transcend the boundaries between government departments.</p>

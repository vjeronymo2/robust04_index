			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Bosnian city divided by fear: Edward Mortimer and Laura Silber report on Mostar's uneasy peace Mr Mehmet Muratovic shook with sobs as he walked from Moslem-held eastern Mostar towards his four-year-old grandson whom he had not seen in nearly a year although they had been separated only by a few streets of shattered buildings. It was 10 am yesterday in the no man's land separating the Moslem and Croat-held parts of Mostar, the regional capital of southern Bosnia-Hercegovina, which until six weeks ago had witnessed some of the most ruthless fighting of the Bosnian war. In May last year the Bosnian Croats, until then allied with the Moslem-led Bosnian government against the Serbs, stepped up their drive to form their own ethnically pure Croat state, of which Mostar was to be the capital. But government forces dug in on the east bank of the River Neretva, and managed to hold a strip of the city centre on the west bank, despite the continuous Croat shelling which destroyed all of Mostar's bridges, including the historic 16th century one which gave the city its name. But thanks to the agreement, signed in Washington on March 1, the fighting has now stopped. Yesterday's tearful reunion of 25 divided families, the first of its kind, was a small step towards the federation which Moslem and Croats have agreed, under strong US pressure, to establish. The Muratovics were among carefully sifted residents of each side who were allowed a two-hour meeting with relatives in a UN tent, encircled by barbed wire. No man of military age could be included and no Bosnian citizen was allowed actually to cross from one side to the other. Although under the agreement, Moslems and Croats are now supposed to be allies and fellow citizens, the Croat authorities insisted on these stringent rules. Peering furtively from the ruins of an apartment block on the eastern side - the nearest he was allowed - a Bosnian soldier gestured at his elderly mother to hold back her tears. Until one month ago, Croat forces were still rounding up Moslems living in western Mostar, firing on them as they were expelled across frontlines. Possibly for fear of suffering a similar fate, six western Mostar residents who had obtained permission for the visit yesterday failed to show up, causing evident distress for their relatives who waited for them in vain. Only those named on a pre-approved list were allowed to take part in the visit. Even small children had to be subjected to a careful body search by UN police. The inhabitants of eastern Mostar looked thinner and wearier than their relatives from the opposite bank. Owing to the Croat siege, the eastern side has been without water and electricity since last summer. Restoring utilities to the city is the most urgent task facing Mr Hans Koschnick, the former mayor of the German port of Bremen, who has been name by the EU as interim administrator of the city, an arrangement which is to last two years under the terms of the Washington agreement. Mr Koschnick, a social democrat, is expected to arrive on April 18. Commander Esad Humo, who headed the defence of the mainly-Moslem eastern bank, said the last time he stood at that devastated spot was a year ago, when under enemy fire, he drove a lorry to form a frontline barrier. The families had to make their way around the rusted remains of this lorry, loaded with rubble from which thistles and spring flowers had now sprouted. General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, is due in Mostar today - his first visit since he arrived in the country in January. 'It's six weeks too late in my opinion,' said British brigadier Jerry Hulme, head of the regional office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. But, he added: 'I am looking forward to seeing how my old pupil is getting on,' (Brig Hulme was formerly an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley). Until now, Gen Rose has focused mainly on the conflict between Moslems and Serbs, elsewhere in the country. Yesterday at Sarajevo airport, he tried unsuccessfully to bring Serb and Moslem commanders together in peace talks near Sarajevo. His peace effort there may yet prevent him from going to Mostar. Brigadier Hulme is concentrating on making the family reunions in Mostar a daily occurrence. That will go on until the two sides feel confident enough to restore free movement throughout the city, he said, as he walked back to the east bank, across the mangled remains of a bridge installed a year ago to replace one destroyed when the war erupted in 1992.</p>

This wish of both sides was  expressed by Azerbaijan's president, Heydar Aliyev, at a meeting  held with elders from the neighboring Dagestan Republic who were  in Azerbaijan on a trip.    The head of Azerbaijan's state, expressing our republic's  position to the Dagestani guests, said that the border between  us has a conditional character. For centuries representatives of  the Azeris, Avars, Sakhurs, Kumyks, Dargins and other ethnic  groups have lived in solidarity and mingled. Azerbaijan's  president, while noting that the uniting of national minorities  in various societies, including ethnic organizations, was  worthy, also noted that common human values must unite all men,  no matter what their identity. They have opted to live in our  republic, and each of them are Azerbaijanians. As the rights and  responsibilities of all of us are one, we must also correctly  understand our duties.    Seid Gurbanov, head of the executive government of Derbend  Rayon and spokesman for Dagestan's elders, in discussing the  goal of the talks, said that they were of a mind to confirm the  good ties between the states and make some proposals about  aiding the refugees, which are a common problem.    Abbas Abbasov, republic deputy prime minister, took part in  the reception.</p>

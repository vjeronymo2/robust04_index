			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Javier Fernandez, president of the National </F> Association of Financial Institutions (ANIF): "The Surviving  Reform"]    [Text] The Social Security Law just passed by Congress is  one of the most important economic reforms of recent decades.  Many persons played a part in this achievement, starting with  the president, who initiated the legislation and without whose  vision and decisive support the change would not have had any  hope of success.    I must reserve space here to comment on the substance of the  law, but I would at least like to emphasize the fact that  Minister of Labor Luis Fernando Ramirez, who actually authored  the reform of the retirement system, won the admiration of the  country by virtue of his mastery of the subject, his  perseverance, calmness, and recognized effectiveness in  promoting a proposal for which many had repeatedly given up hope  this past year.    Black marks will go on the records of the various  obstructionist forces that were bent on throwing a monkey wrench  into the works in order to halt the process or derail it. In  some cases, the opposition was predictable for simple  ideological reasons. For the historical record, however, it  would be false to claim that the unions or most of Colombia's  economists in the academic world played a positive role in the  passage of this far-reaching reform.    Unfortunately, the proposal did not come out of the test  intact. Obviously, not all of the modifications in the  government's original version could honestly be considered as  "improvements," and several are inappropriate. Nevertheless, the  real "guts" of the reform were saved. Beginning next year,  Colombians will have an alternative to the traditional  inefficient and excessive government monopoly over the  administration of pensions.    Fortunately, the idea of opponents of private pension funds  of crippling them at birth by virtue of a "mixed" system in  which Colombians opting for such funds would remain bound to the  ISS for life failed to thrive. Although two pension systems will  exist in the future--including the common pot--at least  membership in either one will be exclusive.    Unfortunately, a populist thrust in Congress altered the  essence of the system of distribution by providing that the  Treasury will cover any shortfall. The provision is so absurd,  fiscally speaking, that workers would do well to foresee that  once the inevitable cash deficit occurs in the system, the law  may be modified to raise dues or cut benefits.    With respect to the relationship between dues and benefits  offered by the system of services provided, insufficient  progress was made to guarantee that the system will be  financially balanced. In addition, an absurd regressive subsidy  was maintained, higher for persons in upper-income brackets than  for those in the lower brackets. However, dues were at least  increased, the minimum number of weeks of payment required for  eligibility was raised, retirement ages were modified slightly,  and a correction was made in the absurd current rule that a  person retires with the wage he was paid for the last two years,  an inexhaustible source of abuses.    Any demagogue could argue that cutting benefits and  increasing dues imply an improvement in the system, but I  believe it is to insult the intelligence of Colombians to  suggest that one can maintain a dreadful financial imbalance in  the system of retirement without forcing workers having to pay  the price in the end and, what is worse, doing so in a  disorganized, traumatic fashion once the system has reached the  crisis stage. Because the financial imbalance is reduced, the  Colombian economy is now on a firmer footing and its  possibilities of development have therefore improved.    Henceforth, the system will begin to generate foreign  exchange, resulting in substantial savings. The counterpart of  these higher reserves will be more productive capital and an  acceleration of economic development.    The program contains two negative aspects that reflect the  determination of some to block and obstruct in various ways the  vigorous development of the pension funds, turning the "grand  reform" into a "minireform" at all costs. One way is the  exaggeratedly long transitional period provided for maintaining  the existing system. The other is discrimination against workers  who join the funds.    Rules for the transition will practically exclude from these  funds all women over the age of 35 and men over 40. With respect  to discrimination, it was stubbornly established that workers in  the lower-income brackets who transfer to the pension funds will  be required to pay into them longer than they would into the ISS  in order to be guaranteed a minimum pension.    Nevertheless, despite the law's numerous requirements that  are aimed at preventing the emergence of a strong pension fund  system, I believe the funds will offer workers a far more  attractive combination of profitability and service than what we  have at present and that in the final analysis, the market will  demonstrate its superiority. The future is upon us!</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Panic, and other kinds of policy In the long run up to the 1967 devaluation of sterling, Mr Harold Wilson was fond of saying that he was not going to take the easy way out. In the end, he provoked The Economist into asking the obvious question: If there is an easy way out, why on earth not take it? He did, of course (though it was not, in fact, easy). So when present-day leaders announce that they are not going to adopt panic policies - presumably to distinguish themselves from politicians who announce that they are going to adopt panic policies - wise men check over their survival kits. If ministers are panicking, why shouldn't they? The wrong answer is to recite cliches about the darkest hours coming just before the dawn. The history of credit bubbles shows that once confidence has vanished, it takes some years to recover. Even in the 1970s, when rapid inflation devalued debt at such a rate that property prices could fall by more than a third in real terms without triggering more than a handful of defaults, lenders remained cautious for about a decade. This time round, the banks' losses are still growing, as each round of failures drags more companies down with unpaid bills; we don't yet know when the darkest hour will come. The course was chosen when the government decided to mount a fierce squeeze against inflation just as the bubble burst, thus taking the adjustment through bankruptcies rather than the general default which follows when debts are devalued. Such a policy could be seen as bold, or at worst foolhardy, if ministers were frank about its meaning. When they waffle of green shoots, it just looks stupid. As for the depression which results from an over-valued currency, there is no time limit at all. It is, as we will be reminded ad nauseam, 500 years since Columbus landed in the New World. The resultant influx of gold and silver into Spain dealt that economy a blow from which it is only now recovering, for men will never work and produce when there is an idle alternative. British uncompetitiveness first appeared troubling more than a century ago, when earnings from overseas investment provided about a 10th of our consumption. Two world wars dissipated that capital, but we still suffer from old bad habits. Adjustment to the disciplines of the ERM is meant to complete that process, and should not take quite so long, but it is not easy. That is shown by the long slowdown in France, the current near-panic in Italy (long the most dynamic of the European economies), and the possibly terminal decline of the Irish Republic, where the brightest and best are simply emigrating. Indeed, such an adjustment is like sports training: strengthening if it is manageable, but possibly fatal if you overdo it. So it is reasonable to ask whether the regime the UK has adopted is manageable or dangerously debilitating. The panic lies in refusing to face such an uncomfortable issue at all. The one country which seems to recognise this is the one for which the question is academic: Germany. It is no secret that the Germans regard some partner currencies as dangerously over-valued. The Bundesbank is currently the victim of much spiteful comment from countries which find its current credit policy uncomfortable; but its president, Dr Karl Schlesinger, in a little-reported new year interview, defended his stance as necessary for Germany and pointedly remarked: 'The ERM is not a fixed exchange rate system.' In other words, the UK is victim not of German choices, but of its own. It would be reassuring to be able to forecast with confidence, as an increasing number in the City do, that this is just a burst of pre-election folly, and that an ERM realignment will quickly follow the British and Italian elections. Unhappily, it can't be taken for granted. Neither election looks likely to produce a strong, self-confident government; and for weak politicians there is a tempting populist alternative. Nobody is openly talking protectionism yet, but the smell is in the air. President Bush, after suffering Australian protests about US farm subsidies, is arriving in Tokyo ready for a trade confrontation. He is soft-pedalling his proposed North American Free Trade Area - his most solid real achievement - in face of protests about exporting American jobs to Mexico. The French are blocking the Gatt agreement apparently to pacify their farmers; but if French car workers soon protest at cheap Fiats and Volkswagens from Czechoslovakia and Poland, they will no doubt get a sympathetic hearing too. Allowing this trend to develop, however stealthily, would be a real panic measure. It would mean that the country is running away from problems it does know how to solve - currency misalignments, and inadequate investment demand - to court others that might have no peaceful solution at all. The television news editors here show more sense than the leaders. They fill screens with reports from the ex-communist economies at a time when hardly any politicians have anything serious to say. Yet this is by far the most important policy challenge for the next decade and more. It demands that not only some aid in filling food shelves is provided now, but above all a future opportunity for these economies to earn their living. If aid is provided, they could in due course emulate the miracles we have seen in the war-devastated economies of Europe and Japan. If they are blocked, a tidal wave of refugees looks the likeliest result; but, given that these are militarised and nuclear-armed countries, it is by no means the worst that can be imagined. If this analysis is right, the biggest employment problem of 1992 is an unfilled vacancy: a leader to turn our attention from our domestic discomforts to the huge problems and opportunities of a bigger world. Chancellor Kohl has made some of the right noises; President Mitterrand could do with a world role; a re-elected President Bush might get the right advice from ex-President Nixon. Major? Kinnock? It is surely more realistic to adopt the Micawber pose, and hope that somebody turns up.</p>

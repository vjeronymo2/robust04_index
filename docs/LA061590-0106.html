			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY ALL-STARS FALTER EARLY IN 9-3 DEFEAT  </P> <P> The Orange County all-stars scored five runs in the first inning against Danny  Choi and the Los Angeles City all-stars en route to a 9-3 victory Thursday  night in the second Los Angeles-Orange County All-Star Baseball Game at UC  Irvine.  </P> <P> Chris Sauritch, who was named the Orange County all-stars' most valuable  player, started the rally leading off the bottom of the first inning with a  home run to right-center field.  </P> <P> Sauritch, from El Toro High, said that his home run might have shocked  Fairfax's Choi, the starting pitcher for Los Angeles, into giving up the next  four runs. "It affected him big-time," Sauritch said.  </P> <P> "He started throwing a lot of junk after that. It seemed like his out pitch was  a curveball, but he kept getting behind and having to throw fastballs."  </P> <P> Anthony Napolitano of Los Alamitos followed with a single to set up a two-run  double by Scott Sebbo of El Toro.  </P></p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Chinks of light on the economy: America Talk of 'pervasive gloom' about the US economy has never been quite justified. For three years, professional forecasters have been consistently complacent. In the summer of 1990, most expected the US to avoid recession. In the spring of last year, most were confident of sustained economic growth. Last week, a rebound in department store and car sales was triumphantly seized upon as convincing evidence that recovery, at last, is at hand. Is it time to join the bulls and declare the recession history? My initial reaction is to call for better US statistics. The preliminary figures that send ripples through global financial markets are often deeply misleading. According to last week's figures, retail sales jumped 0.6 per cent in January. Revisions to prior figures indicated that sales were flat in nominal terms in November and December, instead of down by 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent as previously reported. The news that sales did not, in fact, fall sharply before Christmas is welcome. But how reliable is the claim of a rebound in January? The figure for November was first reported as a gain of 0.3 per cent, then as a fall of 0.5 per cent and, finally, as a zero change. The zing in car sales in the first 10 days of February seems more solid evidence of recovery. But it is nothing to write home about. An estimated annual rate of sales of 6.4m units was encouraging compared with dismal expectations of only 5.8m and a 6.1m rate at the end of January. But in better times, an annual sales rate of 6.4m units would be seen as evidence of near recessionary conditions. And, as with the retail sector, the figures are notoriously volatile. Bulls, however, will reach for the third arrow in their quiver: the recent revival of monetary growth. Bank reserves - the base for lending - have registered annual rates of growth of 20 per cent or more since last September. M1, a narrow measure of money, has grown at a double digit rate. Even M2, the targeted measure of broad money, is staging a lacklustre revival, having grown at an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent in recent months. Federal Reserve officials - at most half-hearted monetarists - are well aware that a similar revival of monetary growth this time last year fizzled out. The figures, nonetheless, help justify the Fed's 'wait and see' stance on interest rates. In his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony next week, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, seems certain to repeat his favourite mantra: that the monetary easing already in the pipeline will be sufficient to revive the economy. So far the nation's factories are paying scant attention. On Friday, the lift from retail sales was largely countered by far worse than expected production figures. Industrial production fell 0.9 per cent last month; and revisions - nearly as large as those for retail sales - showed falls of 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent in November and December. The decline was led by cars but affected every sector, from consumer goods and business equipment to utilities. The feared 'double dip' recession is thus a reality for much of corporate America. It has already caused the loss of some 300,000 payroll jobs since the autumn. Optimists are unmoved. They insist the fall in production is old news because it was a response to the weakening of demand in the final months of last year. Now that demand is rebounding, business confidence will revive and output will start growing. After a weak first quarter, the economy is thus poised for recovery in the spring. The logic is fine. But bear in mind two important caveats. In the first place, the evidence for a rebound in demand is still tentative. More importantly, consumer fundamentals remain weak - savings rates are low, employment prospects are dicey and real incomes are subdued. Any revival in spending could easily prove to be shortlived. In economic if not political terms, the precise timing of recovery is less significant that the medium-term outlook for growth. On this, opinions differ markedly. If you seek reassurance, the best place to look is exports. The combination of cost-cutting in manufacturing and the weak dollar has transformed the outlook for US exporters, which have been gaining market share since the mid-1980s. On some measures, German wage costs are now 50 per cent higher than America's. Far from losing competitiveness, some economists claim, US industry is actually in better shape than at any time since the 1960s. Gloom about the long-term outlook is thus badly misplaced. Those focusing on the public sector cannot swallow this optimism. Given rapidly falling inflation, they say sharp rises in bond yields - back almost to 8 per cent - reflect growing alarm about fiscal trends. Even if congressional Democrats' plans for middle-income tax cuts are fully funded by higher marginal rates on the rich (still a big if), the outlook is for another decade of huge deficits. These lakes of red ink represent negative public savings. The long-term consequences of low saving and investment are dire. At a recent seminar, economists at the Brookings Institute, a Washington think tank, argued that the US economy's sustainable growth rate may now be only a miserable 1.7 per cent a year. Yet the chances that politicians of either party will take serious steps to improve productivity growth remain depressingly slim. In my book, therefore, the bears still have the best of an increasingly complex argument.</p>

Netanyahu  vehemently objected to the impending release of hundreds of  security prisoners and demanded that the state commission of  inquiry also investigate the government's responsibility for the  terrorist acts perpetrated against Jews. As for the  restrictions placed on the hardcore extremist settlers in the  territories, this is what Binyamin Netanyahu had to say:    [Begin Netanyahu recording] If steps are called for against  agitators or against people who assist or participate in acts of  terrorism, then such action is legitimate; however, if the  government's intention is to expand the scope of these measures  to include large groups of settlers, who are the vast majority  -- to say the least -- of the settler population, then it will  constitute an abuse of authority that must not be sanctioned.  Selective, strictly pinpointed action against lawbreakers is  acceptable to us. [end recording]</p>

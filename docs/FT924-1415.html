			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Output of cars for export rises TWO out of every three cars produced in the UK last month were destined for export, by far the highest proportion in the industry's recent history. Exports accounted for only about a quarter of the UK industry's total production as late as 1989. Part of the reason for the rise is that UK new car sales remain weak, depressing production for the home market. Export output rose 22.16 per cent to 73,431 cars against 60,111 the previous year. Over the first 11 months of this year exports accounted for 48 per cent of total car production. At 535,088, it was 4.96 per cent down in volume on the corresponding period in 1991. Short-time working at Ford and Rover Group was largely responsible for last month's domestic production falling 23.2 per cent to 43,216 from 56,265 a year before. As a result - based on statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Office of Information - total November car output was only 0.23 per cent above the 116,647 reached a year earlier. This puts total output for the year's first 11 months 3.3 per cent higher than the 1991 figure of 1,196,427. In spite of the domestic setback, the industry expects production to rise strongly next year as the UK market starts to recover and Toyota, whose Derbyshire plant started production this week, and Honda add their production to Nissan's. The SMMT predicts car output will rise 12 per cent to 1.4m next year from this year's forecast 1.25m. Commercial vehicle output, however, fell back sharply in November by 29.8 per cent to 19,521 from 27,806 a year before. Production for export was particularly hard hit, falling 39.26 per cent to 9,365 from the previous November's 15,419. Export output remained well ahead for the first 11 months. At 120,931, it was 21.81 per cent ahead of last year's 99,281 for the same period. Total commercial vehicle output for the first 11 months, at 233,741, was up 16.65 per cent compared with last year's 11-month total of 200,383.</p>

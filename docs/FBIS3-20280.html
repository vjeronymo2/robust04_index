			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on article based on book by Sir Leon Brittan, EU </F> Trade Commissioner, entitled "The Europe We Need"]    [Text] A strange paradox lies at the heart of the European  Union [EU], a paradox that mirrors the ambivalence so many  Europeans currently feel towards the rest of the continent. In  times of crisis the Union is seen to have let its peoples down,  notably by failing to act to stop the killing in Bosnia; at  other times it is cast as a secretive, self-inflating  bureaucracy bent on over-regulating the lives of its citizens  just to keep its staff in business. It is at once too powerful  and yet not powerful enough, a beast showing the strength of a  bear and the timidity of a door-mouse, and both on the wrong  occasions.    For many, Europe has temporarily lost its bearings. Recent  history helps explain why: the painful reunification of Europe  has collided with the deepest recession since the 1930s, leaving  the shining emblems of a bold and prosperous Europe in the 1980s  looking tarnished alongside the unemployment of the l990s. As  the Danes rejected Maastricht and the money-changers gambled on  France doing the same, it seemed the dominoes of Europe's  delicate consensus in favour of integration were falling one by  one.    Europe must rebuild the confidence shaken from it by recent  history to face the tough decisions that history has now thrust  upon it. The countries of Central and East Europe, fearful of  backsliding in Russia, are knocking ever louder at the Union's  door; the vexed question of monetary union is now resurfacing;  Bosnia has exposed the need for a shared foreign and security  policy but also the immense obstacles to achieving it; the  interdependence of the world economy is calling on Europe to  restore its industrial competitiveness, and seemingly  unstoppable growth in Asia is telling it to do so fast.    If the Union is to confront these issues with unity and  resolve, it needs to carry the people with it. This, above all,  means putting the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in law for  the first time in the Maastricht treaty -- to work.    Subsidiarity, properly practised, should defy the pro- and  anti-federalists alike, for it means striking a balance between  intervention and abstention, allowing decision-making to settle  at the most appropriate level. It is not a static principle but  one which should allow for the ebb and flow of responsibility  between regional, national and European authorities, according  to the need for Europeans to act alone or together at any moment.    If it is to stall excessive centralisation, the burden of  proof must fall on those arguing for decisions to be taken by  the Union itself, and the least restrictive instrument should be  used. All legislation should be screened accordingly, and no  powers should be set in stone -- indeed, there may be cases  where national governments have acquired the expertise to  perform the task hitherto allotted to the Union just as  adequately, and the reins could then be handed back to them.  Knowing when to stop will, therefore, be instrumental in  restoring the Union's credibility.    But equally, the true application of the principle of  subsidiarity means that, where acting together at European Union  level enables something more desirable to be achieved more  effectively, the Union should not hesitate to take the necessary  action. Europe's collective achievements -- the creation of a  unified market and effective single policies on competition and  trade, for example -- should have proved to its detractors by  now that team work at European level can enable each country to  score more highly for itself than it could have done alone,  however tiresome its team-mates may seem at times. Yet  widespread distrust persists. The Union's duty, therefore, is  not simply to accrue power when times are good and wash its  hands of those responsibilities when times are bad: it is to  assist governments in the search for the best level at which to  take each decision, and draw ordinary people into that process.    To do that, the democratic element in the European Union  must  be reinforced. With 12 national parliaments and one European  Parliament all empowered to scrutinise European laws, Europe has  considerable means of democratic expression, but much of that  potential is wasted. National parliaments seldom analyse  European laws with the degree of scrutiny those laws deserve.  They appear to exert little influence over their ministers when  the latter meet at Union level to adopt new laws. Often  national and European MPs are locked in opposition, one  suspecting the other of tugging policy too far towards, or away  from, the centre of Europe.    This need not be. For, if harnessed jointly to the  decision-making wheel, they would complement each other.  Through a Committee of Parliaments, national MPs could be  assigned specific powers alongside their counterparts in the  Strasbourg assembly, so reassuring voters that power over their  lives is not ebbing abroad to bodies they did not elect.    The Committee of Parliaments could ensure power was  exercised  at the right level and on the right legal grounds: it could  watch over subsidiarity, with the power to ask the European  Court of Justice to adjudicate if necessary; ensure laws have  the correct legal base (a common battleground among governments  fearing the Union may be growing by stealth); and check when  governments consider extending the Union,s authority.    Only if it realises its democratic potential can the Union  face the greatest challenge: the drive to maintain efficiency as  it takes in more countries. The Union,s decision-making  machinery, which has hardly changed since the Community began,  is already creaking under the weight of 12 countries. It will  creak more loudly with 16, and grind to a halt if Europe  enlarges thereafter. But to lock out Central and East European  countries on these grounds is inexcusable.    Instead the inter-governmental conference that is to be  held in 1996 should centre on the simple, but intractable  question: how should we change the way the European Union is run  to enable us to admit a substantial number of new countries  without the Union grinding to a halt? This involves looking at  how the Union's institutions work: the Commission and the  Parliament, as well as the Council of Ministers and a fresh look  at the voting questions which have caused such agonised debate.  But we would also have to widen our analysis if the countries  of East and Central Europe were to be absorbed into the Union in  due course.    The collapse of communism is forcing a more sharply focused  consideration of Union policy towards its Eastern neighbours.  The question is no longer one merely of foreign policy -- it is  central to the future of the Union itself. The loss of Soviet  markets made East Europeans look west for business but the  threat of Russian nationalism is sharpening their demand for  membership of the European fold, in economic, political and  security terms.    War in Europe, too, is forcing Nato to confront the need for  its European members to develop a more autonomous security  policy within the alliance, as Soviet might gives way to  smaller, less easily identifiable security threats closer home.  The old dichotomy between reinforcing the European pillar of  Nato and maintaining the transatlantic link is withering away as  the U.S. encourages Europe's autonomy within the Western  European Union [WEU] and France begins to shed its staunchly  independent view of defence. Developing a true European pole  within Nato, but one also capable of acting outside it under the  WEU, is now realistic and should be encouraged.    The European Union should also gradually lift its remaining  barriers to trade from the East, while urging East Europe to  adopt competition and other market rules similar to its own.  Yesterday those countries needed aid and advice on how to build  a market economy; today they also need investment and the  infrastructure and economic stability to attract it as painful  reforms take root. The West's role must also be made more  visible, to help prevent people turning their back on those  reforms. Ultimately it is economic prosperity that will weld the  continent together, leading to a joint political future in one  Union, each country in its own time.    Prosperity is also the most effective agent of integration  in  West Europe -- a lesson apparent from the lack of support for  European integration as the recession and unemployment bite.  The Union will sink or swim on its ability to restore the  competitiveness of its economy. Through its role as "steward"  of Europe, the Union must establish order among a series of  often competing priorities -- for example, the protection of  Europe's rural communities while encouraging agriculture to  compete without excessive subsidies; or the creation of a social  safety net which does not stifle industry; or the need to close  the wealth gap by bringing poor countries up to richer ones, and  not vice versa. Any attempt to muddle through -- merely to  "manage" these issues rather than to introduce real reform where  necessary will not work. The reason is that one priority  thwarts all others: the need to compete on world markets.    Only a detailed and dispassionate analysis of Europe's  economic woes can find a common cure. This process has begun  with the Commission's white paper on Growth, Competitiveness and  Employment. It is clear the Union must pursue existing policies  with renewed vigour, for example by completing the single  market; loosening the grip that monopolies still hold over  Europe's transport, energy and communications networks, while  channelling private capital more smoothly into those networks;  and ensuring that we and our competitors abide by the stringent  new trade rules agreed in the Uruguay Round. We also need  improved research to turn good ideas into market-beating  exports; to encourage the growth of small companies and  entrepreneurship; to reduce state subsidies to ailing  enterprises; and to ensure more efficient spending of the Union  budget, not just by quashing fraud but also by shifting staff  more quickly to confront new challenges.    Of the cures, two of the most potent are also among the most  controversial. First Europe has to improve the versatility of  its workforce. This does not mean neglecting health and safety,  or hiring and firing for short-term gain; rather, it means  removing rigidities which discourage employers from creating  jobs, and correcting the mismatch between the skills people  learn and those they require for the posts available. The Union  itself can remove barriers to workers seeking jobs abroad;  provide "marriage guidance" for industries looking for the most  suitable training schemes in Europe; and help distill  conflicting national views on social policy into common  principles upon which European industry can rely, not through  coercion but through debate. This will help governments shift  their focus away from merely protecting old industries towards  propagating new ones.    Secondly, the European currency crisis has not destroyed the  Continental consensus in favour of a single currency, although  it has shifted the debate over how to achieve it and by when.  Far from exploiting their monetary freedom after the crisis,  most EU countries have followed fiscal and monetary policies  consistent with the approach laid down in Maastricht. In fact  they have not used the greater freedom given to them by the  wider band in the revised ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism]. It  might be however, that the best way of achieving EMU [European  Monetary Union] would be to seek agreement on a trans-Union  non-inflationary monetary target, and for each country to be  able to lower interest rates provided this would not risk  breaching that target. This might mean more rapid emergence  from recession and a pattern of exchange rates based on economic  fundamentals which could, in due course, provide the basis for a  single currency. That goal seems to me to be as valid and as  attainable as ever, even if by slightly different means.    It is ironic that people are most tempted to spurn the  European Union when their countries, need for it is greatest.  Grafting a split continent back together is no mean feat,  particularly when it forces radical change to the structure of  the European house and brings fresh competition to an economy  grappling with recession. The overarching aim must be to  achieve that unity while assuring Europe's place in an ever more  competitive world. It can only be done by a Union that is  democratic, transparent and restrained enough in its actions to  be confident and deserving of the public support it needs.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Three Israeli Jews "who may have some connection" with the slaying of a  Palestinian outside the Old City of Jerusalem have been taken into custody, an  Israeli police spokesman said. Khaled Shaweesh, 26, was killed Monday night,  apparently by an Jewish gunman. Three other Arabs were seriously wounded. A  mysterious Jewish group, the Sicarites, called Israel Radio for a second time,  claiming responsibility for the shootings. The caller said the attack was to  avenge the stoning of Jews by Arabs on Friday at the Western Wall. About 1,300  Arab mourners, some waving the banned Palestinian flag, took part in the  funeral procession for Shaweesh.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 21 (TANJUG) -- Ranking Bosnian Muslim  official Arif Pasalic said on Monday that "the Muslim forces  must war on for the liberation of entire Bosnia-Herzegovina."    In an interview given to the Zagreb weekly DANAS, Muslim  Deputy Foreign Minister Pasalic listed as the Muslim priorities  at this time the recapture of the Lasva River Valley in central  Bosnia and the launching of a counter-offensive in the Brcko  area in the north and the Mostar area in the southwest.    "It is our strategic objective to liberate central Bosnia  (from Croat control). If we accomplish this, we shall improve  our chances in the valleys of the Neretva in the southwest and  the Bosna in the north, and, eventually, for the liberation of  all of Bosnia-Herzegovina," he underscored.    "It does not matter if it takes eight months, or four years,  or even 12 years, we must and can war on," said Pasalic.    The statement came at a time when tensions have been eased  around Sarajevo with the withdrawal and placing of Bosnian Serb  and Muslim artillery under U.N. control, which most politicians  and media in the world interpret as a major step forward in  bringing the peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Bosnian Muslims have invariably been rejecting all peace  offers for Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the belief, encouraged by  military successes against the Croats in central Bosnia, that  they would get more territory at arms than they could at the  conference table.</p>

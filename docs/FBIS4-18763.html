			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reimar Paul report: "Bomblets Being Made Ready for </F> Delivery to Turkey"]    [Text] Goettingen -- According to the initiative "Stop the  Export of Weapons" of the Federal Congress of Action Groups for  Development Policies (BUKO), the German-Netherlands company  Eurometaal wants to export weapons illegally to Turkey. The  planned delivery involves ammunition for artillery shells --  so-called bomblets. The approximately 300,000 explosives are  currently being finished and made ready for delivery.    A spokeswoman of the Federal Economics Ministry told BUKO  that a corresponding export permit for Eurometaal has not been  issued. All previous permits were granted on condition that the  enterprise delivers its products to the Netherlands. From  there, the ammunition must not be exported. Eurometaal has a  tradition of exporting weapons to Turkey. As early as in  November 1992, the MONITOR news magazine reported that the  company planned to supply artillery shells to Ankara. After  official protests -- and the oft-mentioned suspicion that the  ammunition would be used against Kurds -- the firm decided to  export a whole production plant. The plant parts that were  transported on Turkish trucks are currently being assembled in  the town of Kirikale, where the weapons factory is to be  established, as DER SPIEGEL reported.    A document of the Defense Ministry in The Hague, which is  available to BUKO, shows that up to 309,000 artillery shells  with the effect of bomblets are to be produced in Kirikale.  Their value is estimated at 400,000 German marks. The bomblets  that are currently being finished in Liebenau after a complaint  during a quality test are to be exported to Turkey by the end of  the year.</p>

"I request (the passage) by the end of March," Saito told a  regular press conference.    He was referring to reports of a possible delay in tax cuts  because Diet deliberations may be tied up by the opposition  parties led by the Liberal Democratic Party.    Under the tax scheme, the government plans to give half of  the scheduled cut in national income tax in the pay packets  containing the annual summer bonuses, and the other half with  the year-end tax adjustment.    Saito said that implementation of the tax cuts should be  done  as early as possible to help the economy recover.    Concerning the continued rise in long-term interest rates,  Saito repeated that he would watch "for a little while" to judge  the trend and its economic impact, stressing "overall levels are  still low."    He also indicated his intention to watch the trend in  Japan's  current account surplus.    "We can't judge only on single month...And the downward  trend  in volume remained intact," he said, referring to the  politically sensitive surplus for January that showed signs of  resuming an upward trend.    The January surplus posted a rise from a year earlier for  the  second straight month, advancing 30.9 percent in dollar terms.  The yen-denominated figure increased 16.8 percent to mark the  first rise in six months.</p>

Speaking with the press after his meeting with General  George  Joulwan, commander of Atlantic alliance forces in Europe, the  Italian minister said that, until now, no request has been made  for the deployment of Italian troops in Bosnia and, were this to  occur in the future, the decision would be up to the Italian  Government and parliament.    Nevertheless, Fabbri did state that "in the future, I think  that, with a peace agreement signed by all sides and in the  framework of a NATO operation to ensure its application, the  possible use of the Italian military would be, in effect,  plausible."    During today's meeting, Fabbri said General Joulwan voiced  the gratitude of the Atlantic alliance for the "extraordinary"  support for operations in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

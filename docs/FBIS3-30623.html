It had  been convened by the initiative committee for the organization  of the congress. During the two-day proceedings, the congress  established the new by-laws, elected the new party president and  leadership members, and discussed and endorsed the Program and  Political Declaration of the National Liberal Party. The  Political Declaration presented by Petre Dragomir declares,  quote: We are now able to address the country and we want to  participate, through our work and the values that liberalism  promotes in society, in the development and modernization of our  society, unquote.    At the end of the congress proceedings, Radu Campeanu,  elected by the congress as president of the PNL, said that  following this congress, the members of the leadership bodies  who recognize Mircea Ionescu-Quintus as president of the party  became mere party members. We do not exclude anyone, we do not  wage war with anyone, but we believe that we have to conduct  talks, to invite everyone to participate in a dialogue, Radu  Campeanu concluded. We recall that at the Brasov meeting, the  Central Standing Bureau of the PNL termed the congress in  Bucharest, quote: A meeting of Mr. Campeanu's supporters.</p>

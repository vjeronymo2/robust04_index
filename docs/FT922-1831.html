			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Bullish undertone THE BULLISH undertone to trading in the sterling cash market continued yesterday, even though the Bank of England forecast a large shortage which dealers took most of the day to remove. Period rates were a touch softer at the close of trading, perhaps because the market was still swayed by the UK chancellor of the exchequer's comments the previous day. Mr Norman Lamont had suggested that sterling could enter the narrow bands of the European Monetary System, with the implication that a stronger currency would make a base rate cut more likely. One trader felt that the expectation of a base rate reduction may also have been strengthened by stock market difficulties in Japan, where the Nikkei average ended down 400.24 at a 68-month low. The possibility of a drop in world stock markets encouraged some traders to think that central banks could ease interest rates to reverse the trend. Whatever the reason, the markets had a bullish undertone. 1-month money in the sterling interbank market ended at 9 15/16 per cent from a previous 10 1/16 per cent. 3-month money closed at 9 31/32 per cent, down from 10 per cent. In the futures market, however, the September short sterling contract lost two ticks to 90.24 and December was down one tick at 90.54. This was a less bearish performance than it might have been, considering that the market took the entire day to remove a shortage forecast at Pounds 1.2bn in the morning. Traders appeared to be unwilling to offer bills, perhaps holding their fire before the even larger shortage expected today. The overnight rate spent much of the day around 12 1/2 per cent. Again, the Bank dealt at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, 9 21/32 per cent for Band 3, 9 19/32 per cent for Band 4 and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreements (repos). In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 7m of Band 3 bank bills, and Pounds 80m for resale to the market in equal amounts on July 8 and 9. The Bank then bought Pounds 68m in Band 1, Pounds 15m in Band 3, Pounds 7m in Band 4 and Pounds 30m in repos. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 692m in Band 1, Pounds 5m in Band 2, Pounds 56m in Band 3, Pounds 5m in Band 4 and Pounds 20m in repos.</p>

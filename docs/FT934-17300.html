			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sykes-Pickavant Sykes-Pickavant Group, the USM-quoted maker of hand tools and diagnostic equipment, announced a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 402,000 to Pounds 91,000 for the half year to June 30. Mr Ray Way, chairman, said the main event at the Lytham site had been the introduction of a new integrated computer system. He said that 'significant teething problems' were now over and that as a result the first half was made up of a loss in the first quarter offset by a profit in the second. The interim dividend, which is cut to 1.33p (2.25p), is uncovered by earnings of 0.58p (2.75p) per share. The shares fell 8p to 55p.</p>

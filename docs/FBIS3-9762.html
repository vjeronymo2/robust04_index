Kalvoda appeared in a  Nova television station discussion programme "7 or Seven Days."    Lack of "coalition communication" is a serious matter,  Kalvoda said, adding that the fact that several government  proposals have been turned down by parliament proved his  argument.    "It is possible to ponder over the weight of this or that  party in the light of election results but we can only wield  parliamentary majority if we stay together," Kalvoda said,  adding that a working coalition communication would prevent  media disclosures of clashes during debates.    Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec (ODS) said in the programme  that often what happens in cases like that is that "small  coalition parties try to assert themselves even at the cost of  breaking the coalition." Zieleniec said that he considered it  important to "lead public discussion."    The government-proposed Senate elections bill has not been  drafted by the ODS but by the Interior Ministry, Zieleniec said.    A week ago, ODA deputy chairman Daniel Kroupa said in an  interview with Nova that the parliamentary and Senate elections  bill had been worked out by the ODS with an eye to gaining the  ODS a position of advantage.</p>

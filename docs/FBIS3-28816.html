			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Shinichi Yoshida] </F>   [Text] Washington, 10 Feb -- "It is believed that Prime  Minister Hosokawa established the Japan New Party, while  advocating the need to open the Japanese market by tearing down  the bureaucratic system." While both Japanese and American  negotiators are continuing their last-ditch efforts to seek a  political settlement of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  the U.S. Government, taking aim at Prime Minister Hosokawa, is  coming out to politically jolt the prime minister in an  unprecedented way in a bid to press him to make a political  decision on Japan's acceptance of the U.S. trade demands as a  "reformist," while citing his past statements.    At a 9 February news conference at the White House, U.S.  Trade Representative Kantor and other American officials took  tough attitude toward Japan. At the news conference, Mr. Cutter,  assistant to the president, said: "A consensus has been built in  the Japanese society that Japan must open its market, but our  Japanese negotiating counterparts take a view different from the  consensus. We have called them bureaucrats, but we had better  call them obstinate officials of the Japanese Government." In  this way, the senior American official attacked bureaucrats in  Kasumigaseki in an unprecedentedly harsh tone.    At the news conference, an unidentified reporter asked: "If  the prime minister were put to shame, will it not put  U.S.-supported Japanese reforms in danger?" In response, Mr.  Kantor said, "He will not be put to shame for holding frank  discussions." He also stressed that the prime minister, in his  article written when he established the Japan New Party last  year, stated that tearing down the Japanese bureaucratic system  will result in building a society where priority is given to  consumers." He went on to say: "We are trying to consolidate  the fragile power base for the Hosokawa government."    Claiming that the reason for the deadlock in the Japan-U.S.  negotiations lies in the Japanese bureaucratic system, the U.S.  Government has pinned its hopes on the prime minister to make a  political decision to break the deadlock. The actual situation,  however, is that the prime minister has relied on bureaucrats  for his management of policies and the U.S. Government learned  about the situation from the tax-increase upheaval that occurred  shortly before the prime minister left Japan for Washington.  The U.S. Government, therefore, is trying to drive a wedge  between the prime minister and the bureaucrats on the eve of the  Japan-U.S. summit talks.    The U.S. Government does not anticipate that the prime  minister will easily act at the beck of its tactics, but it is  revealing its intention to whip up "domestic pressure" in Japan  by selling the Japanese the impression that the "United States  stands by Japanese consumers." It can be said that the United  States is trying to adopt a Japanese version of the  "campaign-style politics" that the Clinton administration has  used to drum up public support through a publicity offensive.</p>

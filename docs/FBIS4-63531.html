			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Oliynyk: "Rumors About Conversion Are </F> Considerably Exaggerated"]    [Text] The production of military technology and weapons  has decreased several times over, rather than by a civilized  number of percent. For example, whereas, earlier, any  defense-industry plant in Ukraine manufactured 70 or 80 percent  of military products, it presently only manufactures about 10  percent of them, without producing any civilian products  instead. Is it now possible to say that conversion is in  progress in Ukraine? Experts believe that one can now talk of a  different thing -- the decline and collapse of the previously  mighty and science-intensive branch of machine building and the  military-industrial complex.    It does not take a prophet to point out once again that the  problem of conversion in Ukraine is extremely important.  Ukraine is the second most powerful representative of the  former Union's military-industrial complex after Russia. There  are, in Ukraine, 800 ship-, tank-, and aircraft-building plants  that used to be constituent parts of the might of the former  USSR. Ukraine tried to convert the military-industrial complex  and machine building. Why tried? Because the state program is  based upon a program-oriented principle and was elaborated for  400 enterprises. Precisely this program envisaged the  transition of their work to satisfy civilian needs and a  decrease in military production. Regarding the former, that is  to say, the cessation of the manufacture of military products,  it has, indeed, taken place. However, not in accordance with a  systematic program, but as a result of a spontaneous reduction  in the production of military technology and weapons. Production  has been reduced severalfold.    The reason for this is, primarily, the fact that the  Russians  used to be customers of Ukrainian plants, but, presently, they  are creating their own industries. The second reason is the  extremely low wages of workers in the machine building and  military-industrial complexes, averaging between 600,000 and  800,000 karbovantsi [K] a month. What actually took place there  was not conversion, since, as a result, we have empty production  shops, workers who have not been retrained, the unprocessed  technological specifications, and the loss of production  potential.    The state program was developed in 1991-92. If one can put  it this way, it took place in a different state. At that time,  Ukraine's financial situation was different, there were  different reserves and resources, and the rate of inflation was  not so unrestrained. If you remember, the collapse occurred at  the beginning of 1994, and all calculations of the state program  were eaten up by inflation.    Nor are Western investors in any hurry to come to Ukraine.  Despite the fact that both Germany and the United States showed  an interest in investing in Ukrainian conversion. Nothing went  beyond talk and intentions, even though the Ukrainian Government  did try to attract Western capital by its conversion projects.  The reason is simple and banal: Money may only be given for  private industries, whereas the entire defense industry is  state-controlled. There is still no money and nor is there the  sum of $40 million that was recently promised by Americans. If  this money is granted to Ukraine in the near future, almost half  of it will go for remunerating the labor of U.S. specialists and  experts. By way of comparison, I will quote the following  figure: Experts have estimated that at least tens of billions  of U.S. dollars may be needed for the renovation and conversion  of Ukrainian defense capacities.    Having appraised the situation, Western investors were,  frankly speaking, pleased with such a state of affairs. First  and foremost, they got rid of a powerful competitor in weapons  production on the world market, and that is why the firms of the  United States, France, Germany, and Sweden presently reign  there. The West no longer fears the capacity of Ukraine's  defense plants, which live from hand to mouth. Finally,  Ukraine, having reduced, by tens of times, its manufacture of  weapons and military products, has not proceeded to  manufacturing competitive civilian products. This means that,  in the next few years, we will not, so to speak, present any  hazard on the world market of modern civilian products.    There also arises the following question: If the state is so  poor, why doesn't the government make use of private capital for  implementing conversion. This capital in Ukraine is not very  mighty, but it does exist. I mean the capital of between $5  billion and $7 billion that has been taken abroad since the  establishment of independence and that works for the Western  economy. The reason is that, however painful it may be to  admit, Ukraine and its state apparatus still remain successors  to the Ukrainian SSR. Everything proceeds by the inertia of the  former Council of Ministers, as the people there have remained  the same with the same mentality.    Even though not a single statesman will specify the  country's  losses due to the collapse of the military-production potential,  in accordance with rough estimates by experts, Ukraine has  already lost several billion U.S. dollars in pure income, not to  mention the fact that, with a true conversion, we would have  preserved the scientific and production base and potential worth  tens of billions of U.S. dollars. The aircraft- and  tank-building industries have been particularly affected, as  well as plants and enterprises manufacturing radio equipment.    It goes without saying that all of this is not only due to  foot dragging or poor economic management, but this does not  make things easier.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank of England may make novel gilt issues The Bank of England is exploring the issue of zero-coupon UK government bonds and ways of aiding investors to separate the income stream from gilt-edged stock, as part of its programme of making UK government bonds more attractive to international investors. Mr Ian Plenderleith, the Bank's executive director for monetary policy operations, said it was also considering new types of security to meet the needs of pension funds. 'We continue to seek views from market participants on the scale of possible interest in zero-coupon instruments and in coupon-stripping facilities,' Mr Plenderleith told the Third City of London Central Banking Conference yesterday. 'Changes in the pension industry may generate demand for new forms of government security,' he added. Although Mr Plenderleith gave no further details, it is thought that the Bank could be considering the issue of gilts with very long maturities for pension funds. The issue of zero-coupon bonds, which reward investors through capital gains rather than interest payments, will have to overcome Inland Revenue rules that have so far prevented their sale, and the sale of deep discount UK bonds. Mr Plenderleith said the UK government bond and money markets were 'in the midst of a significant process of continuing change'. But officials said the ideas floated yesterday constituted a 'wish list' rather than specific plans. However, the Bank is expected to discuss possible rule changes with the Treasury and UK tax authorities.</p>

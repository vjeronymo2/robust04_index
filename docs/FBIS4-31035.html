			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview and phone-in question-and-answer session </F> with Laszo Kovacs, chief foreign affairs expert of the Hungarian  Socialist Party, by unidentified announcer -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Welcome to Laszlo Kovacs, foreign  affairs expert of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. The  foreign affairs policy of the MSZP--which has been elected to  government--and the party's relations with Hungarians living  beyond our border are on our agenda here. [passage omitted] Do  you consider a wide-ranging regional autonomy justified where  the composition of population is suitable for this, for example  in Szeklerland? [passage omitted]    [Kovacs] I think that the demand for autonomy is a justified  endeavor of the Hungarians beyond the border wherever they live  in large numbers on a certain territory. Furthermore,  Szeklerland is in a special situation; it is rather far away  from the Hungarian border, so the idea of fulfilling the demand  for autonomy would, by any chance, lead to the upsetting of  borders. This is certainly an important and, at the same time,  sensitive issue, which can only be approached and put on the  talks agenda if the sides concerned approach it with good  intentions. This is why we consider it so important that Hungary  and its neighbors should have basically good relations, because  these issues cannot even be put on the agenda without it.    [Announcer] Yes, Gyula Horn has several times mentioned that  there is a need for a historical reconciliation with our  neighbors. What does this mean exactly?    [Kovacs] We mean that we have to settle our relations, first  of all with Slovakia and Romania, which have become very tense  over the past years. We have never said....[pauses] We even  emphasized that this was not exclusively the Hungarian  Government's fault. What we said was that the Hungarian  Government was not able to handle the tensions, which had  occurred for objective reasons, for example, because of the  nationalistic endeavors in neighboring countries and, on the  other hand, the Hungarian Government itself contributed to this  tension with some clumsy statements and unfortunate steps.    Well, we are of the view that the settlement of these  relations is inevitable for several reasons. On the one hand,  it is obvious that relations with our neighbors constitute a  security policy issue for Hungary; on the other hand,  Hungary--and any country in general--cannot exist without  pursuing extensive economic-commercial cooperation with its  neighbors. The third specific question is that the life of  Hungarians living in neighboring countries cannot improve if we  forego, from the outset, the means provided by settled relations  and dialogue.    Where else could we raise these problems? I do not believe  that any kind of pressure can be put on our neighbors with  canceled visits--or even with visits that have not taken place.  The experience of the past four years has not proved the  usefulness or productivity of this approach. Hungary does not  have such influence that any kind of effect could be achieved in  this way. With certain exaggeration I can even say that Hungary  cannot put pressure on Romania with success because Romania is  twice as big as Hungary, and we cannot put pressure on Slovakia  because Slovakia is half as big as Hungary and, therefore, twice  as sensitive. Exercising pressure must be excluded from our  means.    [Announcer] [passage omitted] What kind of guarantees does  the MSZP see that Romanians will observe their minimal promises  to the Hungarian minority, since they have never kept their  promises in 70 years?    [Kovacs] I think that it is an absurdity to sit down at the  international negotiations table with the assumption that my  partner is lying or that my partner has never kept his promises.  This is an absurdity. In this case there is no point in  sitting down, there is no sense in negotiations. [passage  omitted] I see only one guarantee. There is a need for an  international--bilateral--agreement, the frequently mentioned  Basic Treaty, which includes real elements of guarantee, in  respect of which the sides can be called to account. I have  also hopes for the initiative called the Balladur plan, the  opening conference for which took place in Paris just last week.    [Announcer] Does the MSZP--and you personally--think that  the so-called Ukrainian clause could be included in these basic  treaties?    [Kovacs] I think, yes. However, I have to add....    [Announcer, interrupting] Both in the Hungarian-Romanian and  the Hungarian-Slovak Basic Treaties?    [Kovacs] I think, basically yes. However, those who say  this, that this Hungarian-Ukrainian Basic Treaty cannot set a  precedent, are also right. A Hungarian-Ukrainian Basic Treaty  cannot set a precedent for a Hungarian-Slovak or a  Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty on a one-to-one basis.    However, I regard it as a mistake that, at the time some  government politicians categorically said that a basic treaty of  this kind will not be concluded any more. What kind of basic  treaties will we then conclude? Naturally, the  Hungarian-Ukrainian, the Hungarian-Romanian, and the  Hungarian-Slovak basic treaties will not literally match.  However, I think that the content of the future basic treaties  will be similar to the Hungarian-Ukrainian one.    It will not be possible to evade two questions in them: One  of them is the repeated confirmation of the borders, the  renouncing of territorial claims; our neighbors insist on it and  we have no reasons for evading them, because we really do not  have territorial claims, because we really do accept the current  borders. This is not an argument because we have confirmed it  hundreds of times. Since we have accepted it hundreds of times,  there is no reason why we should not do it another time.    Another question that cannot be evaded is guaranteeing the  rights of the Hungarian minority living there and--let me add,  since it is a bilateral matter--the minorities living here.  [passage omitted]    Our political rivals often accuse us of intending to  conclude  unilateral basic treaties. [passage omitted] We have never said  that. We have always stressed that the border issue and the  minority issue cannot be evaded either in the basic treaties.    [Announcer] [passage omitted] Will the future Hungarian  Government undertake the representation of Hungarians beyond the  border if they cannot represent themselves--as it happened at  the opening conference--in the European stability process.    [Kovacs] [passage omitted] Agreements on minorities in this  matter, with which the minorities themselves do not agree,  cannot be concluded. This is obviously absurd. Therefore, some  kind of solution has to be found so that the minorities can  present their endeavors and interests. [passage omitted]  Hungarian foreign policy, in my view, should not be considering  whether to undertake or not the representation of the  minorities, but far more than that: the question of how to  convince the sides concerned in the conference that the  minorities have to have their say. A solution has to be found  for this.    [Announcer] [passage omitted] What are the MSZP's plans with  Duna Television? Will the MSZP support it with grants from the  budget?    [Kovacs] [passage omitted] If Duna Television really  usefully  contributes to the cause of normal relations between Hungary and  its neighbors and--by this, together with this, parallel with  this--the cause of Hungarians beyond the border, I think that  Duna Television will be worthy of support. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Thank you very much for the answers from Laszlo  Kovacs, about whom it is being said in Budapest that he is a  possible candidate for the post of foreign minister.    [Kovacs] I think that it will be decided by the coalition  talks, with particular regard to the question of which of the  possible coalition partners will get the foreign affairs  portfolio....    [Announcer interrupting] But if it is offered?    [Kovacs] Naturally, this is such a professional  challenge--it  will be the peak of my foreign affairs career--that I would say  yes, but at the moment we are not talking about it.    [Announcer] Thank you very much.</p>

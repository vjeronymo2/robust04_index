			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> INFANT 'STABLE' AFTER FALLING INTO POOL  </P> <P> An infant boy was in stable condition Monday after falling into a swimming pool  and receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation from his grandfather, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Larry Martinez, 20 months, was riding a tricycle around in the back yard of his  grandparents' house on the 4800 block of Marion Street when he fell into the  swimming pool about 6 p.m. Sunday, Police Sgt. Ray Peterson said.  </P> <P> The grandmother told police the infant had been left unattended for only a few  minutes when she found him floating face down in the pool. The grandfather  pulled the unconscious boy from the pool.  </P> <P> The grandparents, whose names were not released, called the 911 emergency  number and were turned over to an Orange County Fire dispatcher who gave the  grandfather CPR instructions, said Peterson.  </P> <P> When police arrived, they "found that the child had resumed labored breathing,"  Peterson said. Paramedics took the boy to Los Alamitos Medical Center. The  child was later transported to Long Beach Memorial Hospital where he was listed  in stable but "favorable" condition, Peterson said.MATT LAIT  </P></p>

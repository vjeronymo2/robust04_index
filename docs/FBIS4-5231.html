			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The governing coalition  parties kicked off debate Friday on a possible successor to  outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    "The timing of the mass resignation of the Hosokawa cabinet  will be set after our candidate to replace him is decided and  elected as premier at the House of Representatives plenary  session," Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP), told a news conference.    The No. 2 man of the largest coalition contingent also  revealed that the ruling coalition leaders decided at a Friday  evening meeting to further coordinate their basic policies  before launching a new government.    While basically agreeing to form a fresh government under  the  framework of the current coalition, the coalition leaders also  agreed on the need to narrow down differences over their basic  policies in order to push for new reforms, Kubo said.    "Now that we are entering a second phase of the coalition  government, it is necessary for us to reach a fresh accord on  our basic policies," he said.    Inaugurated last August as a "political reform  administration," the Hosokawa government almost succeeded in  seeing through political reform aimed at weeding out rampant  political corruption in Japan.    Hosokawa, who heads a seven-party coalition government,  announced earlier Friday he will step down in taking political  and moral responsibility for his allegedly shady finacial  dealings.    The 56-year-old premier, a scion of a distinguished Samurai  family in southwestern Japan, swept into power as a standard  bearer of various reforms, including reform intended to  transform the scandal-prone Japanese political system.    The leaders of the ruling parties will resume talks on the  selection of a candidate for the premiership on Saturday  afternoon, Kubo said.    Kubo spoke of the need for the coalition to choose a  successor to Hosokawa and form a new government as quickly as  possible so as to win Diet approval for the budget for fiscal  1994, which started April 1.    It is widely believed among coalition members that Deputy  Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is the best  candidate to succeed Hosokawa.    But some are cautious about the idea of Hata becoming the  next premier, because he is the leader of Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party), a major component of the coalition.    Shinseito, along with Komeito, has been criticized within  the  coalition for its allegedly forceful manner in the policy-making  process.    Kubo said SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama is also a potential  candidate to succeed Hosokawa as he heads the biggest force in  the coalition.    "Our party chairman is qualified for the job," he said.    Questioned about the possibility of the current coalition  joining hands with the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), Kubo said only, "I don't think there is any party and  political group contemplating a tie-up with the LDP."    The once-dominant LDP lost the reins of government last  August after a 38-year uninterrupted lock on power. It has  refused to participate in Diet budget debate until Hosokawa  clears himself of allegations about his personal finances.</p>

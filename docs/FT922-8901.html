			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: Remedy for inadequacies of UK agricultural co-ops Sir, Tim Coone in his article 'Irish milkmen discover talent for butchery' (April 14) highlights the growth of the Irish agricultural co-operative sector and refers to their hybrid co-operative/plc structure as both an innovative and potentially inhibiting factor in future growth. Recent encouragement by UK ministers for farmers in the UK to establish agricultural co-operatives, like their counterparts in many member states of the European Community, focuses the spotlight on the inadequacies of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts which is the principal legislation under which agricultural co-operatives are registered. There have been a number of innovations in co-operative law in other European countries in recent years. These include the issue of non-voting shares or limited voting shares as well as financial instruments, similar to the permanent interest bearing shares issued by building societies, which might be traded on the stock market. Such improvements to co-operative law also appear in the proposal for a European co-operative statute which was issued in March 1992 by the European Commission. If the UK government seeks to enlarge a strong agricultural co-operative sector in the UK then it must ensure that co-operative law, in the form of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, becomes a modern and effective business medium while retaining co-operative principles. This will only happen if the Treasury gives a clear green light to its immediate update and to improving the resources of the Registry of Friendly Societies to examine legislative change.

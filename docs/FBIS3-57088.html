It is necessary now to adopt  federal laws registering the new political reality in Russia,  first deputy speaker of the State Duma Mikhail Mityukov said on  Wednesday. He presented to deputies of the lower chamber of the  Federal Assembly the plan for Duma's legislative work.    Mikhail Mityukov noted the need of consolidating  legislatively real parliamentarism that is forming in the  country. It is based on clear separation of power and  interaction of all branches of power. In this connection it is  planned to draw up laws that will create a legal base for the  State Duma of the future convocations.    The first deputy speaker of the duma said that the plan  includes federal constitutional laws, among them the laws on the  referendum, on the government of the Russian Federation, on the  judiciary reform in Russia and on the powers, the procedure of  forming and the activity of the constitutional court of the  Russian Federation.    Mityukov described the present civic code as outdated. He  said the part of the civic code containing its general  principles has already been drafted and will be submitted to the  State Duma.    He said the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly is to  adopt  new code on taxes, as well as the criminal code, the criminal  proceedings code, the labour and land codes, as well as the code  on the family and marriage. The Duma is also to adopt laws on  political parties and trade unions. A great number of laws  related to the economic sphere are also to be adopted, Mityukov  said.    Much attention is given to legislative acts whose adoption  will make it possible to realise complex problems of federalism  in Russia, Mityukov believes.    Mityukov also stressed the need of adopting legislative acts  in the area of international politics and foreign economic  activity, including the law on international afgreements. The  first deputy chairman of the State Duma believes that the plan  of legislative work stretched far beyond the term of the present  Duma, so it is necessary to adress priorities. Mityukov said  the adoption of new laws will promote the policy of reform. In  this connection he noted that many draft laws being drawn up by  the former Supreme Soviet were obviously populist and therefore  inflationary, and that their implementation led to the worsening  of the economic situation.</p>

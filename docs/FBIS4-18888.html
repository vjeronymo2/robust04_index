			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government will introduce  the 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge as of 1 January 1995  without limiting it to a specific period. This was affirmed by  Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an interview with ARD television on  Friday evening [8 April]. He does "not" see "any chance" for  limitation. He stressed that, apart from the solidarity  surcharge, there will not be any further increases in general  taxes next year. At the same time, however, Kohl implied  additional burdens in the sphere of traffic policy. The  ecologically sensible traffic development, which has been  introduced with the railroad reform, will cost more money.    The chancellor accused the Social Democrats of not having  any  practicable ideas in economic and tax policy. "It is the old  socialist ideas that are now being dragged out again." A  red-green [Social Democrats-Greens] coalition would destroy the  incipient economic upswing through more bureaucracy, punishment  of achievement, and social envy, Kohl said. He expressed the  conviction that the Free Democratic Party of Germany will  clearly exceed the 5 percent threshold at the elections in  October and will continue the coalition with the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. "I am  quite sure that we will win the Bundestag elections." All  indicators, in particular in the economy, are pointing to that.    Kohl warned the CDU/CSU against leaving the political  center.  "I am not at all against winning as many votes as possible from  right of center and as many votes as possible from left of  center. However, the status of our party and the basic movement  of history, of tradition, and also of the program is in the  center, and we have no intention of letting anyone else to  occupy this place."</p>

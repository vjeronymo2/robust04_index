			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Pools pioneer Sir John Moores dies at 97 SIR JOHN MOORES, the football pools inventor who turned the Littlewoods retail, mail order, pools and catalogue stores business into one of the largest privately-owned companies in Europe, died yesterday at his Formby, Merseyside, home at the age of 97. He had been in poor health since being assaulted by burglars at his home four years ago. His death puts in question the future of both Littlewoods and Everton Football Club, the premier league club which is owned by his family interests. Littlewoods, the UK's fifth largest clothes retailer and second largest mail order group, could be worth about Pounds 2bn if it were floated in the stock market. It is owned by 32 family shareholders across several generations. The family split three years ago over a plan to take Littlewoods public. Sir John marshalled opposition to the move. The pressure to float or break up the group is now likely to increase. Littlewoods' latest results showed unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 97m for 1992, on turnover up from Pounds 2.59bn to Pounds 2.71bn. Its retail interests consist of 126 chain stores across the UK, which account for about 1.9 per cent of the UK clothing market, according to Verdict, the retail market research group. The stores made a profit of Pounds 28m from sales of Pounds 696m last year. It also owns the UK's second-biggest mail order company, which controls nearly a quarter of the market. Littlewoods came close to selling this business to Quelle, the German mail order operator, in 1991, but negotiations broke down after failure to agree on a price. Sales were Pounds 974m, with profits of Pounds 55.9m. Littlewoods, although a private business, has been open to new ideas. It has two stores in St Petersburg, Russia, and earlier this year joined with Price Club Canada in a plan to open one of the UK's first warehouse clubs. Obituary, Page 25</p>

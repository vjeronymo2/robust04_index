			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Diego Suarez; from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Ibero-American Summit inaugurated today in  Cartagena supported the creation of a great commercial union  from Mexico to Argentina. It also condemned the current form of  government in Haiti and announced its support for any measure  that could guarantee the restoration of democracy in that  Caribbean nation.    The technical commissions preparing the Ibero-American  Presidential Summit in Cartagena ended their first day of work  with a firm rejection of any form of commercial restrictions,  including economic blockades, and a call to Latin American  governments to be more flexible toward foreign investments.    For more than 12 hours, the representatives of Brazil,  Colombia, Spain, Argentina, and Mexico worked on the final draft  of a 15-page document to be signed by the 22 presidents who will  meet in Cartagena starting tomorrow. In the document, the  presidents openly condemn the current form of government in  Haiti and give a green light to the implementation of  exceptional measures to restore democracy on that island.    [Begin Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolano recording]  Cuba condemns the illegal regime established in Haiti against  President Aristide.

[end recording]    The document also recommends that the countries adopt  specific plans to encourage social investment, reduce  illiteracy, and extend coverage of public services to 70 percent  of the inhabitants of the hemisphere.    [Begin Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Luis Guillermo  Grillo recording] The document calls for strengthening free  trade. I would say it is a document with positive signs in all  areas. [end recording]    Tomorrow, the 22 foreign ministers and presidents of the  countries participating in this Ibero-American Summit will make  a final revision of the document, which without clearly  referring to Haiti or Cuba, condemns commercial blockades and  restrictive practices to restore democracies in some countries.</p>

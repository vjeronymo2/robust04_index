			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Safety fears may force Phillips to advance Ekofisk investment PHILLIPS Petroleum Norway may have to bring forward investment plans for its North Sea Ekofisk oil field because of safety concerns voiced by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the country's oil industry watchdog. The company believes that modifications and new facilities to meet the directorate's stringent demands will cost several billion kroner. The prolific field, Norway's oldest, is estimated still to contain about 1bn barrels of extractable reserves. But the NPD has warned that it could order closure of its processing and distribution tank by 1995-96 because ageing technical equipment and inadequate maintenance has rendered it unsafe. Mr Rolf Wiborg, a senior Phillips Petroleum Norway executive in charge of drilling and production, said yesterday that he agreed with the directorate's opinion that minor modifications would not go far enough to enhance safety of the Ekofisk facilities, which are also plagued by subsidence. 'Minor modifications of facilities are not going to get us where we need to be in 30-40 years time,' Mr Wiborg said. He estimated that Phillips had already invested about NKr60bn (Pounds 5.85bn) in Ekofisk since the field came on stream in 1972. At the end of June Phillips established a four-man task force to finalise a plan for enhancing the field's further development, which was to be presented at the company's headquarters in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, in December 1993. But the directorate is seeking a response from the company by the end of the month to its warning about a potential closure of the complex, through which 40 per cent of Norway's total production passes. Phillips will present a plan to the NPD within the stipulated time limit and it concedes that it will be forced to give priority to work called for by the directorate. The level of further investment in the field will depend on to what extent new facilities will be required in addition to major modifications. 'We need to propose a package which makes sense to optimise the investment required vis-a-vis long-term maintenance costs and what is left to be produced from the field,' Mr Wiborg said. He did not believe the expiry of the production licence in the year 2011 would pose any great problems for Phillips, which would apply for an extension if necessary. On the field's subsidence problem, he said Phillips intended to call for bids next summer for facilities necessary to expand a major water injection programme.</p>

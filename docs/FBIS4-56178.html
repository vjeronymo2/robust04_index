			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 28 Apr (PL) -- Cuban emigrants who  participated here in "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference"  with Cuban authorities are the target of strong pressure,  telephone threats, insults on radio programs, and even  expressions of physical violence.    As newsman Marcos Castellon told PRENSA LATINA today in a  telephone conversation, lawyer Magda Montiel Davis is the chief  target of those attacks, in addition to Vivian Maneruc, owner of  the ABC Charters company that flies airplanes from Miami to  Havana.    On Thursday, Montiel's offices were evacuated following two  bomb threats that turned out to be false, while most of her  staff members resigned, voicing a deep fear for their personal  safety, the source said.    He added that after leaving the building in the company of  her husband, the lawyer's path was blocked by a hail of insults  until the Miami police intervened to clear the way.    According to Castellon, other attendees like Maneruc also  reported threats and requested protection, fearing reprisals by  groups opposed to any peaceful rapprochement between Cuba and  its emigrants.    On their return to Miami, the participants in the meeting  with Cuban authorities were taken out of the airport terminal  under strict security to prevent possible violent clashes with  local ultraright-wing segments.    The political climate in Miami, the commentator of Radio  Progreso Alternativa indicated, has been traditionally marked by  the intolerance of the right, and there is a long history of  bomb attacks and physical and verbal attacks on persons who  support dialogue.    He recalled that two participants of the 1978 dialogue,  which  gathered Cuban emigrants for the first time in Havana, were  killed.    Emigrant ultraright-wing sectors were excluded from  participating in the meeting held 22-24 April. The meeting was  regarded as the first step toward normalizing Cuba's ties with  its emigrant community.</p>

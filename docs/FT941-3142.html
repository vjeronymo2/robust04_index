			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Marley in the red after goodwill write-back Marley, the buildings material group, enjoyed a 55 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 41.5m in 1993 but the write-back of goodwill, interest charges and a small loss on a disposal left it with a loss of Pounds 1.1m pre-tax. The results were slightly lower than some analysts had expected following the big profits rise announced on Tuesday by rival building products group Wolseley, and Marley's shares fell 10p to 195p. Following the disposal last year of its Nottingham and Errol Brick subsidiaries in an asset swap with Tarmac, Marley had to charge against its 1993 profits Pounds 32.8m of goodwill previously written off against reserves. Pre-tax profits for 1992 were Pounds 4.6m after a Pounds 3.5m loss on a disposal. Turnover rose from Pounds 561m to Pounds 622m. Net interest payable amounted to Pounds 11.1m against Pounds 9m. Losses per share were 4.4p (0.5p). Excluding losses on disposals and the goodwill write-back, earnings per share were 7.3p (0.7p). A final dividend of 2.1p is proposed, maintaining the total at 4.2p. Operating profits in the UK, benefiting from cost savings in previous years, amounted to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 300,000 loss). Overseas profits, with gains in the US, continental Europe, Africa and Australasia, increased from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 29.2m. The main engines for growth were the housing market recoveries in the UK and US and the continuing strong demand for homes in Germany. Volume sales of tiles, concrete blocks and bricks rose sharply on both sides of the Atlantic although price competition has remained intense. Since December the group has raised prices of clay and concrete products by between 5 and 7 per cent. About 60 per cent of turnover now comes from higher margin plastic products for the building and automotive industries. COMMENT Some Pounds 30m was taken out of costs by Marley during 1991 and 1992 and the company is now reaping the benefits as its main markets start to recover. Price rises could add another Pounds 5m to profits even if volumes stand still. Clay and concrete sales in the UK rose by about 5 per cent in the first 10 weeks of this year. The recovery in the US, meanwhile, continues to run ahead of that in the UK. Political developments in South Africa, which accounts for about 10 per cent of profits, however, could cause a problem. Profits this year could reach Pounds 45m, putting the group on a prospective p/e of more than 18, which suggests that its virtues are well known and already in the share price.</p>

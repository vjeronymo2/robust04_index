			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 1 May (MENA) -- A spokesman for the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau has commented on the  Presidential Council statement that was released in Sanaa  yesterday evening. He said that the Presidential Council has  revealed its convictions and clarified the truth about its  rejection of a plan to merge the armed forces that the defense  minister put forward four times in the past few years. Merging  the armies would have exposed the corruption and smuggling by  the officers of the al-Ahmar clan, who rob the soldiers'  salaries and food, torture and humiliate them, and seize funds  earmarked for military supplies.    The spokesman noted that merging the armed forces would have  meant providing them with qualified personnel who would make  them loyal not to their tribes and clans but to the homeland and  its constitutional institutions so the armed forces would become  the protectors of the homeland. He pointed out that the refusal  to merge the armed forces exposes a plan to isolate and strike  at them, as has happened in Abyan, (Harf), Safyan, and 'Imran.    The spokesman criticized the Yemeni Presidential Council  statement, which talks of democracy and legitimacy while it  constantly tramples them. It assailed the Yemeni president and  his method of reaching power and ruling the country.</p>

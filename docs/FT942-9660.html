			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Old versus new: Robert Graham on relations between Italy's president and prime minister If looks tell all, the glum face of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro this week said a lot about his relations with Italy's new government headed by media magnate turned politician Silvio Berlusconi. The president, usually courteous to the point of unctuousness, could have smiled when he swore in Mr Berlusconi as Italy's 53rd post-war premier. But the atmosphere between the two men was icy. Mr Berlusconi did his best to ignore the stand-off by beaming with pride as his mandate was formally confirmed. As a result the occasion appeared like a pupil collecting top prize from a stern head-master who still doubted whether the prize was deserved. Subsequently both sides have gone to great lengths to create the impression they get along famously. 'My relations with the president are very cordial (cordialissimi),' Mr Berlusconi insisted. Yet suspicious journalists immediately saw the superlative as so glowing as to be barbed. Surely, they asked in their columns yesterday, this was a classic instance of a person meaning the opposite of what was said? This is an unpropitious start for an inexperienced government (23 of the 25 strong cabinet are ministerial novices) and a prime minister who is an unknown quantity as a politician having only resigned executive duties at his Fininvest media empire in January. The impression of two leaders not seeing eye to eye was fuelled by the disclosure of the contents of a letter President Scalfaro sent to Mr Berlusconi. Dispatched on Monday while Mr Berlusconi was in the throes of forming his cabinet list, President Scalfaro curtly reminded him of his responsibilities. Behind the formal language the president in effect warned Mr Berlusconi that Italians needed reassurances about the nature of the government given that it was going to contain the federalist Northern League and neo-fascists who draw their roots from Mussolini's corporatist state. The move was unprecedented for an Italian head of state and pushed his role as guarantor of the constitution, to the limits. In private the president had also stressed the need for Mr Berlusconi to avoid a conflict of interest with his business empire. The president was instrumental in blocking the tycoon's lawyer, Mr Cesare Previti, from occupying the justice ministry. Relations between the 75 year-old head of state and Mr Berlusconi do not pose the same problems as the Mitterrand/Balladur 'cohabitation' in France as the Italian presidency has no executive functions. But a good working relationship between the two is important for the stability of the government. If relations deteriorate, Mr Berlusconi will be under pressure from his allies in the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance to force President Scalfaro's resignation. Both parties have lobbies who say he should be removed because he represents the Italy they are battling to change in the new 'second republic'. The Italian president has heavily circumscribed powers under the post-War constitution drawn up with the aim of avoiding too much power in any one person's hands. The head of state is not directly elected but chosen by parliament for a seven year term. He can dissolve parliament and nominate the prime minister. But parliament can only be dissolved if it agrees - that is when a government falls or has obviously exhausted its mandate. The power to chose the prime minister depends on the will of the electorate as expressed through the ballot box. The president's authority therefore depends upon his political feel and the extent to which his integrity allows him to exercise moral suasion in private or via public opinion. President Scalfaro, a former Christian Democrat interior minister and one of the country's longest serving parliamentarians, was elected in 1992 as a compromise candidate. He was chosen in a deal between the then dominant Christian Democrats and the Socialists. Other candidates were rendered ineligible by corruption scandals. In difficult circumstances, President Scalfaro has presided with dignity and had considerable influence over the tumultuous transition of the past two years. He played a major part in nominating Mr Giuliano Amato as Socialist premier in 1992 and then turning to the non-political Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former central Bank governor, as the parliamentary coalition backing the government began to collapse in 1993. He can also take credit for encouraging electoral reform that led to the appearance of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia. However, in the transition process Mr Scalfaro has been tainted by accusations from top former members of the intelligence services, now on trial for alleged corruption. They claim that as interior minister he knew about the abuse of secret funds. Even if no more than scurrilous defamation, the accusations identify President Scalfaro with a political system Italy has voted to change. There is thus a danger that any conflict between the presidency and the Berlusconi government will develop into a battle between the old and the new. Such a confrontation may only be avoided if more extreme elements in the League and the MSI decide to focus political energies on other priorities - such as creating jobs and deregulating an over-regulated economy.</p>

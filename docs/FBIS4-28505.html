			<p>BFN     [Text] North-South processing-on-commission trade  increased in the first quarter of this year despite the fact  that North-South tensions have escalated due to the North Korean  nuclear issue. The North and South exchanged goods worth $6.952  million during this period, 7.5 times the amount in the same  period last year.    This accounts for 90.7 percent of the amount of North-South  processing-on-commission trade of all of last year ($7.657  million).    During this period, we brought in North Korean goods worth  $4.122 million, 7.7 times the amount of the same period of last  year. The goods included jackets, trousers, and shirts for men  and women.</p>

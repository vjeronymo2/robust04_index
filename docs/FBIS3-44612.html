			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5427 2765): "Kidnap Cases </F> Puzzle Mainland Society, and the Situation Becomes Worse Because  of Involvement of Public Security Personnel"]    [Text] "Kidnapping" behavior gradually has become popular  on the mainland in recent years, leading to the "hostage  phenomenon," which has puzzled the society. As some cases  involved public security personnel, the Central Commission of  Political Science and Law, the Public Security Ministry, and  other departments recently have stressed that public security  personnel are strictly banned from getting involving in economic  disputes and using their powers to arrest people illegally.    According to reports, the Public Security Ministry has  sensed  the serious consequences of the involvement of public security  organs and policemen in kidnapping hostages, and has demanded  that public security departments at various levels view the  solemn handling of this lawbreaking and discipline-violating  behavior as one of the important contents of the anitcorruption  drive and the rectification of law enforcement work within  public security departments. The procuratorial organs, which  have jurisdiction over the investigation and handling of  "hostage-type" cases, also have removed various obstacles and  have actively handled these kinds of cases, viewing them as a  key area.    The "hostage-type" cases first appeared in the middle of the  1980's, and have increased greatly in the 1990's. According to  statistics provided by the Guangdong provincial procuratorial  organs, from 1990 to 1992 the incidence of such cases increased  52 percent. Information from Shanghai shows that in the first  quarter of last year, cases classified as of the "hostage type"  exceeded by 50 percent the total number of such cases in the  previous year. These are just the figures of cases for which  files have been opened by the procuratorial organs, and the  "hostage-type" cases for which files could not be opened should  be even more.    The "hostage-type" cases were caused mainly by disputes in  commercial and trading activities, and kidnapping a hostage was  the last resort to force someone to pay an outstanding debt.  Those who were kidnapped were from different walks of life.  Judged in terms of status, they included factory heads;  managers; deputies to people's congresses; members of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; soldiers;  and businessmen from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Judged from  the angle of age, they included babies several months old and  elderly people of advanced age. Judged from the relations of  those involved in debts, they included parents, wives, sons,  daughters, inferiors, relatives, and good friends.    As has been pointed out, among those who participated in  kidnapping activities were many party and government officials,  as well as cadres and policemen from public security and  judicial departments. There is a high-sounding excuse for them  to get involved in the "hostage-type" cases: Investigating  economic crime. Thus, there is a legal cover for kidnapping  hostages -- arresting lawbreaking elements -- and there is a  dignified package for forcing someone to pay an outstanding debt  -- recovering economic losses.    A relevant person analyzed the situation and said that there  are profound and complicated economic and social reasons behind  the "hostage phenomenon." One main reason is that the  development of the commodity economy has greatly increased  commercial and trading activities in the community, and the laws  and regulations, as well as law enforcement and supervision  work, have failed to keep pace. In some localities, it is  difficult to file a lawsuit, and in particular, it is very  difficult to open a file for a case that does not involve a  large amount of debt, while it is difficult to carry out the  verdicts in some cases. Some creditors find that their  legitimate rights are not protected, so they must look for  another way to regain their loans as quickly as possible.    Local protectionism is the reason for some government and  judicial organs to get involved in economic disputes arbitrarily  and to abuse their powers by detaining people illegally. Under  the current system, a local government has the power to allocate  finance to local public security organs, procuratorial organs,  and law courts; as a result, they have to listen to the orders  of the local government, and must be responsible to the local  government instead of to the law. Local interests are involved  in various economic disputes, and the "hostage phenomena" all  exhibit one common feature: Most of the kidnappers come from  the economically undeveloped districts or even poverty-stricken  districts, and they badly needed their loans returned because  they lacked money. Some local party leaders would often think  of using the power of government and judicial departments to  detain hostages in the name of "handling cases" so as to  retrieve the outstanding amount of money.</p>

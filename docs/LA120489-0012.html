			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE JOBS  </P> <P> It must be apparent by now to everyone that most of the foot-dragging in  cutting the budget of the military has very little, if anything, to do with our  defense against the crumbling states of the Eastern Bloc, or China, for that  matter. It has everything to do with profits (much of it generated by  overcharges or waste) and jobs.  </P> <P> Now is the time for the federal government to issue a timetable for conversion  and assure workers that their skills will be used to build a new, prosperous  economy based on civilian needs. The political fallout would be minimal if  people knew that their livelihoods would not be threatened, and indeed, that  they would be contributing to the betterment of the world and not the wasting  of our scarce resources for destructive purposes.  </P> <P> SYLVIA S. LAMONT  </P> <P> Gardena  </P></p>

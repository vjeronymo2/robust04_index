			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL;  </P> <P> CITY ADMINISTRATOR TO STAY  </P> <P> At the request of the City Council, City Administrator Robert Clute will remain  in his post for one more year, reversing his decision to retire because of  dissension about him on the council.  </P> <P> The council decided in a three-hour, closed-door session Tuesday night to ask  Clute to stay, according to Mayor James Castaneda.  </P> <P> The decision also ends a search for a new city administrator. This had begun in  January when Clute, 65, said he was leaving after 16 years in the job.  </P> <P> Castaneda and Clute acknowledged that the change in the council's and the city  administrator's thinking occurred as a result of the April elections. Former  Councilman Ted R. Anderson lost in his bid for reelection.  </P> <P> In addition, political newcomer Dominic S. Polimeni, who received the most  votes in the council race, had questioned the council's acceptance of Clute's  retirement.  </P></p>

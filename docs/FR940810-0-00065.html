			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other studies involved lung burden analyses of mesothelioma victims, apparently showing that the pulmonary content of chrysotile was within the range of the general population, whereas amphibole content was significantly elevated compared to the general population (see e.g. Churg, Malignant Mesothelioma in British Columbia in 1982, Cancer, 2/85, 672). OSHA noted in the preamble to the 1986 rule, that there is a difference in tissue retention which would account for the autopsy results and cited a study by Glyseth et al. (Doc. 33&hyph;C, Ex. 312) which supported that explanation. OSHA also noted that ``the differential lung retention of various fiber types has been demonstrated in animals,'' citing a study by Wagner which found that animals exposed to chrysotile fibers developed lung cancer even though a smaller amount of chrysotile was retained in the lung compared to similar tests with amphiboles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Weill believed that ``these differences in tissue persistence may wholly or partially explain the observations [that exposure to amphiboles are associated with a higher prevalence of mesothelioma] in human *&blank;*&blank;* population *&blank;*&blank;*. Non-confirmation of fiber type differences in animal experiments may be related to the much shorter life span *&blank;*&blank;* [of experimental animals, which would not allow] the effects of varying tissue-persistence to be expressed'' (Doc. 33&hyph;C, Ex. 99, p.18; 51 FR 22628). Therefore OSHA had reviewed and evaluated in the earlier rulemaking a portion of the evidence submitted by proponents of differential regulation of fiber types, and had rejected the claim that chrysotile should be regulated less stringently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some new evidence on the issue of differential risks of asbestos fiber types was submitted by both supporters and detractors of that theory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In support of the position that chrysotile asbestos exposure is equivalent in risk to amphibole asbestos exposure, BCTD submitted studies which indicated excess mesothelioma cases in workers exposed solely to chrysotile asbestos (see Ex. 119 C, 1&hyph;136, 125, Att.6, 143 Att C, 143 Att. D). In support of the opposing claim that chrysotile has reduced carcinogenic potential, AIANA and SBA submitted additional evidence. For example, AIANA submitted the World Health Organization's 1989 working report which recommended that the exposure limit for chrysotile should be reduced to 1 f/cc or below (8 hour TWA), where it was recommended that exposure to crocidolite and amosite asbestos be prohibited (Ex. 21 A, p. 9). In particular, two papers by Mossman, et. al, are cited as the basis for the claim that a scientific ``consensus'' believes that chrysotile carries a reduced carcinogenic risk (Ex. 1&hyph;153, 151). Thus AIANA states that ``since OSHA issued its 1984 asbestos risk assessment, the scientific consensus that chrysotile asbestos poses lesser risks has solidified'' (Ex. 142 at 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, OSHA notes that various participants in this rulemaking, including NIOSH and Dr. Nicholson, disputed the existence of such a consensus. Dr. Nicholson and others including Dr. Landrigan, in a letter to Science, (Ex. 1&hyph;155), dispute various interpretations of data in Mossman et al.'s paper, and challenge the conclusion that chrysotile asbestos carries little cancer risk. Nicholson et al, point out that human studies show excess lung cancer risk that is proportionate to exposure across all fiber types, and that animal tests confirm these relationships. OSHA believes that the scientific community has not achieved ``consensus'' on these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the studies submitted in support of the lowered risk of chrysotile asbestos, are those of Churg, and others showing that the lung burden of mesothelioma victims is predominantly amphibole, even though high chrysotile exposure levels were reported. As noted above, this line of argument was presented in the earlier asbestos rulemaking, and OSHA had concluded that lung burden studies are inconclusive. Additional response to this argument is provided by Dement who notes that ``(t)he biological significance of post-mortem lung fiber burden data has yet to be established. These data are not useful as a predictor of disease for several reasons. Chrysotile is known to split longitudinally and partially dissolve in the lung whereas amphiboles remain in the lungs for years without significant dissolution *&blank;*&blank;*. Measurements of tissue fiber burdens many years after first exposure may bear no relationship to the carcinogenic events which likely have taken place many years before clinical manifestation of cancer.'' (Ex. 1&hyph;273)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BCTD pointed out in its post-hearing brief, that ``Dr. Landrigan testified, while the observation that chrysotile does not last as long in the lungs as other forms of asbestos is not new knowledge (Tr. 1074), there is recent evidence that chrysotile is ``the most effective of the three major fiber types at migrating to the pleura, that it is present in substantial amounts in pleural plaques and mesotheliomas, even in circumstances where it is not present or minimally present in the lungs themselves'' (Tr. 1074).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also notes that the HEI report, in summing up its discussion of its literature search of studies examining the issue of the relative potency of chrysotile in inducing mesothelioma, stated: ``(t)he evidence that chrysotile rarely causes pleural mesothelioma is not conclusive ``*&blank;*&blank;* and concluded that the absence of mesothelioma in one of the ``two cohorts of heavily exposed asbestos workers who worked only with chrysotile *&blank;*&blank;* seems likely to be due at least in part to chance'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344 p. 6&hyph;23).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

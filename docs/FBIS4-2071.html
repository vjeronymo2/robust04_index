			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 6 (XINHUA) -- The economic takeoff  over the past 15 years has doubled the area of cities and towns  in South China's Guangdong Province, according to the provincial  construction department.    Cities and towns in Guangdong now cover a total area of  1,676  sq km and have a combined population of more than 19 million,  accounting for 29 percent of the provincial population total, an  official of the department said.    At the end of 1993 Guangdong had 41 cities with a combined  area of 835 sq km and 1,462 towns with a total area of 841 sq  km, he said.    He cited the Pearl River Delta and the Chaoshan Plain as the  two most rapidly urbanizing areas in Guangdong.    For example, the delta, best known for its booming  processing  industry, has formed a network of 100 cities and towns,  including the provincial capital of Guangzhou, the Shenzhen and  Zhuhai Special Economic Zones, and the cities of Shunde,  Dongguan, Zhongshan, Panyu, Foshan and Nanhai.    In recent years the 2,800-year-old city of Guangzhou has  built the satellite towns of Wuyang, Tianhe, Jiangnan and  Fangcun on the outskirts, doubling its urban area to 187 sq km.    "Guangdong now serves as a tourism, transportation,  commercial and financial center for the whole of South China,"  the official said.    The construction has helped improve the living conditions of  urban residents, he noted.    Apartment buildings with a total floor space of 168 million  sq m have been completed over the past 15 years. As a result,  the floor space per urban resident has risen to nearly 10 sq m  from 5.4 sq m in 1979.    Since 1990 Guangdong's investment in urban infrastructure  construction has risen at an annual rate of 104 percent,  totaling 32.5 billion yuan.    In 1993 along Guangdong used 740 million yuan in foreign  funds for urban construction, triple the total for the previous  12 years.    He said that the provincial government plans to increase the  number of cities to 50, and towns to 1,500 at the end of 1995,  and the urban population is expected to reach 22 million at that  time, he said.</p>

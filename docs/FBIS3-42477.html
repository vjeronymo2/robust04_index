Votintsev: "The Unknown </F> Troops of the Disappearing Superpower".]    [Text]  <H5>  Missile Attack Warning System </H5>   The launch of the first Soviet ballistic missile on 18  October 1947 turned out to be a complete surprise for the U.S.  military-political leadership. Two years later, when the first  nuclear device was created and successfully tested in the USSR,  we crossed out the Americans' monopoly on these weapons.    The United States set about creating nuclear missile attack  warning systems at an accelerated pace. In the 1960's, it began  to deploy them on and outside its own territory. The first  echelon was IMEWS satellites, designed to detect missile  launches and locate nuclear explosions. The experimental launch  of the IMEWS-1 satellite took place in 1968, and by 1970 a  space-based system of six IMEWS-2 satellites in orbits 35-40,000  km high, two each over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans,  was already deployed. This system today monitors the entire  surface of our planet, ensures detection of any missile launch,  determines launch time, coordinates, and flight direction, and  passes the information to command posts in no more than 3-5  minutes.    The second echelon--based on the BMEWS over-the-horizon  radar--was created between 1960 and 1963 to cover the main  directions of a likely missile attack--northeastern, northern,  and northwestern (from the territory of the Soviet Union). This  system includes three sites, modernized in recent years,  deployed at Foilingdales-Mure (Great Britain), Thule  (Greenland), and Clear (Alaska). This system uses a  multifunctional PAR radar from the Safeguard ABM system.    The increase in the number of our nuclear-powered submarines  equipped with ballistic missiles forces the United States to  create and deploy in the 1980's new powerful over-the-horizon  Pave Paws radars on the east and west coasts and also on its  southern borders.    Operational command and control of the nuclear missile  attack  warning system is exercised by the NORAD command post located in  Cheyenne Mountain at Colorado Springs, Colorado. Higher national  command and control facilities of the United States and its  armed forces are notified from this same command post.    In our country, development and creation of over-the-horizon  radars for missile attack warning and monitoring outer space  were done at the Scientific Research Radiotechnical Institute of  the USSR under the direction of Academician A.L. Minets (chief  designer Yu.V. Polyak[.sup][/]). The first "Dniester" radars  were deployed in Kazakhstan and Siberia. Together they formed a  solid radar barrier 5,000 km long that ensured accurate  detection and tracking of space objects.    Simultaneously, in 1961 this same institute began developing  the modernized "Dniester-M" over-the-horizon search radar and a  missile attack warning system lead complex on the main northern  avenue of likely missile attack (from U.S. territory) with  location of these radars in the Arctic and Latvia, and a command  post in the vicinity of Moscow.    Work on these centers and command posts began in 1963-1964.  The Chief of the directorate, Lieutenant-General M.M.  Kolomiyets, directly subordinate to the Chief of the Fourth Main  Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, Colonel-General of  Aviation G.F. Baydukov, was charged with organizing military  units for them.    It is noteworthy that in the summer of 1967, General of the  Army S.L. Sokolov[.sup]2[/], recently appointed Deputy  Minister of Defense, deemed it necessary, together with G.F.  Baydukov and me, to visit the centers in Latvia and the Arctic  that were in the stage of installation and adjustment of the  production equipment. Paying no attention to the fact that they  did not "polish up" things at the centers prior to his arrival,  he thoroughly, calmly, and with splendid competence looked into  the state of affairs, learned what was needed, and promised to  help. And he carried out the promise.    In late 1968, a commission chaired by the First Deputy Chief  of the Main Staff of Air Defense, Colonel-General V.V.  Druzhinin, conducted state testing of the "Dniester-M" radar at  the center in the Arctic. In the Far North, the radars operated  in an extremely complex interference environment, caused by the  constant chaotic disturbance of the ionosphere, resulting in  brief blips coinciding in nature to trajectory segments of  ballistic missiles. This did not preclude the generation and  issuance of false warning information.    In 1970, A.L. Mints said concerning my fears: "Yuriy  Vsevolodovich, your concern is not without foundation. But  remember: the leading designers of our institute and I will  always be with the troops. We will do all that is necessary to  guarantee that false warning information about a missile attack  will not be issued."    Indeed, the combat programs were constantly worked on as  statistics were collected. Chief designers Yu.V. Polyak and V.M.  Ivantsov[.sup]3[/] systematically worked at the centers, and  other specialist were always there. There were not cases of  false warning information being issued in the northern and  northwestern avenues of likely missile attack.    Already in 1976, I had occasion to test the lead complex at  full strength: The radar centers in the Arctic and Latvia, and  the command post near Moscow, which became the command post for  the missile attack warning system. Later it was possible to  technically connect the A-35 early-warning ABM system  (subsequently removed from service and dismantled), Dunay-3, and  Dunay-3U to the missile attack warning system command post and  to finish combat programs, ensuring a mutual exchange of  information about ballistic missiles and space objects.    However, this was not easy. Over-the-horizon warning systems  (A.L. Mints) and early-warning equipment of the ABM system (G.V.  Kisunko) were created independently of one another. This  resulted in the equipment operating in a different system of  coordinates determining the parameters of a ballistic missile's  trajectory. Various computers were also used. Mints used the  5E-73 computer of chief designer M.A. Kartsev[.sup]4[/], and  Kisunko used the computer of chief designer V.S. Burtsev. The  automated data transmission systems were also different. Such a  lack of coordination required a significant working up of combat  algorithms and computer programs at the ABM and missile attack  warning system command posts, which took up about 30 percent of  their memory and speed. Later on, it was precisely these  circumstances that made it necessary to increase the number of  computers and replace them with new-generation computers. The  result was considerable additional expenditures.    The various forms of self-spontaneity by the Ministry of the  Radio Industry and the lack of requirements for standardization  of arms have been unjustifiably costly for both the troops and  taxpayers and have impeded the commissioning of new  installations.    This disconnection was overcome to a considerable extent in  the early 1970's. V.G. Repin[.sup]5[/] was appointed Chief  Designer of the Missile Attack Warning System. A draft project  of an integrated missile attack warning system was developed and  approved in 1972 under Repin's direction. It coordinated and  distributed the requirements for characteristics of  above-the-horizon, over-the-horizon, and space-based warning  equipment and defined the principles of combining and mutual  monitoring of their data and rules for generating and presenting  output data. Later, all the work for creating the system was  done in accordance with this project. Clarifications were made  in the process of developing new proposals for detection assets.    The first stage was the above-mentioned interfacing of radar  warning center and the A-35 ABM system at a single command post,  accomplished in 1973. The second stage was the creation of an  updated command post and the first section of the warning system  in 1976. The principles developed in the integrated system  project were confirmed during the course of this work, and  experience acquired in creating and commissioning super-complex  information systems. The collective of chief designer V.G.  Repin, his deputies, and closest assistants, doctors of  technical sciences A.V. Menshikov, B.A. Golovkin, and V.P.  Traubenberg, were the first, and long before the Americans, to  solve the most complex tasks of complete automation of  obtaining, processing, and consolidating data from various means  of ballistic missile detection, generating and presenting  warning information. At the same time, it was also possible to  manage the problem of high-speed and high-reliability  transmission of data about ballistic missiles and space objects  with the aid of systems created under the direction of chief  designers F.M. Lipsman, V.I. Shvartsman, and I.M. Mizin. B.A.  Poluektov, a senior headquarters officer, participated directly  in this work.    It must be noted that despite certain complexities in  relations with the chief designers of individual warning  equipment, A.I. Savin[.sup]6[/], F.A.  Kuzminskiy[.sup]7[/], Yu.V. Polyak, and V.M. Ivantsov, the  chief designer of the system, V.G. Repin, was able to define  fairly clearly the requirements for the equipment and to  achieve, basically, their fulfillment. In those instances when  the basic parameters of the new equipment did not correspond to  the desired parameters, they managed to bring the system  characteristics to the required level through skillful use of  reserves and a systematic approach.    Special note should be made of the role of officers of the  combat algorithms and programs departments and battle task  allotment officials, many of whose proposals were adopted by the  chief designers of the system and equipment and helped to  improve their quality.    Between 1968 and 1972, a project of a solid continuous  above-the-horizon detection field on the western, southwestern,  and southern avenues of likely missile attack was being  developed. New centers were created in the Ukraine, Kazakhstan,  and Siberia based on the Dnieper radar. At that time A.L. Mints  and V.M. Ivantsov were working on a fundamentally new "Daryal"  above-the-horizon phased-array radar. An reduced model of the  receiver portion of this radar was successfully tested at the  center in the Arctic.    In 1984-1985, centers with the "Daryal" radar began to be  put  on alert duty in the North and in Azerbaijan, 5-6 years later  than the originally established timeframe. This occurred due to  the costs of construction organizations, interruptions in  deliveries of equipment by plants, and primarily due to the lack  of readiness of algorithm software. Despite the repeated demands  of the commander in chief of the National Air Defense Forces,  the Main Contracting Directorate, and me, a computer base was  not created in the design bureaus and Scientific Research  Institute of the Ministry of the Radio Industry. This resulted  in the fact that algorithm software with the use of authorized  computers had to be delayed 3-4 years.    I would go against the truth if I did not tell about how the  above-the-horizon radar center was created on the northeastern  avenue of likely missile attack. It was supposed to ring the  outer border of the USSR with a continuous radar field.  According to our prognosis, it was near the U.S. west coast that  American nuclear-powered submarines with Trident and then  Trident-2 missiles, capable of reaching the entire territory of  the Soviet Union, were to be based precisely on this axis, which  was also later confirmed.    According to studies and modeling of the Scientific Research  Department of the Institute of the National Air Defense Troops,  under the direction of Major-General of Aviation Ye.S.  Sirotinin, doctor of technical sciences and professor, such a  center could be placed in the vicinity of Norilsk or Yakutsk.  Due to a shortage of electrical power, Yakutsk was no longer a  choice. The management of the Norilsk Ore-Dressing Plant  guaranteed assistance in creating the center. However, expenses  increased since delivery of construction materials and equipment  was by sea.    The question of the location of the center was discussed  several times with Chief of the General Staff N.V. Ogarkov. I  knew Nikolay Vasilyevich [Ogarkov] well as a man of high  culture, reasonable, and able to delve deeply into the essence  of a problem and make the correct decision. Therefore, I was  astonished when, supported by Deputy Minister of Defense for  Construction Colonel-General of Engineers N.F. Shestopalov, he  did not agree with the Norilsk variant, but demanded that the  new center be created only in the vicinity of Yeniseysk. This  point was mentioned in the project of the Ministry of the Radio  Industry, but was immediately rejected by us due to the fact  that it was a flagrant violation of provisions the 1972 ABM  Treaty with the United States on limiting ABM systems, according  to which over-the-horizon missile attack warning system  equipment could be deployed in the immediate proximity of the  state border with the antenna turned outward. Yeniseysk was  located deep within the country approximately 3,000 km from our  maritime border.    Unfortunately, associates of the General Staff prevailed,  arguing that this installation could be considered not to be a  warning center but a means of satellite detection. Despite all  our objections, at the next large meeting, D.F. Ustinov stated  for all to hear that if someone in air defense still dared to  object to Yeniseysk, he would be relieved of duty.    The Americans focused their space reconnaissance assets on  the progress of work on the center on a literally daily basis.  When its basic structures became visible, they lodged a protest,  which our government ultimately accepted.    The lesson taught us by the American side proved to be quite  costly, and not only in the material respect. It is natural that  is also affected the country's defensive capability.    Today, some of the structures already erected are being  dismantled and being made into a furniture factory. We will be  satisfied if only it begins to produce a product. But there was  not and is not any above-the-horizon detection assets on the  northeastern axis.    On the other avenues of likely missile attack, Dnieper  radars  have been operating continuously for more than 20 years now;  they are obsolete. In the mid-1980's, construction of new  Daryal-U and Volga radars began at the same sites at centers in  Latvia, Belorussia, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Siberia.    By 1992, more than 50 percent of the allotted appropriations  were acquired. Now, financing of the installations located in  the `near abroad' was stopped, and work was suspended. In these  republics, particularly in Ukraine, steps are being taken to  privatize missile attack warning installations.    The obsolete Dnieper radars will be able to operate for  another 2-3 years, 5 years at most, and then the entire  Commonwealth will be left without some of the most accurate  means for detecting attacking missiles on their flight  trajectories with identification of the launch area and the  place and time until the missiles fall.    In 1972, when the Missile Attack Warning System project  proposed by V.G. Repin was being implemented, it became obvious  that its high reliability could be achieved only by employing a  complex of equipment using different physical principles. They  include over-the-horizon radar and spacecraft capable of  detecting missile launches and issuing information 2-3 minutes  after their launch.    In 1970, favorable results were obtained from an  experimental  model of the Duga-2 over-the-horizon radar in the Ukraine when  detecting launches of domestic missiles from areas of the Far  East and the water areas of the Pacific Ocean over the test  range on Novaya Zemlya. This circumstance enabled the Ministry  of the Radio Industry to submit the project to the Scientific  Research Institute for Long-Range Communications (NIIDAR) for  creating two centers in the Ukraine and the Far East (chief  designer F.A. Kuzminskiy). The project asserted that these  centers were able to detect the launch of intercontinental  ballistic missiles from bases on U.S. territory. The decision  was made and the centers created, but a miscalculation was made,  leading further work to an impasse.    As chairman of the commission examining the project and  supporting the creation of the centers, it is my fault that the  effectiveness of the over-the-horizon was assessed based on  results obtained from an experimental model of the radar  detecting missiles in conditions of a middle-latitude path and  relatively calm ionosphere. In conditions of northern-latitude  paths, in the presence of the polar cap and the constant chaotic  ionospheric disturbance, the probability of detecting the launch  of single and small groups of missiles at these centers turned  out to be quite low. And a massive missile launch from U.S.  territory is reliably detected only in favorable ionospheric  conditions. An important condition of an objective assessment of  the effectiveness of these centers was the use of a mathematical  model developed at the SNII [Special Scientific Research  Institute] under the direction of Major-General of Aviation A.S.  Sharakshane[.sup]8[/], doctor of technical sciences. This  very complex model contained ionospheric parameters in which  comprehensively took into account the 11-year cycle of solar  activity during various times of the year and day.    Despite the long and expensive process of tests and  modifications, the centers were not accepted into service. The  facility in the Ukraine essentially was returned to industry,  and the Polar Program of modifying equipment and programs  designed to improve substantially the detection characteristics  was carried out there. Due to a plot at the Ministry of the  Radio Industry, F.A. Kuzminskiy was removed at the most critical  moment. The program was carried out under the direction of the  new chief designer, F.F. Yevstratov[.sup]9[/].    During the course of carrying out this program and  introducing a number of modifications, the NIIDAR collective  under the direction of F.F. Yevstratov and G.A. Lidleyn achieved  stable detection by the center in the Ukraine of launches of the  U.S. Shuttle at a distance of 9,000 km.    The Shuttle catastrophe on 28 January 1986 was observed in  real time as a bright flash on the display screens and a  stoppage of tracking the trajectory at the moment of the  explosion and when the rocket engines stopped operating. I  immediately reported the results of the work to  Commander-in-Chief of the National Air Defense Troops A.I.  Koldunov and USSR Minister of Defense D.F. Ustinov, which  confirmed the report from the United States.    The thrust of the Shuttle's engines considerably exceeds  that  of the engines of Minuteman ballistic missiles, which leads to  an increase in the size of the ionized trail and, consequently,  the size of the radar cross-section of the missile being  launched. After examining these results, the commission agreed  with the calculations on the mathematical models of the  over-the-horizon radar centers for detecting group and massive  launches of ballistic missiles from U.S. territory.    Work on the center continued right up until the catastrophe  at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The center ended up in the  sequestered area and was mothballed.    Somewhat earlier, in 1978, the CINC of the Air Defense  Troops  P.F. Batitskiy made the start of joint testing of the center in  the Far East conditional on the requirement of real and reliable  detection of Minuteman ballistic missile launches from the U.S.  Western Range at Vandenberg to the range on Kwajalein Island in  the Pacific Ocean.    After repeated postponement of the launch of a Minuteman  missile for technical reasons, automatic detection took place on  24 February 1980, and the commission under my direction, making  a detailed inspection of the results obtained, began its work.  However, further tests showed that the center was able to  reliably detect ballistic missile launches from U.S. territory  only under favorable geophysical conditions.    After considerable modifications, the center in the Far East  was placed on alert duty on 30 June 1982. It was periodically  used to detect missile launches from the U.S. Western Range at  Vandenberg. Now this center has also been taken off alert duty.    At that time, many believed that the path I covered together  with the designers of over-the-horizon radars was both  unexplored and fallacious with respect to northern-latitude  paths. This should be recognized. However, one must not ignore  the fact that when the centers were in operation, all nine  missile bases located on U.S. territory constantly felt their  effect. In other words, they were under the "cap" of our  electromagnetic radiation. Unfortunately, the dream of F.A.  Kuzminskiy, who said "We will handcuff American imperialism,"  did not fully come true. Further work showed that the  over-the-horizon radar in conditions of middle-latitude paths  and calmer ionosphere is undoubtedly an effective means of  long-range detection of missile launches, aircraft, and surface  ships at distances of approximately 3,000 km.    Development of a space-based system was more successful,  although not without difficulties, the general designer of which  was A.I. Savin. Violation of the established time periods was  determined primarily by working out algorithm software and the  low reliability of the first spacecraft (chief designer V.M.  Kovtunenko)[.sup]10[/].    The system was placed on alert duty at reduced strength in  1978 and at full strength in 1982; however, its combat  capabilities left much to be desired both in performance and  operating characteristics. For example, based on information  received from aboard the spacecraft, the command post of this  system made a false conclusion about a massive missile launch  from U.S. territory. It is not hard to imagine what kind of  decision the leadership of the country and the armed forces  could have faced. The cause was an unfinished combat program for  conditions of heightened solar activity. Fortunately, at that  time a true professional was fulfilling duties of the operations  duty officer at the system command post, Lieutenant Colonel  Engineer S.Ye. Petrov[.sup]11[/], deputy chief of the office  of combat algorithms and programs. Instantly analyzing and  evaluating the environment and situation, he did not permit  false information to be issue to the command post of the missile  attack warning system. By order of the Minister of Defense, a  commission chaired by the First Deputy Chief of the General  Staff, Colonel-General V.I. Varennikov, was appointed for this  emergency. A.I. Savin and I were his deputies.    I had occasion to meet fairly often with Valentin Ivanovich  [Varennikov] on duty matters. In my view, he is intelligent,  well-educated, firm-willed, courageous, and good-natured. He is  a man of duty, honor, and conscience. He conducted the  investigation objectively and competently.    Commander-in-Chief of the Air Defense Troops A.I. Koldunov  and I had occasion to be present during his report to D.F.  Ustinov on the results received by the commission. Judging from  the atmosphere of the meeting, the relations of the minister of  defense with the leadership of the General Staff were strained.  But despite this, Dmitriy Fedorovich [Ustinov] accepted  Varennikov's report without questions, remarks, or  organizational conclusions. Most likely, D.F. Ustinov knew  general designers A.I. Savin and V.M. Kortunenko well and  treated them with respect and trust.    A.I. Savin, unquestionably a talented scientist and  designer,  together with the collective from the Kometa Central Scientific  Research Institute undertook the task of detecting the launch of  ballistic missiles from the territory of continents and ocean  and sea water areas. The complexity consisted of the fact that  spacecraft from orbits 35-40,000 km in altitude were to be  detected with a high degree of reliability 2-3 minutes after  their launch, and the information was to be passed to the space  system command post.    It is not worth talking about how complicated it is to  identify missile launches at night from U.S. territory,  literally illuminated by powerful light sources. On a daily  basis the spacecraft observed literally thousands of aircraft  takeoffs on afterburner. The electromagnetic disturbances in  space as a result of unpredicted solar flares and also during  the spacecraft's crossing of the so-called "terminator," when it  leaves the space illuminated by the sun and goes into the  earth's shadow, were still not fully known.    Checking out the system by the method of experiments  developed for the most critical situations in order to reveal  and eliminate flaws in the spacecraft's detection equipment,  onboard computer programs, in the equipment complex, and  especially in the command post combat program.    All work was analyzed in detail by A.I. Savin directly at  the  command post. I was struck by his self-control, intelligence,  and ability to analyze his own miscalculations principally and  critically. Incidentally, this was instructive for certain other  general and chief designers, who during failures tried without  basis to shift the blame on whomever, including the combat crew,  considering themselves to be without guilt.    We military people were impressed by the fact that A.I.  Savin  always first listened to the opinions of combat crew officials,  specialists of the SNII of the National Air Defense Troops, and  then his deputies and immediate assistants--K.A. Vlasko-Vlasov,  V.G. Khlibko, and Ts.G. Litovchenko. He consulted M.I. Nenashev  and me. He thoughtfully worked out proposals and made  modifications, which were repeated checked.    V.M. Kovtunenko preferred to examine the circumstances  associated with the failure of the spacecraft in his own office  at the Scientific Production Association imeni S.A. Lavochkin,  since there was a mockup of the spacecraft there on which the  situation that arose during the failure could be reproduced, and  then repeatedly check the effectiveness of the modifications. It  was not easy for Kovtunenko to work; he had to conduct a fierce  debate with managers and designers of many design bureaus and  plants manufacturing component parts for the spacecraft. Each of  them believed someone other than their own firm was at fault for  the failure of the spacecraft. Moreover, it was necessary to  consider: the rigid requirements of the general designer of the  system, A.I. Savin, who was always supported by the  military--the chief of the contracting directorate M.I.  Nenashev, SNII specialists, and representatives of the Main  Space Systems Directorate. The question of a claim always arose;  those at fault were to pay the Ministry of Defense approximately  three million rubles for the spacecraft failure.    I will note that for the general designers and for me, too,  the unsuccessful launch or premature failure of a spacecraft was  not only a tragedy but also useful experience. With an negative  result after a thorough analysis, an opportunity appeared to  determine the causes and take steps to increase the reliability  significantly.    The CINC of the National Air Defense Troops A.I. Koldunov  reacted differently toward this. He had to sign the reports to  the Minister of Defense, and they were naturally impartial. Many  times he rudely rebuked both me and, less often, A.I. Savin.    By the mid-1980's, through the efforts of A.I. Savin and the  collective of the Kometa Central Scientific Research Institute,  V.M. Kovtunenko, and his closest assistants A.G. Chesnokov and  A.L. Rodin, the space-based system was brought to the required  level of specifications and became the most reliable and  effective basis in the integrated missile attack warning system.  This is of special importance in connection with the serious  decrease in the combat capabilities of above-the-horizon radar  equipment for detection of ballistic missiles on their flight  trajectories, now located in CIS countries on several avenues of  likely missile attack.    A most important element in the integrated Missile Attack  Warning System is the several territorially separated,  synchronously operating command posts. In the fully automatic  mode, the command posts receive extensive information about the  technical condition of the entire system, and warning  information is also sent automatically to the command and  control facilities of the Supreme High Command being warned and  to the command authorities of the armed services on a special  "Krokus" warning panel. I remember the three of us--chief  designer of the Missile Attack Warning System V.G. Repin,  Colonel-General V.K. Strelnikov[.sup]12[/], commander of a  separate special-purpose army, and I--depicted on a sheet of  paper a sketch of the front panel, in our opinion, of the  "Krokus" for special briefcases of the top leadership of the  country and the armed forces which contained warning information.    Undoubtedly, I should talk separately about such a brilliant  personality as V.K. Strelnikov. In 1967, upon graduating from  the Military Academy of the General Staff of the USSR Armed  Forces imeni K.Ye. Voroshilov, he was appointed Commander of a  Missile Attack Warning Division being organized for the first  time. He commanded it for 10 years. His name is associated with  the development of the large unit and the purposeful education  of military collectives aimed at unconditional accomplishment of  a combat mission of national importance.    He set the tone in mastering new combat equipment.    He was the first among line commanders to become a candidate  of military sciences. And quite deservedly, he was the first  commander of a separate missile attack warning army.    The task of reliability and survivability of the system and  its equipment was successfully accomplished. Each facility has  triple redundancy of the production equipment and special  technical equipment, and also several separated power supply  feeds. Self-contained power sources were also created based on  magneto-gas-dynamic generators. Landline and cable  communications also have several lead-ins. The facilities are  equipped with satellite, radio, and facsimile communications.    The following made an invaluable contribution to the  creation, development, and improvement of the operation of the  system: M.M. Kolomiyets, V.V. Rozhkov[.sup]13[/], V.K.  Strelnikov, I.A. Slukhay[.sup]14[/], V. M.  Smirnov[.sup]15[/], A.V. Sokolov[.sup]16[/], V.P.  Panchenko[.sup]17[/], N.V. Kislyakov[.sup]18[/], A.B.  Novitskas[.sup]19[/], N.I. Rodionov, V.I.  Motornyy[.sup]20[/], G.A. Vylegzhanin[.sup]21[/], A.K.  Mikhaylov, N.G. Zavaliy[.sup]22[/], A.P. Blinov, V.M.  Shumilin, and many others.    In the creation and particularly in the testing and  operation  of the ABM and missile attack warning systems, one should make  note of the collective of the SNII created in the 1960's, which  I have already mentioned. At that time it was headed by I.M.  Penchukov[.sup]23[/] and his deputy for scientific work, N.P.  Buslenko[.sup]24[/]. In subsequent years, the institute was  led by Yu.G. Yerokhin[.sup]25[/] and today by G.S.  Batyr[.sup]26[/]. The deputy for scientific research work is  M.D. Kislik[.sup]27[/]. This institute was the scientific  headquarters when commissions headed by me examined a number of  preliminary projects. Favorable conditions were created for  carrying out the tasks entrusted to the commissions. I talk  about this with great satisfaction--after all, I was associated  with this remarkable collective for many years.    More than 20 doctors and about 100 candidates of sciences  labored productively at the SNII. The institute's leading  scientists were: for the ABM system--G.I. Butko[.sup]28[/];  for the Missile Attack Warning System--G.V. Kononenko, B.S.  Srebushevskiy, G.S. Suvorov, V.V. Ognev, and A.M. Tseytlenok.  The institute was the first in the Ministry of Defense to  successfully solve the problem of evaluating the combat  effectiveness of complex, essentially unique, and completely  automated complexes and weapons systems. The task was  accomplished both according to results of full-scale testing and  by mathematical modeling. Scientific method foundations of  testing and commissioning these complexes and systems were  developed. What is more, the institute's specialists, working  constantly directly at the facilities, carefully analyzed the  experience of operation and drew up the corresponding  recommendations for the troops and the requirements for the  designers. It is hard to overestimate the productive labor of  the institute's scientists and specialists. Running ahead, I  will note that the leading scientists were awarded two State  Prizes and several Leninist Komsomol Prizes for the research  performed and implemented in the troops.    There is something I would like to say in conclusion. A  great  deal of labor and maximum use of intellectual and economic  potentials of the Soviet state created an integrated missile  attack warning system... It was, is, and, I hope, will be a  decisive deterrent factor in unleashing a nuclear missile war.  For any aggressor will always receive a guaranteed, devastating,  retaliatory strike.    We cannot and do not have the right to close our eyes to the  fact that the great Soviet Union is no more. The Missile Attack  Warning System, particularly its above-the-horizon detection and  position finding equipment, has been weakened significantly by  the ambitions of politicians who have received sovereignty.  Urgent measures are needed for restoration of the system and its  improvement under the direction and control of the government  and the armed forces of Russia. After all, all components of the  nuclear missile strike warning system are being improved  continuously in the United States.  Footnotes    1.

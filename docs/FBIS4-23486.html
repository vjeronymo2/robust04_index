			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 6 SAPA -- State armaments procurement  agency Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] was  trying to shed its "cloak and dagger" image as it prepared for a  more visible international role, Arsmcor Chairman Johan Moolman  said on Monday [6 June]. He was speaking at the handing over of  Armscor's 1993/94 annual report to Defence Minister Joe Modise  at Armscor's Pretoria head office.    "We want to overcome the perception that Armscor and the  industry in South Africa is a cloak and dagger business and that  there is a crook behind every propeller. That is not true. The  fact that we had to get products into the country through  so-called channels we will admit," Mr Moolman said in a  reference to South Africa's illicit purchase of armaments and  weapons technology during three decades of a United Nations arms  embargo on South Africa. He said South Africa had always tried  to be an honest arms dealer.    Mr Moolman said he welcomed debate on the countries to which  Arsmcor sold weapons, saying this was a cabinet decision. He  would welcome the issue being discussed in a parliamentary  standing committee.    The report notes a decrease in the defence budget over the  past few years. "Consequently the South African National  Defence Force had less funds available for the acquisition of  equipment," the report says.    "Arsmcor and the defence industry are national asset that  will play an important role in the development of South Africa.  In close collaboration with the local defence industry, Arsmcor  will continue to ensure that South Africa remains  self-sufficient in key military and security systems."    Arsmcor spent R4,481 million [rand] in 1993/94 on arms and  equipment. Of this sum, R2,487 million was spent on aerospace  equipment, including the replacement of the aged Harvard  aircraft with the Pilatus PC-7 aircraft. Delivery of the first  aircraft is expected in October this year.    Money was also spent on upgrading existing aircraft. The  Rooivalk combat helicopter was developed.    Vehicle and weapons systems absorbed R1,014 million. Among  the projects were developing tank technology, producing armoured  vehicles for the South African army and for the South African  Police Services.    The remainder of the acquisitions budget was spent on  electronics and maritime products. A tactical radio system was  developed, communications infrastructure for the Bushveld  Airspace Control Centre was developed as well as underwater  telephones for use on surface ships and submarines.    The Arsmcor report also highlights steps taken to harness  military technology for civilian use.</p>

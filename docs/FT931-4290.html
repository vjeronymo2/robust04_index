			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE DERIVATIVES sector had a volatile session, with traders becoming more cautious ahead of next week's UK Budget, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened 5 points below Tuesday's close at 2,954, suggesting a quiet session. However, early buyers of the contract, shortly after the opening, sent March ahead and by 10am it was trading at 2,973. But there was no follow-through buying after that and the contract drifted down on sporadic selling and programme trading, which saw it fall to 2,954 over the lunchtime period. With traders cheered by a cut in rates in Belgium, March ignored the early retreat on Wall Street in the afternoon and recovered some of the ground lost earlier in the day. March closed at 2,958, just below the previous day's finish and slightly ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of around minus 2, with turnover uninspiring at 7,978. In traded options, total volume reached 30,193 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option trading 9,147 lots. Two-way business in the Euro FT-SE 100 option saw turnover in that stock reach 3,347. Asda led the way among the stock options, with 2,419 lots dealt and the April 57 calls the busiest. It was followed by Barclays at 1,921 and BP at 1,656. Rolls-Royce, which reports figures today, traded 1,333 contracts.</p>

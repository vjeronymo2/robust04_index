			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Swissair confirms positive result Swissair, the Swiss national airline, has indicated that it made a profit last year in spite of a fourth consecutive year of losses from flight operations. It gave no figures. Mr Otto Loepfe, chief executive, confirmed the positive result, which earlier seemed uncertain, at a press conference yesterday in Zurich to announce an increase in orders for Airbus aircraft from 26 to 29. The airline group also revealed a finance plan to 1998 calling for capital spending of SFr4.6bn (Dollars 3.2bn) and debt repayment of SFr500m. This would be financed by SFr3bn from cash flow, SFr1.5bn in new capital and SFr600m from liquid funds. Swissair's Airbus order consists of 16 A320s, eight A321s and five A319s worth SFr2.3bn. The aircraft will be introduced over two years from the beginning of 1995, more quickly than previously planned, and five of them are to be leased. They will replace 24 McDonnell Douglas MD-81s and five A310-200s, of which all but 14 MD-81s have already been sold. The Airbuses will be equipped with CFM-56-5B engines which produce 40 per cent less NOx emissions than the engines on the MD81s and are 25 per cent more fuel efficient.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Bangemann raps Bundesbank over single market THE EC's internal market commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, yesterday warned Germany's Bundesbank to mind its own business and stop interfering with the Commission's attempts to establish a barrier-free single market. The Bundesbank commented in its report last week that completion of the single market by the January 1, 1993 deadline was not assured. 'I don't deny that there's a certain connection between the success of the internal market and the possibility of creating a common currency,' said Mr Bangemann after yesterday's meeting of internal market ministers. But he added that the Bundesbank should not try to judge what the Commission was doing: 'Everybody should keep an eye on their own cows,' he said. Mr Bangemann, Germany's senior commissioner, is himself a stern critic of member states' sluggishness in implementing single market legislation and abolishing frontier controls. At yesterday's meeting he again put pressure on EC countries to accelerate the removal of internal barriers, although he indicated that there was no immediate need for a single regulation to sweep away all remaining border controls on goods. Mr Bangemann said he hoped compromise proposals under discussion would enable Britain, which is reluctant to lift border-checks on people, to drop controls. Mr Bangemann also praised some EC countries for improved implementation of EC single market directives. For example, Italy - repeatedly criticised by the Commission for not transforming EC directives into national law quickly enough - has leapt from bottom of the Community league table to fifth in less than a month. The back-markers are now the three Benelux countries, although they argued yesterday that they were about to implement a number of EC directives. The third non-life insurance directive, which will enable consumers to buy non-life insurance policies from companies anywhere in the EC from mid-1994, was formally agreed by ministers yesterday. Socialist MEPs, objecting to neglect of the single market's social aspect, had been blocking the directive in the European Parliament but lifted this last procedural obstacle two weeks ago.</p>

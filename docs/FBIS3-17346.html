During the meeting, the head of state  spoke of his striving towards friendship between NATO and  Russia, Georgia, and the CIS states. He said that the  restoration of Cold War would stir up reactionary forces, and  this could be tragical in effect for many small countries.  Today, when even the United Nations fails to render a real help  to this or that country in the settlement of a conflict, NATO's  role as that of a guarantor of stability has further increased,  Shevardnadze said.    The head of the NATO delegation, an official representative  of the Republic of Turkey in NATO, Tugay Ozceni, welcomed  Georgia's joining the Partnership for Peace initiative. He said  NATO intended to extend the cooperation with Georgia including  the military sphere.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Colombian equities look ahead to a better year - The stock market has been held back in 1992 by economic and political difficulties For Colombia, 1992 has been a very difficult year as severe power rationing, low coffee prices and guerrilla attacks on the oil and mining industries took their toll on the economy. This has been reflected in the stock market, which has risen more modestly this year. According to the IFC, part of the World Bank, Colombia rose by 32 per cent in dollar terms from the start of 1992 to the end of November, well below the surge of 173.5 per cent achieved in 1991. A fall in interest rates in the first half of this year led many investors to transfer some of their holdings out of fixed-interest instruments and into equities. But a sudden increase in interest rates in August and September reversed this trend. Nevertheless, the outlook for the stock market is improving: government and independent sources have forecast an economic growth rate for 1993 of more than 4 per cent, compared with government estimates of above 2 per cent for 1992. Businessmen and brokers endorse the government's economic optimism. Imports have begun to rise, and will probably continue to do so as industrialists take advantage of lower tariffs, while a higher devaluation rate will boost exports. Colombia has an annual devaluation rate of about 16 per cent and inflation is running at 24 per cent. Foreign funds - 20 have now been approved  - were particularly active during the first half, but mounting political and economic problems dampened foreign interest in recent months. The escape from jail of the drug trafficker Pablo Escobar and a surge in guerrilla violence (with the economy as the main target) have undermined the government's prestige. 'These problems have an impact on the foreign investor. The country risk is more important than the company risk,' says Mr Paul Weiss of the stockbroking firm Corredores Asociados. 'But next year the 12 per cent profit remittance tax will fall to zero and this will encourage foreign investors.' The high incidence of kidnappings and extortion also affects the willingness of local companies to expose themselves: once a company is listed on the market, guerrillas and criminals can find out how much the business and its owners are worth. Nevertheless, several new companies have issued shares this year, including Fibratolima, a textile manufacturing firm, and Colsanitas, a hospital. Fewer than 180 companies are listed in the stock market and only about a tenth of them are actively traded. Some are only there for tax purposes, says Mr Weiss, not for trading, and he expects a reshuffle next year as such companies drop out and new ones come in, offering real alternatives for the investor. The government's privatisation programme is moving more slowly than expected, although the industrial development institute is selling off its holdings in a number of small companies. It is not clear whether the government has enough support to brave the trade unions and privatise the bigger companies that should attract foreign investors. The stock exchange authorities are enthusiastic about new plans and regulations, which will create confidence in the market and encourage expansion. Pension funds will probably start operating next year and different forms of risk coverage are being studied. Controls on the origin of money are also being applied more rigidly by banks and financial institutions to prevent money-laundering. Small investors are showing more interest in shares now that mutual funds are beginning to operate.</p>

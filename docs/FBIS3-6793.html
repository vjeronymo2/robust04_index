			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- The government and the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) have agreed to maintain  global cooperation and pursue a consistent policy toward North  Korea, with a view to deterring Pyongyang from developing  nuclear arms and preventing war on the Korean peninsula.    The agreement was reached at a high-level party-government  meeting presided over by DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil on Tuesday  morning, called to hear the government report on the rupture of  inter-Korean talks on exchanging special envoys and the threat  made by North Korea's chief delegate, DLP spokesman Ha Sun-pong  said.    Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi  Yung- tug said the North was balking to obtain more concessions  from Washington in future talks and to strengthen its grip on  the North Korean people in the event of possible U.N. sanctions.    North Korea will continue to antagonize the South, while  laying the blame for the failed inter-Korean talks on Seoul and  stepping up propaganda against the South Korean Government, he  predicted.    "The government will pursue a North Korea policy aimed at  co-  existence and co-prosperity on the basis of harmony between  international cooperation and national efforts," he said. "The  door of dialogue remains open but the government is in no hurry  to resume dialogue."    Yi said the basic goal of Seoul's North Korea policy is to  maintain peace, adding that the government has the power and  will to do so.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu discussed measures the  government will take to solve the problem including increased  pressure on Pyongyang through international cooperation,  developing management power to prevent the situation from  abruptly worsening, and establishing a defense system capable of  responding to any unexpected crisis.    The door of dialogue was left open so that North Korea may  be  persuaded to give up its isolationist and confrontational policy  and open up to the world, Han said.    Efforts to resume inter-Korean dialogue will be made in  parallel with an increase in international pressure on  Pyongyang, he added.    He warned that a hard-line policy toward North Korea now  could stymie international attempts to deal with the communist  state.    Under the basic strategy of preventing war on the Korean  peninsula and deterring Pyongyang from developing nuclear  weapons, the government will step up multilateral and bilateral  cooperation with the United Nations, the United States, China  and other countries, he said.    On U.S.-North Korea talks, Han said dialogue channels  between  Washington and Pyongyang must remain open in spite of the  ruptured inter-Korean dialogue, because such channels are  essential to North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections and  in curbing the North's destructive acts.    Noting that China is playing a greater role in the U.N.  Security Council, Han said President Kim Yong-sam would ask  Beijing to help resolve the problem during his visit there next  week.    He said China's abstention in a vote on a North Korean  resolution at the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of  governors meeting on Monday was not unexpected considering its  policy calling for a solution through dialogue.</p>

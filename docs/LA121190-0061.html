			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: LOCAL RESORTS ADAPT TO SNOW-FREE WINTERS  </P> <P> When the first big snow hits the San Bernardino Mountains, the flatlanders  descend upon the town of Running Springs like an avalanche. Their ski-laden  cars and pickups clog the roads and turn the town's tiny commercial center into  a parking lot. The winter visitors get stuck in snow banks, track slush into  shops and use the restrooms without buying anything.  </P> <P> People up here just love them.  </P> <P> "You can't get them in and out of here fast enough," said Dicky Brouelli,  assistant cook at Don Pepe's Casa Blanca restaurant. "This town goes crazy."  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Running Springs and mountain towns like it all over  California, the past five winters have been short on the big snows. Down below,  in the rest of Southern California, drought conditions and warm weather make  flatlanders more inclined to visit the shore than the slopes. Despite a growing  year-round population, the dry conditions can mean fewer customers for nearly  every establishment in town, from the ski area to the video rental shop to the  kids who put on tire chains for a fee.  </P> <P> Snowfall "affects the whole economy of the hill," said Frank Brown, manager of  Fantasy Video in Running Springs, which also sells tire chains to those caught  in unexpected snow storms. "If (winter visitors) stay in one of the motels,  they come to one of the two shops in town to rent videos."  </P> <P> While December is not known for heavy snowfall, the lonely patches of the white  stuff surrounded by dry grass only remind locals of the recent spate of poor  winters. And with less than three weeks before the all-important Christmas and  New Year holidays, local youngsters wandered around Hilltop Boulevard, the  commercial spine of Running Springs, in shorts and T-shirts in the midday  warmth.  </P> <P> "We are just holding our breath and waiting for the snow," said Peggy Parson,  who works the counter part time at Grumpy's Bakery and Deli. "We're dead right  now."  </P> <P> Merchants in this town perched 6,000 feet above sea level say they have managed  well without the normal winter seasons, although the winter season is "the  cream for the people up here," said R. Keith Simpson, who moved out of Laguna  Beach two years ago to set up a mountaintop medical practice. "If there is a  decent season, they really have some money to set aside."  </P> <P> "That's when you make your big margins and big sales," said Running Springs  Hardware store owner Ron Pof, whose strong sales of home repair and remodeling  supplies have more than offset the lackluster performance of such winter  products as snow tires and sleds.  </P> <P> Last winter's sporadic snowfall left Pof, a former electrical engineer, with  plenty of hard-to-sell cold-weather products. "I got real desperate around  February. I couldn't give away snow blowers or snow tires."  </P> <P> Five miles east of Running Springs on winding Highway 18, signs draped over the  entrance to Snow Valley Ski Resort proclaim a "$25 Special" on lift tickets and  "Sale! 20% to 70% Off" at a ski shop. The middle of the week finds only four  chairs of the 13 chairlifts in operation and a few skiers making runs down the  machine-made snowpack.  </P> <P> "If it rained down there, we would just be packed up here," said general  manager Benno J. Nager, looking out upon the nearly silent slopes of the  53-year-old resort. Nager says Snow Valley has remained profitable despite poor  snow conditions that reduced the number of skier visits to 150,000 last winter  from 250,000 during a normal season.  </P> <P> However, the sharp decline in skiers and the expense of snow making -- which  has already reached nearly $100,000 this season -- leaves less money for $5  million worth of expansion and renovation projects.  </P> <P> "Those plans are entirely dependent on the success of the coming ski season,"  said Nager, who notes that his problems and those of other ski resorts in the  area reverberate into neighboring towns. "A bad season has a negative effect  all the way down the line."  </P> <P> Carol and Bill Carlisle have also had to cut back on improvement projects at  their nine-unit Cloud 9 Lodge in Running Springs. Instead of buying new  mattresses and carpeting all at once, the couple have decided to spread the  projects over two years.  </P> <P> "If we had good skiing up here, we'd be full seven days a week," said Carol  Carlisle. "It's the midweek business, it's running one-third full. Sometimes  it's even less than that. We can survive. But it makes it a lot tougher. The  money doesn't come in and you're just sitting there."  </P> <P> Still, the Carlisles and other Running Springs merchants are not about to sell  out and move out of the town that began as a lumber mill settlement nearly a  century ago. The 6,000 residents of the unincorporated town and surrounding  communities were lured here by the small-town atmosphere that they believe  offers a cleaner, safer lifestyle than what is generally available down at the  "bottom of the hill" in the rest of Southern California.  </P> <P> "The quality of life up here is quite good," said Simpson, whose practice  features a vintage medical cabinet and the medicine kit and microscope owned by  his great grandfather, a Civil War physician. "It's far superior to my life  down in the beach communities."  </P> <P> The lifestyle and relatively inexpensive housing have lead to a surge in  full-time locals. Realtor Kay Fugate says her sales are running ahead of last  year, and more than half of the buyers plan to live up here year-round. "That  is quite a difference. The percentage of (full-time) sales has increased over  the last five years."  </P> <P> The change has lead many merchants to beef-up customer service to cater to the  growing pool of year-round residents, who often shop down below for lower  prices and better selection.  </P> <P> After buying Mountain Mercantile earlier this year, Patty Houk and her husband  have remodeled the grocery store, added fancy new products such as stuffed pork  chops and banned the cashier from smoking on the job.  </P> <P> During the winter season, "our business improves, but we don't depend on it,"  said Houk, who says out-of-towners account for 25% of sales during January and  February. "We want to cater to the locals . . . and customer service is our  main thing."  </P> <P> Still, there is nothing like a blanket of new snow to send business soaring.  "You couldn't even walk in the store on weekends -- it was mobbed," said Houk,  who clerked at the store before buying it. "But that was six or seven years  ago."  </P></p>

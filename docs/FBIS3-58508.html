Now that this has not happened and extremism  appears to enjoy a considerable following, people are rapidly  drawing the opposite conclusion. Both reasonings are wrong. It  is simply inconceivable, in the light of history, that Russia  should change overnight."    [Amelink] Your government is positive about NATO's  Partnership for Peace program, and even wants to take part in  it. Does that not represent a break with Finland's policy of  neutrality?    [Aho] In this context, it is important to make a distinction  between the countries of East Europe, whose security guarantees  disappeared with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and the  neutral and nonaligned countries in Europe. I view the  Partnership for Peace as an offer of closer cooperation with  NATO. We are not out to set new rules in the area of our  security. Our interest extends to that part of the program  aimed at peacekeeping activities. The Finns have a long  tradition in this area. Some people are suggesting that we are  interested in the project in the same way as the countries of  East Europe. That is not the case. The foundation of Finnish  foreign policy remains nonalignment and a strong national  defense. [end Aho]    The visit by Prime Minister Aho, who arrived from Dublin and  who will be traveling to Luxembourg this afternoon, falls within  the framework of Finland's possible accession to the European  Union [EU]. These negotiations must be completed by 1 March.  Finland is primarily concerned with measures to protect its  agriculture, the prime minister said: "We have to struggle with  a number of structural problems for which the EU will have to  allow transitional measures. We need time to adapt to the rules  of the EU." A tougher matter is the climate, which limits the  productive period of our agricultural sector. Despite the  greenhouse effect, there is no possibility of changing that.  Consequently, a separate system of support loans is needed for  farmers in the Nordic countries. There are already separate  rules in the EU for the mountainous areas. We do not have  those. A new and good criterion to take account of and that  would benefit our farmers is the degree of latitude. Using this  criterion, the EU can prevent other countries from using the  same rule to obtain support for their farmers. A separate rule  is primarily of interest for supporting the existing social  structure in the Finnish countryside.    [Amelink] The opinion polls give a changing picture of the  Finnish attitude toward the EU. Do you expect a positive  outcome from the referendum this fall on EU accession?    [Aho] Many people, and especially those in my own Center  Party, are indeed against it. There is a certain amount of  hesitation about whether or not you can trust the conditions of  accession. However, I expect that the majority will agree if we  can obtain favorable conditions during the negotiations in  Brussels. They would be crucial in the final judgement.    [Amelink] Are you thinking of holding the accession  referendums in Norway, Sweden, and Finland on the same day?    [Aho] That is one option that cannot be ruled out. However,  it is still too early to speculate on it. We still need a few  more weeks.    [Amelink] The Finnish economy is currently in a slump.  Despite inflation of about 1 percent, unemployment remains  above 20 percent. Can you see light at the end of the tunnel?    [Aho] In early fall the unemployment rate stopped rising,  but  I must admit that this really is an enormous problem. If  investment resumes -- and there are initial signs that this is  beginning -- then the situation in the labor market will  gradually improve. The fact that our exports have risen  considerably recently will increase room for new investments,  but the employment situation will certainly not improve in such  a dramatically quick way.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Yun Sok-chin: "Those Who Have Kim Yong-sam's </F> Ears"]    [Text] Whose word does President Kim Yong-sam listen to  most in leading his administration? WOLGAN CHUNGANG polled 69  Chongwadae and National Assembly reporters covering the  president's conduct of state affairs firsthand and at short  range. Following is an analysis of the traits and backgrounds of  those exerting mighty influence on the president, based on the  findings of this survey (Editor's note).    The survey found that the person who exerts greatest  influence on the Kim Yong-sam administration is Chongwadae  Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong. He is followed by Yi Hoe-chang,  prime minister; Choe Hyong-u, minister of home affairs; Yi  Won-chong, senior presidential secretary [SPS] for political  affairs, and Kim Chong-nam, SPS for educational and cultural  affairs, in that order. Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the  Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], placed sixth.    The poll showed Pak Kwan-yong "overwhelmingly at the top" of  a list of public office holders with influence on the  administration in general, as 68 of the 69 political reporters  who responded to the survey voted for him among the top 10. As  seen in "Table 1," 40 of them saw him as No. 1 in this category,  10 as second, and 6 as third. Thus, they unhesitatingly gave him  higher ratings. In total points, Pak gained a whopping 599  points out of a possible 690 to hold a virtually incomparable  lead over rivals.    It is often said that "how often you open the door to the  president's office determines the degree of your influence." Pak  Kwan-yong, in his capacity as Chongwadae secretary general,  holds a one-hour tete-a-tete with the president at 0700 every  morning, giving reports and receiving instructions. It is seldom  skipped. People say that the frequency of tete-a-tete is the  indicator of influence, and we saw the truth of what they say in  the fall of the commander of the Defense Security Command [DSC]  of our National Armed Forces in his status under the civilian  government.    As late as in the No Tae-u regime days, the power wielded by  the DSC commander was an almighty one; he often was in emulation  with the Chongwadae secretary general and the director of the  Agency for National Security Planning [ANSP]. This was because  the presidents in the past had considered the DSC as a major  channel of information and held a tete-a-tete with its commander  on a regular basis. In the poll, altogether 50 persons were  named at least once to one of the top 10 places but the DSC  commander's name was not among them.    Pak Kwan-yong's rise is not just because of the post he  holds. He was elected to the National Assembly four times. As  the record shows, he has political sense, which is a necessity  for a Chongwadae secretary general, plus an outstanding ability  to analyze and deal with matters, however complex. For instance,  on North Korea as the biggest pending issue, he is an expert to  some degree. In addition, he is deft in handling business.    Notable more than anything else is that Pak, as Chongwadae  secretary general, is displaying his superb leadership for  harmony. He is playing without a hitch his role as the leader of  the 50-odd members of the Chongwadae staff, including nine  senior secretaries, holding them together in perfect cooperation  to "assist the president." Outstanding is his ability to  transform discord, predictable in the Chongwadae relationship  with the DLP or the cabinet, into harmony whenever such tuning  is needed.    When President Kim picked Pak as his chief secretary, it was  a surprise to the public. He is not one of those so-called  born-and-bred Sangdodong [Kim Yong-sam's private residence] men.  He had never been a Kim Yong-sam follower, and when Kim Yong-sam  was an opposition leader, Pak belonged to a faction opposing  him. He had never held any of the top three posts in the former  Reunification Democratic Party [RDP]. At the time of the  three-party merger, he belatedly became a member of the 15-man  RDP negotiating team, as a pinch hitter for Yi Ki-taek, the  present chairman of the Democratic Party, who dropped out at the  last minute. That was about the highest party post he ever held.    Nonetheless, Pak Kwan-yong beat other longtime followers of  the president and became the "center fielder" in the core of  power. The promotion was a superb pick by President Kim  eliminating from the beginning every potential cause of dispute  such as acts of arrogation and human walls. Pak functioned  correctly as a Chongwadae chief of staff should to be deeply  trusted by the president--and to emerge in the poll as No. 1 of  the president's men.    Of the top 20, as many as seven are Chongwadae staff  members.  Yi Won-chong, SPS for political affairs, and Kim Chong-nam, SPS  for educational and cultural affairs, placed fourth and fifth  respectively, while Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs, ranked  eighth and Kim Yong-su, SPS for civil affairs, 12th. Pak  Chae-yun, SPS for economic affairs, and Chu Ton-sik, SPS for  public information, unexpectedly found their way to the list, in  lower spots though, the 14th and 15th respectively. Of those who  are not among SPS's, it is noteworthy that Kim Ki-su, director  of the Office of Presidential Suite, made the list. Yi  Won-chong, Hong In-kil and Kim Ki-su belong to the ranks of Kim  Yong-sam men born and bred.    Conspicuously among RDP men born and bred, Home Affairs  Minister Choe Hyong-u and former Minister of State Kim Tok-yong  placed third and ninth respectively. They appear to be seen as  exerting great influence on President Kim regardless of their  official positions. Less than a year after his resignation as  DLP secretary general because of a college entrance scandal  involving his son, Choe Hyong-u was reinstated, as minister of  home affairs this time, demonstrating his influence as the  president's "right-hand man."    The same thing can be said about Kim Tok-yong, former  minister of state, who once was generally viewed as "Kim  Yong-sam's other self." Except his seat in the National  Assembly, he currently holds no office in party management.  According to some observers, however, he will be named to an  important post again when the time comes as President Kim hinted  at his New Year's press conference by expressing his confidence  in him.    Kim Tok-yong had to leave the Administration because of  controversies over his private organization and, for this  reason, placed rather low in the poll for the weight he actually  carries. But he is viewed as a darkhorse capable of a rollback  to the top group at any time.    So Chong-won, who succeeded Kim Tok-yong as minister of  state, placed 19th. He is another RDP man born and bred.    DLP figures are lagging a great deal in the ratings. The  fact  that even Chairman Kim Chong-pil, who is said to be entrusted  with the "Yoido [location of DLP headquarters] administration,"  only placed sixth and behind senior presidential secretaries Yi  Won-chong and Kim Chong-nam clearly shows it. Even that came  after the president at the New Year's press conference bolstered  Kim's image by saying that "party affairs will be the  responsibility of the party chairman." It is an alarming  development indeed. But for that comment by the president, what  could have happened to Kim Chong-pil's ratings? Reporters  themselves who responded to the questionnaire raised the same  question. However, there is no question that in view of the  "next" presidency, the chairmanship of the ruling party is  always a powerful post and can by no means be treated lightly.    The DLP could save face, so to speak, with Mun Chong-su,  secretary general, and Kang Sam-chae, director of the Office of  Planning and Coordinating, placing 11th and 15th respectively.  Particularly conspicuous is Mun Chong-su's rapid rise. He is a  "YS man to the core" who, in the days when Kim Yong-sam ran for  the National Assembly as an opposition candidate from Pusan's  West district, used to accompany him to his nighttime stumping,  carrying a torch in his hand. The two beat Yi Han-tong, flood  leader, and Yi Se-ki, chairman of the Policy Committee, both  influential members of the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party]  faction, to place among the top 20 in the poll. This development  can be explained by what is called a trend of political lineage  prevailing over the weight of individual character. This means  that Mun Chong-su and Kang Sam-chae do not owe their rise to the  party itself.    Rep. Kim Yun-hwan, rather unexpectedly, placed as low as  18th. While it is unavoidable for him to act as leader of the TK  [Taegu-Kyongsang] group whether he likes it or not, Kim Yun-hwan  personally keeps a very low profile, presenting himself as a  "person to be tested in light of the new era." But he is the man  who contributed most to the DLP nomination of Kim Yong-sam as  its presidential candidate, and it is only assumed that  President Kim may not have lost his gratitude for the  contribution.    From the National Assembly, only Speaker Yi Man-sop was  listed among the top 20. Neither Vice Speaker Hwang Nak-chu, a  member of the RDP faction, nor any of the standing committee  chairmen was even close to the 20th spot. Even in the case of Yi  Man-sop, it was because of the weight of the office he holds as  the leader of one of the three branches of government that he  placed as he did. Thus, Yi Man-sop's case can be compared to an  "ornament" carrying little clout, according to reporters'  opinions.    Compared with the party and the National Assembly, the poll  showed the cabinet as exerting greater "influence" on President  Kim. Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang placed second and Chong  Chae-sok, deputy prime minister and concurrently minister of the  Economic Planning Board [EPB], 10th. Also, Han Sung-chu,  minister of foreign affairs, and So Chong-won, minister of  state, respectively took the 13th and 19th spots.    Yi Hoe-chang also represents another of one of the three  branches of government. The weight of the office he holds,  combined with his strong will as a fresh reformist, seems to  have brought him high marks. Earlier, as the director of the  Board of Audit and Inspection, he held fast to principle with  his characteristic tenacity, and this was received with  enthusiastic applause by the public.    It should be noted that President Kim is, first and  foremost,  a politician relying on the masses and that the degree of his  trust in a public office holder is generally influenced by how  the latter is received by the public. Therefore, it is not  impossible that, if Yi Hoe-chang's performance as prime minister  should prove creditable, the president could bring him into  politics through the 15th general election and have him set his  sight on the next presidency, although it is still too early to  say so. At any rate, Yi is a man of conviction and his  conviction changed the image of the Board of Audit and  Inspection in a short period of time; when President Kim put him  in charge of the cabinet, we were able to get a glimpse of his  style of personnel management. In this connection, attention  should be paid to the rise of Deputy Prime Minister Chong  Chae-sok whose unique individuality and conviction propelled him  to the top of the economic department.    Since its creation, the successive directors of the ANSP had  held the levers of power, as one of them said "I am the power. I  can ruin anyone." In the civilian government, however, ANSP  Director Kim Tok placed seventh, indicating a measure of  decline. He staged a close match with Chairman Kim Chong-pil and  Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs, sandwiched between them by  a margin of less then 10 points. In the number of votes they  received within the top 10 places, there were little difference  between the three, all marking slightly over 40.    Meanwhile, those polled were unanimous in saying that the  seventh place for the ANSP director represents a substantial  improvement from the initial days of the new government when  President Kim unhesitatingly hinted at his intent to reduce the  excessively enlarged power of the ANSP. Symbolic of it was his  decision barring the ANSP director from attending cabinet  meetings. In principle, that decision still is in effect.    Nevertheless, President Kim, who recognized once again the  importance of the ANSP's existence after he entered Chongwadae,  is known to see its director once a week for regular briefing.  He seems to highly appreciate the leadership of Kim Tok, who was  a scholar before becoming the ANSP director. In view of the  nature of the ANSP as an agency operating behind the scenes, its  real status could possibly be higher than people think.    Kim Yong-su, SPS for civil affairs, who placed 13th,  especially attracts attention in many ways. An ex-prosecutor, he  served as ANSP deputy director, then as assemblyman from the DLP  national constituency. As the record shows, his career contained  little that President Kim could appreciate. Nevertheless, he  became the head of the civil affairs secretariat, an office that  combined the functions of the audit and inspection secretariat  and the civil affairs secretariat of the No Tae-u days. It was  none other than Kim Yong-su who actually wielded--at working  levels--the sword of reform and investigation which President  Kim drew as soon as he took office.    Whoever its head, it was inevitable for the office of SPS  for  civil affairs to increase its influence rapidly during the first  year of the YS reform. The fact that, of the six secretaries  directly under him, three are "Sangdodong men" tells how much  President Kim did to prop up Kim Yong-su. The three are Kim  Kil-hwan, first secretary for civil affairs; Kim Mu-song, second  secretary for same; and O Se-chon, first secretary on audit and  inspection. Also, Kim Hyok-kyu, governor of South Kyongsang  Province, had served as second secretary on audit and inspection  until two months ago, helping Kim Yong-su. It appears that Kim  Yong-su's influence will continue unless the president slows  down his reform program in the future.    Another figure attracting attention is Yi Won-chong, SPS for  political affairs. Since his days as an information secretary at  Sangdodong, Yi has been one of those closest to YS, although his  name was little known. They used to say that Yi Won-chong "can  read YS' mind from the look of his eyes." When President Kim  formed his first cabinet, he appointed Yi vice minister of  public information in a surprise move, then senior political  affairs secretary in less than a year, putting him at the top of  senior Chongwadae secretaries. Yi Won-chong thus gained  additional power and became a tiger with wings, so to speak. As  vice minister of public information, he had attracted public  attention as he exerted much influence on the administration.  Since he has his place even closer to YS now, it would be  interesting to watch how much more frequently the president will  be seeking for "our Won-chong."    It so happened after all that the "top 20 men exerting their  influence on the administration in general" shows that the  closer the individual's workplace is to the president's office  geographically, the greater is his influence. Chongwadae  secretaries are unquestionably ahead, followed by those in the  Integrated Government Building on Sejong Street. "Namsan"  [ANSP], further away, is that much more behind, while the DLP  and the National Assembly, located across the Han River, have  even less influence, the survey found.    On the other hand, Sangdodong men are asserting their  prominence regardless of where they are. One may say that  "Sangdodong is in all its glory now."    In the "political" category, they demonstrated their  influence even more conspicuously. Of the top 10, only  three--DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil, who placed 4th; Prime  Minister Yi Hoe-chang, 8th; and ANSP Director Kim Tok,  10th--were non-RDP members. The rest were all Sangdodong men, a  fact clearly indicating that it is not an overstatement to say  that they are in control of the nation's politics.    As seen in "Table 2," Chongwadae Secretary General Pak  Kwan-yong again emerged at the top in the "political" division.  Although he did not score as overwhelmingly in total points as  in the "administration in general" division, 28 of the 69  political reporters put his name in the top spot. However, only  47 altogether voted for him for one of the top five spots. So,  in total votes, Yi Won-chong and Choe Hyong-u were found ahead  of him with 57 and 50 respectively.    Most noteworthy in this category was the rise of Yi  Won-chong  to the second place. While 20-odd points behind Pak Kwan-yong in  total points, he prevailed over Choe Hyong-u by more than 50  points, clearly reversing their positions in the "administration  in general" category. However, as in the "administration in  general" category, Choe Hyong-u led Chairman Kim Chong-pil and  Rep. Kim Tok-yong by substantially large margins.    Also notable is the advance to the seventh place of Hong  In-kil, SPS for general affairs, whose office seems to be remote  from politics. He strikes a good contrast to Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang, who placed second in the "administration in general"  category but eighth--next to Hong In-kil--in this category. In  the Sangdodong days, Hong managed the Kim Yong-sam faction's  difficult housekeeping; he is known to be unrivaled in the depth  of rapport with the president. At any rate, it is another case  demonstrating the power of Sangdodong men.    ANSP Director Kim Tok received 24 votes, ranking last in the  10th, a fact unthinkable in the past. It would strike people  even strange--as strange as the fact that nowhere in the survey  did the name of the Secret Service chief arise. The ANSP and the  Secret Service, known in the past as a hotbed of political  intrigues, are thus being returned to where they belong in what  should be viewed as a welcome indicator of political  development. In the Pak Chong-hui era, Secret Service Chief Cha  Chi-chol behaved as if he had been "vice president," while under  President Chon Tu-hwan, it was Chang Se-tong, Chon's Secret  Service chief, who was known to all as the "No. 2 man in power."  Compared with those days, the Kim Yong-sam era Secret Service  has changed immensely indeed.    A general view of the "political" top 10 presents a fair  mixture of Chongwadae secretaries, the cabinet, party executives  and heads of the agencies under the president's direct control,  seemingly maintaining a reasonable degree of balance. As said in  the above, however, an in-depth analysis will unveil a virtual  monopoly of power by Sangdodong men, prompting concerns about  the lopsidedness. Critics say that at a time when improvement in  the nation's competitiveness is an urgent demand, the larger the  pool of talents, the better.    In the "economic" division, the cabinet held a conspicuous  lead over Chongwadae.    As "Table 3" shows, Chong Chae-sok, deputy prime minister  and  concurrently EPB minister, placed first by marking 291 points,  while Hong Chae-hyong, minister of finance, came out third, and  So Sang, minister of health and social affairs, fifth.  Meanwhile, Kim Chol-su, minister of trade and industry, was tied  at sixth and Kim U-sok, minister of construction, shared the  10th spot. Moreover, if Han I-hon, EPB vice minister, placing  fourth, and Chu Kyong-sok, commissioner of the Office of Tax  Administration, sharing the sixth place, should be included in  an expanded cabinet category, the cabinet accounts for an  overwhelming seven out of the 11 [including ties] listed in the  top 10. A point common to all the seven is that they are  ex-career bureaucrats and economic experts.    Only three were picked from Chongwadae--Pak Chae-yun, SPS  for  economic affairs, placing second; Choe Yang-pu, SPS for  agriculture and fisheries, eighth, and Pak Kwan-yong, secretary  general, ninth. Perhaps because the economy requires expertise  more than anything else, Pak Chae-yun and Choe Yang-pu are,  exceptionally, ahead of Secretary General Pak in this category.    Of the 11 persons, a surprise is the case of Yi Se-ki, DLP  policy chief, who shared the 10th place. He is not an economic  expert but yet was voted among the top 10 apparently for the  reason that as chairman of the party Policy Committee, he is in  the position of supervising DLP economic policies. Of the many  self-styled economic experts in the DLP, reporters practically  saw him as the only one who has any influence on President Kim.    In this category, Deputy Prime Minister Chong Chae-sok, the  number one in this category, and SPS Pak Chae-yun, the  runner-up, give the impression that they were engaging in a  see-saw game as economic experts representing the cabinet and  Chongwadae respectively. The result was that Chong Chae-sok  prevailed over Pak Chae-yun by 40 in total points and four in  total votes, or virtually by a decision. This strikes a good  contrast to the days of Yi Kyong-sik, Chong Chae-sok's  predecessor.    Pak Chae-yun, senior economic secretary, is a stubborn man  with a style persisting in academic conviction, a factor having  contributed to the consistency of policy and to its  implementation. Based on that, he had worked as a  behind-the-scenes adviser for YS since the latter's presidential  candidate days, then played a leading role in drawing the  100-Day Plan and the Five-Year Plan of the New Economy. As a  result, former Deputy Prime Minister Yi Kyong-sik was kept at a  distance in the decisionmaking process on major economic  policies, until the day of his retirement. He was, in effect,  dragged around by Pak Chae-yun. If Yi Kyong-sik had stayed on as  deputy prime minister, Pak Chae-yun would have, in all  probability, topped the "economic" category list.    However, the arrival of Chong Chae-sok--who rose to deputy  prime minister and EPB minister only four months after his  surprise promotion to minister of transportation--put on the  brakes on Pak Chae-yun's one-man race. The "lack of experience  in administration" and "want of political sense" was the  weakness on the part of Pak Chae-yun; Chong Chae-sok had no such  weakness. In addition, as seen in his unconventional speech and  conduct, Chong Chae-sok could simply leap over what Pak Chae-yun  would persist in in his scholarly fashion. This also enabled  Chong to score higher. Choe Yang-pu entered Chongwadae in  December last year when the post of SPS for agriculture and  fisheries was created. Although it is too early yet for him to  be appraised of his performance, his name apparently came up in  the poll for the reason that he is one of the economic experts  among the Chongwadae senior secretaries. A graduate in economics  of Seoul National University, Choe is a typical agricultural  economist. He obtained his doctorate at the University of  Missouri and, after that, worked at the Korea Rural Economics  Institute for 25 years. His extensive theoretical expertise is  viewed as his strength. While Choe's administrative capability  is yet to be tested, he served as the "mouth" of our government  delegation in the 1989 Uruguay Round negotiations.    EPB Vice Minister Han I-hon is a graduate of Kyongnam High  School, President Kim's alma mater, who served as an economic  adviser in YS' presidential candidate days. He is generally  known to be a notch above Pak Kwan-yong, the Chongwadae  secretary general, in reading the president's mind. On the start  of the new government, Han was appointed chairman of the Fair  Trade Commission and, while in that post, reportedly continued  to provide advice and suggestions to YS as requested. It is  possibly for this reason that he emerged as the only vice  minister making the list, placing as high as 4th.    The fact that Chu Kyong-sok, commissioner of the Office of  Tax Administration, a vice minister-level post, placed sixth  seems to be the result of consideration that he is the head of a  "powerful agency" rather than that he is exercising any policy  influence on President Kim. Under the past regimes, the Office  of Tax Administration had been called an "ANSP of the economy."  Chu Kyong-sok, appointed its commissioner in the Sixth Republic  days, retained the post under the Kim Yong-sam government, which  is a rare case. And behind it is a school relationship--Chu and  the president attended the same high school. Similar is the case  of Kim U-sok, minister of construction, who placed 10th. He is  neither an economic expert nor a minister of a powerful  department; however, he once served as chief secretary when the  president was an opposition leader. And political reporters  apparently expected that he would be exercising influence  visibly and invisibly.    Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong, placing third, Health and  Social Affairs Minister So Sang-mok, fifth, and Trade and  Industry Minister Kim Chol-su, sixth, are all among the top  experts in their fields and, as such, needed by President Kim.  However, it remains to be seen whether the president would still  want them after the three quit their cabinet posts.    Expert judgment is more in demand in the economy than in any  other sectors. Perhaps for this reason, President Kim seems to  value the views of ex-bureaucrats who have long experience.    In the "foreign policy, national security and reunification"  division ("Table 4"), it was a close match between ANSP Director  Kim Tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu second, and Chong  Chong-uk, SPS for foreign policy and national security. The  three were all professors before joining the government, and  people are rather anxious to know who of them really exerts more  influence on the president.    In this category, ANSP Director Kim, holding a monopoly on  intelligence concerning North Korea, placed first, followed by  an extremely small margin by Foreign Minister Han, whose  overseas trips are exceptionally frequent, including visits to  Washington over the North Korea nuclear issue.    Scholastic ability is one thing and administrative  efficiency  for insight into North Korea issues is another. SPS Chong  Chong-uk, whose ratings for the latter are not very high yet,  was pushed to the third place after all. With regard to the  exposed deficiency in the realistic sense on Chong's part, it is  known that Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong makes the necessary  intervention each time.    When Han Wan-sang was deputy prime minister and concurrently  minister of the National Unification Board [NUB], Pak Kwan-yong  acted as mediator whenever differences occurred within the  government's national security team. In the RDP days, Pak long  served as chairman of the party special committee on  reunification and of the National Assembly ad hoc committee on  the same. As a result, he is known to be considerably familiar  with North Korea issues. His fourth place, therefore, is nothing  unusual.    The fifth place for Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister [and  concurrently NUB minister], cannot but be a natural one for his  post. However, affected by the current status of the NUB, plus  his own conservatism, Yi was found not high in this category  although he chairs the government's national security team. The  minister of national defense is limited in his authority; the  impression of the post is that it is more for the implementation  of policies that have been decided than for making the  decisions. Possibly for that reason, Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae placed only sixth. In the military government days,  the chief of the General Staff of the Army and the DSC commander  wielded considerably great power in connection with the security  of the regime; under the civilian government, however, they were  completely left out, in the same context that the Police Agency  director, responsible for public security, was treated as  irrelevant.    Also noteworthy is that Hwang Pyong-tae, ambassador to  China,  and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu placed seventh and eighth  respectively with almost the same marks. As for the ambassador  to the United States, it seems that his post was given due  consideration under the circumstances that the nation is  required to maintain close relations with Washington over  "foreign policy, national security and reunification."  Meanwhile, Hwang Pyong-tae was, in President Kim's Sangdodong  days, so close an aide that people called him "No. 1 policy  adviser" for Kim. Furthermore, Beijing, his present post, is the  best observation point on North Korea, and he is assigned the  extremely important duty of negotiating China's exercise of  influence on North Korea concerning the nuclear issue. These  factors seem to have led to the high marks.    Interesting is the fact that Rep. Chong Chae-mun placed not  10th but ninth in the "foreign policy, national security, and  reunification" division. He has successively served as chairman  of the National Assembly committee on foreign policy and  reunification and, as such, is duly recognized for his  expertise. He belongs to the RDP faction and, moreover, he and  the president share Pusan as their home city. So, it is quite  possible that he will be exerting further influence in this  field in the future.    Based on what has been said, it can be concluded that Pak  Kwan-yong, the secretary general at Chongwadae, is the man of  super power only next to President Kim Yong-sam. He not only  placed "overwhelmingly first" in the "administration in general"  division but topped the list in the "political" division as  well. In the "foreign policy, national security, and  reunification" division, too, he placed fourth among the top 10.  Moreover, he even ranked ninth in the "economic" division where  he is seen as a layman. Thus, in the survey, Pak Kwan-yong  emerged as the unrivaled, all-around champion by scoring a  majority decision.    The survey also clearly showed that those who are now  wielding mighty power, including the secretary general, are  mostly Sangdodong men. In particular, the results in the  "administration in general" and "political" categories showed  the following as the leading characters from Sangdodong: Choe  Hyong-u, minister of home affairs; Yi Won-chong, SPS for  political affairs; Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs; Kim  Tok-yong, former first minister of state; Mun Chong-su, DLP  secretary general; and So Chong-won, first minister of state.    Among cabinet members, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, Deputy  Prime Minister and EPB minister Chong Chae-sok, and Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu surfaced as men of influence. The "team  power" of the cabinet could not beat the "group power" of  Sangdodong men. The survey also found that except the case of  ANSP Director Kim Tok, the holders of other offices that had  been regarded as the "seats of power" in the past--the  prosecutor general, the commissioner of the Office of Tax  Administration, the chief of the General Staff of the Army, and  the director of the Police Agency--have been greatly reduced in  their voice under the civilian government.    This poll was conducted under the management of WOLGAN  CHUNGANG.    The questionnaire-based survey was made on political  reporters assigned to Chongwadae and the National Assembly,  including those of dailies, radio-television networks, and press  agencies. It also included many reporters of local dailies but  no foreign correspondents. The questionnaire sheets were  distributed on 8 and 12 February, and altogether 69 of them were  retrieved. The questionnaire was as follows:    QUESTION: Of public office holders, who do you think is  exerting most influence on the conduct of state affairs by  President Kim Yong-sam?    Please write in the names of persons you choose--10 names in  the first category and 5 each in the other three categories--in  order of importance, as indicated below:    --administration in general: 1, 2, 3 ... through 10;    --political: 1, 2 ... through 5;    --economic: 1, 2 ... through 5;    --foreign policy, national security, reunification: 1, 2  ... through 5.    The "administration in general" was designed to get a  general  picture of those influencing the Kim Yong-sam administration.  Considering the potential public interests nationwide in this  division, the reporters were asked to choose 10 persons, one  each for the first through 10th spots.    Separately, the survey had the "political," "economic" and  "foreign policy, national security and reunification" divisions  because these divisions, while representing major branches of  the administration, require expertise. For each of these  categories, reporters were asked to choose five persons.    In the tables below, "Overall Standing" of the person was  determined by the "Total Points" he scored.    First, the number of votes each received for each place was  counted. As for points scored, a different weight was assigned  to each place--i.e., 10 points to the first place, 9 points to  the second place, and so on down to 1 point to the 10th place in  the "administration in general" division. Thus, the maximum  points was 690 in the "administration in general" category and  345 in the other three categories.    The "Total Votes" indicates the total number of votes  received by each and is unrelated to the "Overall Standing."  Generally, the "Total Points" and the "Total Votes" were in  proportion to each other, but they were not in a few cases. The  significance of the "Total Votes" lies in the fact that the  person cannot, after all, be left out in his influence on  President Kim in the respective division.    In the "administration in general" category, the respondents  picked their top 10's and, based on the total points thus  computed on them, WOLGAN CHUNGANG arranged the top 20  point-getters in order of "Overall Standing." In the other three  categories, the respondents picked their top five's and WOLGAN  CHUNGANG arranged the top 10 point-getters in order of "Overall  Standing" in each category.    The survey found that some names cited in the  "administration  in general" category came up again in other categories. Also,  the reporters were asked to consider only public officials to  prevent any unnecessary misunderstanding or irresponsible  criticisms that might be caused by involving relatives by blood  or marriage.

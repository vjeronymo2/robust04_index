			<p>BFN     [Text] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] issued a  political statement following a recent meeting during which the  APF discussed political and security developments in the  Palestinian arena. The conferees examined some of the serious  measures undertaken by the corrupt Oslo team in the context of  the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    In its statement, the APF said that the suspect role  assigned  to the so-called Palestinian police has shown them to be a  repressive tool in the hand of the Zionist occupation. As part  of the practical arrangements agreed on between the Oslo team  and the Zionist enemy, a number of those affiliated with the  Zionist enemy agencies made statements on disarming our people  and their militant forces and on opening prisons for our  people's honorable strugglers. In this context, they have  started by detaining Hani 'Abid, an Islamic Jihad member, and  pursuing our people's strugglers who reject the Oslo agreement  and all its appendices, chapters, and objectives.    The APF statement adds: We in the APF warn of the gravity of  this dangerous behavior which will lead to detrimental results,  sedition, and internal strife. We urge the masses of our people  and their militant forces to firmly confront the practices of  this team which has violated the will of our people, and its  agencies which have been proved to be dens designed to absorb  agents and spies linked to the Zionist enemy.</p>

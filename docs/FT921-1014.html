			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Carolco secures Dollars 73.8m of financing CAROLCO, the troubled independent Hollywood film studio, has secured Dollars 73.8m of financing from its foreign investors and has gained access to an additional Dollars 23m in new bank loans. The fresh funding should be sufficient to allow the studio to continue operating. Carolco's foreign minority shareholders include Pioneer of Japan, Rizzoli of Italy and Canal Plus of France. Carolco, along with other independent film companies such as Orion Pictures, has been caught in a financial squeeze. In December, Carolco cut its staff of 200 by 25 per cent and said it was considering reducing the number of deals with film-makers. Problems at the company, which started mounting last summer, forced it to cut off talks aimed at acquiring a 46 per cent stake in Live Entertainment, the home video supplier, in November. Carolco still holds a 53 per cent stake in Live. The studio, which is best known for its Terminator and Rambo films, was in technical default on Dollars 172m of bank loans for much of last year. The details of the new financing and restructuring are not significantly different from a package arranged two months ago, although the amount of funding has increased. In January, Carolco said it had secured Dollars 45m of financing and a deferral on Dollars 10m of debts from its US and foreign lenders. The principal differences include the Dollars 23m in new loans that Carolco's banks have made available to the company. Carolco's bankers include Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank and Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland. In addition, Carolco's investors have agreed to fund up to Dollars 13.8m of potential bank collateral shortfalls. While the arrangement should help Carolco keep operating in the short-term, the company said it anticipated that its operations could require 'additional sources of funds'.</p>

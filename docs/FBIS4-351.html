			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The situation in Kigali is dramatic. The  Presidential Guard is looting and killing. We have just spoken  to Colonel Marchal, the commander of the Belgian blue helmets in  Rwanda. He has denied the reports about the death of three  Belgian military observers. However, 10 Belgian soldiers have  been taken prisoner by the Rwandan Army. They are being  detained at a camp in Kigali, but we have no further news about  them. Two Ghanaian blue helmets have, however, been killed.  [passage omitted]    We are also getting reports of a violent confrontation  between the Presidential Guard and soldiers of the Rwandan  Patriotic Front, who have left the building where they were  based in central Kigali.</p>

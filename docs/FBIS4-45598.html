			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Russian Academy of Sciences Press Service under </F> the "Teletype" rubric: "Semaks Is a New-Generation Drug"]    [Text] Clinical trials of an original psychotropic  preparation of a peptide nature have been completed. It is  semaks, developed by the Institute of Molecular Genetics [IMG]  and the Biology Faculty of Moscow State University. In terms of  its structure semaks is a synthetic analogue of a short fragment  of the stress hormone--adrenocorticotropic hormone. This short  fragment is interesting because of its clearly expressed  stimulating influence on the highest forms of activity of the  central nervous system: the formation and reproduction of a  memory trace, motivation, attention, and emotional state. The  analogue synthesized at the IMG possesses the same range of  physiological action, but it takes tens of times longer to take  effect than the prototype. The analogue synthesized at the IMG  has traveled the long path of essential preclinical trials and  the development of the technology for producing the substance  and its medicinal form. This has resulted in the creation of a  medicinal preparation in a form convenient to use--nose  drops--which has been named semaks.</p>

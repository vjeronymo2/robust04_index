			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes for economic boost spur 1.9% rise in Nikkei Shares surged in the morning on reports of an additional stimulus package, but later lost half their gain on profit-taking and position squaring, and the Nikkei average closed 1.9 per cent up, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average added 333.44 at 17,458.75. The Topix index put on 21.25, or 1.5 per cent, at 1,465.12, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.25 to 1,180.12. The Nikkei declined to a low for the day of 17,073.81 in early trading, but later jumped to a high of 17,887.29 on reports that the government would announce an emergency stimulus package containing an income tax cut and relaxation of land transaction taxes. Reports that Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, had hinted on a cut in the official discount rate also encouraged investors. Investment trust funds and companies were seen actively buying shares. However, the rally lost steam as Mr Takemura later denied that he had mentioned a rate cut, and a fall in the futures market in the afternoon prompted arbitrage selling and profit-taking. Volume expanded to 470m shares from 368m, while rises led falls by 952 to 120, with 62 issues unchanged. Mr Jiro Saito, vice-minister of finance, denied that the government had played a role in the rebound of stock prices. Local newspapers have been suggesting that the government was trying to prop up the market by ordering life assurers to buy shares. An official meeting between Mr Setsuya Tabuchi, former chairman of Nomura Securities, and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, on Tuesday, when the Nikkei plunged to a year's low, is also believed to have been staged by government officials in order to revive confidence. In spite of the overall rise, some bank shares were weak. The Nikkei banking index rose only 1.3 per cent, with Industrial bank of Japan down Y40 to Y2,820 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank off Y30 at Y1,940. Gainers included Fuji Bank, up Y50 at Y1,950, and Sakura Bank, Y20 ahead at Y1,480. East Japan Railway firmed Y8,000 to Y435,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y12,000 at Y741,000. In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 479.59 to 19,456.59 in volume of 32.7m shares. Roundup The Pacific Basin region was generally firmer yesterday. HONG KONG finished slightly lower as sharp early gains were erased after Governor Chris Patten announced the introduction of a partial bill on his controversial electoral reform package. The Hang Seng index closed 15.83 easier at 9,238.20, having been 113 points ahead in the morning and 88 points up at midsession. Turnover dipped to HKDollars 5.14bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 5.32bn. December futures slid to a low for the day of 9,150 after the Patten speech, but recovered slightly to finish a net 170 down at 9,170. TAIWAN was lifted by a wave of strong buying just before the close, and the market ended 2.5 per cent higher after hectic trade, extending Wednesday's gain of 2.6 per cent. The market index moved ahead 110.90 to end at its intraday peak of 4,579.24, the highest finish since May 13. Turnover increased to TDollars 60.53bn, the heaviest since April. Pulp and paper stocks led the advance on expectations that the industry, which slumped this year, will recover on firmer product prices next year. Chung Hwa Pulp closed the day's limit up at TDollars 21.40. KUALA LUMPUR saw the day's highs eroded by late profit-taking, although the composite index still ended 2.09 ahead at a new closing peak of 1,017.51. Volume rose to 693.3m shares from the previous day's 601.5m. SINGAPORE was spurred to a record close by foreign institutional buying, the Straits Times Industrial index adding 25.24 at 2,131.25. Early Japanese institutional buying set the mood for the market's advance in the morning, but later trading was subdued by profit-taking. AUSTRALIA rose strongly, encouraged by gains elsewhere in the region. The All Ordinaries index climbed 41.9, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,047.3. Turnover amounted to ADollars 557.4m. More heavy trading in the shares of Goodman Fielder, the food group, led to speculation that someone may be amassing a stake, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The stock closed 6 cents higher at ADollars 1.68 in volume of 11m shares and has now gained almost 10 per cent during the past fortnight. SEOUL closed near to the 800 level on across the board selling. The composite index shed 7.58 to 801.17. Turnover totalled Won682.9bn. Posco, the steel group, saw the day's heaviest volume with 2.2m shares changing hands, and rose to a day's high of Won37,800 before closing unchanged at Won36,500. MANILA advanced strongly, with the composite index rising 72.13 to 2,395.89 in turnover of 1.1bn pesos. Philippine Long Distance Telephone appreciated 20 pesos to 1,755 pesos and PT &amp; T 1 peso to 9.40 pesos. NEW ZEALAND was again boosted by demand for forestry issues, which left the NZSE-40 capital index 38.78, or 1.9 per cent, higher at 2.079.30 in strong turnover.</p>

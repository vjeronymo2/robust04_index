			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: UAP fights for a bridgehead - The French insurer's foray into Germany AT first glance, the announcement on Wednesday that Union des Assurances de Paris, the biggest single French insurer, was buying a minority stake in Nordstern of Germany from the Winterthur group looks like an ordinary business transaction. UAP has made no secret of its ambitions of expanding into Germany, and Nordstern is an attractive vehicle. Moreover, the deal, whereby UAP cedes 3 per cent of its equity to Winterthur for 37.4 per cent of Nordstern, seems reasonably priced and should not dilute UAP's earnings. But there is a hidden agenda. Nordstern is the latest offensive in UAP's increasingly bitter battle with Suez, the French holding company that controls Nordstern through Colonia, the German insurer which UAP has long hoped would be its bridgehead into Germany. Last week, Suez scuppered UAP's hopes by breaking off its long-running negotiations over Colonia. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, UAP chairman whose high standing in French financial circles could be imperilled if he cannot clinch the Colonia deal, has described the Nordstern deal as part of his 'friendly chess match' with Suez. The European insurance industry is now waiting to see how 'friendly' the rest of the game will be. The chess match began three years ago when UAP paid FFr14.3bn (Dollars 2.66bn) for 34 per cent of Victoire, a French insurer controlled by Suez, which had bought it for FFr25bn. UAP then tried to swap its Victoire shares for part of the latter's controlling stake in Colonia. The transaction, or so Mr Peyrelevade hoped, would be eased by his own connections with Suez, which he chaired for three years until 1986, and with Mr Gerard Worms, its current chairman whom he had hired in 1984. But UAP's only bargaining tool was a minority holding in Victoire, which was of little value to Suez given that it already controlled the company. Moreover, as Mr Worms was well aware, the French financial community saw the Colonia affair as a test of his influence over Suez and of his independence from his old patron. Mr Peyrelevade was in an even trickier position. UAP is state-controlled and its chairman is chosen by the French government. He is a socialist appointee who could lose his job if the Right returns to power in next March's elections. He really needs to clinch Colonia before March. Only eight days ago he seemed to have succeeded. Suez was poised to approve UAP's offer of all its Victoire shares plus FFr1bn in return for a controlling 50 per cent stake in a new holding company which would own Victoire's majority stake in Colonia. But Suez held out. It wanted another FFr1.5bn. 'Suez is smart,' said Mr Michael Huttner, insurance analyst at Banque Nationale de Paris. 'It knows UAP is desperate and has seized its chance to raise the price.' Mr Peyrelevade needs to bring Mr Worms back to the negotiating table. Nordstern is his latest ploy. It provided roughly two-thirds of Colonia's profits last year, with net profits of FFr300m on sales of FFr9bn. UAP could try to use its minority holding to block Suez's strategy, notably its plan to merge the administration of Nordstern and Colonia. It remains to be seen how influential UAP will be. Winterthur failed in its legal attempt to scupper the merger. 'Maybe this will give UAP a little more leverage over Colonia, but Nordstern is a very small piece in the jigsaw,' said Mr Derek Elias, insurance analyst at Paribas. Most analysts suspect UAP will be forced to resort to another ploy - threatening to raise its 6.3 per cent stake (with 10 per cent voting rights) in Suez. Mr Peyrelevade has squashed speculation about an outright bid, but UAP said guardedly that it did 'not intend to substantially raise' its stake. Mr Peyrelevade must now be pondering his next move in the chess game. 'Anything could happen,' said one analyst. 'All we can be sure of is that he does not want to be remembered as the man who spent FFr14.3bn for nothing.'</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Quasi-major securities firms undergoing  restructuring have beefed up their management teams by  appointing personnel who formerly worked for their main banks  and the Ministry of Finance [MOF].    Kankaku Securities, which recorded huge losses from  transactions representing financial manipulations to conceal  unrealized losses, was extended financial aid totaling 70  billion yen in the form of a subordinate loan from Dai-Ichi  Kangyo Bank and requested a loan for roughly 40 billion yen from  three leading banks to establish a collateral deposit on a  domestic convertible bond. In the area of human resources, it  appointed Mr. Mitsuo Hamamoto as vice president, and a group of  four other officials of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank as officers of the  securities firm. One former employee of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank  will resign from Kankaku Securities as a managing director, but  that will still leave Kankaku Securities with President Yoichiro  Kato and four others, providing for strong bank influence over  the securities firm.    Yamatane Securities, which has been aided by managerial  support from Sakura Bank, will appoint as chairman Takashi  Yasuhara, an ex-MOF official and former vice president of the  Agricultural-Forestry Industry Loan Corporation. He will  collaborate with President Hidefumi Kubo, formerly of the MOF  and Sakura Bank, in an effort to restore profits during this  fiscal year after five years of deficits.    At Okasan Securities, Kozo Tsukakoshi, Bank of Japan Kobe  branch president, will become managing director; and Koichi  Saku, main bank Japan Industrial Bank Machida branch president,  will become a director. Although Okasan Securities is known for  its independent management team composed of members of the  founding family, President Seiichi Kato says, "I would like to  see the newcomers make use of their experience and personal  connections at the banks they come from and shore up weaknesses  in the management of Okasan." There are signs that he has a  desire to overcome difficulties by bringing in new blood from  other industries in the face of increasing competition expected  as a result of the establishment of banks' securities  subsidiaries.    Needless to say, appointment of officers from banks will not  lead to an easy improvement in operating results. A prevalent  comment is reflected in that of Cosmos Securities which says,  "We have received introductions from our main banks, but it is  difficult to translate such contacts into actual brokerage  business."    The respective securities firms are exerting efforts in the  area of cost reductions, such as in the case of Cosmos  Securities which in April reduced its mandatory retirement age  for managerial positions from 57 to 55. It seems that the  appropriate management philosophy is reflected in Yamatane  Securities President Kubo's remarks, "It is of foremost  importance that securities firms try to make a recovery based on  their own initiative."</p>

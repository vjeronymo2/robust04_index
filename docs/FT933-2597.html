			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (5): When the going gets tough . . . - Profile: J Henry Schroder Wagg IN 1983 J Henry Schroder Wagg, the UK investment bank, was taught a horrible lesson. One of its oldest and most valued clients, Thomas Tilling, faced a bid from BTR, the conglomerate. Not content with Schroders' advice, it turned to its rival, SG Warburg, with the parting explanation: 'When you are fighting for your life you need the best'. Mr Win Bischoff, who was appointed chief executive at Schroders in the same year, says Tilling's defection 'really hurt'. But he also believes it was responsible for a renaissance at the bank - by teaching it that it could no longer afford to be complacent. 'We were too relaxed, too reactive, and too remote,' he says. The more aggressive approach paid off: in the last 10 years the group's capitalisation has increased from Pounds 100m to more than Pounds 1.5bn. Mr Bischoff decided early on in the 1980s that the bank would not try to do everything. 'We like to think of ourselves as a relatively small flexible company.' Corporate finance operations are still at the heart of the group. At the time of Big Bang, most of Schroders' competitors chose the opposite route, which proved a mistake. An exception was SG Warburg. But it needed the capital to finance its new business in securities. Schroders conserved its capital, and its family control, by staying out. Since it became a publicly listed company in 1961, the bank has never raised capital. Because the bank makes a significant amount of money advising clients on how to tap shareholders for cash, Mr Bischoff is the last person to criticise other banks for going down that path. But he believes Schroders is stronger for having conserved its capital and share structure - the family of Mr Bruno Schroder owns almost half the bank, which effectively gives them control. Mr Bischoff says this has imposed important disciplines on the bank: 'We have to focus on less capital intensive businesses.' One of his earlier decisions as chief executive was to sell its American bank. It made no sense for a London-based merchant banking group to be in commercial banking in New York, and Schroders switched from commercial to investment banking there, by taking a 50 per cent stake in Wertheim Schroder. In the long term, Schroders is likely to take full control. Mr Bischoff says that joint ventures do not usually last forever. 'In management terms there are advantages to be able to integrate our businesses in the United States.' In the UK, Mr Bischoff is content with the present structure. Analysts estimate that Schroder Investment Management, whose managed funds total more than Pounds 35bn, could account for up to two-thirds of Schroders' stock market valuation. If floated off it could further increase the share price. But Mr Bischoff firmly resists such suggestions. 'We do not need the capital  -and furthermore, how could we better invest it?' Schroder Ventures now accounts for 10 per cent of the bank's profits. Schroders recently reported after-tax profits of Pounds 64m, 23 per cent more than the previous year, excluding an extraordinary item. Mr Bischoff adds a cautionary note. The larger venture capital businesses become, the more often they may have problems in looking for an exit via a flotation. 'It has not been an easy time for the capital venture business'. Having got this far, most banking analysts wonder whether Schroders can continue to grow. The view at SG Warburg is that Schroders lacks the distribution to become a serious threat outside the UK. As a rival puts it: 'A merchant banker is only as good as his last conversation with a broker.' Mr Bischoff happily concedes that Schroders' distribution does not come close to that of Warburg's. But then he is happy to rent its stockbrokers. 'Did you know we have more clients that use Warburg Securities than SG Warburg?' But, some banking analysts say, that is fine when things are going well. When corporate finance deals start to go wrong, as in the aborted flotation of GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, an investment bank needs a broker to tell it what is going on. In Schroders' defence, Mr Bischoff says it was only the UK adviser. Nomura International was the global manager which (he believes) did and does lack international distribution. Furthermore, he says all the advisers, including the brokers to the GPA failed flotation, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, misjudged the market. 'No other bank would have got different soundings from the market' says Mr Bischoff. Warburg, however, turned down the opportunity of advising GPA on a flotation, which Schroders could not resist. The GPA association did not appear to harm Schroders' reputation. Its continued association with the company, by helping with its restructuring, indicates how far it has come since it was abandoned by Thomas Tilling.</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Markets: When the Big Blue chip is down - Wall Street BLUE-CHIP (-chip) adj (after high-value blue chips of poker). 1. designating any high-priced stock with a good record of earnings and price stability 2. (Colloq) excellent, valuable etc' Webster's New World Dictionary INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, 'Big Blue' to its friends (a dwindling number these days), was once the king of the blue-chips. For much of the post-war era, it was a high-priced stock - Dollars 175 was the all-time peak, reached in 1987 - with a solid history of earnings and price stability. IBM, to its most ardent admirers at least, was a name that represented excellence and value. Not any more. So bad has IBM been to investors, so unlike a blue-chip in its performance, that (as The New York Times calculated this week) a Dollars 1,000 stake invested in IBM just before the bull market began in 1982, would now be worth (not counting dividends) a meagre Dollars 857. That is the worst performance among the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In comparison, a similar amount invested in Coca-Cola in 1982 would now be worth Dollars 13,392. This week IBM fell to a new 11-year low of Dollars 52, almost exactly half what the stock was worth in July, just before the latest troubles began. Those troubles - a shrinking share of the international computer market, slowing demand worldwide for IBM's goods (especially in Europe), and a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive market that is leaving IBM struggling to keep up in the technology products race - led to Tuesday's announcement of another radical restructuring plan. The plan will involve cutting a further 25,000 jobs from IBM's workforce (about 8 per cent of the total) and reducing manufacturing capacity sharply. Not only will the company have to take a Dollars 6bn fourth quarter charge to cover the costs of the restructuring, but the annual IBM dividend is now threatened, as is the company's famed policy of avoiding compulsory redundancies. Somewhat surprisingly, the stock market took the IBM news in its stride. Had it not been for IBM's 11 per cent plunge on Tuesday, the Dow would have shown a decent gain at the end of trading (instead of an eight-point loss). Ironically, IBM's problems may actually be helping the market, or at least certain other stocks and sectors. Most investors that have scrambled to take their money out of IBM appear to have put it back somewhere else in the market. Analysts say that individual investors have been switching from IBM into either growth-oriented small-capitalisation stocks, which are expected to do particularly well from the economic recovery, or into the big computer companies that are profiting most from IBM's travails. Microsoft, for example, is up almost 20 per cent this year, and Intel - which earlier this week told investors that its fourth quarter earnings would come in about 25 per cent higher than the Dollars 1.43bn reported in the third quarter - is up almost 75 per cent since the New Year. IBM, in contrast, has fallen 42 per cent so far this year. All in all, it was not a good week for blue-chips in general. On Wednesday Ford announced that it would cut its workforce in Europe by more than 10,000 by the end of next year in an attempt to reduce its production capacity to fit a shrinking European market. The job cuts will cost Ford a Dollars 419m charge in the fourth quarter. Two other important constituents of the Dow, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing and Goodyear, also fell into the market's disfavour. Shares in 3m dropped sharply on Thursday after the diversified manufacturing group said it was comfortable with the new, lower 1992 earnings forecast of Dollars 6.50 a share put out by several Wall Street analysts. Goodyear tumbled after broking house Merrill Lynch downgraded its rating on the stock from 'above average' to 'neutral'. That the market has held up so well in the face of bad performances from some of its bluest of blue-chips suggests that investors remain optimistic about the longer-term outlook for the economy and corporate earnings. The market even seemed to draw comfort from this week's economic 'summit' hosted in Little Rock, Arkansas, by President-elect Clinton. Although the political pundits were eager to label the meeting a publicity stunt, the exhaustive debate on the economic ills of the US, and what to do about them, seemed to strike a chord with the public.  --------------------------------- Monday      3,292.20 - 11.88 Tuesday     3,284.36 -  7.84 Wednesday   3,255.18 - 29.18 Thursday    3,269.23 + 14.05 Friday      3,313.27 + 44.04  ---------------------------------</p>

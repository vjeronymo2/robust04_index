			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Agricultural Sciences Dzhurakul </F> Sattarov, director, Institute of Soil Science and Agrochemistry,  corresponding member of the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences: "The  Tired Land: Scientists Sound the Alarm"]    [Text] These are difficult, anxious times we're living  through, as you know. A time of political disputes, internecine  warfare, economic discord, a time in which practically every  republic has shut itself off into its own compartment,  introduced its own currency, and is experiencing mountains of  unaddressed economic and social problems. When will we learn to  understand and be sensitive to one another? But the main  question troubling me as a scientist and a person in this  whirlpool of contradictions is this: What is going to happen to  our life-giving land?    To be honest, even when we were still living as "one family"  we didn't tend it very zealously. But now the situation has  worsened, and all science, and especially agrarian science, has  been given a very low priority. This can be said not only of the  republics of Central Asia but also of Russia and Ukraine.    Let me dwell on a particular comparison confirmed by data of  our institute covering many years. By scientifically improving  the land, eliminating many of the extremes of land reclamation,  and introducing more productive varieties we could increase the  productivity of cotton by 600,000-700,000 tonnes. That's how  much two oblasts produce today. But cotton isn't the only  concern, after all. Imagine this: As many as 22 million persons  already live in Uzbekistan, on a territory of a little more than  450 square kilometers, a sizable part of which is occupied by  deserts and semideserts.    The population is growing, its annual increment has averaged  half a million, and the fields that are supposed to give us  grain, vegetables, fruits, milk and meat are the same size as  before, while in many places their area has decreased  dramatically due to growth of cities. If we use these fields  more intensively, which means applying more mineral fertilizers,  herbicides and pesticides, we would be ruinously contaminating  and destroying the soil. There's something to think about here.    The main problems of the land today can be determined by  looking at it in three dimensions. The first--its fertility, the  ability to provide the greatest return per irrigated hectare.  The second--ecology, the ability not only to feed man but also  preserve the surrounding beauty, and civilization's natural  lungs--the forests and the rivers. Third--the social side,  uniform distribution of productive forces, reasonable  construction of cities and towns on the land, so that all  interests of the people would be accounted for. To be honest,  this is not a simple task. But it is something we need to do.    As far back as in the 1960s scientists of our institute  developed the concept of the fertility of irrigated soil, and  carried out major soil improvement operations in regions of  future development. These were mainly the Karshinskaya,  Dzhizakskaya and Sherabadksaya steppes, the Fergana Valley, and  the lower reaches of the Amu-Darya. It was then that a means was  found for growing high cotton yields in the conditions of a  desert zone: Scientists proposed creating an optimum soil  density by sowing plants on previously prepared ridges and  seedbeds, which increased the yield by 4-6 centners per hectare.    Much was done to study and regulate the hydrologic and  thermal cycles of different soils. And in recent years research  was started on thermophysical characteristics of soil.  More-sensible means of improving desert soil were found, and  plants promoting swift recultivation of land were tested.  However, soil erosion, to which over 700,000 hectares of land  fit for use are subjected in Uzbekistan, remains a serious  problem to farmers. Imagine how much food could be obtained from  this land in the presence of an acute shortage of plowland!  Taking on this problem, scientists developed and introduced  agrotechnical systems into production for controlling gully  erosion on irrigated land and the means of laying out and  cultivating gullied and unproductive land. But while developing  even a good recommendation is one thing, getting to the fields  is another. This is the task of the business executives, but  sometimes they are simply powerless in the acute contradictions  of a market economy. There are not enough resources, equipment  or materials. But even under these conditions I feel that we  need to do everything we can to improve the land. Because  without it, it would be impossible to raise agricultural  potential or solve ecological and social problems.    It would be worthwhile here to consider one other important  point. When we lived in the Union, summary soil maps of river  basins and certain large regions--the upper and lower reaches of  the Amu-Darya, the Zeravshan and the Syr-Darya--were prepared.  That is, the area of not only Uzbekistan but also Tajikistan,  Turkmenia and Kyrgyzstan was covered. With our division into  national compartments it has become very difficult, and  sometimes impossible, to concentrate energy on carrying out  common tasks and monitoring their fulfillment. All that remains  here is to wish that in pursuing important political and  economic objectives the leaders of neighboring states would  remember that they are living together on the same land, and  they need to take care of it together.    Talking about the present day, here's something else that  needs to be said. While in the 1920s-1930s land development  proceeded slowly because of the limited availability of  technical resources and the needs of those times, in recent  decades the scale of development increased by several times.  Intensive development and introduction of irrigated farming were  carried on, however, without regard for soil conditions in each  particular locale. As they say, we worked under the same  yardstick--getting as much from every hectare, whatever the  cost. Incompetent handling of the land led to degradation of the  soil, growth of the area of salinized land, exhaustion of the  total reserves of organic matter, worsening of the physical  properties of plowland, and its contamination by heavy metals,  pesticides and herbicides. As a result the productivity of the  land fell, and its ecology found itself at a critical point.    Today, dependable means of improving the land are being  sought. The "Soil" republic scientific-technical program has  been developed. Considering that the ecologically most serious  situation has evolved here in the lower reaches of the  Amu-Darya, we started implementation of this program with  Karakalpakstan. Here of course the problem has to do not only  with soil but also with water, and with social reconstruction,  brought on by the sharp drop in the level of the Aral Sea. That  has meant thousands of tons of extra salt chased by the winds,  and even change in climate. But we have selected a specific task  for ourselves. Specialists of different profiles working in the  institute have begun integrated study of the soil surface of  Karakalpakia and detailed mapping of its soil. After the  scientific work is finished, recommendations will be provided on  what specific crops would best be cultivated on different types  of land, with regard for its ecological and ameliorative  condition.    In the future such work is planned for all of Uzbekistan.  You  will have to agree this is an enormous amount of scientific  work, which will require many years. But people of the rural  areas can't wait--they need serious scientifically substantiated  farming procedures today, tomorrow. They have to feed and clothe  the people.    Many have become accustomed to thinking that nature  reproduces or restores itself. But that's not so. Today even  short-term action by man upon the environment is such that it is  comparable to the consequences of geological, geochemical and  other global processes spanning many millions of years. A  graphical example of this is the hundreds of ruined settlements  in Central Asia. Today they have become historical monuments,  museums beneath the open sky. You can be sure that not only the  hordes of Genghis Khan and other conquerors are to blame for the  disappearance of oases. Nature has not forgiven man his  mistakes, and his indifferent attitude. Springs feeding the  rivers have dried up, and the land has lost its former fertility.    When we ponder our history, we recall that there was a time  when the Sahara was a rich land, and Hannibal caught elephants  for his army in the forests of North Africa. According to  statistics each year around 50 million hectares of fertile land  in the world are transformed into desert. That's a fact that  catches your attention. While we grieve for the land that is  abandoning man, he is doing little to bring its goodness and  generosity back.</p>

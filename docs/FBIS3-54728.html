Soon the clock on the Kremlin's  Spasskaya Tower will chime midnight and we will see off 1993.  Whatever it was like it will remain in our memories, in our  history.    In this difficult year, civil war almost singed our homes  and  crossed the threshold of our Fatherland. I hope that the  politicians and citizens of our country will learn the lesson of  these bitter events.    There were also important acquisitions in the past year. The  new Russian Constitution, adopted at a nationwide referendum,  came into force. It gives a firm foundation for the  construction of a democratic state and free society. We held  honest and free elections, and I hope that the people who were  elected to the Federal Assembly will always listen to their  people and think about the good of Russia.    Now, in the midst of winter, we can say with confidence:  Russia has bread and staple foodstuffs, and our houses will be  warm.    In the Commonwealth of Independent States we have at last  virtually reached the understanding that we need to be together.  We are so indissolubly linked by history, economics and a  single destiny that it is simply not possible for us to live  apart. Our people will not allow this, anyway.    Dear friends! Now, in keeping with a long tradition, the  majority of you are at home with your family, with children,  with your nearest and dearest. Many are celebrating this holiday  with friends. I wish you happiness in the time you spend with  each other. May your friends be with you not only in times of  happiness but also at difficult moments. This is the custom in  Russia, and it is good that this tradition is alive.    Not everyone is celebrating the New Year at a festive table.  Let us remember them on this New Year's Eve. Let us remember  those who are guarding our peace, those who are guaranteeing the  country's normal life, and of course, thanks to those who keep  our television screens and radios on the air throughout the  night.    On this New Year's Eve I would like to address in particular  those Russians who are outside Russia's borders.    Dear compatriots! You are inseparable from us and we are  inseparable from you. We were and will be together. On the  basis of law and solidarity, we defend and will defend your and  our common interests. In the new year, 1994, we will do this  with greater energy and greater resoluteness.    I hope for you all, dear people of Russia, that the coming  year is, above all else, peaceful. Preserving peace in Russia  is my main task as president, but I know that it will be  incredibly hard to do so without your support. I am counting on  you in this most important endeavor.    I hope that the New Year brings your families more good  things and more peace of mind. We must be closer to one  another. Only together will we be able to conquer need; only  together will we be able to defend our peace of mind; only  together will we open up a future for our children. May the  coming year, 1994, be a year of coming together, a year of  harmony, a year of reason.    Dear fellow countrymen, I hope that in the coming year,  1994,  that your family will not want for anything. As the president,  I will spare no efforts to that end. May your secret dreams  come true and may the ideas that you have not yet managed to put  into effect be realized in the coming year.    May those who are young find their love, and may that love  be  a long and happy one. I hope for people of my generation that  their children and grandchildren will be good and loving. May  we rejoice in their successes. And may we meet our children as  often as possible.    Dear friends!    There are only a few seconds left before the New Year comes  in. Once again I wish you a Happy New Year. I wish you  happiness, good health and prosperity!</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> FULL-TIME GRAFFITI REMOVER CONSIDERED  </P> <P> Gang markers, names, racial epithets and pornographic phrases sprayed on walls,  overpasses and elsewhere have become a $5,000-a-month headache in Fullerton.  </P> <P> The cost has increased so much recently that the city would save money by  hiring a full-time worker to remove graffiti rather than continue contracting  with a company to do it, Community Services Director Ronald E. Hagan said.  </P> <P> "We (used to) have the contractor come out once every week or once every two  weeks," Hagan said. "Now we're having them come out two or three times a week,  at a minimum, and we're still getting a backlog."  </P> <P> Tonight the City Council will consider Hagan's request to hire a worker and to  buy a truck and other equipment for the graffiti-removal effort. That should  cost about $34,000 for the remaining six months of the city's fiscal year. The  projected annual cost is $52,000, or about $4,300 a month.  </P> <P> The city employee should be able to remove graffiti within two days after it is  reported, rather than the current seven to 10 days, Hagan said.  </P> <P> The city also plans to open a hot line for city residents to report graffiti  and to introduce an anti-graffiti program at local schools and community  centers, he said.

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Campground Closures -- O'Neill Regional Park in Trabuco Canyon will be closing  two of its three campgrounds at the end of this month in anticipation of the  slower winter season. That will leave 60 campsites available, ranger supervisor  Richard Dyer said, adding that structures in the closed areas will be treated  to some much-needed maintenance.  </P> <P> "Now is the time to come out (to the park)," Dyer said. "It's not hot anymore,  and it's not crowded."  </P> <P> For those looking for fall foliage, he added, the park's liquidambar and  sycamore trees offer an array of colors from yellow to gold to brown.  </P> <P> No campgrounds will be closed during the winter at the county's other two  regional camping parks, Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park east of San Juan  Capistrano and Featherly Park in Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> There are 52 individual and six group campsites available at Caspers  year-round, as well as 30 equestrian sites. Park technician Russell Greene  noted that the park is restricted to people over 18.  </P> <P> There are 120 campsites available at Featherly Park on a year-round basis.  </P> <P> Environmental Symposium -- Endangered habitats will be the theme of the  Southern California Botanists' 16th annual symposium at Cal State Fullerton on  Saturday. Topics will include the management of rare plants and rare plant  habitats in California state parks and the California Nature Conservancy's  Habitat Restoration Program. Registration begins at 8 a.m. at the Ruby  Gerontology Center on campus. Registration is $10 to $15. For more information,  contact Diana Cosandat at (714) 773-3548.  </P></p>

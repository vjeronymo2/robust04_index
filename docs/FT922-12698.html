			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television Thank goodness for Channel 4. At 7.50, after Channel 4 News (still pretty impressive), they screen the first in a series of five short programmes called Things That Don't Exist. The series ranges from law to finance but today's subject is common-law marriages. In Opinions (8.00) American economist DeAnne Julius, who has lived in Britain for the past six years, considers the global consequences of the collapse of the US military-industrial complex. That is followed by the last in the comedy series The Big One (8.30) in which American romantic writer Mike McShane has been rubbing along uneasily with English slob Sandi Givskot. . . oh all right, Toksvig. At 10.00, True Stories deals with Rytasha, daughter of a baroness, former international model, and now a guru in Bangladesh and dispenser of charity. BBC2's consistently impressive series Taking Liberties (8.00) investigates the high level of trust placed by courts in miracles of modern science and in expert evidence. In particular they look at the case of James Ryan who was gaoled after 'facial mapping' evidence, then released two years later when the evidence collapsed.</p>

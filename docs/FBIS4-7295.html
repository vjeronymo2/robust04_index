			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, director  of the Information Office of the Supreme Command Headquarters,  told reporters at office headquarters at Sanam Suapa, Bangkok,  yesterday that the situation near the Cambodian border is not  peaceful due to continued fighting inside Cambodia between  Cambodian Government military forces and Khmer Rouge forces.  The fighting near the Thai border district of Aranyaprathet,  Sakaeo Province, has resulted in a number of artillery shells  falling on Thai territory and caused damage to the lives and  property of Thai people living along the border. More than  30,000 Cambodians have fled across the border into Thai  territory. The senior Thai military official reported that the  Khmer Rouge have seized part of the area of Km 12 of the  Poipet-Sisophon Road, which is a major transport route. Their  actions are aimed at blocking the Cambodian Government's troop  reinforcements, who seek to wipe out Khmer Rouge forces and also  Phnum Malai which serves as a Khmer Rouge major stronghold.  This road is also an important route for the transport of  various kinds of goods from Thailand to Cambodia. With the  seizure by the Khmer Rouge, the route has been cut and this will  cause great difficulties for the Cambodian Government and  people. The Thai people living along the border in  Aranyaprathet District, Sakaeo Province are advised to be  cautious regarding possible dangers caused by the fighting  between the two Cambodian factions and always to follow closely  and listen to warnings from Thai military authorities.</p>

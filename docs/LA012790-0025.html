			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME SAY TOO MUCH, SOME SAY NOT ENOUGH  </P> <P> Why are you hyping the Super Bowl? I can understand the TV network that is  going to broadcast it having a motive, but not the L.A. Times.  </P> <P> It isn't being played in Los Angeles, nor even California. A California team is  involved, but I doubt that is an explanation. You ignore plenty of interesting  stories to turn over your front page to this non-event.  </P> <P> Please review your coverage of sports. More balance, please.  </P> <P> RONALD BENKERT, Marina Del Rey  </P></p>

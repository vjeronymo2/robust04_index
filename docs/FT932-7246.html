			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television BBC's crime and punishment season continues tonight with an absorbing Assignment (BBC2, 7.45pm), examining the Japanese way of crime - low rates, good prisons, but rather nasty prying police plus new ruthless types of gangsters on the way. Two excellent nature programmes worth making an effort to see - In Praise of Penguins (Channel 4, 4pm), splendidly narrated by Richard Briers, and Wildlife 100 (BBC1, 7pm), on ants in Panama and the Amazon jungle, with David Attenborough. Testimonies (Channel 4, 9pm) holds a mirror up to the Israeli army's behaviour in its combat against Palestinians involved in the six-year old Intifada. Some may feel its critique of Israeli army violence fails to address some basic political questions - like, it takes two to be peaceful. ITV has given up all pretence of scheduling intelligent programmes until bedtime. Disappearing World (ITV, 10.40pm), one of the last quality controlled ITV programmes, tonight features the 50 year old bloody civil war of the Karen tribesmen against Burma's military bullyboys.</p>

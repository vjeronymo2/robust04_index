			<p>BFN     [Text] With news of the 19th session of parliament's second  day of business, here is Ivana Anyzova from the parliament  building.    [Anyzova] The deputies of the Czech parliament today  approved  an agreement negotiated between the Czech Republic and the  Republic of Slovakia concerning free trade. As Trade and  Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy stated, this agreement will  gradually liberalize bilateral trade, and by the end of the  two-year transition period -- in other words by 1 January 1996  -- all tariff and nontariff barriers to trade in all industrial  products, with the exception of private cars and certain other  items, will be removed.    Parliament also approved the statute of the National  Property  Fund of the Czech Republic [FNM]. According to this statute, the  fund will have the right to set up joint-stock and trading  companies and to invest in them. Following that, however,  parliament did not approve the National Property Fund budget for  1994. Three votes were lacking for the budget to be approved.  The question thus presents itself whether parliament really has  so much against it or whether the required number of deputies  were not present at the final vote, in particular those from the  governing coalition. At present, the deputies are debating the  state's final accounts for last year.</p>

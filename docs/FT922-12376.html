			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / East European bloc set up Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland yesterday set up a regional economic bloc to present a common front to the European Community and the outside world, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. The Visegrad Three, the group of reformist east European countries which takes its name from the city in Hungary, established a Central European Co-operation Committee (CECC) as a forum for regular trade consultation. One of the CECC's first decisions was to press ahead with the formation of a free-trade zone covering the three countries in the second half of this year. The CECC also attacked the EC for failing to live up to last year's commitments to triangular aid - western purchases of goods in eastern Europe for delivery as aid to the former Soviet Union.</p>

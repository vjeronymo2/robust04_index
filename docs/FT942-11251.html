			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Bank of Scotland Mr Bruce Pattullo of the Bank of Scotland is one of the few bankers around who appears to believe that banks should actually lend money. Yet again he has shown that it is possible to increase profits by doing so. Customer advances were up 8 per cent last year; operating profits rose 19 per cent with net interest income up 14. Admittedly, the bank was helped by favourable conditions in the mortgage market where variable rate margins came close to 2 per cent and bad debt problems are relatively small. This year, the act could be harder to repeat. In general, loan demand remains subdued and, although increased activity in the housing market suggests a plentiful supply of mortgage business, there is more competition among lenders. Bank of Scotland still expects to lend more this year but it may become harder to maintain margins. Those on mortgage lending will certainly narrow if and when base rates rise again. At least the bank is less dependent than the English clearers on dealing profits. A further drop in provisions and non-performing loans should compensate to some extent for any margin squeeze. Still, the time seems to have come for Bank of Scotland to concentrate more on building return. It admitted as much yesterday with its reference to greater emphasis on productivity and cost control. Despite the impressive increase in profits, net return on average equity was still only 14 per cent. And the relatively modest dividend increase is a reminder that banks which rely on volume for growth have to keep up a flow of retained earnings.</p>

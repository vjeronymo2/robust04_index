			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hepworth shares fall 8% in spite of 30% rise to Pounds 58m Shares in Hepworth, the building materials and boiler group, fell 8 per cent, or 35p, yesterday to 418p in spite of its announcement of a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in 1993 from a restated Pounds 44.8m to Pounds 58.3m. The market was more concerned at the company's warnings about the slow pace of the UK construction recovery and worries that Hepworth's price increases were unlikely to stick in what remain very competitive markets. Turnover increased from Pounds 627.5m to Pounds 654.7m. The rise in earnings per share from 15.6p to 19.2p was in line with market forecasts. The final dividend was held at 9.35p keeping the year's total at 14.85p. Many of the group's markets remained flat with the decline in construction activity reaching bottom in the UK but still falling in many continental European markets. Nonetheless, margins improved in a number of areas as a result of previous cost-cutting, rising exports and product development. The group's range of products ranges from clay pipes to central heating boilers: this gives it a wider exposure to the construction industry than most building materials groups. Mr John Carter, managing director, said that European construction markets were likely to remain demanding in the short term but ultimately would benefit from lower interest rates. Gearing fell from 136 to 12 per cent following last year's conversion to equity of Pounds 100m of convertible bonds. Profits in the building products division rose from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 20.1m helped by exports of clay pipes to the busy German housing market. Profits in the home products division rose 10 per cent to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 10.6m) helped by an 8 per cent rise in the UK boiler market. Profits of Saunier Duval proved very resilient - they fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 25.2m - given the problems facing continental European construction markets. Hepworth Refractories' profits rose from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 6.5m, while profits from the minerals and chemicals division dipped to Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 8.5m). COMMENT Comments by Hepworth and John Laing that the UK construction revival may not be proceeding as fast as had been previously thought may increase concern ahead of next month's tax rises, which may yet undermine confidence in the housing market. That, and fears about the effect of public spending cuts on the UK road programme were enough to send Hepworth's shares falling. The company, like Laing in contracting, is a quality performer but its strengths are well known. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 75m in 1994 put the group on a prospective p/e of 20 - high enough given uncertainty about the pace of recovery.</p>

But Britain wants the 62 hectares of land along the airport  railway to be granted in one go, without going through the  annual Sino-British Land Commission talks.    In its latest financing package, which is still being  studied  by the Chinese side, Britain boosted the government injection to  $60 billion, cutting the debts to be borne by the future Airport  Corporation and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation to $23  billion.    But the Chinese side insists Britain abides by a stipulation  in the Memorandum of Understanding that any debts above $5  billion must be agreed to by China.    A source close to the British side said the Government was  willing to increase the cash injection into the airport projects  as they were a good investment.    But Britain would stand firm on the view that the Chinese  should approve granting the 62 hectares of land along the  airport railway in one go, on top of the 50 hectares of land  disposed of annually.    "We must be ensured that this land is available to us  without  further strings attached," said the source.    Regarding China's demand to set up a monitoring group to  control costs of the airport projects, the source said the  Government would not concede this point.    Instead, it would rather allow the Director of Audit to  audit  the financial accounts of the future airport body, he said.</p>

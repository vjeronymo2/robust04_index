			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Avoiding CGT on a house My husband and I live in Switzerland. In 1984, in order to give my mother an increased income, I agreed to buy her house for Pounds 22,000, its independent valuation. The house was conveyed to me, subject to an interest-free mortgage in my mother's favour of Pounds 22,000 (repayable at Pounds 150 a month) and a tenancy for life agreement. To date, I have paid my mother Pounds 18,000 and the approximate value of the house is now Pounds 55,000. My husband and I will be returning to live in the UK permanently next month. How should I deal with the house to avoid paying CGT when, eventually it is sold? We take it that the house in question is in England (or elsewhere in the UK), and that the mortgage deed and the tenancy for life agreement are subject to English (or Scots or Northern Irish ) law. That being so, the solicitor who acted for you in 1984 (or his successor) is best placed to advise you. One possibility is that the tenancy-for-life agreement is a settlement to which section 225 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 applies. This was probably considered at the time the documentation was prepared in 1984 (the 1992 Act being merely a consolidation of existing law). It seems clear that section 226 of the 1992 Act does not apply. One possible course of action, if need be, would be for you and your husband to move into the house for a short time, giving judiciously-timed notices under section 222(6)(a) of the 1992 Act beforehand and afterwards (with retrospective effect from judiciously-chosen dates). But professional guidance through the CGT and IHT minefield is essential. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

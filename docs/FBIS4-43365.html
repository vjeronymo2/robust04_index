			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- A day before his visit to Bonn,  Italian Government head Silvio Berlusconi has highlighted the  joint economic interests of both countries. Italy was one of  the first countries to be interested in a commitment to Eastern  Germany, Berlusconi said in an interview in the Bonn daily  GENERAL-ANZEIGER (Thursday's [16 June] edition).    His country is now one of the leading investors in the East  German states. Over 40 Italian companies have already  established themselves on the territory of the former GDR. This  represented "a major flow of investment," which has also led to  the creation of new jobs, the prime minister said.    Berlusconi defended the cooperation between his party and  the  neofascists of the National Alliance. This could not be  compared with the right-wing extremist French Front National or  the Republicans in Germany.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Management: Private pain of public sector - The role of non-executives in UK public services is increasingly important as concern grows over potential waste and corruption UK public services such as health, transport and education have adopted many of the methods of the private sector in the past 15 years. But has this exposed them to the sort of excesses that can arise from a more entrepreneurial approach? The government's aim has been to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the public sector by encouraging managerial autonomy and placing much greater emphasis on performance. The move away from the traditional administrative approach of delivery, however, has led to growing concerns over waste of taxpayers' money, corruption and fraud. It has also raised questions over the role of the thousands of outsiders appointed to the boards of quangos and other bodies that deliver public services. These 'non-executive directors' have been blamed for several of the failings of public bodies, which led to the warning in February from the powerful Commons Public Accounts Committee of a decline in management standards. This parliamentary watchdog catalogued an increase in 'serious failures in administrative and financial systems and controls' in government departments and other public bodies. These included: The loss of at least Pounds 20m on an abortive plan to computerise the Wessex regional health authority involving conflicts of interest between board members and computer contractors. Serious neglect of their duties by members of the West Midlands regional health authority that allowed managers to waste more than Pounds 10m on the authority's services organisation. Misuse of public funds at the Welsh Development Agency, including the provision of cars for board members without requiring them to pay for private motoring. 'If the level of problems continues at its present level, we are just not capable of handling it,' Michael Stern, a Conservative member of the PAC, told a recent seminar called to launch a discussion paper on corporate governance in the public services* published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa). The seminar brought together more than 50 top managers from the sector to discuss the responsibility and accountability of those in charge of high-profile public services. The starting point for the discussion was the report of the Cadbury Committee, set up in 1991 to examine the financial aspects of corporate governance in the private sector. Participants in the seminar were keen to see whether they could learn anything from the debate in the private sector over the code of practice recommended by the committee in its 1992 report. One immediate point of similarity between public and private sectors was highlighted by Sir Adrian Cadbury, the businessman who chaired the committee. He pointed out that behind most cases of fraud and mismanagement lies the unfettered role of a single individual. 'Checks and balances are needed to avoid these undesirable concentrations of power,' he said. The Cadbury committee had concluded that strengthening the role of non-executive directors and separating the roles of chairman and chief executive was the key to good corporate governance. It was the responsibility of the non-executives to provide independent judgment on issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct, on behalf of the shareholders. Noel Hepworth, director of Cipfa, warned that creating such checks and balances was more difficult in the public sector. These services are accountable to a variety of stakeholders, including the community at large, their customers and higher levels of government. Too often, it was assumed that political accountability was a substitute for good governance, he said. Yet the interests of politicians and the public services may not be the same, with the former subject to the short-term imperative of re-election. 'We have to look for alternative structures which harmonise with, but are not part of, the political process,' he said. The Cipfa paper suggests that non-executives in the public services should play a bigger role in reviewing the systems of internal control, financial or otherwise. They must ask questions about the balance of power and authority in the organisation, ensuring that no single individual wields unfettered power. They should ensure that their own roles are properly defined, and that there is a clear understanding of which decisions must be taken at board level. And they are responsible for ensuring adequate systems of internal control, monitored by effective internal and external auditors. Non-executives also need to promote greater openness in the public services they are responsible for, said Hepworth. He believes that exposing the public sector to competition has made it more secretive. 'The competitive threat has made managers less willing to disclose information and discuss problems with others,' he said. Yet openness is central to good corporate governance, as Sir Adrian reminded the seminar. 'It is essential if the public are to have confidence in the organisation,' he said. If non-executives are to fulfil all these tasks effectively, they need to understand the wider public interest issues involved in the delivery of public services, according to Hepworth. Public bodies must work within an ethos that stresses impartiality and equity as well as efficiency and effectiveness. The requirement of equity, for example, implies fairness in the distribution of scarce resources and equality in the treatment of customers. Training may be required to introduce those with no experience of public-sector management to the norms of behaviour expected of them. Hepworth's hope is that public services will draw up their own equivalents of the Cadbury code to promote good governance in ways that reflect the unique features of each service. The National Health Service has already published a draft code for consultation. A similar inquiry is under way among housing associations whose board members - all unpaid non-executives - now handle large amounts of public money and raise impressive sums on the capital markets. However, better governance in the public services may also require a greater commitment from non-executives. Sir Adrian warned the seminar that outside appointees may need to commit more time than many currently do if they are to provide the necessary monitoring. They should also be subject to tough assessment of their performance, he added. 'If someone is not pulling their weight on the board, the chairman should take action - passengers drag down the whole ship.' Those invited to join the boards of bodies delivering public services can expect much closer scrutiny of their performance in future, with increased expectations of their responsibility for ensuring good corporate governance. *Corporate Governance in the Public Services.

The  grenade was thrown across the fence of the candle-lit restaurant  -- power supply to the area was cut at noon. On-the-spot  evidence has shown that the grenade was Soviet-made. Six  persons were wounded in the attack which caused some material  damages. The wounded, who were admitted in a private clinic,  include four Frenchmen, one German, and one Beninese trader.

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SURVEY PLANNED ON POOL CLUB  </P> <P> A group working to restore the run-down Roessler Pool in Malaga Cove is  conducting a survey of Palos Verdes Estates residents to determine if there is  support for running the city-owned pool as a membership club.  </P> <P> The committee was appointed early last year by the City Council, which wanted  to make the historic pool financially self-sustaining. The proposed Palos  Verdes Beach and Athletic Club would be operated by a concessionaire through a  lease with the city. The pool was built in 1929.  </P> <P> An open house to promote the idea will be held Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon at  the pool.  </P> <P> The club would have two heated pools, a professionally staffed fitness center,  barbecue and volleyball facilities and improved beach access. Family  memberships -- including a $2,000 initiation fee and $50 monthly dues -- would  cover the estimated $1.5-million in restoration and equipment costs, as well as  operation costs, the group said.  </P></p>

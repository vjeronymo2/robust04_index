			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / ANC and Pretoria closer to power-sharing deal THE South African Government and the African National Congress appear to have moved substantially closer to agreement on how power will be shared between whites and blacks after apartheid, following five days of bilateral negotiations. The talks have raised hopes that an elected government of national unity could be installed next year. But a number of obstacles will first have to be overcome, including the need to agree on the decision-making process in the new government. Negotiators from the two sides, who met until Tuesday night, drew up proposals calling for a power-sharing 'government of national unity' to remain in place until roughly the end of the century, but calling on the government to drop its insistence that compulsory power-sharing should be written into a permanent constitution. Leaders from the two sides, including the South African cabinet and the ANC's policy-making national executive, must endorse the proposals before they can be agreed. They must then be placed before a multi-party negotiating forum, including parties such as the ANC's main rival, the Inkatha Freedom party, and representatives of black homelands and the white right. Government negotiators met Inkatha representatives yesterday, and agreed to meet again next month. But Mr Joe Slovo, one of the ANC's chief negotiators, made clear no smaller parties would be allowed to prevent a final agreement. 'It is clear we dearly want Inkatha to come into the process,' he said, 'but we cannot allow it to have a veto over whether the process goes forward or not'. If agreed, the government of national unity would be elected some time next year, would draw up a new constitution, and then would remain in office for a further four to five years under the new constitution. Disagreement remains likely over how this government would take decisions. The two sides negotiators have proposed that some decisions be taken by consensus - implying that the white-dominated National party would have an effective veto - but the two sides have yet to discuss which decisions would require consensus. The negotiators appear to have moved toward agreement on the structure of an elected constitution-making body - their proposals call for a one-chamber body, instead of the government's proposed bicameral assembly, but with special powers for members elected on a regional list. They have also moved closer to agreement on how the powers of regional and local governments would be determined. The government had previously insisted that such powers be agreed now, but it is now proposed that the decision be delayed until a constituent assembly is convened. The two sides also appear close to agreement on a procedure for replacing the board of governors of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, long a biased tool of the state, with more independent governors. The ANC and government are due to meet to finalise the proposals next month. Yesterday the government's chief negotiator met leaders of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party (IFP) to try to patch up relations after a row in which the two sides traded charges of racism and incompetence, Reuter reports from Cape Town. In talks between government negotiator Roelf Meyer and the Inkatha delegation led by party chairman Frank Mdlalose both sides appeared anxious to heal the rift that scuttled a two-day meeting last week.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Army General Raul Castro Ruz during the </F> inauguration of the Eastern Army's fish farming center in Las  Tunas Province; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Unidentified announcer] After  hearing a detailed report by Colonel Jose Ramon Jimenez, head of  the General Staff of the Defense Council in Las Tunas, on the  characteristics of the project, Army General Raul Castro,  minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, toured areas of the  new installation. He was accompanied by Commander of the  Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque and Division General Ramon  Espinosa Martin, head of the Eastern Army.    After completing his tour of the facilities, the second  secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  Cuba highlighted the significance of the development of fish  farming in our country and its contribution to the nutrition of  the people.    [Castro] On a water tank not far from here, there is a sign  that reads: Under our conditions of the special period, beans  are as valuable as cannon. This is a statement I once made and  later rectified by saying: At this moment, beans are more  valuable than cannon. Today, as many of you saw, I used a marker  to add to the sign: and fish farming, which is the most  inexpensive way of obtaining a magnificent source of protein for  our people and our Armed Forces. I hope the Eastern Army, as in  other activities, will be the vanguard in fish farming and in  fraternal emulation among Army units.    [Unidentified announcer] Gen. Raul Castro once again took  advantage of the opportunity to congratulate the Eastern Army on  the occasion of its 33d anniversary.    [Castro] Here in Las Tunas, in this very regiment, and with  the inauguration of this important fish farming center, on my  behalf and on behalf of my companions Commander of the  Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque, Ramon Espinosa, head of the  Eastern Army, and of the commander in chief, once again I  congratulate the Eastern Army.

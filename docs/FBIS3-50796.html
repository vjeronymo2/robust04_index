The Mexican Army's attack was launched from the region of  Maria Auxiliadora hill, approximately 8 km southeast of San  Cristobal de las Casas, where clashes between the Armed Forces  and rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) have  concentrated.    The new military operation in the zone, which began shortly  after 0700 local (1300 GMT), was confirmed by residents to  Mexican and foreign journalists who traveled to the area despite  the defense ministry's recommendations to the media yesterday --  to abstain from entering the combat zone, for security reasons.    Six Mexican journalists were almost killed yesterday when  machinegun fire from Mexican Air Force aircraft hit near the  station wagon in which they traveled toward Maria Auxiliadora  hill.    There is still no information if the Army's bombardments and  machinegun fire in the region have resulted in casualties.  However, San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz said he  had received information about the disappearance of various  Indians who live in the zone.    Clashes in the mountain zone south of San Cristobal de las  Casas began on Tuesday, when fighter airplanes launched the  first attack on Maria Auxiliadora hill to evict groups of rebels  that withdrew to the mountain after leaving various towns they  seized on Saturday.</p>

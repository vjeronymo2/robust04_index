			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTERS DEFEAT MOVE TO GIVE LATINOS BETTER CHANCE AT COLLEGE BOARD  </P> <P> Voters narrowly defeated a proposal to divide the Cerritos Community College  District into seven trustee areas to give Latinos a better chance of being  elected to the board.  </P> <P> More than half of the voters, or 6,691, were against Proposition B, while 5,349  voted for it. Four incumbents retained their seats on the Cerritos College  Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> Trustes will continue to be chosen at large from throughout the district, which  serves Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens, La Mirada,  Norwalk, Santa Fe Springs and parts of Lakewood, Long Beach and South Gate.  </P> <P> During a February meeting, the board voted 4 to 3 in favor of creating seven  trustee areas, which were expected to increase representation of ethnic  minorities, especially Latinos, on the board.  </P> <P> Mark Durant, 38, who was reelected for a second term, opposed the proposition.  He said that raising the ethnic issue was "wrong."  </P> <P> "It is wrong for one nationality to be favored over another group," he said.  "It was set up and addressed to a certain group. I think it's garbage.  </P> <P> "I was glad, very glad that the public saw it for what it was."  </P> <P> Most of those calling for redistricting have argued that Latinos, the largest  minority in the district, have been inadequately represented in the past and  that the new plan would increase the likelihood of a Latino trustee being  elected by largely Latino communities such as Hawaiian Gardens. The board has  one Latino member, Ruth Banda.  </P> <P> "Our opponents made it look like we were dividing along ethnic lines," said  Banda, "but we were just being sensitive to the community and trying not to  intentionally divide it.  </P> <P> "We were trying to give areas more local control over selection of trustees,  and redistricting was the best way to do it," she said.  </P> <P> She said she regrets that proponents didn't do a better job of providing more  detail and background on Proposition B.  </P> <P> Joseph Stits, 52, who was reelected, said the issue will resurface.  </P> <P> "I'm sure the issue will come back soon, maybe in four years. It is not a dead  issue at all," said Stits, who was appointed to the board in January.  </P> <P> Trustee John Moore, who was reelected to the board, was against the proposal,  because there was not enough information on the plan.  </P> <P> Because of the present makeup of the school board, Stits said he's not  convinced that redistricting would increase the number of minorities on the  board.  </P> <P> Several other community college districts have trustee areas, including Rio  Hondo, Pasadena and Compton.  </P> <P> In Tuesday's election, all four incumbents were victorious, including Ada  Steenhoek, 50.  </P></p>

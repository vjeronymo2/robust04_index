			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Fox units to be reorganised Fox, the US film and television subsidiary of News Corp is to be split into two separate divisions reporting directly to Mr Rupert Murdoch, News Corp's chairman and chief executive, under a reorganisation announced yesterday. The reshuffle will see the departure from the company of Ms Lucie Salhany, who chairs of Fox Broadcasting and was the first woman to head a US broadcast network. She took the position 18 months ago. News Corp said Ms Lucie Salhany had resigned because she felt the reorganisation was an appropriate time for her to pursue other interests. But she had been under pressure because of weak programme ratings, and recently suffered the embarrassing cancellation of The Chevy Chase Show, a short-lived late-night chat show that she had backed. Under the previous structure, Fox had four principal subsidiaries: Twentieth Century Fox, Twentieth Television, Fox Television Stations and Fox Broadcasting. After the reorganisation, Twentieth Century Fox and Twentieth Television will be in one division, while Fox Television Stations and Fox Broadcasting will be in the other. Twentieth Century Fox makes films and Twentieth Television makes television programmes, so their combination in a single division will bring together Fox's production activities. The division comprising Fox Television Stations and Fox Broadcasting, to be called Fox Television, will bring together the television programming activities . News Corp said Fox had been growing aggressively over the past few years and the time had come to review the company's structure. Mr Peter Chernin, chairman of Twentieth Century Fox, will continue in his present role and add responsibility for Twentieth Television. The Fox Television division will be headed by Mr Chase Carey.</p>

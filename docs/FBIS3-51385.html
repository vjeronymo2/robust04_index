Policemen shot a woman and made numerous  arrests. There was almost total absenteeism at places of  employment due to a sudden work stoppage decreed by the  Transportation Union in Anzoategui State.    Neighborhood groups and student organizations of Eastern  University (UDO), Puerto La Cruz branch, demanded that the  Transportation Union and local municipalities reach an agreement  on fares because an increase decreed in both cities exceeded the  30-percent mark, thus affecting the entire labor sector.    The increase was approved by Barcelona Municipality in  December but was revoked until three days ago in response to  neighborhood committee protests.    The neighborhood organizations' action resulted in the  closure of principal roads, particularly an alternate road, all  of which were obstructed by burning tires. The Metropolitan  Police (PM) cleared the roads after 0900, while criminals who  had infiltrated the demonstration tried to set fire to the  Araguay gas station near the Santo Domingo housing area.    Public transportation was suspended and thousands of workers  were left stranded.    The PM reported the arrest of eight persons, including  students and neighborhood residents, who were traveling in a  black pickup, license plates 383-BAR, loaded with used tires  that the individuals intended to burn on various roads leading  to public transportation routes.    Bolivar and Sotillo Municipalities (Barcelona and Puerto La  Cruz) decided to repeal the fare increase unilaterally approved  by the Transportation Union in December.    One woman was shot during the protests, and demonstrators  set  fire to a bus and a fuel truck while dozens of people were  arrested amid veritable traffic chaos.    The alternate route was most heavily affected by the  protest,  which included the participation of residents from more than 50  heavily populated neighborhoods along the route. Local  residents began setting up barricades and burning tires to  obstruct traffic in the early morning hours. Mrs. Rosa Blanco,  46 years old, was shot in Santo Domingo neighborhood when the PM  arrived and indiscriminately began to set off a large number of  tear gas bombs. Apparently a PM agent fired his regulation  weapon and the bullet wounded the woman in the back. She was  transferred to Las Garzas hospital where she underwent surgery.    On the intercommunity highway, a group of demonstrators that  included UDO students burned a tourism bus valued at several  million bolivares that belonged to the Responsible Venezuela  line. The demonstrators also torched a fuel truck owned by the  SAET [expansion unknown] transportation company, license plate  754-AAR, as it was being driven in an area close to the UDO.    To the south, residents of La Ponderosa and El Vinedo  obstructed the highway to the coast and blocked traffic en route  to the capital. By noon dozens of trucks and hundreds of  privately owned vehicles were waiting for the highway to be  opened. Cruz Bastardo and Arquimedes Barrios, leaders of the  Neighborhood Federation, said the protests will continue until  the Transportation Union discusses a more equitable fare system.    The National Guard intervened at about 1100 after the bus  was  burned, and fierce clashes occurred between the military and the  demonstrators, who had sought shelter at the UDO.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Solton commentary on 10 April Bosnian air strike] </F>   [Text] U.S. F-16 fighter planes under NATO's command  attacked Serb positions in the suburbs of the Bosnian city of  Gorazde on Sunday. Yuriy Solton comments on the situation  there, and this is what he writes:    Heavy fighting has lasted for about two weeks around  Gorazde,  declared by the United Nations as one of the securiy areas in  Bosnia. The lives of 60,000 civilians and United Nations  personnel there are in danger. At the request of the United  Nations Protection Force commander General Rose, who referred to  previous United Nations Security Council resolutions, NATO  aircraft have bombed Serb positions for the first time in two  years. United Nations Secretary General Butrus-Ghali was  notifed of the measure.    A bombing of the Bosnian Serb positions has seriously  worsened the situation in Bosnia. President Boris Yeltsin has  voiced serious concern. At six o'clock on Monday morning Moscow  time he discussed the situation with President Bill Clinton.  And this is what President Yeltsin said before leaving for  Spain:    There are several fundamental principles one must always  bear  in mind. Firstly, all measures must be taken in strict  compliance to the United Nations resolutions. We are for  discussing that question in the United Nations Security Council.  I told Mr. Clinton more than once that such measures can't be  taken without prior consultation between United States and  Russia. And we insist on this.    On the eve of the attack the warring Serb and Muslim  factions  in the area of Gorazde signed a 24-hour cease-fire agreement.  The Serb community leader, Radavan Karadzic, has suggested  making the agreement universal, spreading it to the whole  Serb-Muslim frontline in Bosnia. The Muslims dismissed the  proposal. And this was followed by NATO's air raid.    The developments in Bosnia are at a crossroads. At this very  moment it's being decided whether the Bosnian Republic will  choose the road of peace or the road of war. That hasty  military action without prior discussions in the United Nations  Security Council is pushing the country into a war. The leaders  of the Serb community have described the air strike as  aggression. All contacts with the United Nations Protection  Force have been broken. The peace talks between the warring  factions have been suspended. In the meantime NATO's  headquarters has warned there may be more air strikes.    Armed intervention from outside will fail to bring either  party to the negotiating table. And it's only negotiations that  can produce a political solution.    The special Russian presidential envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, is  holding negotiations in former Yugoslavia. His meetings with  political leaders there are expected to clear up the situation  and find a peaceful way out, as it was the case with the lifting  of the siege of Sarajevo and opening Tuzla airport to United  Nations forces.</p>

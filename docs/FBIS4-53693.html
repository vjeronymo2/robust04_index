			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  renewed a pledge Monday [23 May] to seek the passage of the  overdue fiscal 1994 state budget by the end of the current Diet  session as discussions on the budget finally started.    Hata told the House of Representatives budget committee, "I  really hope the budget passes in the current Diet session by any  means. I will make most sincere efforts for that." The Diet  session is scheduled to end June 29.    He apologized for the delay in the budget debate due mainly  to the political turmoil over former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's shady personal finances, which forced his resignation  last month.    "I feel great responsibility. I regret the delay," Hata  said. Nearly 80 days have passed since the government submitted  the budget to the Diet for deliberations.    He was responding to questions by an opposition Liberal  Democratic Party legislator Takashi Fukaya.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai denied he is seeking  an extension of the term of the current Diet session to ensure  the passage of the budget.    Hata declined to talk about an extension of the Diet  session,  saying it is a matter that should be decided by the Diet.    Kumagai also promised a formal report on the recent "sexist"  remarks by Ichiro Ozawa, top policy strategist in the ruling  coalition.    Kumagai said he will directly ask Ozawa what he really meant  by the remarks and will brief the committee session.    He was referring to Ozawa's remarks last month which  defended  the move among some coalition partners to create a new Diet bloc  without the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which led to  defection by the angry SDP, the largest coalition component.    Comparing the convergence of various political parties to an  extramarital affair, Ozawa reportedly told reporters, "it  doesn't matter which women you may sleep with."    Kumagai said the remarks are "not appropriate if they were  really made."    LDP's Fukaya also questioned Hata over what he calls a  "vague" concept in the government's defense policy.    He blasted the coalition's policy platform, which says  Japan's constitution adopts "universal security," saying such a  concept does not exist in international law or the UN Charter.    Hata said universal security is a wide concept that roughly  corresponds to the constitution's idea about the nation's  security.    It is a bit wider concept than the collective security as  defined in the UN Charter, but not quite far from it, he added.    Concerning the possibility of Japan's military involvements  in international crises, Hata reiterated that the government  will handle the situation within the framework of the  constitution.    Fukaya, unsatisfied with the answers, sought a unified view  by the government over the security issue.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Lending higher than expected CONSUMER borrowing was higher than expected in April, and pointed towards a gently recovering economy. The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that net lending to consumers was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 194m in April. This follows a revised Pounds 196m for March. The figure points towards steady consumer confidence. The seasonally adjusted figures - which do not include mortgages and account for about 15 per cent of total private-sector debt - also show that new credit advanced to consumers in April totalled Pounds 4.42bn, down from Pounds 4.74bn in March. In the three months to April, new credit advanced rose to Pounds 13.57bn from Pounds 12.63bn in the previous three months. According to the CSO, the demand for credit was spread across a broad range of credit options. A small rise in net lending by finance houses was offset by lower net lending on bank credit cards. Consumers borrowed a net Pounds 65m on bank credit cards compared with Pounds 84m in March. Net lending by finance houses rose to Pounds 129m, compared with Pounds 117m in March. Building society loans excluding mortgages were flat. Consumers have borrowed more than they repaid in every month since August, when they repaid a net Pounds 25m of debt. Since then, consumer credit has shown modest strength. In the latest three months, net lending to consumers rose to Pounds 444m, the highest quarterly figure for two years. It compares with net lending of Pounds 304m in the previous three-month period.</p>

[passage omitted]    Have the Kazakhstani leaders adjusted their stance on the  eve  of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Almaty?  "No, they have not," said state counselor Tulegen Zhukeyev, who  in fact shapes Kazakhstan's foreign policy. "Our policy remains  unchanged. If the Russian side wants to discuss the subject, we  will continue the dialogue. But I do not think it will reveal  anything completely new."    As for "minor" details concerning the issue, Kazakhstani  Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko unexpectedly spoke up on the  matter during his trip around the republic's eastern oblasts.  In his words, a treaty with Moscow is being drawn up whereby  every Kazakhstani citizen, if he or she so wishes, will have the  possibility of obtaining Russian citizenship in Moscow under a  special procedure that will be simplified as much as possible.    This information was confirmed for your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent at the information-analytical center of the  Kazakhstani president's staff. "I do not think that the  question of citizenship is a cornerstone in Russian-Kazakhstani  relations," Marat Tazhin, the center chief, believes. "To all  appearances, a solution will be found in the form of a  `postponed' or `dozing' [`dremlyushchiy'] citizenship; at least  our president has repeatedly said that he wants the problem  resolved in this particular fashion."    According to Marat Tazhin, the procedure for obtaining  Russian citizenship may boil down to a simple registration for  ethnic Russians, and for other persons wishing to move to Russia  the acquisition of citizenship would last no longer than three  months. "But all this, of course, will be settled at the  upcoming talks and in the course of concluding treaties," the  chief of the presidential staff's information-analytical center  said. [passage omitted]    "References to Turkmenistan or Kyrgyzstan in this case are  inappropriate," thinks Sabit Zhusupov, a sociologist and the  center's leading analyst. "We have an entirely different  situation in Kazakhstan. If we agree that dual citizenship is  really needed, around 60 percent of the state's population will  turn out to be foreign citizens." Sabit Zhusupov also believes  that the problem can be resolved completely by concluding  bilateral agreements that would specify the rights of the two  countries' citizens and simplify a procedure for changing  citizenship. "But for the most part these matters are of  interest for politicians," Sabit Zhusupov claims, "and also the  intelligentsia. But not for other categories of citizens."    An entirely clear view has taken shape in Kazakhstan's high  echelons of power: It is Russian politicians who are trying to  add a political tinge to the citizenship question with an  evident purpose of expanding Russia's sphere of influence into  Central Asia and making Russophones a sort of "force field" to  influence local governments.

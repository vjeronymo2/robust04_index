			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NOON DOES HIS BEST ONE BETTER  </P> <P> Brent Noon surpassed his state best shotput with a throw of 73-feet-5 3/4 in a  dual meet with San Dieguito on Thursday.  </P> <P> Just two weeks ago Noon eclipsed the 70-foot mark and set the state best at  73-3.  </P> <P> Both marks are not considered records because they came in meets other than the  State Finals.  </P> <P> Noon credited improved technique for his lengthy tosses.  </P> <P> "That last throw could have been the 77-footer (the National Federation High  School record set by Michael Carter in 1979)," Noon said.  </P> <P> It wasn't, Noon said, because he still needs a little work at the end of his  spin.  </P> <P> But Jim Noon, Brent's father and coach, said Brent's technique on the final  throw was near perfect.  </P> <P> "That 73-5 3/4 could have been a new National Federation record," he said.  "Today for first time I saw him throw it good technically and you saw what  happened on the last throw."  </P> <P> But . . .  </P> <P> "Brent still hasn't really hit the ball yet," Jim Noon continued. "It's very  difficult to get (momentum) to go linearly (from the spin). The left arm keeps  going to the left and the ball (in the other hand) is going away from the body  to the right. You don't have a nice linear punch. It's like getting hit with a  side-arm slap instead of a punch and if you're on the end of the punch, you'll  know the difference."  </P> <P> Brent Noon feels he is about to pop that 77-footer. He has been edging upward  by a couple inches each meet.  </P> <P> "I'm getting consistent at this mark (between 73 and 74 feet)," he said. "And  that's usually when you'll hit a big one. I know it's there."  </P> <P> Noon next throws at the Arcadia Invitational on Saturday. JOHN GEIS  </P></p>

After all of 12 years' development, the  four-engined An-70 transport plane has had its rollout, the  ceremony, similar to the launch of a ship, that marks the  beginning of the trial phase.    Neither the An-70's 500-km range nor its 35-tonne freight  capacity is its most striking feature. What is sensational is  its ability to take off, fully loaded, from an unsurfaced runway  only 600 m long.    The An-70 is the latest in a long series of Antonov  transport  planes that includes the An-12 (NATO code: Cub), which for 30  years constituted the East Bloc armed forces' flying workhorse.  In the seventies, the Soviet Air Force used to boast that its  An-12 aircraft alone were sufficient to displace two entire  armed divisions -- 14,000 men plus arms and equipment -- in one  go over a distance of 1,200 km.    The An-72 "Coaler," which put in a surprise appearance at  the  1979 Paris air show, aroused particular interest. It was a  curious-looking transport plane for short takeoff and landing  runways with two jet engines mounted at the front of the wings.  This unconventional configuration was designed to direct the  exhaust plume over the upper surface of the wings, a technique  that makes for a considerable increase in lift; the specialists  refer to it as the "Coanda effect."    The new An-70 exploits the Coanda effect in a modified form.  It is not a jet, but a turboprop. Four Progress turbines built  at the Saporoshje Works are each driven by two counterrotating  propellers with extremely broad, saber-shaped, curved blades.  According to the engineering office, their airflow gives rise  to a supercirculation phenomenon on the wings that doubles lift  during takeoff and landing, shortening runway requirements  accordingly.    The eight strange, 4.5-m diameter propellers, which look  more  like large marine screw propellers, give the airborne aircraft a  speed only marginally lower than that of a fast jet transporter.  The designers thus calculate that, at an altitude of 8,500 m,  the An-70 will be capable of flying 30-percent faster than the  American Hercules or the Bundeswehr's Transall, although it will  be half as slow again in the critical takeoff and landing phases.    The An-70's hold measures 4 x 4 x 16 m, three times the  capacity of the An-12 or Transall fuselage. The gigantic hold  can accommodate practically any military vehicle or weapon  system.    The An-70's system of digital on-board electronics meets  western standards and is more advanced than that of the  much-extolled MiG-29 supersonic fighter aircraft.    The Russian Air Force is very interested in the An-70, and  the aircraft may well take on great importance as a freight  plane in view of the shortcomings of the railway system in the  CIS states.    The An-70, which western experts describe as technically  brilliant, is scheduled to take off for its first test flight in  April. What happens after that depends primarily on how  relations between the Ukraine and Russia develop.</p>

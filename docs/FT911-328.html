			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Economics Notebook: Election fever haunts UK policies THESE are difficult days for knowing what is happening in the British economy. But it is as good a time as any for evaluating the policy priorities of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The UK's usual statistical fog is being compounded by political noise as both leading parties appear determined to stay on election alert. So far, the most obvious symptom of this double malaise has been Mr Lamont's tendency to accentuate the positive side of UK economic developments in his recent public statements. But with pressure rising among Tory backbenchers and in financial markets for another cut in British bank base rates from their current 12 per cent level, there is a risk that the noise will direct economic policy and drive a wedge between the Bank of England and the Treasury. Signs of incipient tension emerged last week. In a lecture at Exeter University, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, underlined that the big fall in the retail prices index for April, which is expected to be published on Friday, should not be interpreted as a sign that underlying inflation is falling as sharply. Using veiled 'central bank speak', Mr Leigh Pemberton voiced his own and the Bank's belief that there should be a pause before base rates fall further, following their 2 percentage point drop from 14 per cent in the two months between mid-February and mid-April. Last Friday, the Bank hammered home this message in its money market operations by lending Pounds 965m at the base rate level of 12 per cent for 14 days. Throughout last week, however, financial markets chose to believe that interest rates would fall soon. The domestic money market betted heavily that Friday's big RPI drop would be the occasion for another 0.5 percentage point base rate cut. It was encouraged by the expectation that the annual rate of RPI inflation in April will have fallen to about 6 per cent from 8.2 per cent in March as the impact of last year's poll tax bills drops out of the index. The Nationwide Anglia Building Society last week pre-empted such a move by cutting its mortgage rates by 0.7 per cent. Until recently, the Treasury and Bank appeared equally concerned about underlying inflation. It is probably still the case that Treasury officials would like some delay in the downward movement of interest rates to evaluate the economic effects of the cuts already made. But it is also possible to detect some difference in tone over monetary policy between the Bank and Treasury. The Treasury's reaction to last week's developments was muted. While the Bank was sticking its neck out against an interest rate cut, officials in Whitehall said the Treasury was 'agnostic' over whether conditions would soon be right for a base rate move. All of which brings us back to Mr Lamont. He earned a reputation as an iron chancellor in his early months in Number 11 Downing Street, as he carried out the tough counter-inflationary policy that his predecessor, Mr John Major, summed up with the words: 'If it isn't hurting, it isn't working.' But Mr Lamont sang a different tune when in Washington last month for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Then the talk was of recovery 'round the corner' as he forecast that Britain would reduce its inflation rate to near-European levels 'within a very short period of time'. The chancellor's comments about economic recovery came at a time when Britain's economic statistics are more than usually confusing. His confidence was based almost entirely on the latest quarterly survey of industrial trends from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). In particular, he picked on the CBI's report of a partial recovery in business optimism as a sign that forward-looking economic indicators were pointing his way. Since then, other surveys by the Institute of Directors and 3i, the investment capital group, have indicated a revival of confidence among businessmen. In addition, the Central Statistical Office's (CSO) longer-leading cyclical indicator has turned sharply upwards since the beginning of the year. It may be indicating a revival in the economy over the next six months. But the good news in all these indicators - including the CSO leading indicator - is limited to measures of expectations and confidence. Last week's newspaper headlines telling of job losses in companies such as Rolls-Royce suggested that the economy is still in recession. This week's indicators of economic activity, covering unemployment and industrial production in April and March respectively, are unlikely to lift the gloom. The City scents that Mr Lamont, in seeing recovery through the statistical fog, has chosen to put as positive a gloss as possible on economic developments for political reasons. His statement that recovery was round the corner came just days before the May 2 local government elections. If anything, the political pressure on the chancellor to enhance the 'feel good' factor in the economy has increased since then. Quite apart from excitement over a possible general election, this Thursday sees another by-election test for the government in Monmouth - which has been a safe Conservative seat. For these reasons, some City analysts have suggested that the base rate cut could come as early as Wednesday, when the Treasury should have its first insight into the April RPI and conveniently ahead of the Monmouth vote. Such a move is far from certain. It would be odd in view the Bank's firm action on the money markets last week, but not unprecedented. It would also have to be judged against the economic data that has still to be released this week. But with election fever running strongly, the chancellor may find it difficult to square his political instincts with his job as custodian of the nation's economic welfare. Over the next few weeks, the electorate, financial markets and international investors should be better able to judge whether Mr Lamont's first priority is defeating inflation - as he has always professed - or whether he is more anxious to secure victory for his party at the polls.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / People: Imro after Maxwell Charles Nunneley has accepted a permanent appointment as chairman of Imro, the investment managers' regulator, after working as acting chairman since George Nissen's resignation in June. Nunneley now has the delicate task of steering Imro through the remaining after-effects of the Maxwell scandal, which led to Nissen's resignation. He should certainly command sufficient respect within the industry to do so. An old Etonian, Nunneley is deputy chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings, where he has worked for 30 years. He is also deputy chairman of the Clerical Medical &amp; General life assurance society, as well as being a director of Monks Investment Trust and Macmillan. He is a former chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers' Association. He is clear about the job ahead of him: 'The chairman's immediate tasks are to continue the process of restoring Imro's reputation and organisation post-Maxwell, which I sincerely hope is in the process of completion now, and of steering it through the investigation into the whole system of regulation which Andrew Large and others are conducting.' He added: 'Maxwell exposed in a cruel way the sort of weaknesses you might expect in any system which was developing. I think, before Maxwell, Imro was in many ways a very effective regulator. The process of examining our navel has been extremely useful and it's allowed us to do in six months what might otherwise have taken 18.'</p>

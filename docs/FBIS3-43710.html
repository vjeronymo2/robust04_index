			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 12 SAPA -- Residents of East Rand  townships were overwhelmingly opposed to the presence of police  Internal Stability Units [ISU] and wanted them withdrawn,  African National Congress [ANC] spokesman Carl Niehaus said on  Wednesday.    Replying to a question on the SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] news programme AGENDA as to why the  ANC refused police presence in the townships and at the same  time demanded it, Mr Niehaus denied the ANC had refused to let  the police perform their duties.    He said what the ANC wanted was "proper policing", not  policing by people who were involving themselves in the violence  and were unpopular in the townships. "We have heard time and  again from residents that they don't want the ISUs in the  townships. Ask anyone and they will give you an unequivocal  `no' to the presence of these units."    Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] National Organiser Maxwell  Nemadzivhanane said the police worked for an illegitimate regime  and township residents therefore considered the Transitional  Executive Council and the ISUs to be illegitimate.    He added the police were finding it difficult to maintain  law  and order in the townships "simply because they are not  acceptable there". "As long as we don't have a government  that's acceptable, they (the police) are illegitimate," he said.    Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] member Hennie Bekker said the  IFP  was against withdrawing the ISUs and said a "small war" was  going on in Natal. It was "all right to criticise", but the  units were necessary to prevent further slaughter.    Asked whether there had been specific complaints about the  ISUs, Law and Order Deputy Minister Gert Myburgh said the  Goldstone Commission had reported that attacks on uniformed  police were so widespread that the ISUs "had to stay". He said  the police had investigated many cases, including a number  against policemen, and did not spare colleagues found guilty of  offences.    Asked about reports that Tanzania had banned violent actions  by the PAC against South Africa, Mr Nemadzivhanane said Tanzania  nevertheless remained a strong supporter and was "only asking us  not to make claims".    On allegations of violence and lawlessness committed by self  defence units, Mr Niehaus said the reasons were complex. The  ANC was presently restructuring the units and it was hoped they  would return to their original objectives.</p>

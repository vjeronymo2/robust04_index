			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / France sees output fall FRENCH manufacturing output fell 1.7 per cent during October, the month after the currency crisis which strengthened the franc against key European currencies. The news of the decline comes at a critical time as the government, which faces legislative elections next March, is trying to protect the franc against pressure from the foreign exchange markets. The fall in manufacturing output was partly offset by a modest increase in overall industrial production of 0.8 per cent in October compared with September, according to Insee, the state statistics institute. This was due to high demand for energy as fuel consumption rose in the cold weather.</p>

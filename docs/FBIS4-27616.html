			<p>BFN     [Text] Indonesia appreciates the Philippine Government's  handling of the Manila conference on East Timor. The conference  is taking place after the Philippine Supreme Court overruled a  lower court's ban on the conference. Only Filipinos are  attending the conference, however, after the Philippine  Government exerted various effective efforts to bar foreigners  from attending the conference.    According to a press release from the Directorate for  Foreign  Information of the Department of Foreign Affairs received by RRI  [Radio Republik Indonesia] this evening, the Philippine  Government has also given assurances that the conference is not  being used as a platform to launch a campaign of lies or an  international disinformation campaign against Indonesia. In  this connection, Indonesia respects the sovereignty of other  countries and the right of their citizens to hold debates.</p>

The three men who filed candidacy papers were incumbent  mayor  Hidenobu Takahide, 64, and challengers Toshihiko Izu, 67, and  Takashi Nomura, 40.    All three are independents.    Takahide, who is seeking a second four-year term of office,  has gained the backing of the Liberal Democratic Party, the  Social Democratic Party, Komeito, Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party) and the Democratic Socialist Party.    Izu, a professor emeritus at Yokohama City University, is  backed by the Japanese Communist Party, while Nomura, a former  Home Affairs Ministry bureaucrat, has garnered support from new  party Sakigake and the United Social Democratic Party.    Yokohama, the largest international port city in Japan, has  a  population of 3.3 million, ranking second after Tokyo which has  a population of more than eight million.    The challengers have accused Takahide of having received a  huge amount of election campaign funds from general contractors.  Takahide denies the allegation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, April 24 (AFP) -- The Tibetan settlement  of Dharamsala in northern India was calm Sunday [24 April], but  tension remained after the death of an Indian in a street fight  triggered a burst of rioting, reports said here.    The Dalai Lama's government-in-exile issued an appeal to the  residents of the hill town to maintain "peace and calm during  this period of tension," a spokesman for the Tibetan spiritual  leader's office in New Delhi said Sunday.    Tibetan refugees were urged not to retaliate against "acts  of  violence from anyone" and the Indians in Dharamsala were asked  to help restore the traditional goodwill between the two  communities.    Tibetan property, including some exile government offices, a  hospital and library, were damaged and about a dozen people  injured when angry Indian residents armed with bricks and sticks  went on the rampage Friday.    The attacks were sparked by the death of a 20-year-old  Indian  youth in a knife fight Thursday night with a Tibetan refugee,  who also was injured and hospitalised.    Police reinforcements have reached Dharamsala, where the  authorities imposed a ban on public protests in response to a  Tibetan request for additional security, the spokesman for the  Dalai Lama's office said.    "Our information is that it is now calm and quiet, but there  is some tension still," the spokesman said, adding that Indian  leaders in the region had expressed their regret over the  rioting.    He said the incident which sparked the riots was an  altercation between two individuals and "no one should take  steps which will result in communal tension."    Dharamsala has been home to the Dalai Lama and the seat of  his government-in-exile since he fled Tibet in 1959 following an  abortive anti-Chinese uprising. India is home to about 100,000  Tibetan exiles.    The Tibetan spiritual leader is now on a visit to the United  States and expected to return May 1.    His government-in-exile used Sunday's statement to express  Tibetan gratitude to India for "coming to our help at this  critical period in our history."    "Tibet and India have had close spiritual and cultural ties  for centuries," the statement said. "The Dalai Lama has always  been reminding our people that the relationship between India  and Tibet is that of a teacher and a disciple."</p>

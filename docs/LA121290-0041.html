			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE FINES HOSPITAL OVER GAS LEAK;  </P> <P> JOB SAFETY: TARZANA REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER IS PENALIZED NEARLY $5,000 AFTER A  TECHNICIAN IS EXPOSED TO ETHYLENE OXIDE.  </P> <P> State job-safety inspectors have fined a Tarzana hospital nearly $5,000 after a  technician was exposed to a suspected cancer-causing gas leaking from a machine  used to sterilize surgical instruments.  </P> <P> But Cal-OSHA officials dropped more than $12,000 in additional fines against  Tarzana Regional Medical Center after deciding that they could not prove that  the hospital didn't have proper mechanical controls to prevent future leaks, a  spokesman said.  </P> <P> The hospital was cited Oct. 2 for 18 violations of state worker-protection  laws, including five repeat offenses. Cal-OSHA officials Tuesday released  details of the citations, which carried $17,100 in potential fines.  </P> <P> Cal-OSHA said ethylene oxide gas, which is associated with higher rates of  cancer in people, accidentally leaked from the instrument sterilizer three  times in May and July. Three workers at the 600-employee hospital were possibly  exposed to the gas, but only one had any symptoms, state officials said.  </P> <P> During a May 28 leak, hospital technician Margarita Luna entered the sterilizer  room without wearing an emergency respirator, Cal-OSHA said. Luna experienced  tingling in her fingers and toes but the symptoms later disappeared, according  to hospital officials.  </P> <P> Following a five-day inspection last summer, the hospital was cited for, among  other things, not having sufficient engineering controls on the sterilizer to  prevent other leaks, an offense punishable by a $10,000 fine. This was a repeat  offense.  </P> <P> The hospital was also cited for not supplying employees with respirators, not  training them about hazardous substances on the job and failing to notify state  officials within 24 hours of an employee's exposure to ethylene oxide.  </P> <P> But hospital officials later told Cal-OSHA that they had made a number of  repairs to the sterilizing machine before and after the gas seepages, including  fixing an electrical short and a faulty door gasket.  </P> <P> After two hospital executives met Oct. 31 with Cal-OSHA's Van Nuys district  manager, Ed Grimes, the agency dropped the $10,000 citation and another  citation charging that the hospital had not properly monitored employees'  exposure to possible gas releases.  </P> <P> Grimes refused to discuss the action. But Cal-OSHA media spokesman Rick Rice  said the $10,000 citation was canceled because the agency felt that it couldn't  legally defend its allegation that the hospital didn't have sufficient  engineering controls on the sterilizer. Employers cited by Cal-OSHA have the  right to appeal in court.  </P> <P> "They actually did have engineering controls, but the controls failed," he  said. "I guess we just have to say that it was felt that the citation was not  legally supportable upon appeal."  </P> <P> John Jeffries, senior vice president of the hospital, said the hospital will  probably pay the remaining fines without filing an appeal.  </P> <P> He said the sterilizer, which was shut down after the leaks, has been working  properly for the past four to six weeks. He said the ethylene oxide gas used to  sterilize surgical instruments evaporates and poses no danger to patients.  </P></p>

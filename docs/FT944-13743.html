			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Shell Canada ahead sharply at nine months Strong domestic and export markets for chemicals, oil and natural gas and sulphur brought a sharp turnround in Shell Canada's third-quarter and nine-month results. Net profit in the third quarter was CDollars 89m (USDollars 65.81m), or 79 cents a share, up from CDollars 1m, or 1 cent (after a CDollars 32m special charge), in the 1993 period. Revenues for the company, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch Shell group, were CDollars 1.35bn against CDollars 1.17bn. Nine months' profit was CDollars 217m, or CDollars 1.93, up from CDollars 13m, or 11 cents, on revenues of CDollars 3.7bn against CDollars 3.48bn. Cash flow from operations was CDollars 561m against CDollars 377m. The resource sector provided most of the gain, but refining margins recovered and a sharp rise in contributions from chemicals came mainly from stronger styrene prices. Canada's biggest integrated oil company Imperial Oil (70 per cent owned by Exxon of the US) posted third-quarter net profit of CDollars 171m, or 88 cents a share, up from CDollars 84m, or 43 cents, a year earlier, with better upstream and downstream contributions. Nine months' profit was CDollars 258m, or CDollars 1.33, up 15 per cent from a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 6.67bn, little changed.</p>

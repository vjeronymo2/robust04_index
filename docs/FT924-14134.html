			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Quarter of UK fund managers see no return to ERM A QUARTER of Britain's leading institutional fund managers believe the UK will never return to the Exchange Rate Mechanism, according to a survey by Gallup for stockbrokers Smith New Court. Since the UK's departure from the ERM, the institutions have also raised their forecasts for the 12-month inflation rate from 3 per cent to 4 per cent. The survey suggests scepticism for Mr Norman Lamont's new economic policy laid out at last week's Conservative Party conference. More than half the investors believed the UK would return to the ERM but not within the next 12 months. Nearly a fifth thought re-entry would be after three months but within a year. Fund managers have sharply increased their interest in investing in index-linked gilts. The survey showed a similar increase in fund managers intending to reduce their holdings of UK conventional gilts. The biggest change in sentiment was towards UK equities. The size of the majority of fund managers intending to increase their UK holdings rose to its highest level since April. However, the institutions have shaved their estimates of earnings per share growth in 1992 from 3.8 per cent to 3.2 per cent since the September survey. One hundred institutions, which together handle funds worth Pounds 542bn, took part in the survey.</p>

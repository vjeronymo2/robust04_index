			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Cookery: The last chicken in the pot THE FIRST time I made stock using chicken wings, a few scraps of flesh fell from the bones on to the work surface while I was separating the liquid from the solids. I ate them absent-mindedly, more as a gesture of tidiness than in the spirit of inquiry. I did not expect the meat to taste of anything. When a fine batch of chicken stock has been made, it is reasonable to assume that the bird has given up all its goodness and flavour to the liquid. The bones and flesh are spent, ready to throw away. But the meat from those chicken wings tasted of chicken. I cannot pretend that this was chicken as you would cook it for eating - the texture was over-soft from prolonged simmering, the pieces were too small to be handsome, and the flavour was weak - but it was much better than expected. A colleague has suggested that cooling the chicken in the stock pot, as I do, allows some of the flavour to seep back into the flesh. Encouraged by that first mouthful, I picked a few more slivers of chicken from the bones and used them at lunchtime, together with a little chopped parsley, to garnish a tureen of the rich, pure chicken stock. The broth was received so well that afterwards I freed the rest of the flesh from the bones, skin and gristle. Now, I aways do. I use 6-7 lb of chicken wings for every batch of stock I make, and you get 1 1/2 -1 3/4 lb of flesh each time. This is the same amount of meat you will get from a 4 lb, oven-ready chicken. In these recessionary times, a saving like this is not to be overlooked. Chicken broth garnish apart, how best can the salvaged meat be recycled? Because its flavour and texture are not of prime quality, it is important to partner the chicken with strong, fresh tastes and to provide a good contrast of textures. Here are three dishes that work well for me. CHICKEN CROQUETTES This is an old-fashioned sort of dish but worth reviving. Deep-fried parsley and a fresh tomato salsa go well with it. Make a panada with 2 oz each butter or chicken fat and flour, a scant 1/2 pt rich chicken stock, and 3 to 4 tablespoons thick cream. Season the very thick sauce generously with salt, pepper and freshly-grated Parmesan or chopped capers. When it is cold and set firm, beat in a good squeeze of lemon juice and some wholegrain mustard, and stir in  3/4 lb of cooked and finely chopped meat - all chicken, or a mixture of chicken and ham carved freshly from the bone. Scoop and roll the mixture into neat little sausage shapes. Dust with flour, egg-and-crumb and fry until piping hot and crisp. CHICKEN BONNE FEMME This is a soothingly pure and simple soup-cum-stew, made along the lines of waterzoie or water-souchy but without the enrichment of eggs and cream usually added to Dutch-inspired dish just before serving. Peel and cut into chunks one good-size potato and carrot per person. Sweat them for a few minutes in a little chicken fat or butter. Pour on just enough richly-flavoured chicken stock to cover the vegetables. Add a soupcon of tarragon and a few spoonfuls of chopped parsley. Cover with a lid and simmer until the vegetables are half-cooked. Then add 1 or 2 thickly-sliced leeks and, finally, 3 or 4 oz cooked chicken meat per person. Simmer for another five minutes or so until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is thoroughly hot. Check seasoning and serve in soup plates, on its own, or scattered with diced croutons of fried bread. CHICKEN PIE WITH ONIONS I have saved until last my number one choice for using chicken wings twice over. Serve the pie tepid, about half an hour after it emerges from the oven. Or, almost better, serve it cold, when it makes marvellous picnic food. First, simmer 1 lb roughly-chopped onions in  1/4 pt rich chicken stock until meltingly tender. Process the contents of the pan with a walnut of chicken fat or butter to make a soubise-like puree. Measure and top-up with extra stock as necessary to make 1 pt. Stir in 5 oz of grated feta cheese and plenty of salt and pepper. Add two beaten eggs and mix gently with about 1 lb 10 oz of cooked and chopped chicken meat. If there is not enough chicken, make up the weight with eggs (hard-boiled and cut into wedges). Pack the filling into a 10in paella pan, lasagne tin or other shallow metal dish which has been lined with 3-4 layers of phyllo pastry and brushed lightly between layers with chicken fat or melted butter. Do not use a pottery dish as pottery is a poor conductor of heat and soggy pastry may result. Cover with 7 or 8 more layers of phyllo, brushed with fat as before, and tuck in the ends of the pastry to make a neat, well-sealed parcel. Brush with more fat, score the top decoratively, and bake the pie on a hot baking sheet at 375'F/190'C (gas mark 5), or just over, for 45 to 50 minutes until golden.</p>

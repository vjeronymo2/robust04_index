			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ORIOLES BEAT TIGERS, 8-3, FOR 12TH WIN IN 15 GAMES  </P> <P> Jim Traber expressed disappointment at sitting on the bench while the Baltimore  Orioles were playing their best baseball of the season, yet the first baseman  knew he would get another chance to make a contribution.  </P> <P> That chance came Thursday night. Traber, starting for the injured Randy  Milligan, and Rene Gonzales hit home runs to key a six-run first inning as the  Orioles won for the 12th time in their last 15 games, beating the Tigers, 8-3,  at Detroit.  </P> <P> "It's been kind of hard not playing," said Traber, who had four RBIs. "The  team's doing well, and I didn't feel a part of it. But I deserved to be on the  bench because I had a terrible slump at the start of the season and Randy  played well."  </P> <P> The Orioles have won four straight games, equaling their longest streak of last  season, and are the first American League East team to go five games over .500.  </P> <P> Rookie Randy Nosek, making only his second start since being called up from  Class Double-A London, Canada, did not survive the first inning, giving up all  six runs on four hits and two walks.  </P> <P> Dave Schmidt won his fourth consecutive start despite allowing leadoff homers  by Gary Pettis in the first and Fred Lynn in the fifth. It was Pettis' first  homer of the season and Lynn's second.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 5, New York 0 -- Teddy Higuera, hampered all season while recovering  from back surgery, pitched a two-hitter through six innings for his first  victory as the Brewers beat the Yankees at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Higuera did not give up a hit until Alvaro Espinoza singled over the pitcher's  glove to lead off the sixth inning. The left-hander then gave up another single  to Steve Sax before retiring the side.  </P> <P> Higuera, in his fifth start, struck out seven and walked one in his longest  outing of the season. He underwent back surgery in January to remove a  herniated disk and came off the disabed list May 1. Jay Aldrich pitched the  final three innings for his first career save.  </P> <P> Seattle 3, Texas 2 -- Dave Cochrane hit a home run with one out in the ninth  inning at Seattle to lift the Mariners past the Rangers.  </P> <P> The Rangers had tied the game in the eighth on Scott Fletcher's two-run double,  but Cochrane connected on an 0-and-1 pitch from Texas starter Kevin Brown for  his second homer. Texas has lost four straight.  </P> <P> Mike Schooler, the third Seattle pitcher, worked 1 2/3 innings to win his first  decision of the year.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAEL HIGH COURT QUASHES EMERGENCY HOUSING PLANS  </P> <P> The Israeli Supreme Court today quashed the emergency powers granted to Housing  Minister Ariel Sharon for a crash building program to house a wave of Soviet  Jewish immigrants.  </P> <P> Israel's new right-wing government gave Sharon the right July 1 to circumvent  existing rules in order to rush construction of 3,000 new apartments and  prepare the groundwork for another 8,000.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court ruled in favor of parliamentarian Avraham Poraz of the  centrist Shinui party, who charged that Sharon's emergency powers were  unreasonable and illegal.  </P> <P> "It was possible to build houses at all the sites that Minister Sharon wanted  to build according to the existing law," Poraz told Army radio after the  ruling.  </P> <P> "In fact these emergency measures were intended to create an atmosphere of  public hysteria, an atmosphere of distress."  </P> <P> Sharon, a hard-liner who orchestrated Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon,  received broad powers in the new government to handle the immigration of  hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews.  </P> <P> In a second blow to Sharon's ambitious plans to cope with Soviet immigration,  Tourism Minister Gideon Patt attacked his emergency plan announced Sunday to  house immigrants in hotels.  </P> <P> "Three-, four- and five-star hotels will not become absorption centers," Patt  told reporters. "I won't allow it."  </P> <P> Pressure on the government to solve the housing crisis grows daily as the  number of homeless Israelis swells and dozens of tent cities spring up across  the country.  </P> <P> The growing demand for space has forced up rents, driving many young couples  and poor families out of their apartments.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> TAKING SIDES ON IRVINE PARK BOND;  </P> <P> YES: RESIDENTS WILL ENJOY INCREASED AMENITIES AS WELL AS A BOOST IN PROPERTY  VALUES.  </P> <P> A yes vote on Proposition Parks means Irvine intends to finish the job begun in  1974 with our first park bond. That investment 16 years ago provided the parks  and facilities we currently enjoy, which have helped assure Irvine a national  reputation as a great place to live.  </P> <P> Voting yes on Proposition Parks provides our seniors their long-awaited senior  center and day-care center and assures our youth and adult sports teams more  playing fields -- some lighted. A gymnasium, serving both daytime Irvine High  students and evening community groups, will be built. Woodbridge, Northwood and  Westpark will each receive a major community park.  </P> <P> A family/human services center, a child-care facility, 13 miles of new bike  trails, a model farm (Irvine's agricultural heritage museum), landscaping  Northwood Railway and the Edison easements as well as improvements to all  existing park facilities are among the projects that would benefit Irvine  residents.  </P> <P> We must finish the job begun in 1974. Our 105,000 population will double in the  next 20 years, and current parks and facilities won't be adequate. Already our  senior facilities are inadequate and our sports fields, fine arts facility and  swimming complex are overscheduled.  </P> <P> Beginning in January, 1989, hundreds of residents petitioned the city for more  than $100 million in recreational facilities and projects. During an  eight-month hearing process at City Hall and in the neighborhoods, the  residents outlined their needs. The council cut these requests to the $57.5  million bond before you March 6.  </P> <P> The council's criteria for project inclusion were: need and diversity. Each  geographical section and various recreational interests in the city should  derive benefit. The wide range of opportunities provided are those we will be  touting to our guests and visitors, to prospective business partners and new  businesses, and to prospective home buyers.  </P> <P> This park bond is a worthwhile investment when you consider the 27 projects  being funded. You, individually, will gain from the recreational opportunities  offered and the increased value of your home. Businesses will benefit from the  dynamic growth that comes from people moving into a growing and desired  community.  </P> <P> Mello-Roos Community Facilities bonds allow for construction, maintenance and  operation funding. Given staff-projected city expenditures and revenues, there  are insufficient funds available in the general fund to provide, maintain and  operate these new recreational projects. To provide outstanding recreational  facilities, then allow them to fall into disrepair because of inadequate  maintenance funding, is the height of fiscal irresponsibility.  </P> <P> In that situation, future City Councils would be forced to return to the voters  every few years for additional taxes. A more honest approach is to provide for  future infrastructure in a comprehensive, "total funding" package. You won't be  nickeled and dimed and dollared to death in coming years with repeated tax  increases because we failed to be fiscally responsible. And you won't dread  driving past a browned-out park area or see facilities closed because of a lack  of foresight on government's part in planning for operation and maintenance  costs.  </P> <P> Those old sayings that "nothing worth having is free" and "you get what you pay  for" apply to Irvine's Proposition Parks.  </P> <P> The dollars currently available in the city's coffers are restricted to  specific uses such as capital improvements (roads, lights), economic  uncertainties and rehabilitation reserves or are already designated for other  purposes. In summary, Irvine is solvent because we have prudently planned  balanced budgets.  </P> <P> Irvine voters should keep the park bond numbers in perspective. In 20 years the  total investment is less than $3,000 for your family. Our homes appreciate far  more than that in one year, partly because of the very amenities this park bond  provides. You, your family, friends and visitors can use and enjoy these  projects as long as you're here -- for less than a can of soda a day!  </P> <P> Indeed, had the 1974 park bond voters been scared off by total costs  aggregation, we wouldn't have the desirable Irvine community we know today.  </P> <P> The March election was scheduled for two reasons: to ensure that residents vote  on the park bond unhampered by the politics of the City Council/mayoral races  in June and to save money. The election costs are less than the additional  inflationary costs of these projects in three months' time.  </P> <P> Let's finish the job begun in 1974. Let's continue the progress and provision  of those amenities that we enjoy and that add to our investment in our homes  and community. Join with the unanimous approval of the Board of Education and  the City Council in voting yes on Proposition Parks.  </P></p>

			<p>Compound,   Useful for Development of Functional Materials   <F P=102> 94FE0273A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Nov 93  p 5 </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0273A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Koichi Komatsu, assistant professor of the  Chemistry Laboratory of Kyoto University, et. al., have  synthesized a new organic compound that is highly reactive with  other substances. As a hydrocarbon it dissolves readily in  organic solvents, and its processability is excellent. Although  the research is still in its preliminary stages, Assistant  Professor Komatsu hopes to use the new compound to develop  functional materials such as catalysts that control  single-electron reactions, or electrical elements.    The new organic compound is  tetrakis-bicylcoocteno-cyclooctatetraene, whose structure  consists of an octagonal cyclic hydrocarbon to which four  T-shaped portions are attached. It is capable of accepting and  donating four electrons, becoming either an ion with a charge of  +2 or an ion with a charge of -2. This is a larger number of  electrons than previously known organic compounds could accept  and donate, which makes it highly reactive with other substances.    The first step in the synthesis is to react a bromide of the  T-shaped bicyclooctene with an organic solvent. By removing the  bromine while simultaneously causing four molecules to react  with each other, an octagonal cyclic hydrocarbon is formed as  four bicycloocteno portions join together. The new compound is  stable in air at room temperature. Highly reactive free radicals  are generated by exposure to visible light, showing that it is  an organic catalyst that reacts with other substances.    Organic compounds dissolve more easily in organic solvents  than do inorganic catalysts. Assistant Professor Komatsu says,  "This is still the preliminary stage of research, so the fields  of application are not yet clear, but the excellent stabilty and  solubility should lead to functional material applications."</p>

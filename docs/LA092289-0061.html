			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> BUTTE COUNTY GETS REPRIEVE  </P> <P> With the help of the state, Butte County received a reprieve from bankruptcy,  but supervisors still prepared for insolvency by setting aside $200,000 to hire  lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy cases. An immediate financial crisis was  averted when the state agreed to defer billing the county for its $2.8-million  contract with the Department of Forestry for fire protection services until  July. The agreement helped erase a $3.5-million deficit and permitted  supervisors to adopt a $128-million 1989-90 budget by virtually eliminating  library services for 167,000 county residents and drastically cutting the  county's emergency reserve fund. If Butte County eventually declares  bankruptcy, it will be the first California county ever to do so.  </P></p>

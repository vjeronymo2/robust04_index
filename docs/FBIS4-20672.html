Introduction </H5>   Although the number of sewage facilities has significantly  increased in Japan's urban concentrations, this is not so in  areas with low population density. Water pollution caused by  wastewater, domestic and from small-scale industries, in these  low population density areas constitutes a critical problem that  needs to be solved as soon as possible. Wastewater treatment  systems which are demanded for use in such areas must feature  compactness, easy maintenance, high reliability, and capable to  perform advanced treatment. One system which fulfills such  requirements is the activated sludge wastewater treatment  process which uses integrated type membrane separation (hollow  fiber microfiltration membrane) modules. The authors have been  engaged in the development of this system, currently in the  practicalization stage, and have reported previously that the  configuration of membrane module is vital factor for stable and  continuous membrane separation on a long-term  basis.[.sup]1[/] The following discusses membrane fouling,  membrane washing, and other relevant topics which are consequent  to recent test results.  <H5>  2. Test Apparatus </H5>   Activated Sludge Wastewater Treatment Process    Tests were carried out using a nitrified liquor recycling  denitrification nitrification activated sludge treatment  process. The influent was domestic sewage. The modules were  submerged in a nitrification separation tank (3 m[.sup]3[/])  for solid-liquid separation. The volumetric aeration rate was  set at 5.6 [1/h].    Membrane &amp; Membrane Modules    Figure 1 shows a conceptual diagram of membrane module A.  This module features hollow fiber membranes which are bent into  a U-shape. The potted end, wherein the membrane fibers are  potted in a circle, constitutes the filtrate collector. The  U-shaped section features a support ring, which supports the  gaps between the membrane fibers.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-01A>      Figure 1. Membrane Module A </FIG>     Figure 2 shows a conceptual diagram of membrane module B.  The  hollow fibers are arranged and potted flatly. There are two  filtrate collectors on both sides. Table 1 shows the  specifications of both types of membrane modules.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-01B>      Figure 2.

The  pump flow rate was adjusted so the flux could be kept at a  constant. The suction pressure was measured as the filtration  pressure.  <H5>  3. Test Results </H5>   Membrane Module Configuration    A test operation using membrane module A was continued for  over two years. Figure 3 shows variations in the filtration  pressure during this period. The filtration pressure is  corrected to 20C of water temperature. A comparison is made  between the filtration pressure measured in the activated sludge  and that measured in the filtrate following the washing process.  There were two phases of variations in the filtration pressure  of sludge: one which was a stationary phase, where the increase  rate of the pressure was low, and the other which was the  non-stationary phase, where the increase rate of the pressure  was irregularly high. In the stationary phase, the membrane  modules indicated favorable dispersion and the pressure increase  rate was low at 1 [mAq/year]. This pressure variation matched  well with pressure variations of the filtrate following the  washing process. Considering that the variation in the  filtration pressure of the filtrate following the washing  process is due to membrane fouling, it can be assumed that  membrane fouling progresses during the stationary phase.  However, variation in the filtration pressure during the  non-stationary phase was 2 [mAq/month], necessitating a washing  which had to be done within a short period of time. Interfiber  clogging was found in the membrane modules at this stage.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-02A>      Figure 3. Variations in Filtration Pressure of Membrane Module A </FIG>     Membrane modules with interfiber clogging were removed from  the tank and the sludge between the fibers washed off by tap  water. After the operation was resumed, the filtration pressure  in the sludge was almost identical to the filtrate pressure.  Trends of pressure increase were identical to those before the  washing.    Interfiber clogging was also found during the stationary  phase, i.e., in the proximity of the filtrate collector of the  modules. This was assumed to be due to small gaps between the  hollow fibers in the proximity of the filtrate collector, also  due to the fact that module washing by the water flow was  ineffective there. However, the majority of the hollow fibers  were favorably dispersed and it was possible to carry out a  stable long-term operation under this phase. It is probable that  interfiber clogging spreads over an entire module, i.e., after a  few months of such favorable condition, but the cause of this  clogging is yet to be clarified. The duration of the stationary  phase showed a tendency to become shortened with the increase in  the operation time and was approximately five months up to the  third washing. An increase in the washing was found to be  impractical in terms of maintenance and it was considered  necessary to modify membrane module A.    Figure 4 shows filtration pressure variation of membrane  module B. It indicates that a stationary phase had continued for  seven months since the startup of the operation and that there  was no occurrence of interfiber clogging. The pressure increase  rate was only 0.5 [mAq/year], less than that of membrane module  A.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-03A>      Figure 4. Variations in Filtration Pressure of Membrane Module B </FIG>     As for the transition of the pressure increase rate, there  was no clarification made on the cause of the shift from the  stationary phase to the non-stationary one. However, prevention  of interfiber clogging was found possible by sufficient washing  of the membrane surface. The aeration flow causes more movement  by the hollow fibers in module B, i.e., than that by the same in  module A. The aeration flow and the movement of the fibers  themselves causes a greater washing effect, both of which can be  attributed to the prevention of interfiber clogging.    Flux and Membrane Fouling    Figure 5 shows the relationship between the pressure  increase  rate and flux. The pressure increase rate becomes higher along  the increase of flux, and is proportional to the third power of  the flux. The increase rate of hydrophobic membranes is higher  than that of hydrophilic ones. It's indicating that membrane  fouling progresses faster for hydrophobic membranes than for  hydrophilic ones. Fujita et al.[.sup]2[/] indicate a similar  trend in their report on potable water treatment by membrane  filtration.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-04A>      Figure 5. Relationship Between Pressure Increase and </FIG>      Membrane Washing    There are two objectives of membrane washing, washing off  sludge that causes interfiber clogging and washing off  pollutants that attach on membrane pores and cause membrane  fouling. The former can be easily done by washing with water and  the membranes retain their former condition.    Conditions that make it necessary to carry out washing for  membrane fouling have yet to be clarified. However, tests were  conducted to clarify which washing method was most effective for  membrane fouling. An alkaline washing was attempted, taking into  account that organic matter must be the cause of fouling. Figure  6 shows the test results.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-04B>      Figure 6. Effects of Washing by Chemical  Solutions </FIG>     A membrane immersed for two hours in a 5 percent NaOH  solution with water temperature at 40C, resulted in a  filtration pressure recovery to a value identical to the  pressure of a new membrane. The washing effect was found to  decrease with a drop in the chemical solution concentration and  water temperature.    Membrane Module Life and Optimum Flux    It was confirmed through the tests conducted that the life  of  the membrane module could exceed two years. It is figured that  membrane life was elongated by improvement made on the module  configuration, the outcome of which was decrease in the pressure  increase rate. Further long-term tests will be necessary to  affirm this.    Insofar as designing a membrane separation system is  concerned, a decrease in the number of modules could be achieved  by setting the flux at a high value. Consequently, a saving in  initial cost can be made. However, this leads to a faster  progress of membrane fouling and washing by chemical solutions  for pollutant removal becomes necessary. For this reason, the  optimum flux was determined by the initial and running costs.    Although the present treatment method is designed for use in  a small-scale treatment plant, to use a chemical washing system  in such a plant is impractical even in economic terms. It will  become necessary to transport the modules to a washing plant and  this will increase maintenance requirement, not to mention  increased costs. A solution here would be to set the flux to a  predetermined value, considering the relation between the flux  and factors such as membrane life, whereby washing by chemical  solution would not be necessary.

The ratio of total  nitrogen removal was not favorable, because the DO level in  denitrification tank did not indicate zero for the small BOD  loading. As for phosphorus removal, it was the same level as  that by the conventional activated sludge process, as no  phosphorus removal system was applied. There was negative  indication of E-coli groups; however they became detected along  an increase in hollow fiber damage. One future objective would  be to study the application of phosphorus removal methods fit  for the said treatment.  <H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>   The following are results of tests on the activated sludge  wastewater treatment process which featured the integrated type  membrane separation (hollow fiber microfiltration membrane)  modules.    1) There are two phases of variations in the filtration  pressure during continuous filtration: one which was a  stationary phase, wherein membrane fouling progresses, and the  other which was a non-stationary phase, where interfiber  clogging occurs.    2) The progress of membrane fouling was related to the flux,  while the pressure increase rate was proportional to the third  power of the flux.    3) Interfiber clogging could be easily dealt with by washing  and the membranes retain their original pressure as a result.    4) Alkali washing of fouled membranes is effective to a high  degree whereby the washed membranes could retain a state which  is close to that of new membranes.    5) Module life was elongated to exceed two years by  configuration improvement, but further studies are necessary to  affirm this.    6) Optimum flux should be determined in an overall manner,  i.e., considering factors such as the necessary washing and  membrane life.    7) The treated water quality by the said process was  favorable.

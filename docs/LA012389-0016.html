			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A THAW BUILT ON SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE  </P> <P> George Bush has become President of the United States and leader of the Western  world at a time of peace and promise unprecedented in the postwar era. Ronald  Reagan's presidency provided a solid basis on which to build in key areas of  national security. But the choices that Bush makes must be grounded in part on  an accurate understanding of what Reagan did and did not do.  </P> <P> There can be no doubt that his optimism was far more consistent with the  American national character than was Jimmy Carter's "malaise," and national  self-assurance is a valuable asset in diplomacy. Through the occasional  exercise of military power -- with Libya's Col. Moammar Kadafi as his favorite  villain -- Reagan provided catharsis for collective anger over assaults on  American dignity, even if he rarely produced concrete results. And in his  support -- even if with words more than deeds -- of democracy elsewhere on the  globe, Reagan gave a sense of purpose to U.S. policy that was rooted in  American values. It was only in piling up mammoth budget and trade deficits  while neglecting a wide range of global economic and environmental concerns  that Reagan passed to his successor a set of challenges worse than what he  inherited eight years ago, along with a weaker hand to play.  </P> <P> Overshadowing all else during the Reagan years was the passing of the Cold War.  U.S.-Soviet competition continues, even the risk of war, but rigidities have  softened and East-West tensions have been reduced almost everywhere. Equally  important, Reagan acknowledged that U.S.-Soviet relations have changed  significantly, thereby disarming the right wing and giving the new era a  political legitimacy that perhaps no other President could have conferred. Bush  can now proceed in dealing with the Soviet Union by wrapping himself in the  flag woven by Reagan. It is thus possible that wild swings in U.S. attitudes  toward Moscow will be damped down, leading to more sustainable and productive  policies toward the Soviet Union than proved possible during detente's false  dawn in the 1970s.  </P> <P> But, beyond the politics, it is important to analyze how the thaw occurred in  superpower relations. Obviously, the Soviet Union has done most of the  compromising. It is removing its troops from Afghanistan, reducing its military  forces by about 10%, smiling warmly on a host of its neighbors, helping to  broker reduced tensions and even settlements in places like Cambodia, Korea and  Angola, supporting the United Nations, and accepting on-site inspection as a  condition of arms-control agreements.  </P> <P> Some observers, including Reagan himself, attribute these shifts in Soviet  behavior largely to the U.S. defense buildup and years of firmness in resisting  Soviet military encroachment (Afghanistan) or divisive diplomacy (medium-range  missiles in Europe). Only in places where the President has not had his way --  notably Nicaragua -- has Soviet power resisted retreat.  </P> <P> According to this view, the Soviets could not compete, and they are wisely  drawing in their horns. The lesson for George Bush is clear: Be resolute and  militarily powerful, and bargain only from strength.  </P> <P> By contrast, many critics of the Reagan hard line regard as self-deluding the  vision that effects must necessarily have causes that are Made in America. By  this account, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has changed his tune and  his tactics in order to gain a breathing space in which to restructure the  Soviet economy, supported by Western credits and technology. He has played  relatively poor cards with consummate skill, thereby gaining relative  advantages in many parts of the world. Unable to provide his people with bread,  he has given them circuses, while the U.S. government has lacked the  imagination to match his diplomacy. The lesson for the next President: Be wary  of Gorbachev and learn to compete with him, but also do not undermine the best  Soviet leader that the West can hope for.  </P> <P> Yet another view gives President Reagan significant credit for helping to  produce changes in Kremlin policy, but holds that he began to succeed only when  he radically altered his own approach. That change can be dated from early  1984, when he began embracing the goals and rhetoric of arms control in order  to counter the nuclear freeze movement and to co-opt the Democrats' one  selling-point in the presidential election. Reagan continued by making major --  indeed, bizarre -- concessions at the 1986 Reykjavik superpower summit, by  concluding a Euromissile agreement that provided relative advantages to the  Soviet Union, by inviting it to join Arab-Israeli peacemaking, and finally by  supporting a human-rights conference in Moscow in 1991. Thus only by becoming  more accommodating himself did Reagan evoke a similar response from Gorbachev's  Soviet Union. The lesson: Resist a return to the confrontation policies of the  early 1980s, pursue arms control and work to reduce regional tensions.  </P> <P> Each of these visions has its strengths and weaknesses. But most remarkable,  both for assessing the record of the Reagan years and for guiding the policy of  the Bush Administration -- the lessons that they embody are all essentially  correct. Taken together, they provide a reasonable basis for U.S. policy toward  the Soviet Union for the foreseeable future. Indeed, by acting in ways that  provided arguments for almost everybody, Reagan permitted a bipartisanship that  Bush would be wise to emulate.  </P></p>

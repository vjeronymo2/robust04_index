			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Savings restore training centre POSTING mail second class and making telephone calls after 1pm have helped a structural engineering company to reopen its training centre for apprentices. Cleveland Structural Engineering, a subsidiary of Trafalgar House, the conglomerate, closed its craft and technician training centre in 1990 while reducing overheads. At the time the company, based in Darlington, County Durham, cut its workforce from 1,200 to 650. Now fears over skills shortages in the industry  -which fabricates and erects structural steelwork, such as for the new Dartford bridge across the river Thames - have led the company to reopen the centre and resurrect a traditional four-year apprenticeship scheme. Last month 28 craft apprentices and seven trainee technicians started one-year training off the job. They are soon to be joined by 12 other trainees who are not employed by Cleveland but whose training is to be fully funded by Durham Training and Enterprise Council. A substantial amount of the Pounds 210,000 annual running cost has been raised by cost-saving measures such as posting all but very urgent mail second class, using telephones in the cheaper period after 1pm and freezing the replacement of company cars. Mr Jeremy Beeton, managing director, said: 'Training is one of the very few areas of our business on which expenditure will be increased next year. Without good quality tradesmen, this industry will not survive. 'Because of the serious financial problems of the structural steel industry, training has been almost totally sacrificed but we cannot afford to neglect it. Even now, it is difficult to recruit a skilled tradesman who knows how to weld or cut steel.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Ambition for Domination Over Asia Cannot Be Realized"KCNA </F> headine]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists'  wild ambition to dominate Asia can never be realized, stresses  NODONG SINMUN in a signed article today.    The United States is trying to break up and stifle socialist  countries in Asia with its "peaceful transition" strategy as  well as its policy of "strength" and put other non-socialist  countries under its control by applying the American view of  value, but it is met by a storm of objections in these  countries, the paper notes, and goes on:    The United States has got nothing from its anti-socialist  moves.    The Korean people have firmly defended socialism, their life  and soul, pushing aside the U.S. strategy of "peaceful  transition". The U.S. strategy of "peaceful transition" to  isolate and stifle Asian socialist countries and revive  capitalism has become impotent.    It has also failed in its maneuvers against Asian countiries  which aspire after independence.    In recent years the spirit of independence has grown in  Asian  countries and there are such positive movements as promoting  bilateral and multilateral cooperation in various fields and  taking joint steps in external relations. This is a reflection  of the aspiration of people to develop independently free from  the domination and intervention of the imperialists.    Developing countries in Asia are rejecting the West's  "standard of human rights", saying "it cannot be a model." They  are also rejecting the "democracy" of American style, saying "it  is not suitable for them."    The Asian people are maintaining their mental and cultural  traditions, turning down "freedom" and "democracy" of American  style.    All facts show that whatever means and ways the United  States  may apply, it can never stamp out socialist countries and  developing countries in Asia.</p>

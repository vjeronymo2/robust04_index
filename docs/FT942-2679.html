			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (29): Group F - Netherlands The Netherlands continues to breed talented players. Dennis Bergkamp and Wim Jonk moved last year to Inter Milan in Italy. They followed Ruud Gullit (Sampdoria/AC Milan), Marco van Basten (AC Milan) and Frank Rijkaard (Ajax) who led AC Milan to two European Cups. Van Basten, injured, and Gullitt, sulking, seem set to miss the World Cup. Rijkaard will play as will the middle generation of Dutch Italians - Brian Roy (Foggia) and Aaron Winter (Lazio) - and the next generation, Marc Overmars (Ajax). But the key to the Dutch performance will be provided by Ronald Koeman, who followed the greatest Dutch master, Johan Cruyff, to Barcelona. Koeman is a sweeper. His play in the European Cup final against AC Milan demonstrated yet again that while he may be a great player coming forward, he is a liability in defence. He is powerful in the air and strong in the tackle but he is slow and he compounds the problem by poor positional play. - Against Sampdoria in the European Cup final two years ago Koeman was let off by Gianluca Vialli's poor finishing before winning the game in extra-time with a pile-driver free-kick. Against England, in the last qualifying match, Koeman was reprieved by a lenient referee after allowing David Platt to escape and then felling him. Again he then settled the game with a goal from a free kick. Without the ruthless finishing of van Basten and with Bergkamp off form, Koeman will have to contribute heavily in attack to keep himself in credit and the Dutch in the World Cup.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>   [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- North Korea's threatened  withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  although coming as a shock, is actually the weakest action it  can take at this point.    For one thing, Pyongyang is not exempted from IAEA nuclear  inspections even if it withdraws from the agency because such  checks are obligatory under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty  (NPT), not under IAEA membership rules.    North Korea is apparently saving NPT withdrawal, a much more  drastic action that would sever all inspection obligations, for  the future when the UN Security Council starts implementing  sanctions.    In order to make its IAEA withdrawal official, North Korea  must notify the United States in writing since it is the  depository nation for the agency's statutes.    Once such notification is made, withdrawal becomes effective  immediately.    North Korea joined the IAEA in 1974 and will be the first  country to bolt the agency.    But the communist state remains in the NPT regime and it is  this link with the NPT that keeps North Korea bound to  inspection obligations.    In 1985 Pyongyang signed the NPT, an umbrella agreement  requiring its members to comply with IAEA inspections in  accordance with the safeguards accord. The IAEA, in short,  conducts inspections on behalf of the NPT. As long as North  Korea does not leave the NPT, the inspection requirements remain.    There are other nations which are non-members of the IAEA  but  are parties to the NPT, such as Taiwan and Latvia. This  accounts for the difference in the size of membership between  the two groups.    The IAEA has 118 members, including North Korea, while the  NPT has a membership of 162.    Changes are afoot once Pyongyang leaves the IAEA. The agency  paid for all inspection costs of past monitoring activities in  North Korea; but if its withdrawal becomes effective, the North  must bear the costs.    North Korea no longer needs to pay its share of the IAEA  budget, currently 0.05 percent of the annual 20 million U.S.  dollars.    Officials here say Pyongyang was driven to announce its IAEA  withdrawal to show that its threat to leave the NPT is not  merely bluster.    The IAEA, for the first time ever, adopted a sanctions  resolution against North Korea on June 10 canceling 560,000  dollars worth of technical aid.    The pullout announcement is in retaliation for this IAEA  action as well as a threat of what may come next -- NPT  withdrawal, officials say.</p>

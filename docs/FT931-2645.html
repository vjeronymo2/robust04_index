			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: A tour of investors buys time for the bank  -Barclays' chief meets dissatisfied shareholders MR ANDREW Buxton, chairman and chief executive of Barclays Bank, seems to have won some time. His tour of shareholders in the past two weeks following the announcement of a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss for 1992 has not reassured all of them. But it has - at least temporarily - mollified some. Mr Buxton has arrived on his own at the meetings and asked to see only the top one or two executives of each fund. 'I got the feeling he realises the level of dissatisfaction,' said the chief of one investment company after a meeting with Mr Buxton last week. 'I think the will is there.' Mr Buxton asked at least one investor whether he should resign. But most investors say they believe he deserves some time to show that Barclays management is getting better. 'A lynch mob is not being gathered. We just responded to his invitation to talk and listen,' said one shareholder. Another shareholder, who earlier described the bank's management as 'a shambles', said Mr Buxton had indicated that he was trying to appoint a chief executive swiftly. Mr Buxton, who was appointed chairman in January, has said he wants to split his two roles 'as quickly as possible'. A fund manager at one institution, who had earlier said he had strong reservations about both Mr Buxton's intentions and the abilities of the bank's board, said his perception had changed somewhat. 'I think he is genuinely committed to working with shareholders.' Mr Buxton told the Financial Times before starting his meetings that 'a significant part' of his responsibilities would be passed to a new senior executive this year. But he did not specify to shareholders when this decision would be made, or whether an outsider would be appointed. 'At least he was making the effort to come and listen to shareholders. That is quite a change from last year, when we were told he was going to be chairman and chief executive without any consultation,' said one investor. Shareholders started expressing discontent over Mr Buxton's appointment to both roles last summer. Most now want an early disclosure of how the roles will be split, and would like to see an outsider appointed. They are also keen to be shown that the bank's assessment of loan risks has improved. 'The whole problem is that Barclays gives an impression of lurching along. It is important for them to convey a sense of direction and purpose from the top,' said one investor. Most investors contacted by the Financial Times believe the bank deserves some months to make its reforms. Not everyone is sanguine about giving such time. 'I think his position is totally untenable. He cannot distance himself from the mistakes Barclays made, and he has shown crass insensitivity by rejecting the advice many of us gave about his appointment,' said an institutional investor. There is some division of opinion among shareholders about how corporate governance should be altered. Most investors favour bringing in a chief executive, but at least one fund would prefer to see Mr Buxton stay only as chief executive while a chairman is appointed from outside. Resentment about the bank lingers from last year, when investors who expressed concern say they were given the impression that they were in a small minority. Mr Buxton has impressed upon investors his desire to keep future discussions about management changes at Barclays private. In his contacts with shareholders, he urged them to make any future complaints directly to the bank, rather than discussing them with journalists. Shareholders said they were still uncertain about whether Barclays had learnt from its poor lending in the property and construction sectors during the late 1980s. One investor said Mr Buxton had been 'quietly positive' about the reforms the bank was undertaking to reduce future bad debts. Some remain concerned that Barclays has not yet made a clear decision to reduce exposure to property lending. 'He said loans are assessed on an account-by-account basis,' said one shareholder. The fact that the bank's past controls allowed property lending to rise worries some. Barclays has signalled its intention to impose tighter controls on its lending portfolio by appointing Mr Alan Brown, formerly the head of its Japan operations, to the new post of director of group credit policy. His task will be to balance its portfolio, but he only took up his job this month. Mr Buxton will have further meetings next week. Investors he has met so far appear willing to give the bank a breathing space - perhaps until the interim results - to show it is changing. But the level of discontent has been subdued, rather than banished entirely, by Mr Buxton's tour.</p>

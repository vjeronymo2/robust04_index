			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Observer: Stamped out When is freepost not free post? When it's Freepost. The Union of Communication Workers, which is being advised in its anti-privatisation campaign by Sir Tim Bell, has printed masses of postcards to distribute to the public, in the hope that UK trade and industry secretary Michael Heseltine will be sunk beneath a tidal wave of protest. The cards go Freepost, but cost the union 20p a time. Which could get expensive - depending on how many actually get delivered.</p>

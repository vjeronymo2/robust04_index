			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Japan banks on recovery JAPAN'S DEEPENING political and economic difficulties make a worrying spectacle. The Japanese government has the room to act, both to prevent a recession and to ensure that its troubled banking sector is purged and ready for recovery. But the combination of bureaucratic myopia and political grid-lock may still produce too little action, too late. Japan faces two distinct recessionary threats. The slowdown in the corporate sector, and the associated fall in profits, investment, output and prospects for employment, make headline news. But it is the collapse of the real estate sector and the resultant troubles in the banking industry which pose the greater threat to economic growth in the medium term, both for Japan and the world. Japanese industry is fundamentally strong, but burdened by excess capacity at a time when both international and domestic demand is weak. Inventories are too high. The investment growth of the late 1980s was probably too rapid. Many observers now expect private investment to remain depressed for a year or more. Fortunately, Japan's life-time employment system and the recently agreed Y10,700bn fiscal package of public investments should together ensure that Japan avoids an outright recession. Yet it is the threat of an anaemic recovery, not recession, that should disturb the sleep of Ministry of Finance officials. Japanese monetary growth may currently be sluggish because the demand for new loans is depressed. But the pace of recovery, both in Japan and elsewhere, may subsequently be constrained by the ability and willingness of Japan's banks to lend for new ventures. Bad debts The omens are poor. Bad debts in the US banking industry have hindered the pace of the US recovery, despite the willingness of the US Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy aggressively in order to steepen the yield curve and boost bank profitability. The scale of the likely bad debts held by Japan's less profitable banking sector is only slowly becoming apparent. The Ministry of Finance reported last week that the non-performing loans of the leading 21 Japanese banks rose by 54 per cent, to Y12,300bn, in the six months to the end of the September, about a third of the total capital of these banks. Other estimates, based on a less conservative definition of bad loans and including regional banks, suggest a figure for bad debts that is four times as great. In fact, the low level of transactions in the land market and the artificially inflated level of recorded land prices make it impossible to know quite how large the damage to bank balance sheets will turn out to be. Public support Neither the Bank of Japan or the Ministry of Finance is willing, at least publicly, to recognise the threat to recovery that these bad debts present. The Bank of Japan has left the discount rate unchanged since July, while the gap between short and long-term interest rates is half that in the US. The Ministry of Finance appeared willing, in August, to consider direct public support for the banks as did Prime Minister Miyazawa. But these signals have since been denied in the face of widespread opposition to the use of public funds to help the banks. Yet the alternative - a poorly capitalised agency, owned and run by the private banks, that will purchase their bad loans - is a recipe for delay and concealment. Writing off the banks' losses at realistic land prices would destroy much of their capital, and perhaps some banks entirely. In practice, the agency is likely to buy real estate at inflated prices, minimising the apparent loss to the banks, but at the price of postponing the inevitable losses and leaving a still distorted land market. Herein lies the case for public funds. The banks should be forced to accept losses that are as large as they can bear, while land prices must fall by much more than the 10 per cent canvassed by the banks. But this risks destabilising the financial system unless the agency is sufficiently well capitalised and firmly run. Only the Bank of Japan can perform that role. When past errors have been cleared away, along with the managers who made them, the banks will be able to re-capitalise and finance recovery.</p>

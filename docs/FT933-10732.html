			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking up the Pieces: German industry braces for stronger D-Mark GERMAN INDUSTRY expects to take one step backward, followed, possibly, by two steps forward as a result of the weekend shakeout of the European monetary system. But yesterday, labouring under the twin burdens of recession and restructuring, it was more concerned with the first stage of the process than the longer-term possibilities. Daimler-Benz, for example, which generates well over 20 per cent of its sales among its European neighbours, warned of a marked increase in exchange rate risks for international groups like itself. Any revaluation of the D-Mark against EMS currencies would tend to depress the group's profit position, it said. The VDMA engineering industry association welcomed weekend efforts to save the system from complete collapse but complained that the loosening of fluctuation bands had deprived its members of a useful basis for calculations. 'We need stable exchange rates because we have long development times,' a spokesman said. Economists expected an early but modest effective revaluation of the D-Mark against the French franc, which would damage German exporters' competitiveness initially. Some 17 per cent of all German sales abroad go to France. However, economists suggested, that would eventually be offset by increased demand as customer countries spurred economic growth by reducing their domestic interest rates. At the same time, the reduction in German import prices, implied by a D-Mark with improved buying power, could encourage the Bundesbank to continue cutting its rates, and thus bolster internal demand. Most eyes were on France, where Mr Dietrich Beier, chief economist of the Berliner Bank expected a devaluation of '5 per cent but not more.' This is the engineering industry's most important single export market, accounting last year for sales of DM12bn (Pounds 4.64bn), 10.3 per cent of the sector's business outside Germany. The French industry was also highly competitive, and with a greater relative price advantage, might win market share in Germany, the spokesman added. Italian manufacturers, too, could benefit from a D-Mark revaluation. Mr Bodo Bottcher, head of the ZVEI electrical and electronics industry association, said if his members wanted to hold on to their European market shares, they could only do it at the cost of reduced profits. The need for hedging measures to cover currency risks would also increase costs. The VDA, representing motor vehicle makers, warned of 'considerable injury' to sales prospects in France, which absorbs 11 per cent of German car exports. But the benefits do not flow only one way - out of Germany. Daimler, for example, which has D-Mark sales in France of more than DM2bn, also buys DM1.5bn worth of French goods each year. And not all industry representatives saw the future as black. There was widespread relief that the structure of the EMS, although greatly loosened, remained intact with the prospect of a return to closer links in the future. The BDI federation of German industry said the central idea of creating a European zone of stable exchange rates had been brought into question. However, Mr Reinhard Kudis, the federation's senior economist, felt the gloom had been overdone. 'A revaluation of the D-Mark is unrealistic and is only the result of temporary speculation,' he said. The DIHT association of chambers of commerce agreed. 'Further exchange rate developments within the EMS certainly do not need to be dramatic,' it said in a statement. 'Negative consequences for German exports as a result of a further revaluation of the D-Mark are by no means unavoidable.' Mr Michael Fuchs, representing wholesalers and exporters, said he did not expect the pressure on the French franc to last long. 'Given the weaknesses in the German economy at present, we could even see the exchange rate reversing in favour of the franc in two or three months,' he said. Bankers, however, were more sceptical. Mr Eberhard Martini, president of the federal banking association, said the widening of the ERM fluctuation corridors was a 'second best' solution. Realignments, in accordance with the rules of the EMS would have been better, but this solution had been avoided because in many cases it would have meant a devaluation, he said in a radio interview. A formal statement from his association noted that the EMS had 'above all, not collapsed.' But the existence of the EMS could only be guaranteed if all members persisted with policies aimed at maintaining monetary stability and consolidating budgets. Only then would plans for European economic and monetary union have a realistic chance.</p>

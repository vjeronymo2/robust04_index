Twelve minutes past midnight, two UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] armored carriers carrying Ukrainian soldiers entered  Gorazde. They were welcomed by antiaircraft weapons fired from  chetnik positions at the approach to the town. In the town  center, they came across sniper fire from the hills on the right  bank of the Drina. The rest of the convoy started entering  Gorazde at 0145 hours. French General Soubirou, the commander  of the Sarajevo sector [word indistinct] also arrived aboard  this convoy.    No changes have been sighted at the chetnik positions. The  snipers are still firing at the main communications and  crossroads. At 0100 hours sharp, a large-caliber shell landed in  the town center, followed by several explosions on the outskirts  of the town. According to initial reports, some people were  wounded. At 0200 hours, the chetniks on the right bank of the  Drina were still only a few hundred meters from the hospital.  Fahrudin Becic reporting for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and TV  from Gorazde.</p>

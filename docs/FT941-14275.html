			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Britain buys time on HK airport funding: But the project may not be operational much before 2000 Today's vote in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) on extra finance for the colony's HKDollars 160bn (Pounds 14bn) airport will, at best, buy Britain a few months more to agree with China the overall funding of Asia's largest integrated transport plan. The Hong Kong government is asking the finance committee of LegCo to approve an extra HKDollars 1.7bn of government spending on the airport. Of this, HKDollars 377m is for the running costs of the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) until March 1995; HKDollars 1.3bn is for design work and construction of foundations for the airport terminal. If LegCo approves this finance, and it seems it will, the Hong Kong government will have until the summer to agree with China the overall financing for the project, an agreement which would keep alive the hope of finishing the project before the end of British rule in mid-1997. The balance of risk remains on the side of no agreement and that the government will have to admit publicly what most businessmen and government officials are saying in private: that the airport will not become fully operational much before 2000. Companies planning to tender for vital airport services, such as baggage and cargo handling, believe the new airport at Chek Lap Kok will not be fully operational until mid-1998. This prediction assumes the PAA is able to award the franchises for the various services by July this year, and importantly, that China gives its blessing to the franchisees. Potential holders of a franchise are in little doubt as to the importance of China's approval. One senior businessman whose company will be tendering from a franchise said: 'If the PAA awards the franchises without Beijing's approval, all China has to do is say they do not think it a good idea, and the banks will not lend the money. China calls all the shots.' Many in Hong Kong believe the political row between China and Britain over democracy in Hong Kong has made it virtually impossible for China to agree to the Hong Kong government's suggestions on how to finance the project. Some believe China has decided it does not want the British to 'complete' the airport and would rather it be finished a year or so into Chinese sovereignty. Mr Victor Sit, a university professor and adviser to Beijing on the airport, believes officials in China run a personal political risk if they accede to the Hong Kong government's suggestions for financing the airport at this time, when relations are so fraught. 'There is a very serious problem of mistrust, so if they (Beijing officials) let go of the airport issue, there would be more political troubles ..for themselves,' he said recently. British officials hope Mr Sit is wrong. They speculate that between now and when Governor Chris Patten introduces his second political reform bill (probably in early March) there exists a chance for a deal. To test this, Britain requested a meeting of the Anglo-Chinese 'airport committee' earlier this week and indicated it was prepared to make yet another offer on the financing of the airport. Since March 1992, it has made three separate proposals. But the fourth and latest offer may meet China's stated concerns about the level of debt the airport and railway will carry, come July 1997, when responsibility for Hong Kong passes from Britain to China. The Hong Kong government sought to meet Beijing's complaint about debt in its second financial proposal, made public in September 1992. Debt financing for the airport was cut to Dollars HK5.9bn from HKDollars 37bn, while the debt needed to be raised to build the airport railway was cut to HKDollars 17bn from HKDollars 36bn. The 'problem' with this proposal was that about half the Dollars HK50bn increase in equity it envisaged would come from a land fund established for the use of the post-colonial government. China, which wanted more equity, was not prepared to spend its 'own' money to see that end achieved. Beijing, on safer ground, also pointed out that the British had agreed in 1991 that total government debt outstanding at June 1997 should not exceed HKDollars 5bn. The Hong Kong government was still in breach of that agreement as the project's total debt was HKDollars 23bn. Details of the latest financial proposal are not public but it is understood the government is prepared to throw yet more equity at the airport and its connecting railway, meaning a commensurately lower level of debt. There is much resistance within the government to putting more money into the airport, but Hong Kong can afford it. Its coffers are brimming with cash, mainly due to receipts from stamp duty on stock market transactions; a projected deficit of HKDollars 3.5bn in 1993-94 is now expected to be a large surplus. China has yet to respond to the request for another meeting of the airport committee or to the latest financial proposal. Mr Zhang Junsheng, a Chinese official in Hong Kong, lowered official hopes of a positive response when he indicated a meeting of the committee was not in the offing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The committee for international affairs of the  Russian State Duma has expressed concern over the adoption by  the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress of a  resolution in favor of the unilateral lifting of embargo on arms  supplies to Bosnian Muslims.    The statement adopted by the lower chamber of the Russian  parliament notes that such a measure would lead to an escalation  of conflict in southern Yugoslavia [as heard] and undermine the  current peace process. In this situation the committee sees it  as its obligation to reaffirm a recommendation to the president  and the government of the Russian Federation to study the  question of taking practical measures to lift unjustified  sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>

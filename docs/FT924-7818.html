			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: Oppression as the muse - Poetry in performance POETRY seldom impinges upon politics in the western world. This is not so, however, in many other parts of the world; and if there was one theme that recurred over and over again during this year's 10-day Poetry International festival at London's South Bank, it was that of the importance of poetry to writers who have lived and suffered under oppressive regimes and the threat that those in authority believed the writing of poetry to represent. And, related to the problem of writing under duress, was a second theme: what happens to poetry when regimes of that kind disappear. Does it continue to flourish? But first, a few of the harrowing details. Jack Mapanje was imprisoned without trial in Malawi's notorious Mikuyu prison for four years. No charges were laid, though the authorities had, it seems, taken exception to a poem conceived on the day that Sergeant Doe took power in Liberia, and therefore written in criticism of a different regime. No reading or writing was allowed in the prison, though there were three bibles to be shared amongst the 90 detainees. In order to stimulate the mind, Mapanje and his fellow inmates devised indexes - on how many occasions, for example, did a raven manifest itself between the beginning of the book of Genesis and the end of Revelations? This exercise in survival later developed into a remarkable poem entitled 'The Famished Stubborn Ravens of Mikuyu Prison', in which the biblical ravens meld with the crows that used to hammer on the rooftops of the prison each dawn. Mapanje's sombre and dignified reading manner occasionally rose to a pitch of ferocious denunciation - understandably enough. Irina Ratushinskaya, imprisoned without trial in Russia in 1983 for 'anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda' (which meant the writing of poems) resorted to writing on soap with matchsticks. She was released on the eve of the Reyjkavik summit as a gesture of appeasement. Her reading of the poems written during her captivity was remarkable for its lack of querulousness. Delivered without the incantatory ferocity or any of the histrionic gestures that one usually associates with Russian poets, the poems seemed to testify to a new serenity. Had she transcended all that suffering? Or was this merely a remarkable act of emotional containment? The only evidence of pain appeared when she spoke of the difficulty of emigrating from the Motherland. Later that same evening, the short, ebullient Irish poet Brendan Kennelly whipped up a storm by reading from The Book of Judas, a ferocious and often blasphemous denunciation of the backwardness of the Church, the ridiculous, self-serving behaviour of politicians, and of the way that society maltreats its children. Speaking with a gloriously manic, almost hysterical fervour, Kennelly managed to give a good deal of offence to those in the audience who had come to bask in the reflected glory of Ratushinskaya's heroism. And yet who but a fool would not delight in a playful account of James Joyce's dinner with the Holy Family? Miroslav Holub, the leading poet of post-war Czechoslovakia, is also one of the world's most eminent immunologists, and much of the subject matter of his poetry is derived from the practice of science. His poems are sly parables, written in spare language which is almost entirely stripped of adjectives or even metaphors. His speaking manner, too, has a clinical exactitude that helps to point up the humour. His heavily accented English is a marvel to listen to. A sceptical man, he had this to say of life after the 'velvet revolution' of 1989 (embedded in a poem entitled 'The Moth'): 'Freedom makes the moth tremble for ever. That is, 22-hours.' Freedom after communism is a difficult matter - as we were reminded by the four Slovenian poets. The Slovenes are a small nation of two million people, and their language and its literature have lived in the shadow of more powerful neighbours. According to the young poet Ales Debeljak, it is precisely this sense of having been overlooked that has caused the pervasive mood of loneliness and existential anxiety in Slovenian poetry, traits shared by Debeljak himself, whose reading style was emotionless and strangely abstracted. But the poems themselves make a powerful impact when read on the page. English is a multiplicity of tongues, spoken by not a few but a diaspora of peoples. But can it become a universal language for poetry? Not without obliterating the traditional cultures of the people who are often yearning to learn it, according to the English poet James Fenton, who delivered this year's Poetry Book Society lecture. Seldom can a festival of poetry have thrown up such difficult and challenging themes, and that is a measure of its success, leaving aside the fact that approximately 5,000 people listened to almost 50 poets in the space of 10 days. Perhaps poetry is after all beginning its long trek back from the margins of our culture.</p>

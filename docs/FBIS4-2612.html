			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 8 (XINHUA) -- The United States  remains concerned about Russia's biological weapons program and  seeks complete termination of such a program, the State  Department said today.    "The United States has determined that the Russian offensive  biological warfare program inherited from the Soviet Union  violated the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) through at  least March of 1992," State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry  said.    "We've been engaged in an effort to work with the Russian  leadership to ensure complete termination of the illegal  program," McCurry said.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree in April,  1992, to prohibit biological weapons programs. Five months  later, Russia, Britain and the U.S. confirmed in a joint  statement full compliance with the BWC.    McCurry said the status of the Russian biological weapons  program, which included production, weaponization and  stockpiling, "remains a little unclear" to the U.S. and  Washington was engaged with Russia to find out answers to  questions like that.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. EXPECTS TO PAY $30 BILLION TO CLOSE S&amp;LS;  </P> <P> BUSH SEEKS $44 BILLION MORE FOR MERGERS; SKEPTICS CALL PLAN TOO OPTIMISTIC  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, unveiling financial details of its savings and loan  rescue plan, said Tuesday that it expects to spend $30 billion to shut crippled  S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors over the next 10 years.  </P> <P> The plan also calls for additional outlays of $44 billion on "assisted"  mergers, with the government offering substantial financial incentives and  guarantees to persuade outside investors to buy ailing institutions.  </P> <P> However, both figures may be too low, because they don't include enough funds  to dispose of S&amp;Ls that are now solvent but ultimately will become too weak  to survive, experts warned.  </P> <P> "These numbers are understated -- conservatively you can add another $30 billon  or more to the total," warned Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bond Issue Required  </P> <P> The Administration plan, which will be formally presented to Congress today by  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, depends on a bond issue and premiums  collected from savings institutions for the financial rescue.  </P> <P> The total price has been estimated at $126 billion over 10 years. Besides the  outlays to shut insolvent S&amp;Ls and help finance new mergers, the package  includes $52 billion to cover future costs of sales and mergers that have  already been consummated.  </P> <P> Specific details of the plan, including the amount to be spent on future  S&amp;L closures, were issued Tuesday by the Office of Management and Budget.  </P> <P> The Administration plan is directed at 350 insolvent institutions in which  liabilities exceed assets.  </P> <P> Several hundred more may be solvent now, but are weak and unlikely to meet the  tougher capital standards called for by the Bush program. "There are a lot more  basket cases, and that's where I'm questioning whether they have enough money,"  Litan said.  </P> <P> Rising interest rates will drive up the cost of doing business for these weak  institutions because they will be compelled to pay higher rates to attract  deposits.  </P> <P> Although outlays would extend over a decade, the centerpiece of the Bush plan  is a special bond issue to provide federal regulators with funds quickly to  shut down insolvent institutions.  </P> <P> If Congress approves the Bush program, $50 billion in bonds would be sold over  the next three years to provide immediate cash. The balance of the $126 billion  would come from premiums paid by financial institutions and from approximately  $40 billion in taxpayer funds.  </P> <P> However, some experts say the short-range need is greater than $50 billion.  </P> <P> "That is clearly not enough," said Bert Ely, a financial consultant. "They  should have gone for $65 billion. "  </P> <P> The money "doesn't come fast enough," Ely said. More funds will be needed to  close weak institutions that engage in costly rate wars, he said.  </P> <P> Ailing S&amp;Ls commonly offer unusually high rates of interest to attract  deposits, a policy that drives up costs for the rest of the industry, hurting  the healthy S&amp;Ls by forcing them to pay extraordinary rates to stay  competitive.  </P> <P> The federal savings and loan insurance fund, which guarantees deposits up to  $100,000, is currently insolvent. Regulators have been forced to permit many  crippled S&amp;Ls to stay in business because there is not enough money to shut  them down.  </P> <P> Under the Bush plan, regulation of S&amp;Ls is shifting to the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp., which oversees the safety of bank deposits up to $100,000. The  FDIC already is moving to seize control of more than 200 insolvent institutions  while waiting for Congress to act on the Bush plan. The former S&amp;L  regulator, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., will provide personnel  to work under FDIC leadership.  </P> <P> This extraordinary concentration of regulatory power was sharply questioned  Tuesday by Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), chairman of the subcommittee that will  write the S&amp;L rescue legislation.  </P> <P> Annunzio said the FDIC's "current level of supervision over the banks that it  insures is inadequate." In Texas, for example, the FDIC is responsible for 617  banks, but has not examined 73 of those banks since 1985, he said in a  statement on the House floor.  </P> <P> "The FDIC already insures $1.68 trillion in 8,400 banks, and I am concerned  that it is too overextended to take on new work," said Annunzio, who is  chairman of the financial institutions subcommittee of the House Banking  Committee.  </P> <P> "Can a federal banking agency that in the past two years has not conducted . .  . examinations of hundreds of banks under its supervision, " he asked, "be  trusted with additional supervisory authority over thousands" of S&amp;Ls?  </P> <P> Annunzio's subcommittee will conduct a quick investigation of FDIC regulation  of banks. The subcommittee "needs to determine whether the FDIC can handle its  own work, let alone other agencies' work," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said "auditing  firms must share substantial blame for the S&amp;L crisis."  </P> <P> The independent accounting firms failed badly in neglecting to identify bad  loans that were uncollectible, Frederick D. Wolf, assistant comptroller  general, told the committee.  </P></p>

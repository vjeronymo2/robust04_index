			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Post Office chief opposed to minority sale Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, yesterday warned that a minority sale of the corporation's shares would be 'unworkable' and the worst of all possible compromises. A number of Conservative backbenchers opposed to the government's favoured option of floating 51 per cent of the Post Office's shares are pressing for a minority sale to keep the Post Office in the public sector. The MPs, who include Mr Hugh Dykes, Harrow East, and Mr Nicholas Winterton, Macclesfield, cite the example of the Dutch Post Office, which recently sold about 30 per cent of its shares. Mr Cockburn said: 'This would be the worst of all possible compromises. The combination of public-sector control without commercial freedom is not a solution. It would leave the Post Office with disenchanted shareholders and without a base from which to expand.' His warning comes as the Union of Communication Workers said the government had lost its parliamentary majority for privatisation. Union leaders said that as many as 24 backbench Conservative MPs were ready to vote against government proposals to sell 51 per cent of the Post Office. This would be more than enough to defeat its 15-seat majority if all the opposition parties combined against it. Other Conservative backbenchers who have voiced opposition to the government's scheme are Sir Peter Emery, Mrs Ann Winterton, Mr Robert Hicks, Sir David Knox, Mr Stephen Day, Mr Jim Lester and Sir Edward Heath. The UCW said that a further 15 Conservative MPs have written sympathetic letters to concerned constituents, but the union would not reveal their names at this stage. Mr Alan Johnson, the UCW's general secretary, said: 'We are pleased Tory MPs are listening to their constituents' concerns and realising that Post Office privatisation would destroy a cherished institution in British life. People everywhere in constituencies around the country have inundated MPs with letters of protest and this is clearly now having a significant impact.' A poll commissioned from MORI, the independent survey organisation, by the Communication Managers' Association and released yesterday, showed 76 per cent of 350 middle to senior Post Office managers disagreed with the view that the Post Office could be commercially successful only if privatised. As many as 64 per cent opposed the government's plan for the Post Office, with 61 per cent believing it would increase job insecurity and nearly 50 per cent saying that the service to customers would deteriorate. Mr Cockburn, who recently completed a series of road shows to the corporation's top 4,000 managers, said: 'People are naturally worried about change since they do not yet know what the government is going to do. But we are confident that the message is getting out that we either change or decline.'</p>

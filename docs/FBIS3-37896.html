In his opinion, those guidelines should now be translated  into legislative acts and in the steps to be taken by executive  authorities. Then they will really become "actions with  tangible results."    Yakovlev stressed that the putting into effect of the main  guidelines is the task for all branches of authority.  Legislation and its subsequent implementation should be the  next stage.    The presidential address pointed to the absence of  uniformity  in the economic legislation and stressed that "a breakthrough in  providing legal support for the market-oriented reform is  urgently needed."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Knin, 24 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president  of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], today sent a letter to  Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy for the Russian president, in  which he highlighted the issue of the Medak pocket.    Martic warned that six months after the withdrawal of  Croatian forces, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] was still  in control of the area around the villages of Citluk, Divoselo,  and Pocitelj, prohibiting the local population from returning  and banning access to the Krajina militia and authorities.  [passage omitted]    "You have seen that this was one of the most difficult  problems in the negotiations at your embassy in Zagreb, and that  the planned cease-fire agreement was most probably not signed  because of it," Martic underlined, adding that the reference  point in this case should be the line of separation between the  Serb and Croat ethnic communities established by the decision of  the Geneva conference of 23 November 1991.    The RSK president believes that UNPROFOR should not be  allowed to replace the Croatian Army in keeping territories  under occupation -- as is the case with the Medak pocket.    "The Medak pocket must be returned to Krajina and excluded  as  an issue in the negotiations between the Serb and Croat sides,"  Martic said, concluding that, if not, it will not make sense to  continue the talks in Zagreb next Tuesday.</p>

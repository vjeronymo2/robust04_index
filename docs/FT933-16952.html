			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Get 'em young / A look at the motives of big companies which sponsor educational course material Marketing managers looking for a wide audience need look no further than school classrooms. In England and Wales, around 35,000 schools teach 7m children. This fact has not gone unnoticed. Glossy curriculum materials sent to schools in recent months include a history of the tea trade, produced by a consortium of tea companies, a fact-pack on the war in the Atlantic, produced by the Royal Navy, and 'Chance and Change', a guide to mathematics and how it can be applied to personal finances, prepared by Pearl Assurance. Although companies have been providing teaching aids on a limited scale for years, schools have not traditionally been regarded as a fertile ground for promotional activities. But the introduction of the national curriculum over the last few years is beginning to change that. Martin Skelton, of the Ipswich-based educational sponsorship company Fieldwork, gives two reasons for this. First, the curriculum has prescribed what children across the country should study in much more detail than ever before. This makes it easier for companies to prepare material which they can be confident will fit in with children's scheme of work. Second, according to Skelton, the degree of prescription has made teachers keener to embrace anything which varies the standard educational diet. Done well, educational sponsorship works excellently for all concerned. Hard-pressed schools are provided with useful material which helps children, while companies demonstrate their caring credentials. BP Oil UK, which spends around Pounds 500,000 annually on educational material, says: 'The reason it's done is a mixture of concern for BP's overall reputation as a responsible corporate citizen, and a genuine concern for relevant educational development.' The material can also educate tomorrow's customers in ways which might help the companies' products in future (explaining maths, for example, just might make complicated investment products easier to sell) and establish a brand name at the same time. Some companies use it as an aid to recruitment. For example, J Sainsbury, the retailer, produces a series of worksheets about the 'days in the life' of different workers in retailing. The company's policy is: 'We are a major employer, so it's very important for us to have people coming out of the schools system with the sort of skills, abilities and interest in business that we need.' Teachers are alive to the possibilities of corporate help. The Department for Education's figures on school-business links show that 82 per cent of schools accept help from businesses in curriculum development. Responses to a questionnaire sent by Pearl Assurance to all schools which requested its mathematics package found that 77 per cent of schools had found some material from companies very or quite useful. Most of the respondents said that companies did have a role to play. However, Skelton makes it clear that the work has to be done well. 'Our main premise is that any material has to be credible with teachers. Otherwise they will probably throw it in the bin,' he says. This fate is likely to befall teaching aids which include a sprinkling of corporate brand-names. Companies cannot afford to be blatant. Rather, the aim should be simply to be seen to have sponsored the work, according to Skelton. Jackie Miller, deputy general secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers, believes that companies are sailing close to the wind. 'There have always been one or two very poor primary schools which have been terribly grateful for anything they can get. I am not sure they have perceived until now the extent to which it's a barbed hook. Some of the larger schools see precisely what the companies are offering and dislike it.' Any material which arouses that kind of emotion will be counter-productive. The National Consumer Council's guidelines now suggest that all material should be tested in schools before it is distributed, and this is as good an idea for the sponsors as for the educators. Product placement has to be handled sensitively if the material is to be used by teachers. Andrew Miller, research and development director of the University of Warwick's School Curriculum Industry Partnership, points to at least one blatant example which overstepped the mark - Weetabix. Two years ago, Weetabix developed a series of school books, including a history book, in conjunction with the Oxford University Press. The sponsorship was rammed home to children in the illustrations, which depicted all the historical figures it covered as bars of Weetabix, dressed in the appropriate costumes. According to Miller: 'When something strongly branded like Weetabix is used in a subliminal way that's not good practice.' A subtler example comes from Pearl's series of worksheets. They include the question: 'Find out what companies like Pearl do with the money that people pay in so that they can pay out so much more than was invested in the first place?' This is scarcely harmful, but mathematics teachers might be unimpressed. Oil companies are prolific producers of curriculum material, with both Esso and BP providing formidable batteries of support-aids, particularly for science and technology. Both, however, take the opportunity to counter bad publicity about pollution. For example, Esso publishes a pack detailing the clean-up of Alaska following the Exxon Valdez spillage, which some might think dwells disproportionately on how the area has now recovered. This kind of material is valuable, but may fall prey to teachers who disagree with it. Marketing experts say there is little point in designing material 'in-house'. Their advice is that textbooks and worksheets are best compiled by people with educational experience, and tested in classrooms before distribution. Material which passes the stringent tests of both teachers and pupils then has every chance of forming part of an effective marketing strategy.</p>

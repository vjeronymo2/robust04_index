			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Valeo sees Japanese car plant output at 1m in UK VALEO, France's leading producer of car components, yesterday predicted that output at Japanese-owned car plants in Britain could rise to around 1m vehicles annually by the end of the decade. Mr Noel Goutard, chairman, said Nissan, Honda, and Toyota, the three Japanese car makers with assembly plants in the UK, had the capacity to double by the year 2000 their own forecast of around 500,000 vehicles by 1995. This compares with Japanese car makers' forecast for UK production of 300,000 vehicles in 1992. Valeo, which has invested heavily in Britain over the past four years, is aiming to double its UK turnover by 1995, with Japanese car makers providing the main growth in demand. The French group makes security systems, clutches, climate controls and wipers at four UK plants, to which it is about to add a fifth.</p>

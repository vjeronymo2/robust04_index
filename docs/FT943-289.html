			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Stability an imperative after Mexican assassination: Bringing killers to justice will test new president's resolve The scene at the headquarters of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) was sadly familiar. President-elect Ernesto Zedillo, dressed in a black suit, stood next to the coffin of a slain party leader while the crowd that had gathered to mourn chanted 'justice, justice, justice'. Six months ago it was the body of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, a presidential candidate, that lay in state. Justice in his assassination has not yet been served, nor is it likely to be. On Wednesday the assassination victim was Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI secretary-general. Bringing his killers to justice will be one of the first tests of Mr Zedillo's promise of profound reform of Mexico's political and judicial system when he becomes president on December 1. Although Mr Ruiz was a central player in Mr Zedillo's still ambiguous proposal for political reform, it was clear he was taking orders from the president-elect rather than giving them. The Mexican political system has a great reserve of talent and although Mr Ruiz had a flair that will be difficult to replace, he will be replaced nonetheless. Investors seem to believe this and are showing a combination of political understanding and blind faith. After falling nearly 3 per cent on news of the killing, the stock market rebounded, as did the Mexican peso, the latter with apparent heavy central bank help. 'The market is going to shake this off. The foreigners are showing remarkable restraint,' said Mr Timothy Heyman of Baring Securities. But if confidence is to remain high and economic growth to take off, the country cannot afford to hold funeral wakes at PRI headquarters every six months. The morning after the killing, the nation's papers were full of editorials warning that if violence becomes the way of resolving political disputes then the country is in for tough times. Mr Zedillo's advisers say that he understands something must be done to halt the killings, adding that the trauma it produced shows that Mexicans are not yet prepared to take politically motivated violence as the norm. 'If anything, this makes him more committed to reform,' said one party insider at Wednesday evening's memorial ceremony. But he added: 'Zedillo is a tough man, but I'm not sure how many more of these things he can take before his nerves start to fray.' Indeed, the temptation to crack down on, rather than open up, the system may become hard to resist. Most observers believe the PRI was re-elected because voters wanted stability more than change. Some within the ruling party are sure to argue that further reform will only expose the country and the president to more political shocks. If Mr Ruiz's killing was designed to send a message about the dangers of reform - as many are already suggesting - it could be a very effective message. Others, including government officials, are suggesting a different motive for the assassination: drugs. Mr Ruiz's brother, Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu, is Mexico's assistant attorney-general in charge of the anti-drug fight. In recent months Mario has presided over several high-profile crackdowns on the country's two most powerful drug cartels. Two other brothers of Francisco and Mario were killed in an unsolved attack in Guerrero state, where Francisco was governor, a number of years ago. Police arrested a man from Guerrero, named as Hector Resendiz, close to the scene on Wednesday. Government officials said the assailant appeared to be a hit-man as he was carrying an Uzi sub-machinegun. The drug cartels have shown a shocking capacity to undermine and destabilise the country when politicians get in their way. The three most highly publicised, and unresolved, killings of political figures in the past 18 months - of Cardinal Juan Posadas Ocampo in Guadalajara, Mr Colosio and police chief Jose Benitez in Tijuana - have been either officially or unofficially attributed to drug traffickers. Finding the traffickers responsible for the assassination and taking strong action against them would be a convenient way to justify some repression without derailing overall political reform. But it also carries political risks, as well as the threat of more violence. It would mean taking on the drug monster that has penetrated most aspects of Mexican society, including the political system. There is a widespread belief in Mexican society that taking on the drug cartels would also involve taking on certain parts of the PRI and the government. Opening up that Pandora's box would also mean having to improvise political reform. Mr Zedillo has pledged to change the country, but he also wants to stay in control. When the Mexican government announced last week that it would follow a restrictive economic policy during the first year of the Zedillo administration, many took it as a sign that initially the new president was going to concentrate on restoring stability through political reform rather than economic growth. Now stability appears even more imperative. As one foreign observer said: 'If you don't have growth and you don't have stability, then you don't have anything.'</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: TO DRAW MORE, SIMPLY VISIT THE DEEP WELL  </P> <P> Offhand, which would you say were the two worst baseball cities in the National  League in 1990?  </P> <P> If you rate the teams according to attendance by market size, as the Pittsburgh  Press did recently, the answer is New York and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, who outdrew every other National League team in gross attendance  with 2,925,853, ranked 11th in attendance by market size, with 21,248 per  100,000. And the Mets, second in gross attendance with 2,617,300, occupied the  deep cellar with 14,444 per 100,000.  </P> <P> Add attendance: The newspaper's chart showed the Pirates third, with 80,950 per  100,000, behind Cincinnati, with 126,954, and St. Louis, with 101,042.  </P> <P> Baseball fever? Greater Pittsburgh hasn't necessarily caught it. The Pirates  drew only 45,611 for Game 3 of the National League playoffs Monday and 50,461  for Game 4 Tuesday. Capacity for baseball at Three Rivers Stadium is 58,729.  </P> <P> Last add attendance: Pirate General Manager Larry Doughty did his part before  Monday's game. Walking outside the stadium, he saw a young man waiting by one  of the gates.  </P> <P> Doughty asked him what he was waiting for. The man said he was hoping to get in  but couldn't afford a ticket. Doughty handed him a ticket for a third-base box  seat.  </P> <P> Trivia time: What was the only major league game in which every player on one  team finished with the same batting average he had when the game began?  </P> <P> Bad news, so-so news: For Fresno State, what good could possibly come from its  73-18 mauling at the hands of Northern Illinois Saturday?  </P> <P> Maybe the Bulldogs can take solace in a statistic. By surrendering only 73  yards passing, they moved from 11th place to a tie for ninth in the NCAA  Division I-A pass defense ratings.  </P> <P> Of course, the Northern Illinois offense attempted only six passes, completed  four and spent most of its time running the ball for 733 yards.  </P> <P> Throw in the towel: Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser, on the  harassment of Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson in the New England Patriots'  locker room: "Keep Olson out and you discriminate. You break the law.  </P> <P> "And the commissioners of all the major sports won't let that happen -- because  they're all lawyers. They know women will take them to court and beat the pants  off them."  </P> <P> Now it can be told: The Chicago Cubs defeated Philadelphia, 4-3, last  Wednesday, the final day of the season, to tie the Phillies for fourth place in  the National League East.  </P> <P> Afterward, the credit went to the Cubs' manager . . . Andre Dawson.  </P> <P> Manager Don Zimmer said he let his right fielder make all the decisions.  </P> <P> Dawson, sitting at the manager's desk in the clubhouse, said: "I was kidding  around before the game, saying I was going to manage. Zim said, 'Go ahead and  manage.' "  </P> <P> Add Dawson: Said Zimmer: "All I told him was I wanted (Greg) Maddux to win his  15th."  </P> <P> Before Dawson pulled him after eight innings, Maddux (15-15) gave up seven hits  and had a season-high nine strikeouts.  </P> <P> Said Maddux: "I didn't mind coming out after the eighth inning. I was tired and  struggled the final three innings. It would have been silly to stay in."  </P> <P> As any fourth-place manager could tell you.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Bob Feller's opening-day no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox  at Comiskey Park in 1940.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Joe Sroba, agent for San Francisco outfielder Kevin Mitchell, after  Mitchell signed a four-year, $15-million contract extension: "This deal  indicates that major league baseball is healthy, Kevin Mitchell is wealthy and  the Giants are wise."

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / An unwelcome diversion: Ireland's political crisis could hardly have occurred at a more awkward time for the peace process Eleven weeks after the IRA ceasefire, fresh uncertainty has descended on the Northern Ireland peace process, throwing up the possibility of further delays in the political negotiations to end the 25-year-old conflict. On Thursday Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister, was drummed out of office, after allegations that he misled parliament over a controversial extradition case involving a paedophile Catholic priest. The resignation of Mr Reynolds has left Ireland under a caretaker administration, while parliament tries to agree a new coalition. But the absence of a government in Dublin has also left the delicate peace process apparently frozen. The crisis was triggered by opposition to the appointment by Mr Reynolds of Mr Harry Whelehan, a former attorney general, as president of the Irish High Court. Mr Whelehan's former office is facing allegations that it delayed for seven months the extradition of Father Brendan Smyth to face charges in Northern Ireland of child abuse. Mr Whelehan has also been involved in other controversial cases, including the investigation in 1991 into the misuse of official export credits in Ireland's beef scandal. As attorney general, he issued an injunction in the notorious 1992 'X-case' to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim travelling to the UK for an abortion. When Mr Reynolds persisted in making the appointment, the coalition between his Fianna Fail party and Mr Dick Spring's Irish Labour party collapsed after 22 months in office. Mr Reynolds resigned as prime minister before a parliamentary vote of confidence that he would have lost. Mr Whelehan, the cause of the crisis, resigned from his new office. At one point, however, it seemed that the affair might have much more far-reaching consequences. Mr Pat Rabbitte of the Democratic Left, told the Irish parliament of documents that would 'rock the foundations of the state'. Rumours circulated in the Dail, Ireland's parliament, that the head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Cahal Daly, may have intervened on Father Smyth's behalf - a rumour quickly scotched by the Cardinal with good humour. Such was the massive public interest in the drama unfolding in the Dail, even pilots on Aer Lingus flights felt obliged to provide their customers with constant in-flight updates as the government teetered. Dublin's troubles could hardly have occurred at a more awkward time for the peace process. The UK and Irish governments have been locked in talks on the framework document that will form the basis of future talks involving Ulster's principal political parties. Ideally, this would have been finalised before London begins the exploratory talks it has promised to open with Sinn Fein before Christmas. Some disruption to the timetable now seems unavoidable. Agreement between the parties on a new coalition could be days, perhaps weeks away. If the search fails, parliament will be dissolved and the country will have to go to the polls. That would certainly require prolonged negotiations over a new coalition before a government could be formed. It could be into the New Year before the Irish are ready to push the peace process forward. The composition of any new coalition could have wide ramifications for the peace process. All the Irish parties are publicly committed to the process and all have endorsed the Downing Street Declaration that was signed by Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major last December. However, it is widely believed in Dublin that Fianna Fail, a party formed to oppose partition and the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, may be better placed to persuade the hardline republicans of Sinn Fein to go along with a settlement. Mr Reynolds was criticised, even in Dublin, for being over-hasty in embracing the Sinn Fein leaders, greeting Mr Gerry Adams, the party's leader, with a handshake on the steps of Government Buildings less than a week after the IRA ceasefire. However, Mr Reynolds argued that a bold gesture was needed from Dublin to bolster the moderates in the movement. Similar thinking was behind his idea of a cross-party Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which had its third sitting in Dublin Castle yesterday. There are many officials in Dublin who feel it will be difficult in the short term for a new government to achieve the sort of understanding with Sinn Fein that Mr Reynolds and his top advisers enjoyed. Such rapport may be hard to replicate with a government led by Fine Gael, the main opposition party, a conservative party that is identified historically as the pro-1921 treaty party. With Fianna Fail on the opposition benches, Fine Gael might also find it harder to promote the constitutional change that unionists in the North see as a central part of any settlement. Fianna Fail meets today to elect a new leader to succeed Mr Reynolds. The two names put forward so far are those of outgoing finance minister Mr Bertie Ahern and Justice Minister Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn. Under a new leadership, Fianna Fail may be able to form a new coalition with Labour. The policy programme agreed between the two parties as the basis for the coalition that is now dissolved remains to be completed. However the bitter taste of this week's events will not be easily swallowed. The alternative coalition options may be no easier to put together. Fine Gael, the main opposition party, could form a parliamentary majority with Labour and one of the smaller parties. But relations between Mr Spring and Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, are described as frosty. Without an early resolution of the political uncertainty, however, progress on the peace process is likely to be impaired.</p>

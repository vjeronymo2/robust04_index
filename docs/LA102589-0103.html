			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> STARS BEHIND BARS: Zsa Zsa Gabor's trial (A1) recalls another celebrity legal  circus. . . . In 1921, silent film star Bebe Daniels drew a 10-day sentence  after becoming the first woman convicted of speeding in Orange County. Her stay  in the county slammer was less than a hardship, as a local furniture store  delivered a bedroom suite and a band played beneath her window in the evenings.  . . . Daniels displayed something of Gabor's imperial air: "I suppose if you  live in a small town you get like that," she said of the sentencing judge. "I  bet 56.5 m.p.h. sounds awfully fast if you've never driven anything faster than  a plow." Dana Parsons and Rick VanderKnyff  </P></p>

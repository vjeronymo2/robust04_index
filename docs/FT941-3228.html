			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Bus group rages at 'naive OFT' The Office of Fair Trading yesterday ruled that Fife Scottish Omnibuses, a subsidiary of the quoted bus company Stagecoach, had 'preyed on' a rival by registering loss-making commercial services on routes where the other company operated subsidised services. Fife Scottish immediately accused the OFT of naivety and said its report contained 'inaccuracies, half-truths and outright misrepresentation'. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was satisfied that Fife Scottish's behaviour was predatory and that its intention was to displace its rival, Moffat &amp; Williamson, the Fife company which brought the complaint. Fife Scottish said the complaint concerned only six services and that those services had come to an end last August, before the OFT inquiry began. Stagecoach operates subsidiaries in many parts of Britain and its subsidiaries have frequently been subject to investigations by the OFT. Some of these have resulted in the companies giving undertakings to the OFT. Mr Jim Moffat, Fife Scottish's managing director, said he was concerned that 'a supposedly impartial body could come up with such a mish-mash of inaccuracies, half-truths and outright misrepresentation of the facts and background of this case'. He accused the OFT of ignoring what Fife Scottish had told it. 'The naivety of the OFT continues to surprise me and some of the financial reasoning in this report is quite ludicrous in the context of bus operations,' he said. The OFT said last night that the fact that the services complained of no longer operated was immaterial. It would be seeking undertakings from Fife Scottish that it would not register loss-making services on subsidised routes in the future. If it did not receive such undertakings the issue would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It could not comment on Fife Scottish's views on its report. Mr Derek Scott, finance director of Stagecoach, said that the issue was not of material importance either to Stagecoach or to Fife Scottish, which has an annual turnover of Pounds 17m. Moffat &amp; Williamson welcomed the report.</p>

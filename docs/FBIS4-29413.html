			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu Tuesday labeled nuclear weapons and the environment as  critical issues for the world in the coming century.    Scientists widely believe that cultural evolution brought  about material comfort and prosperity while also posing dangers  to human existence, Han said in a speech at the international  media conference on the environment and development.    "As we try to connect this view of natural science to that  of  social science, we will find that they match perfectly at this  juncture, a juncture where the world is struggling to cope with  the end of the Cold War and the conclusion of the Uruguay  Round," said Han.    "The former has pushed forward the nuclear question, whereas  the latter has catapulted the environmental question to the  center stage," the foreign minister said.    "...The dual questions, nuclear weapons and the environment,  have become critical issues for the world and especially for  Korea, which also is arguably the most densely populated country  in the world," said Han.    The foreign minister emphasized the need for regional  cooperation in Northeast Asia, which is "characterized by a high  population concentration and dynamic economic activity."</p>

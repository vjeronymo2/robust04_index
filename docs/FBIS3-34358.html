			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "an official source" at the Standing Committee </F> of the General People's Congress, GPC; date not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] On 4 February, the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  media cited a statement attributed to an official source at the  YSP Central Committee. It was not only the contents of the  statement that aroused our surprise and condemnation. What  aroused our surprise and condemnation was the YSP's exploitation  of the official media to transmit the statement issued by an  official at the YSP Central Committee. This represented party  monopoly over the second channel and Aden radio unprecedented  since 22 May 1990.    While the General People's Congress Standing Committee  regrets this act, it has no choice but to transmit this  explanatory statement to our masses, asserting that it is forced  to do this hoping that the YSP will stop this exploitation.  Furthermore, the official spokesman's statement, which was  embellished with flowery language concerning the document of  pledge and accord, is strong evidence that the YSP views this  document as a card for political propaganda and media deception.  Although we, in the GPC, have always preferred that the  practical implementation of the provisions of this historic  document be the real test through which our people will be aware  of the honest intentions, sound trends, and serious commitments,  we have no choice but to explain the facts to our people without  distortion, as follows:    1. The YSP statement notes that some representatives of the  coalition to the dialogue expressed reservations about the  document when it was signed so as to resort to them when they  discuss the implementation. This shows a clear contradiction  between their agreement on the document and their reservations  about it.    In order to explain matters and to avoid veiled words --  which will only cause fear and worry for citizens when they fail  to understand or comprehend --we, in the GPC, do not hesitate  to acquaint the citizens with what the Standing Committee  spokesman really means. The citizens will then judge what was  issued by the YSP and decide which side is telling the truth,  adopts clearer stands, and is most concerned about this document  which was welcomed by our masses because it is an impregnable  shield that protects the unity, safeguards democracy, and  strengthens popular participation:    On the evening of Monday, 17 January -- that is, less than  24  hours before the signing of the document of pledge and accord --  brother Prime Minister Haydar al-'Attas, representative of the  YSP who was chairing the meetings of the political forces  dialogue in Aden, dropped the following paragraph -- which was  registered as Number two in page 18 of the document, under the  headline "Constitutional Amendments:"    "Unifying the political will and enabling the constitutional  institutions to assume their tasks, exercise their powers, and  implement what was agreed upon in the pledge document."    When the GPC representative in the subcommittee, which was  reviewing the final draft of the document, insisted on keeping  this paragraph, the rest of the committee members supported him.  Despite this, the YSP representative paid no attention to any  opinion in the committee and insisted on canceling it. This  prompted the GPC representative to underscore his reservation  about this behavior in front of all the members of the dialogue  committee. However, the YSP representative insisted on his  stand on the pretext that this issue falls within the powers of  the subcommittee.    In light of this behavior, and after signing the document,  the GPC distributed the following memorandum among the members  of the dialogue committee:    Brother members of the political forces' dialogue committee,  greetings:    The GPC would like to draw your attention to the paragraph  which had been listed on page 18 of the pledge and accord  document until 17 January, when it was unilaterally dropped by  one party to the committee.    That paragraph reads: Unifying the political will and  enabling the constitutional institutions to assume their tasks,  exercise their powers, and implement what was agreed upon in the  pledge document.    That unilateral arbitrary measure proved beyond any doubt  that as far this matter is concerned, all our efforts have been  in vain.    [Signed] The GPC.    That memorandum was described by the YSP statement as a  point  of reservation designed to be used when implementation of the  document is discussed. The GPC is certain that the masses of  our people cannot consider the GPC's adherence to ending the  crisis and all its manifestations as affirmed by its official  memorandum to the members of the political forces' dialogue  committee on 18 January an indication of ill intentions and  noncommitment to implementation of the accord. However, it is  regrettable that the fallacies that have been floated by the YSP  after the signing of the accord document provide the most  conspicuous evidence that the YSP views the document only as a  means to continue the crisis in the face of the citizens'  suffering in terms of a speedy deterioration of their living  standards and the appalling price hikes. Citizens are also  living in fear and anxiety over the destiny of their unity and  the future of their homeland for no reason except that the YSP  considers the demand for the unity of the political leadership,  merging of the state institutions, and the Presidential Council  and cabinet members' assumption of their executive tasks an  inexcusable crime. What commitment does the YSP claim to the  implementation of the pledge and accord document when its  representatives in the political forces' dialogue and the  state's executive authorities refuse to abide by the  stipulations of the Constitution, contrary to the provisions of  the pledge and accord document?    Following the same deceptive tone, the YSP Central Committee  source claimed that the coalition representatives in the  subcommittee and the military and security committee shirked  their responsibilities toward the so-called discussion of the  military and security guarantees. The source also claimed that  the House of Representatives refrained from supporting the  pledge and accord document. We at the GPC have irrefutable  evidence which puts the blame on the YSP and proves the honesty  and soundness of the GPC stand in the subcommittee and the  security committee which was established to enforce the seventh  article of the accord document. However, we will postpone  exposing the falsehood of the YSP Central Committee spokesman's  allegations in this regard and concerning the House of  Representatives' decline to bless the document until the  political forces' dialogue committee concludes its debates on  the stands of the parties represented in the subcommittee. This  is out of the GPC's concern that its uncovering of that  deception and falsification might embarrass the parties to the  political forces' dialogue before they are briefed on all that  has been included in the minutes of the meetings of the  subcommittee and the security committee. Afterward, we will be  free to inform the people of all facts so that they would pass  their judgment away from propaganda, allegations, or statements  that have nothing to do with reality.    The GPC, which has expressed readiness to sign the agreement  anywhere and anytime, regrets those new conditions and demands  that have been set by the YSP, its partner to the coalition,  outside the boundaries of the agreement. The GPC views those  new conditions as a clear attempt to obstruct the signing of the  agreement and to avoid commitment to implementing it. The  consequences and effects of this regrettable stand will further  complicate the crisis and expose the homeland to an unknown  destiny.</p>

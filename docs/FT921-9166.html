			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Japanese machinery orders drop sharply JAPANESE machinery orders, a key leading economic indicator, plunged in December to their lowest level since February 1988, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said yesterday. The sharp decline - 13.9 per cent below a year ago excluding order for ships and from electric power companies - adds to a growing weight of evidence that Japan's economy is slowing sharply. The latest figures will increase pressure on the authorities to cut interest rates. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, none the less said yesterday that further monetary easing was not yet required, and that companies were not facing a squeeze in funding. Mr Mieno said underlying economic activity remained firm. He also poured cold water on ideas put forth by some members of the ruling Liberal Democratic party aimed at hastily propping up the stock market, where prices have slumped for the past two years. Mr Mieno said any such ideas had to take account of the long-term market impact. Private machinery orders for the month came to Y696.4bn (Pounds 3bn), which was 25.6 per cent below November's orders. Machinery orders were 9.4 per cent lower in the last quarter of the year, compared to a year ago. Orders from manufacturing industries were down by 11.2 per cent month-on-month, or by 17.3 per cent compared with a year ago. Non-manufacturing industry orders were down by 33.4 per cent on the month, or 10.6 per cent from December 1990. Mr Robert Feldman, economist at Salomon Brothers Asia, said the sharp decline in non-manufacturing orders was likely to disappoint government officials who had been counting on this sector to hold up the economy. Total machinery orders, from the public and private sectors, were down by 8 per cent compared with a year ago. For the year as a whole, total machinery orders fell by 2.1 per cent, while private machinery orders excluding ships and power equipment were down by 1.4 per cent. The EPA survey indicated an upturn in machinery orders in the first quarter of the year, with private orders excluding ships and power equipment expected to grow by 18.3 per cent compared with the third quarter of 1991.</p>

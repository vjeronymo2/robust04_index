			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Director disqualifications jump by 42% to record THE NUMBER of company directors disqualified last year jumped by 42 per cent to a record, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday. The figures reflect the sharp increase in company failures during the recession, which has led to a growing number of reports from insolvency practitioners and the official receivers' office on the conduct of directors. According to the DTI's latest annual Company Trends report, 651 directors were disqualified in the 12 months to April this year. This compares with 460 in 1991-92. Most took place under the provisions of the 1986 Directors' Disqualification Act. But they still represent a tiny proportion of the total number of cases of corporate failure during the period. The DTI said that the most recent figures typically related to the directors of companies which failed two years ago, because a growing number are now delaying disqualification by fighting their cases in the courts. About 900 disqualification recommendations from the government's Insolvency Service, part of the DTI, are being processed through the courts. There were 446 disqualifications of unfit directors of insolvent companies, and 178 were barred after being convicted of company-related offences. Ministers have approved increases of about 9 per cent in budget and staffing levels within the Insolvency Service, for this year. The increases are designed particularly to strengthen its investigations and disqualification functions. The action followed concerns expressed in the service's annual report last year that maintaining standards was proving difficult at a time when the case load was rising. Mr Phil Wallace, an insolvency partner with accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, said last night: 'The problem is staffing and what the service can handle. They take on only those cases which are pretty blatant.' He stressed that any more aggressive attempts to push for disqualifying more directors had to be balanced against the increased costs which would be levied on creditors if insolvency practitioners needed to spend more time co-operating with investigators. The DTI considered 1,083 requests for investigations, which led to the start of 187 statutory examinations during the year including 16 handled by outside accountants. Eight trials led to the conviction of 19 individuals. Department of Trade and Industry. Companies in 1992-93. HMSO. Pounds 14.50.</p>

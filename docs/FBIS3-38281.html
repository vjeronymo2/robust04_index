			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "D. Gd.": "Leotard Calls Talkative Generals </F> to Order"]    [Text] Defense Minister Leotard wants to avoid the  pronouncement of any controversial statements by French military  officials on the situation in former Yugoslavia. This was  without doubt the purpose of his meeting at the Defense Ministry  yesterday with the "chief commanders" of the Army -- some 20  four- to five-star generals, including General Bertrand de La  Presle, who is to replace General Cot as leader of the  UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] blue helmets in late March.    The Defense Ministry declared yesterday that the aim of this  exceptional meeting was to explain to the military authorities  "under which conditions" General Bertrand de La Presle will  succeed General Cot, the provisions of the latter's mandate, and  why (Francois Leotard -- LIBERATION editor's note) would like  Cot to refrain from talking henceforth.    Although General Cot received [the Ministry's] support on  the  basic points of his criticism of the United Nations, he  nevertheless was firmly instructed to calm down. He has been  forbidden from giving interviews to the French press for a week.  And since the first criticisms by Sarajevo- or Zagreb-based Blue  Helmets of the United Nations one month ago, all French officers  with responsibilities for the former Yugoslavia need a formal  authorization from the Army chief of staff to answer  journalists' questions.    Last week, while strongly criticizing the United Nations,  Francois Leotard said that "flag officers sometimes talk too  much and too often." Thus far, none of France's active flag  officers, the majority of whom concur with General Cot's  analyses, have publicly commented on the subject. But Francois  Leotard probably thinks that prevention is better than a cure.</p>

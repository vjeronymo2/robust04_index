			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Forth Ports turns in Pounds 5.25m FORTH PORTS, the operator of ports in Scotland's Firth of Forth, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.25m in the six months to June 28. The company was floated in March, with 27m ordinary shares being issued at 110p, thereby raising Pounds 33m for the government. Yesterday the shares rose 9p to 176p. Operating profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 5.05m (Pounds 4.79m), which Mr William Thomson. chairman, described as 'very encouraging given the low level of economic activity in the country'. Turnover increased almost 8 per cent to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 15.1m), though Mr Hugh Thompson, chief executive, revealed that tonnage levels of piped and dry cargo had fallen to 9.24m (9.64m) tonnes and 11m (11.3m) tonnes respectively. He said that the 9.24m tonnes was 'the lowest for a long time', but that it would be 'better after 1993'. He explained that the mix of cargo had offset the overall tonnage fall and enthused about prospects for the Braefoot Bay marine terminal, where traffic levels had grown 'with a vengeance', and would expand by a further 50 per cent when its new extension became operational. Group debt was static at Pounds 11m giving gearing of 30 per cent (34 per cent). A flotation condition was that Forth should pay the government the Pounds 8.6m long-term debt it owed it for building lock-gates. Forth has done this earlier than it envisaged - there was a Pounds 9.8m liability in the 1991 balance sheet. The result was a Pounds 1.23m extraordinary credit. The ports division currently accounts for 70 per cent of turnover, with the marine division pitching in about 14 per cent and property about 9 per cent. Earnings were 11.4p (9.5p) per share and the maiden interim dividend is 2p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 (YONHAP) -- The former Soviet Union's  KGB believed back in 1990 that North Korea already secured a  nuclear detonator, the SANKEI SHIMBUN here said in a dispatch  from Moscow on Friday.    Quoting a story appearing in the Friday evening issue of  IZVESTYA, SANKEI said the report filed by KGB to Soviet  leadership in February 1990 said in part, "North Korea already  has its first nuclear detonator and is simply withholding its  test to keep it a secret."    The KGB report said that it had obtained from a reliable  source the information that North Korea was indulging in  research on the production of nuclear weapons in a bid to  maintain a military edge over South Korea and join the group of  nuclear countries.    Explaining about difference between "nuclear detonator" and  "nuclear bomb," IZVESTYA reportedly said the existence of a  nuclear detonator means there are nuclear weapons.    The contents of the report have high credibility as it was  prepared by Col. V.L. Smolinov of 16th department of KGB's  Second General Bureau, IZVESTYA added.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Arts: How the money men invaded our screens - Television Any visiting Martian who last week read the newspapers, listened to the radio, watched television and then took at face value the reactions to the first annual Performance Reviews on commercial television companies by the Independent Television Commission might well be under the impression that a government body had launched a frontal attack on ITV. He would be led to believe that ITV programmes, once the wonder of the world, were now hopeless, which simply confirmed what all right-thinking people had been saying ever since Jewel In The Crown and Brideshead Revisited. Let us recap briefly. Between 1955 and 1992 British commercial television companies were made to behave like public service broadcasters. Then, in the market-obsessed spirit of the 1980s, the government decided to sell the ITV franchises to the highest bidders and swap the old public service body, the IBA, for a 'light touch' authority (the ITC) and let the businessmen get on with it. The Performance Review is the ITC's way of saying whether the businessmen are doing what they said they would. It is an exercise in that modern phenomenon 'compliance', largely devoted to estimating whether, for instance, Granada is doing its duty by Equal Opportunities. Affirmative: 1.6 per cent of the staff are from ethnic minorities and 0.4 per cent are disabled. When it comes to the general performance of the 17 programme licensees, phrases such as 'a successful year' (Central), 'a strong performance' (Channel) and 'a very satisfactory first year' (Ulster) predominate. Just two outfits take a wigging: the breakfast company, GMTV, and the London weekday licensee Carlton. Of Carlton the ITC says: 'The application contained ambitious proposals for network programmes, but only a small number of these were commissioned by the Network Centre for transmission during the year . . . those network programmes which were shown . . . were, with some exceptions, not distinctive or of noticeable high quality.' The fact is that, whereas under the old ITV horse-trading system, a big company such as Thames or Granada could muscle its way on to the national network, in the new setup the national schedule is decided by the Network Centre. So none of the companies can guarantee how much of their material will be networked. Thanks to the government's daft legislation we now have something of a paradox at the centre of commercial television. Having bid vast sums for their franchises, the chief concern of the licencees is to make enough money to pay off those bids plus the government levy and, of course, provide a profit for shareholders. What they are after is consistency: consistent programmes pulling in a consistent audience. Experimentation and idiosyncrasy do not fit in. Meanwhile the ITC is trying to enforce quality thresholds and making value judgments about programme content. As a critic I find myself looking less and less to ITV as a source for interesting new programmes; what we see are safe and increasingly repetitive ratings builders. But this is hardly surprising, as it is an inevitable outcome of the government's legislation. Most nights now there is a big slab of middlebrow, middle-aged, middleweight drama in the middle of ITV's evening: 2 1/2 hours of Taggart (Saturday), 90 minutes of Cadfael (Sunday), two hours of Sharpe (tonight), an hour of Moving Story (tomorrow), an hour of London's Burning (Friday). They are not cheap or badly made, though they are often too long. The opening episode of Cadfael, for instance, with Derek Jacobi playing a medieval detective monk, would have been better with 30 minutes cut out. The tone got perilously close to 'Ho, varlet' (we had 'vile traitors' and 'vile thievery') but it looked good, having been filmed in Hungary. The first episode in Jack Rosenthal's expansion of his one-off drama about removal men, The Chain, into the series Moving Story was also slow but it is obviously going to be character that counts here. Much the most entertaining of the new drama series is Sharpe, a blood and thunder saga of the Peninsular War with Sean Bean playing a rough diamond officer promoted, unusually, from the ranks by Wellington, thus bringing in the favourite sub-text of British television drama: class. With blowzy camp followers, Peter Postlethwaite playing a marvellous scoundrel of a sergeant who keeps whipping off his cap to use it like a telephone to talk to his mother, and yet more ex-Warsaw Pact locations, it makes a refreshing change from policemen in screeching motors. No doubt such entertainment contributes little to the artistic sensibilities of the nation, but what can you expect when politicians decide that ITV should be an electronic whelk stall? They left Channel 4 to carry commercial television's banner for the arts, alternative programme making, minorities and so on, and Channel 4 does that pretty well. As the ITC report rightly proclaims: 'In many programme areas high standards of quality, innovation and distinctiveness were achieved.' On Saturday Channel 4 gave us a splendid evening, providing a live relay of the first performance from Glyndebourne's new opera house, The Marriage Of Figaro, with an excellent documentary during the dinner interval about the creation of the new building: The House That Jack Built. You do still come across the occasional outcrop of high quality on ITV. The Windsors is an example: a four-part series about the British royal family which began last week with Victoria and had fascinating things to say about George V and his children. The royals are the best possible subjects for archivists since their activities have been so assiduously filmed, but the material can still be used well or badly and this looks like an outstanding series. Yet, despite the popularity of the subject matter, the Network Centre has decided not to show it until 10.45pm. That arrangement is the natural outcome of the last lot of political fiddling with television. There is nothing much wrong with Britain's programme makers. The trouble is that those working for ITV find themselves in a system that is concerned more with accountancy and less with programmes.</p>

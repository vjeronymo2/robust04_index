			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 20-STORY TOWER PLANNED;  </P> <P> AGENCY OKS PLANS FOR HIGH-RISE  </P> <P> The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday approved modified plans to speed  traffic circulation around the city's largest proposed high-rise office and  retail development.  </P> <P> Agency members voted 3 to 2 to permit Homart Development Co. of Chicago to  proceed with plans to build a 20-story office and retail development at  Broadway and Brand Boulevard, directly north of the Glendale Galleria. The site  has been vacant for five years.  </P> <P> The developer plans to build a second tower 22 stories high after the first  phase of the project is completed. Construction is tentatively scheduled to  begin early next year, said Barbara Knight, acting redevelopment director.  </P> <P> Agency members Larry Zarian and Ginger Bremberg have consistently voted against  the project on the grounds that the 790,000-square-foot development is 90,000  square feet larger than the city had deemed suitable for the site and that it  will worsen downtown traffic congestion.  </P> <P> In the wake of objections, the developer this week agreed to install additional  traffic turn lanes, restrict the flow of traffic out of a parking garage to  right turns only and update traffic signals at major intersections to allow  protected left turns.  </P> <P> Despite the changes, Zarian and Bremberg still voted against the project.  </P> <P> Homart proposes to build the 20-story tower at the southern end of the block  bounded by Broadway, Brand, Wilson Avenue and Orange Street. A temporary park  will be built on the northern end of the block, where the 22-story tower  eventually will be built. The block now is surrounded by a deteriorating  construction fence.  </P></p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Reed International Although Reed International's full-year figures came as an agreeable surprise to the market yesterday, they were reassuring only up to a point. It is five years since Reed embarked on its grand strategic plan of turning itself into a pure publisher. Shorn of the benefits of its pensions holiday, its earnings per share are now lower in nominal terms than they were then. Granted, the underlying increase of some 10 per cent in second half pre-tax profits is in welcome contrast to the first half fall of 22 per cent. But it remains faintly unsettling that Reed should still be dependent on advertising for more than 40 per cent of its revenue. While its advertising prices have broadly kept pace with inflation in the past couple of years, advertising volume in that time is down nearly 20 per cent. Whatever the merits of the strategy, they evidently do not include immunity from the cycle. Then again, the more cyclical the stock, the greater the potential. This doubtless accounts for the fact that at yesterday's 580p, the shares are on a historic multiple of almost 20 and a yield of only 3.7 per cent. Although Reed is very cautious about the scope for an upturn in its markets, it remains wedded to the theory that the world publishing industry is due for further consolidation. With its relatively strong balance sheet, it is certainly in a position to take advantage of any asset reshuffling still due from the excesses of the late 1980s. The question is perhaps whether, in the post-Maxwell era, the market is ready for another turn on the publishing merry-go-round.</p>

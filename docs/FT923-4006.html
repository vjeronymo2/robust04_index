			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Accbank shows 21% improvement to IPounds 3.6m ACCBANK, the Irish state-owned financial group that is being groomed for privatisation, reported a 21 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 2.9m to IPounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.42m), for the half-year to June 30. Its loan portfolio has grown 25 per cent on a year-on-year basis to IPounds 482m, while total assets have grown 25 per cent to IPounds 741m and deposits by 15 per cent to IPounds 535m, also on an annualised basis. An interim dividend of 1p is declared. Accbank was the first state bank established in Ireland after independence in 1922, being set up to provide long-term credit to the agricultural sector. After heavy losses in 1987, it was reorganised and per-mitted to make loans to the non-agricultural sector of up to 25 per cent of its loan portfolio. This ceiling was achieved by the end of 1991, and new legislation this year lifted all remaining lending restrictions allowing it to diversify. The Ministry of Finance said yesterday: 'Everything is in place for a sale. It's just a matter of finding the right buyer'. Deregulation of the Irish financial sector has resulted in keen interest, particularly from the non-banking Irish financial institutions, in any banking network coming on to the market.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: China Merchants sails smoothly into uncharted waters - Simon Holberton examines the flotation of a mainland Chinese company on the Hong Kong market THE first time that Jiang Bo encountered China Merchants was in 1949 in Shanghai. The People's Liberation Army liberated the city from Nationalist control and he was one of the officials the new communist government sent into the company's then head office to seize its assets. Today, 67-year-old Mr Jiang, a Communist party member since 1944, is China Merchant's managing director and the man who has presided over its expansion from a shipping company to one which owns hotels, three insurance companies, two banks and hundreds of small industrial companies. He is also the man who this week scored a first in the Hong Kong capital market by floating 25 per cent of the equity of a pure Chinese mainland company, Hai Hong Holdings, a producer of marine and industrial paints. The offering was a success. Hai Hong sought less than HKDollars 100m (USDollars 12.9m), but on Monday Hong Kong investors - hungry for any stock that can be described as a 'China play' - stumped up HKDollars 31.2bn to make the issue 373 times oversubscribed. Mr Jiang says it is possible that in the future Hai Hong may become China Merchant's main listed company on the Hong Kong exchange. It will always wish to retain at least 51 per cent of the company, he said, but did not rule out selling its interests in other assets the company now holds privately. The strength of investor interest reinforced the growing importance of Hong Kong as a source of capital for the mainland. Equally importantly, it underlined a significant change of approach to the colony by the mainland establishment. China Merchants, along with the three other 'Heavenly Sisters' - China Resources, Bank of China, and China Travel Service - has been one of the more conservatively-managed mainland companies in Hong Kong, preferring to go about its business with the minimum of fuss. But in keeping with Beijing's 'open door' policy of economic reform and the impending transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China in 1997, the mainland's economic presence in the colony is daily becoming more visible. China Merchants is the mainland's oldest company in Hong Kong. It was founded in 1872 by Li Hung-Chang, a late Qing dynasty reformer, and has always had close ties with the Chinese state. Since 1949, when the communists assumed power in China, it has been under the 'direction' of the Ministry of Communications. The minister of communications is the chairman of the company's board, but China Merchants' operational headquarters is in Hong Kong and, since 1978 when Deng Xiaoping's reforms were inaugurated, its managing director has been given considerable latitude to develop the business. Today, China Merchants employs 40,000 people in 22 wholly-owned subsidiaries and 40 Hong Kong joint ventures, and operates 368 mainly industrial companies, the bulk of which are located in a region of the Shenzhen special economic zone called Shekou. This is a port situated on the Pearl River Delta, which the company owns and operates on behalf of the Ministry of Communications. According to Mr Jiang, the company has assets with a book value of HKDollars 12bn, HKDollars 6bn of debt, and made profits last year of HKDollars 200m. Profits in 1991 were hit by the poor performance of its UK marine insurer, Scottish Lion Insurance. The company also owns a shipping line, called Ming Wah, which made profits of HKDollars 300m in 1991. Ming Wah owns and operates a fleet of ships of 3.5m dead-weight tonnes - the second largest in Hong Kong. The core of its business remains shipping. Last year its ships carried 11 per cent of Hong Kong's trade that went by sea; they also handled 50 per cent of all marine trade by Chinese-invested companies in Hong Kong. China Merchants also operates ship repair and maintenance facilities, and owns docks and container operations in Hong Kong, Shekou and Shenzhen. Earlier this year it paid HKDollars 175m for a 15 per cent share of Modern Terminals Limited - one of the main owner-operators of Hong Kong's container port. 'Because we are under the Ministry of Communications our main business is shipping,' says Mr Jiang. 'But if we have the opportunity we are also prepared to diversify and develop other activities.' Since he became managing director in 1985, the company has bought into banking and insurance and increased the vertical integration of its shipping business by acquiring a ship repair business and warehouses. The company has also done its bit for the economic development of other parts of the mainland by setting up businesses in the Pudong area of Shanghai and in Weihai, Shandong province, and recently acquiring an 18 sq km area of land in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, to develop as a free trade zone. These ventures are part of the 'developmental' role the big mainland companies in Hong Kong are meant to fulfil for China. In Shekou, where the company has funded the ports development and taken slices of 340-odd industrial companies which have set up business there, it is also building a 35km railway to connect the port with the industrialised part of Shenzhen to the west. The company's move into banking and insurance fulfils both the developmental and profit-seeking brief it has been given. Scottish Lion may be a loss-maker today, but China Merchants has plans to set up a branch in Shanghai and, as a mainland-owned company, it should be well placed to take advantage of the liberalisation being planned for China's the insurance market. Similarly in banking. It owns a controlling interest in Hong Kong's Union Bank, and has a joint venture bank on the mainland, China Merchants Bank. Both are small, but the seeds of future growth have been sown. As Mr Jiang said: 'I joined the revolution in 1944 to make China rich and strong.'</p>

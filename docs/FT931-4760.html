			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Sweden urged to end bank crisis AN independent commission set up by the Swedish government has called for a quicker resolution of the country's banking crisis and for further savings of up to SKr70bn (Pounds 6.3bn) to help tackle the country's acute economic difficulties. The commission, led by economist Mr Assar Lindbeck, broadly supported the country's current monetary policy, saying that too swift a lowering of interest rates risked higher inflation and a further weakening of demand. In a report published yesterday, it said: 'The central bank is advised to continue its strategy of a gradual reduction in short-term interest rates, provided there is no dramatic fall in the exchange rate or a dramatic increase in long-term interest rates'. The report was commissioned by Ms Anne Wibble, the finance minister, in December to provide a blueprint for Swedish economic recovery in the wake of the forced currency flotation last November. Mr Lindbeck said top priority should be given to resolving the country's banking crisis. He also suggested Sweden needed to save or raise a further SKr60bn-70bn in the next five years in order to stabilise public debt at 40-50 per cent of GNP by 1998. High long-term unemployment was the most serious threat facing Sweden, but the country needed to get better value out of the SKr90bn allocated to programmes for the jobless. He called for reduced benefits and a shift towards less expensive training programmes. In its list of 113 proposals, the commission also suggested increasing the government's mandate period, cutting the number of MPs, strengthening the budget process and reducing the influence of all types of interest groups. The aim now will be to build consensus through wide-ranging discussions in the coming weeks, with some of the proposals likely to be adopted in the country's supplementary budget next month.</p>

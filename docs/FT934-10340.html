			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: US utility and Cox 'close to' multi-media link SOUTHWESTERN Bell, the regional telecommunications company, and Cox Enterprises, the privately-owned US media group, may be on the verge of forming America's latest multi-media alliance, according to a report yesterday in a Cox-owned newspaper. However, Cox, expressing surprise at the report, said the group had reached no agreement with Southwestern Bell. It was continuing in talks on strategic alliances with a number of telecommunications companies. Southwestern Bell, one of the seven Baby Bell local telephone companies, declined to comment. The Atlanta Journal and Constitution reported that the two companies were expected to announce a definitive agreement near the end of this month. Under the deal, Southwestern Bell would make an investment of over Dollars 1bn in Cox's cable unit. The report comes amid a rush by US local telephone and cable television companies to form alliances in preparation for the growth of an interactive, multi-media home entertainment industry. The biggest alliance so far is the planned takeover of Tele-Communications by telephone group Bell Atlantic for up to Dollars 22bn. Southwestern Bell and Cox are already partners in the UK, where Cox last spring took a 25 per cent stake in cable television and telephone operations owned by Southwestern. They have some 1.1m UK cable homes under franchise. Cox, with US interests including 17 daily newspapers and seven television stations, runs the sixth-largest cable system in the US, with some 1.7m subscribers. Southwestern Bell, based in San Antonio, Texas, provides telecommunications services in Texas and neighbouring states. Early this year it became the first US regional telephone company to enter the cable business when it agreed to buy two systems in suburban Washington, DC, for Dollars 650m. Analysts speculated yesterday Cox might spin its cable systems off into a separate, and possibly public-quoted, company in which Southwestern Bell could invest. This would preserve the private nature of the rest of the group.</p>

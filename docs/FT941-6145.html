			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Ministers expect no council capping Ministers are increasingly confident that the government will not have to limit, or cap, the budgets of any English councils this year. According to provisional Department of the Environment figures, none of the 137 billing authorities for which information has been received is proposing to set a budget above the cap limit. These include Gloucestershire and Harlow, two of the three councils capped last year. The third, Conservative-controlled Castle Point district council in Essex, has not set a budget yet, but will not exceed its capping limit. Ministers expect an increasing proportion of councils to set budgets at their cap limits, rather than below. All 39 English county councils have made their spending plans for next year and only three have not set a budget at the limit imposed by the government. If the government does not need to resort to capping for the first time in recent years, it will enable ministers to claim in the approach to local elections in May that they are exercising increasingly tight controls on local spending. Last year's quota of three capped councils was less than half that of previous years. Neither the Association of District Councils nor the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, whose members include all the English charging authorities, have yet been informed of any councils intending to breach their capping limit. Provisional figures indicate that 35 of the councils that have set budgets so far are proposing to set council taxes lower than last year. That is in line with last week's survey by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy which found that council taxes are rising at less than the rate of inflation. But Dr Linda Murray, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on local government finance, predicted on the basis of county budgets, which have increased by an average of 2.3 per cent, that the average household council tax bill would rise by an average of 6.6 per cent to pay the extra costs. Dr Murray, the leader of Berkshire county council, dismissed the local government finance policy as 'another plank in the government's tax rise policy', and added that the DoE's figures predicted an average rise of 7 per cent.</p>

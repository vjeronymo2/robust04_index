			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Skandia grouping talks falter TALKS ON the creation of a pan-Nordic insurance grouping failed to produce a breakthrough yesterday after an inconclusive meeting in Stockholm between Skandia, the region's largest insurance company, the Norwegian group Uni Storebrand, Denmark's Hafnia, and Pohjola, the Finnish insurance company. Billed as a showdown, yesterday's discussion was the latest stage in what has turned out to be a protracted and tangled affair. In a joint statement, the companies said they had briefed each other on how the talks were progressing and agreed they would not comment further. The uncertainties surrounding Skandia's future started as long ago as October 1990, when Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, acquired a 28.2 per cent share option in the Swedish insurer from the Wallenberg investment companies, Investor and Providentia, with the aim of creating a large banking and insurance giant. In the face of stiff resistance from Skandia's management, SEB accepted defeat last November and sold most of its option to two Nordic insurance companies, Uni Storebrand and Hafnia. They were believed - in alliance with Pohjola, which already had a stake in Skandia, and an unidentified European insurer - to want to build a pan-Nordic insurance conglomerate centred on Skandia. However, November's deal between SEB and the insurance companies failed to settle the matter. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, expressed doubts as to whether a pan-Nordic insurance conglomerate could emerge from this. The power play among the Nordic insurance companies was complicated further by the fact that Skandia already owns a Norwegian subsidiary, Vesta, which poses a severe competitive threat to Uni Storebrand on its home territory.</p>

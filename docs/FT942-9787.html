			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Repsol ahead 11.6% in first term Economic recovery in Spain helped Repsol, the leading domestic energy group, to lift its first-quarter after-tax profits by Pta26.2bn (Dollars 187m) to Pta46.471bn. This was an 11.6 per cent increase compared with the first three months of 1993. Repsol, which is 41 per cent state-owned, said that increases of 1 per cent and of 3 per cent in petrol and in diesel consumption respectively, together with a depreciation of in the peseta and improved margins in its chemical unit, had helped to offset the impact of lower crude prices and reduced fuel demand during a mild winter. The group, which lifted its 1993 net profit by 11.4 per cent to Pta80.1bn, said that it would propose a dividend of Pta115 per share, a 10.6 per cent increase on 1993, to shareholders at the annual meeting in June. The first-quarter results - which were slightly ahead of forecasts - and the increased payout will fuel market interest in a possible international offering of Repsol shares later this year. The government, which is seeking to reduce its public deficit, is considering offering up to 20 per cent of its Repsol equity on the stock markets. Last year, the government raised Pta110bn when it relinquished its majority ownership of the group with a 13 per cent placing of its Repsol equity that was aimed at institutions. Repsol is also expected soon to announce the acquisition of Enagas, the fully state-owned monopoly supplier of industrial gas, by Gas Natural, the big domestic gas distributor in which Repsol has a 45 per cent stake. Repsol, which had hoped to finalise the deal last month, is still smoothing out the final details of the takeover. The acquisition of Enagas will make Repsol the chief shareholder of one of the biggest natural gas companies in Europe.</p>

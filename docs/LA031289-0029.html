We have watched the show religiously (irony intended).  </P> <P> Those cynically inclined might suspect the lady of being in the employ of the  show she attacks. The hilarious show needed more attention than the fledgling  FOX would normally get. Voila, it has found it.  </P> <P> FLOYD A. OLIVER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

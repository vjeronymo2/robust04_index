			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GRETZKY FIRST TO WIN NHL'S MOST VALUABLE TROPHY FOR NINTH TIME  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky of the Kings was named the National Hockey League's most valuable  player Wednesday night, winning the Hart Trophy for a record ninth time.  </P> <P> Gretzky became the first player in NHL history to win the same award nine  times. Bobby Orr won the Norris Trophy as best defenseman eight times.  </P> <P> Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh, who broke Gretzky's eight-year reign as MVP last  season and has won the last two scoring titles, was second in the voting,  conducted by the Professional Hockey Writers Assn. Detroit's Steve Yzerman,  third behind Lemieux and Gretzky in the scoring race, was third.  </P> <P> Gretzky, who led Edmonton to four Stanley Cups in five years, was traded to the  Kings by the Oilers last August in a blockbuster deal. With Gretzky, the Kings  improved by 12 victories and 23 points, finishing second in the Smythe Division  and beating the Oilers in the first round of the playoffs. They also set  attendance records, selling out 24 of 40 regular-season home games.  </P> <P> Gretzky finished the season with 54 goals and 168 points in 78 games and he now  has 1,837 career points, 13 short of the all-time record held by Gordie Howe.  </P> <P> Four members of the Montreal Canadiens, who lost the Stanley Cup to Calgary,  received individual awards. Patrick Roy won the Vezina Trophy as the best  goaltender, defenseman Chris Chelios won the Norris Trophy and Guy Carbonneau  repeated as winner of the Selke Trophy, given to the best defensive forward.  </P> <P> In addition, Montreal's Pat Burns won the Jack Adams Trophy as the league's top  coach, an award voted by the NHL Broadcasters Assn.  </P> <P> Roy led all goaltenders with a 2.47 goals-against average and had a 33-5-6  record as the Canadiens finished first in the league in defense.  </P> <P> Chelios had 15 goals and 58 assists for 73 points, third on the Canadiens in  scoring. Carbonneau, who also had his best offensive season with 26 goals, was  one of the NHL's top penalty-killers and led the Canadiens at plus-37.  </P> <P> Calgary had only one award winner. Joe Mullen captured the Lady Byng Trophy,  given for skillful and gentlemanly play. Mullen had 51 goals and 59 assists for  110 points while taking only 16 minutes in penalties.  </P> <P> Mullen, the 1987 winner, beat out last year's winner, Montreal's Mats Naslund,  and Gretzky, who won in 1980.  </P> <P> Brian Leetch of the New York Rangers won the Calder Trophy as the rookie of the  year. Leetch, who came to the Rangers after serving as captain of the U.S.  Olympic Team, set an NHL record for goals by a rookie defenseman with 23. He  added 48 assists for 71 points, leading all rookies in scoring.  </P> <P> Leetch is the first Ranger to win the award since Steve Vickers in 1973.  </P> <P> Teammate Tony Granato and Vancouver's Trevor Linden also were considered for  the honor.  </P> <P> Bryan Trottier of the New York Islanders won the King Clancy Memorial Award,  given for humanitarian contributions to hockey. The Clancy Award, now in its  second year, was won last year by Calgary's Lanny McDonald.  </P></p>

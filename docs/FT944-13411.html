			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alusaf will consider expansion with conditions Alusaf of South Africa said yesterday it would consider further expansion if the metal's present price recovery was sustained, but only once its Hillside project was up and running, reports Reuters from Johannesburg. The company was due to start bringing on stream an extra 466,000 tonnes of aluminium from mid-1995 at Hillside, but start-up had been brought forward by five months and there was no room to accelerate it further, a company official said as aluminium climbed to a four-year high of more than Dollars 1,800 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. However, if the price recovery was sustained Alusaf would accelerate its long-term plans to upgrade potrooms B and C at its existing Bayside smelter. That could produce an extra 40,000 tonnes of aluminium a year over current annual output of 170,000 tonnes at Bayside.</p>

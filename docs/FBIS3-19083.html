			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Philippe Escande report: "Difficult Birth of Environment </F> Agency"]    [Text] Decided in 1989 and then officially created in  1990, the European Environment Agency still does not have its  own home. Tossed about by political battles which go way beyond  it, so far this modest institution has not had much luck. For  three years, France, although it initiated the project, blocked  any decision on the Agency's headquarters while the future of  the European Parliament in Strasbourg was threatened. The  affair was settled last year and resulted in the selection of  Copenhagen as the final headquarters.    This new Community body, modest in size, correspondently has  an extremely ambitious objective: To finally give the European  Union [EU] the means of pursuing a real environment policy. "In  the absence of any reliable statistics, we cannot say anything  about the state of the environment and respect for the  directives in the different countries of the Union," Ioannis  Paleokrassas, current commissioner for the environment in the  European Commission, admitted. It is still impossible to  compare the quantity of waste consumed, air pollution, or the  quality of water between two Union countries. Indeed, Brussels'  aim is to have a reliable and indisputable tool which enables it  both to prepare future directives on the environment more  efficiently and to monitor their effectiveness on the ground.  <H5>  Independence but Modest Budget </H5>   "The original idea was also to combat ecological  inequalities  by preventing the transfer of polluting activities to less  demanding countries," Jacques Varet, director of research at the  Environment Ministry and first chief of the French Environment  Institute (IFEN), explained. The aim now is to gather, check,  and process data coming from the whole European Union in order  to make them available to Brussels, member states, and the  public (associations or enterprises).    To carry out its task effectively, the Agency will have  around 40 people and a budget of around ECU10 million (ECU9.5  million this year, almost ECU13 million when fully operational).  These are limited means which force it to work through a  network. Correspondents in each country, called "focal points"  in Community jargon, will have the task of collecting these  data. In Germany, the focal point simply will be the big  Federal Environment Agency, whereas France has set up a body  especially devoted to this work -- the IFEN. It is for the  European Agency to harmonize the methods and to compile and  interpret the results. In addition, for specific requests, the  Agency will use thematic centers (which may or may not be focal  points) on specific subjects such as air, water, noise, waste,  or land use.  <H5>  Political Role </H5>   At first, the Agency will mainly work on air and water  quality, natural habitats, and waste. These priorities were all  defined in the Fifth EU Framework Program. Every three years it  will publish a report on the environment, a vast compendium  including all the data harmonized at the European level.  Meanwhile, it will design specific studies, for instance on  acid rain, waste transportation, or the greenhouse effect.    The director of the Agency should be appointed in April.  Then a work program covering several years will be drawn up  before the summer. Officially, this institution will work  completely independently. This is demonstrated by the fact that  its 18-member Administrative Council will comprise in particular  two Commission members, two members appointed by the European  Parliament, one representative from each member state, a  representative from Eurostat (the European statistical body),  and a representative from the Joint Research Centers. This  independence could ultimately engender tension. Although all  states agree on the need to have a data collection tool, many  are worried about seeing this institution transformed into a  censor with the task of pointing out good and bad students  (which are not necessarily those you would expect...) in the  European Union in the sphere of the environment and the  implementation of EU directives.    This is a "political" role which so far the Agency is being  refused, but one which Brussels would like to see it playing.  If it is simply a question of compiling and harmonizing  statistics, was there any need to create a new body when a  powerful tool in this sphere already exists with Eurostat? In  addition, the web-like organization of the network, with focal  points intersected by thematic centers, raises the fear of an  escalation of bureaucracy, for which Brussels is already all too  often criticized.    The Agency, because of this "headquarters battle," comes  rather late, at a time when many of the European directives have  already been adopted or are "in the pipeline" and especially at  a time when the environment no longer has the same influence as  before within the Commission and in the member states. It will  therefore have to prove quickly that, despite its late arrival,  it is still an observation post that is more vital than ever.</p>

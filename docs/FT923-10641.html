			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Observer: Governors under fire What price a bust-up between Australia's central bank and the federal government? One certainly seems on the cards if the opposition Conservatives are elected next year, as looks likely. John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, has just re-appointed trade union boss Bill Kelty to the Reserve Bank board for five years, ignoring opposition claims that Kelty's close relationship with Labor prime minister Paul Keating makes him incapable of making independent judgments. The Conservatives have been unhappy ever since Keating chose one of his old treasury chums, Bernie Fraser, to head the Reserve Bank. The head of Australia's central bank has traditionally been a non-political appointment but Keating's choice of Fraser, which resulted in the early retirement of the bank's able deputy governor, has raised questions about the Reserve Bank's independence. John Hewson, the opposition leader, has stopped short of threatening to fire Fraser and Kelty, but has talked of amending the Reserve Bank Act to increase the bank's independence if he wins the next election. The tensions in Australia are just the latest sign that being a central banker is not as cosy a number as it was once cracked up to be. Mariano Rubio, the governor of the Bank of Spain, stepped down last week. His chances of getting a third term disappeared after the Ibercorp scandal broke. Russia's central bank boss, Georgy Matiukhin, resigned a few weeks ago after he lost the support of the government and parliament. The central bank chiefs in Finland, Poland and Peru have all lost their jobs over the last year and S Venkitaramanan, India's central bank governor, has been under increasing pressure in the wake of the Bombay financial scandal. Political pressures have played a role in unseating all these figures. But few are quite as outspoken as Australia's Bernie Fraser who vowed last year that he would not resign 'just to appease some dickhead minister'.</p>

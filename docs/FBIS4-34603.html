			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper's campaign has just  issued a communique regarding the contents of an audio cassette.  On the tape, a well known Bogota journalist speaks to an  alleged Cali Cartel leader. The conversation speaks of possible  campaign contributions. Part of the communique says:    1. The President-elect talked today with the prosecutor  general to request a swift and efficient investigation of the  facts. Samper gave the prosecuter general's office his campaign  accounting books for a thorough examination.    2. From the very beginning of the presidential campaign, we  warned of the danger of drug trafficking money filtering into  the political process. In response to this, a Code of Ethics  was issued. This Code of Ethics contains a full chapter on  controlling the source of campaign funding and it appoints an  ethical prosecutor.    Former presidential candidate Andres Pastrana will address  this controversial issue during a press conference tomorrow.</p>

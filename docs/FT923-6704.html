			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: Puncturing Thatcherite myths Sir, Well done to Samuel Brittan ('The benefits of lower housing prices', August 20) for puncturing the Thatcherite myths about home ownership. The real value of an asset is the income it could earn, and few houses could fetch 10 per cent gross annual rentals on current valuations. In a rational market, older property would stand at a substantial discount to newer property, since much of it is sub-standard on current building regulations and should be redeveloped; overpricing of tarted-up hovels depresses the market for new building. Site values, as he says, ought to bear a rational relationship to the price of agricultural land - not a multiple of up to 1,500. By these criteria, property prices still have a way to fall, to the benefit of housing standards, the building industry, and new buyers and renters. Samuel Brittan rightly urges special and selective assistance for those conned by the lenders and others in the selling industry and now stranded with substantial debts against equity.

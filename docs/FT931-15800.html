			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Quite what it will do for equal opportunities in the workplace one does not like to think, but Horizon's Cheating Time (BBC 2, 8.00) shows that the day is not far off when it will be commonplace for women employees in their fifties to take maternity leave. Moreover, in this Brave New World, the fecund 50-year-olds of tomorrow could find their own mothers next to them in the maternity ward. There was once an English medieval king who reported he was having nightmares that the peasants were coming to get him. Michael Heseltine's dreams are no doubt haunted by the miners who gave him such a terrible finale to 1992. Tonight's Panorama, The Great Pit Disaster (BBC 1, 9.30), analyses the case for and against closure. First part of The Name of the Room (BBC2, 7.20) unearthed some delightful householders, then patronised them to death with a snooty, pretentious and at times incomprehensible commentary. But this week's presenter is the architectural historian Dan Cruickshank, so things ought to look up.</p>

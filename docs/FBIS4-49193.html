			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with the World Travel and  Tourism Council (WTTC) delegation, headed by Jonathan S. Linen,  vice-chairman of American Express, here today.    Despite the tremendous achievements over the past 15 years  of  reform and opening up, Qian said, China's tourist industry is  still short of experience and needs to learn from countries with  advanced tourist industries.    China is willing to cooperate closely with WTTC, Qian told  the visitors.    WTTC is a non-governmental group, composed of about 70  executives from aviation, hotel and railway industries, aimed at  drawing government support for the tourist industry, sources  here said.    The delegation came here to attend a tourism symposium at  the  invitation of China's National Tourism Administration (NTA).    Briefing Qian on the symposium, Linen said the delegation is  impressed on China's tourist industry development and the  world-class tourist facilities built in a relatively short  period of time.    WTTC Chairman Robert Burns voiced his satisfaction with the  cooperation between WTTC and NTA.    NTA Director Liu Yi attended today's meeting.</p>

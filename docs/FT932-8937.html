			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / More Britons to holiday in Spain SPAIN'S share of the UK package tour market is expected to grow as a result of the peseta devaluation - even though the effect will not feed through to holiday brochure prices until summer 1994. British travel companies say they do not intend to reduce the cost of holidays to Spain this year, but that bookings are likely to increase because UK holidaymakers will now get more spending money for their pounds once they arrive. The prices of the 7.5m UK package holidays sold each year are set well in advance as tour operators buy their foreign currency forward. The pre-devaluation exchange rate will apply for this summer's holiday brochures as well as those for winter 1993-94. Travel agents Thomas Cook said UK bookings to Spain had been rising even before the devaluation. Sales of summer holidays to the Balearic islands are up 18 per cent. Bookings to the Canary Islands have increased 31 per cent and those to mainland Spain have risen 7 per cent. The company added: 'The exchange rate change will result in even heavier bookings as people have that extra confidence that their pound will go further when they get there.' Ms Rosemary Astles, marketing director of Thomson, the UK's biggest travel company, said publicity given to the devaluation in the British press would also encourage bookings. The impact of the devaluation on brochure prices should be more apparent in August when companies announce their summer 1994 programme. Ms Astles said it was too soon to say whether holiday prices would fall. This depended on the exchange rate at the end of the summer and whether Spanish accommodation owners used the devaluation to push up peseta prices. The devaluation of the escudo is likely to have less impact, as Portugal is a small market for UK travel companies. Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, marketing director of travel agents Lunn Poly, says Portugal is likely to be the destination of only 400,000 UK package tourists this year, compared with 2.8m to Spain.</p>

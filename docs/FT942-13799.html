			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (3): Slow response to reforms - Mark Nicholson finds private investment levels disappointing By almost any measure the levels of private investment in Egypt, both foreign and local, are a big disappointment. They are particularly so, given the successful macro-economic stability achieved during the past two and a half years of reforms steered by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. These reforms were designed to create the conditions for robust private investment and job-creating growth. The fact that neither has followed Egypt's remarkable monetary and fiscal achievements proves that such reforms provide only a necessary condition for such growth. Creating an investment environment sufficient for growth rates capable of absorbing Egypt's annual flood of new labour market entrants is, however, proving a complex and intractable task. Economists in Cairo suggest that there is no single easy answer. Economists, bankers, businessmen and investment agencies concur in blaming a raft of reasons, ranging from the psychological to the petty bureaucratic, for the dim showing of private investment. But most people also agree that Egypt is not short of profitable things in which to invest. 'There are certainly far more opportunities here than the attention Egypt is getting,' says Ms Anahid Harrisson, director of the EU-backed European-Egyptian Investment Promotion Programme. Hard numbers on investment levels in Egypt are scarce and official figures, where available, are unreliable guides. One fact, however, is clear: that the decline in public sector investment, which is a concomitant of the IMF-inspired reform programme, has left a gap which is a long way from being filled by the local private sector or foreign investors. A recent International Finance Company report on private investment in developing countries notes that private investment in Egypt was 'considerably below other regional countries', and shows that between 1985 and 1992 gross investment shrank from 26.7 per cent of GDP to 18.2 per cent. Public sector investment almost halved - from 20.5 per cent in 1985 to 10.4 per cent in 1992. Private sector investment edged up to 7.8 per cent over those seven years from 6.1 per cent of GDP. It is difficult accurately to break down private investment between domestic and foreign flows. The General Authority for Investments, which handles the bulk of foreign investment approvals, estimates that 57 per cent of total private investment is domestic, 22 per cent from Arab countries and the remainder from the rest of the world. However, these figures refer only to projects approved rather than actually pursued. The slow response of domestic investors to the increasingly deregulated and stable economy of the past two years is perhaps the biggest disappointment to the advocates of Egypt's drastic reforms. In particular, economists say they have seen little of what they estimate to be tens of billions of dollars worth of Egyptian flight capital - some people put the figure at Dollars 60bn - returning to the country in productive projects. Some money has returned, but bankers say that much of it is invested short-term on local treasury bills, which presently offer a rate of just under 14 per cent. Part of the reason for the lack of response appears to be psychological. 'Many of Egypt's wealthiest potential investors have been badly hurt before by sudden shifts of government policy,' says one Cairo banker. 'These people are unlikely to commit themselves until they are more certain about the government's commitment to the private sector in the country.' In this regard, there is a unanimous feeling among bankers and businessmen that the best signal the government could send such investors - and potential foreign investors - would be vigorous pursuit of its proposed privatisation programme. 'That would clearly send the message that the government's reforms are irreversible,' says an economist. However, there is also unanimity in the view that the glacial pace of privatisation, and the government's shifts and wriggles in pursuing World Bank targets for company and asset sales, has sent precisely the wrong signal. Another reason for the slow pick-up of the local private sector, according to local economists such as Ms Heba Handoussa, head of the World Bank-funded Economic Research Forum in Cairo, is that it is still adjusting to the painful shock of the past two years' reforms. 'To get the private sector to make up for the loss in public investment when demand is down is asking a lot.' Added to the shock of real interest rates (a novelty for the private sector since 1991, after years of negative rates before the IMF-led reforms) are higher fuel and energy prices, tariff cuts, tax reforms and overall price deregulation. All these have made the environment for local business considerably tougher. But even with the present high interest rates - about 7 per cent in real terms - there are a few encouraging signs. Bank claims on the private sector, for instance, are up 19 per cent in 1993 on a year earlier. The modest levels of foreign direct investment in Egypt are possibly more surprising, given the government's macro-economic success - something which, in fellow IMF-reformed countries such as Tunisia and Morocco, has helped spark a substantial rise in foreign interest. Here, too, analysts partly blame psychological factors for Egypt's limited success. One such, clearly, is the negative effect of the past 18 months' rise in Islamic militancy and the attacks on tourist targets. Before these attacks the tourism sector was far and away the most powerful magnet for both local and foreign investment (other than the oil and gas sector, which obeys its own quite distinct rules and has for a long time attracted the bulk of gross inward investment.) New tourism ventures, however, have almost dried up. Another factor is Egypt's reputation for cumbersome bureaucracy. But local businessmen and experienced investors in the country suggest that this is a two-edged sword, and that in any case that Egypt's reputation for red tape is increasingly overstated. The double edge of Egypt's bureaucracy is simply that while such time and paper-consuming barriers to investment exist, they provide something of a shelter behind which greater returns are possible than in more open economies. 'The rates of return here rank among the highest in the world, partly because of the bureaucratic constraints.' says Mr Farouk Nasser, who chairs the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt's investment committee. He says that some of the bigger foreign investors are able to show returns on equity of as much as 40 per cent, once they have mastered the system. Such mastery - which critically requires finding good local counterparts for an investment - is also considered by many of the country's bigger investors to be no more difficult than in other developing markets. In fact, Egypt has considerably streamlined its investment approval system in the past three years and a recent study of European investors in Egypt found 'significant improvement in the investment environment, from both the operational and regulatory perspective, particularly within the last 12 months.' Most foreign investments must be approved by the General Authority for Investment (GAFI). Its director, Mr Mohieddin el-Ghareeb, is at pains to characterise the authority as a provider of investment services rather than a regulatory or approvals body. And increasingly, investment agencies report that this seems to be true, with many investors reportedly happy that they can at least achieve most of the necessary bureaucracy through a single body. Mr el-Ghareeb also claims that investment these days is 'automatically approved' - which is truer than it was since the 'negative list' of sectors, in which investment requires case by case approval, has been trimmed to embrace only military industries, tobacco and investments in Sinai. Nevertheless, the GAFI board meets infrequently, partly because it is chaired by Mr Hosni Mubarak, the president, himself, which means that investors can wait up to eight months to receive final approval for a project. This sort of delay is among the chief complaints made by investment bodies in Egypt. Another is the government's apparent reluctance to sell itself harder to foreign investors and emphasise investment benefits which, according to Mr James Pringle, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, include 'world class, competitive incentives'. Alongside Egypt's chief attractions of cheap labour costs - ranging, for example, from about Dollars 60 a month for semi-skilled labour to Dollars 700 a month for managerial staff - and a 60m local market, these include access to preferential trade agreements with the Gulf, and tax holidays of up to 10 years for investment in prescribed industrial zones. At present, such investment promotion as exists is in the hands of small lobbies such as the American Chamber of Commerce, its German equivalent and the EEIPP, which is soon to be replaced by another EU-backed body. What seems to be lacking is a concerted push from the Egyptian government itself - a push conspicuously present in regional competitors such as Morocco, Tunisia or the Gulf states.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------         CAPITAL OF TOTAL INVESTMENT PROJECTS APPROVED FOR           OPERATION INSIDE THE COUNTRY TO JUNE 30 1993  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 993USDollars 1.00 = LE 3.3859       EPounds bn      %    USDollars bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Egyptians                              12.8        57        3,780 Arabs                                   4.8        22        1,418 Foreigners                              4.6        21        1,359 Total                                  22.2       100        6,202  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Arab Bank, Cairo  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------        PARTICIPATION IN CAPITAL OF TOTAL INVESTMENT PROJECTS           ACCORDING TO MAJOR ARAB COUNTRIES TO 30/6/93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                     EPounds bn      %    USDollars bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Saudi Arabia                           1983        41        585.7 Kuwait                                  788        16        232.7 Libya                                   416         9        122.9 UAE                                  333         7         98.3 Lebanon                                 167         3         49.3 Jordan                                  147         3         43 4 Others                                  966        20        285.3 Total                                  4800       100      1,417.6  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Arab Bank, Cairo  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------      SECTOR BREAKDOWN OF ARAB COUNTRIES'     CAPITAL IN TOTAL INVESTMENT PROJECTS  --------------------------------------------- 30th June 1991 Sector                    Participation %  --------------------------------------------- Finance                        62.6 Industry                       19.8 Services                       12.2 Construction                    3.0 Agriculture                     2.4 Total                           100  --------------------------------------------- Source: Arab Bank, Cairo  ---------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUIN SOCCER TEAM OPENER FRIDAY; TOP SCORER BREAKS LEG  </P> <P> The UCLA men's soccer team won't have Bill Thompson, last year's leading  scorer, in the lineup in its opener Friday at the University of Akron. But the  Bruins will have eight starters and 18 lettermen from last year's 13-5-4 team  that went to the Western Regional playoffs.  </P> <P> Senior forward Thompson, who had 13 goals last season, has a stress fracture in  his right leg and will be out six weeks.  </P> <P> Among returning starters are senior goalkeeper Anton Nistl, who needs six more  shutouts to break the UCLA career record of 30, and three other three-year  lettermen: defender-midfielder Will Steadman, midfielder Steve Black and  forward Chris Roosen . Junior midfielder Ray Fernandez, who had 17 points on  five goals and seven assists and finished as the Bruins' second-best scorer, is  also back.  </P> <P> The Bruins will play Saturday at Cleveland State and open at home at 3 p.m.  Tuesday against Southern California College.  </P> <P> The Pepperdine and UCLA women's volleyball teams will open the regular season  this week, the Waves against USC, ranked 16th nationally, at 7:30 tonight at  Firestone Fieldhouse and the No. 1 Bruins at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Loyola  Marymount. Pepperdine will also play host to No. 14 San Diego State at 8 p.m.  Wednesday.

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICTS' 'SPECIAL TAX' REMAINS INVALID  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court dealt a setback Thursday to school districts in  fast-growing communities, limiting their ability to impose special taxes or  fees on developers to pay the full costs of educational facilities.  </P> <P> The justices, over one dissent, refused to hear a challenge to a ruling last  November by a state Court of Appeal that struck down a voter-approved tax of as  much as $6,300 on each new home built within five districts in the Santa  Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The three-judge appeal court held that the tax was invalid either as a "special  tax" allowed with two-thirds voter approval under Proposition 13 or as a  "development fee" that schools may impose, but only up to $1.50 a square foot  of a new residence.  </P> <P> The panel ruled further that the tax was illegal because it was not imposed  uniformly on residents and property owners throughout the community, but would  be borne only by developers and future residents.  </P> <P> The high court's action, taken in a brief order issued Thursday, means the  appellate ruling becomes binding on trial courts throughout the state. Only  Justice Stanley Mosk voted to review the appellate court decision -- leaving  the matter three votes short of the number required.  </P> <P> The case had drawn wide attention in the wake of a flurry of recent efforts by  local governmental agencies to impose fees on developers to provide for  schools, roads and other facilities required by rapid population growth.  </P> <P> While most school districts in the state had abided by the statutory limit on  developer fees, the effort by the districts in the Santa Clarita Valley to  impose what they called a "special tax" to obtain far more revenue for  long-range educational needs could have led to similar moves throughout  California, lawyers and officials said.  </P> <P> School authorities expressed dismay with the decision, saying it would  eliminate a once-promising avenue of support for districts hard-pressed to meet  growing demands. They noted that the $1.50-a-square-foot limitation on fees  ordinarily would pay only about one-third of the cost of new facilities.  </P> <P> "We are deeply disappointed," said Clayton H. Parker of Santa Ana, one of the  attorneys for the five districts in the case. "If you can't get local funds  with a special tax, there will be no place else to turn to but the state."  </P> <P> William Ingram, president of the California School Boards Assn., said school  authorities from across the state had been hopeful that the appellate court  ruling would be overturned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Back to Drawing Board'  </P> <P> "That would have given us an out," he said. "Now, we're back to the drawing  board."  </P> <P> On another front, Sonoma County Counsel James P. Botz, representing a coalition  of 14 counties that supported the five school districts in the case, voiced  concern that the ruling could encourage legal challenges to a wide range of  voter-approved, post-Proposition 13 special taxes enacted by cities, counties  and special districts.  </P> <P> Botz noted, for example, that under the decision a hotel occupancy tax -- borne  primarily by visitors and not voters -- might face a legal challenge because it  was not uniformly imposed.  </P> <P> "It could really narrow the kind of taxes that local governments can impose  under Proposition 13," he said. "Those kind of taxes are difficult enough to  obtain because they have to be approved by two-thirds of the voters."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minimal Effect  </P> <P> However, Alvin S. Kaufer, a Los Angeles attorney who represented the California  Building Industry Assn. in a suit against the tax at issue in the case, said  the ruling would have minimal impact, affecting only a relatively small number  of school districts that have tried to impose a special revenue measure.  </P> <P> The Court of Appeal opinion, he added, stopped far short of requiring absolute  uniformity in the burdens imposed by a special tax -- and thus may pose little  threat to such measures. There is still room for special taxes to contain  reasonable rate differentials, he said.  </P> <P> "The primary effect will be to retain the status quo," Kaufer said. "If the  decision had gone the other way, there would have been chaos. Residents in any  school, sewer or mosquito-abatement district in the state could go out and tax  new residences in any amount and nothing could be done about it."  </P> <P> The case arose after voters in the Newhall, William S. Hart, Saugus, Castaic  and Sulphur Springs school districts in Los Angeles County approved the special  tax by a two-thirds vote in June, 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raise Costs  </P> <P> Developers filed suit against the tax, voicing fears that the measure would  prohibitively raise costs of new housing. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge  upheld the tax, but last Nov. 29 a state Court of Appeal ruled it was  unconstitutional on several grounds, finding it could not stand either as a  special tax or development fee.  </P> <P> Appellate Justice H. Walter Croskey, joined by Appellate Justices Joan Dempsey  Klein and Armand Arabian, said that without specific legislative authorization,  school districts had no authority to impose special taxes -- and that the tax  at issue was actually a development fee that exceeded allowable limits.  </P> <P> "The characterization of these exactions as special taxes, and their submission  to voters who would not be called upon to pay them, was a poorly disguised and  ineffectual attempt to avoid the statutory limitations to which development  fees are subject," Croskey wrote.  </P> <P> Croskey, one of four appellate justices now under consideration by Gov. George  Deukmejian for appointment to the state Supreme Court, said further that  because the tax was not imposed uniformly on residents, it failed to meet the  requirements of Proposition 13, the property tax reform initiative passed in  1978.  </P> <P> Croskey noted that shortly after the voters in the Santa Clarita Valley  approved the tax on developers, a state law went into effect that allowed  school districts to impose special taxes, but only if they were uniformly  applied.  </P> <P> This year, another law went into effect that places procedural restrictions on  developer fees and requires that their amount be proportional to the effect of  new development.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Steve Padilla contributed to this report.  </P></p>

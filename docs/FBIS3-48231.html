			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom </F> Ranariddh in Kampot Province on 23 January -- recorded]    [Text] Concerning Cambodian territory, as his majesty has  already mentioned, no one can divide it. There must be only one  Cambodian territory within the territorial integrity recognized  since 1962. It is indivisible. However, as all of you know, I  came here on my provincial tour to look at the overall situation  and especially to see if there is potential for boosting our  economy, because up to the present our national budget has  proved to be insufficient if we are to rely only on taxes. The  national income in 1994 is just $280 million and that is not  enough. The tax money will run out soon. The bulk of our  budget comes from international aid. So, if we Cambodians only  rely on taxes and international aid, we will experience great  difficulties one day. As I said, the budget of 1994 is not  sufficient. We need to attract as much foreign investment as  possible.    I and His Excellency Second Prime Minister Hun Sen together  with the government delegation recently visited China. We saw  great prosperity in China. China claims to be a communist state  but in reality it is communist only because it still adorns  itself with red flags. Besides that, there is nothing communist  about China. It is very, very prosperous. For this reason, my  wish is to see our people's living standard improve. We are  poor but we have so much natural resources. We should let  others come in to exploit them. To attract investors into our  country, there must be four main factors, as the Chinese have  just told me.    First, there must be political stability and security. We  could form our royal coalition government because all major  parties listened to the correct advice of our venerated king.  So, we have been united and this has led to a degree of  political stability. As for the Khmer Rouge problem, I have  already said that we must settle it peacefully. However, if the  Khmer Rouge refuse, what can I do? One day the national assembly  and the royal government would blame me, Ranariddh, for that.  But I have tried and I must continue to try.    There is another kind of stability. I would like to take  this opportunity to deal with the important issue of staging  demonstrations. This issue is closely related to human rights.  The government, the constitution strictly stipulates respect  for human rights. At the same time we all recognize that the  Kingdom of Cambodia is a legal state, a state that abides by the  law. Everything must be undertaken within the legal framework.  For example, there is the press law, the law on holding  demonstrations, and the law on staging strikes. These laws are  respected in all developed countries, such as the French  Republic which has professed democracy since 1789, the United  States, and Germany. As far as democracy is concerned, these  countries are very developed. Still, they are under the law.  Having laws does not mean that freedom and human rights are  stunted. Guarantees for democracy and human rights can be made  through laws. Respect for laws guarantees democracy and  legality. Therefore, the people are asked to please be more  understanding. We do not forbid you from staging demonstrations  and strikes. Before reaching the stage of demonstrations and  strikes, however, there are many other solutions. The royal  government is here to help you solve your problems. Moreover,  everything should be made within the legal framework. If we  stray from the legal framework, I am afraid the Khmer Rouge  might take the opportunity to instigate unrest. I am not going  to detail the possible dangers of staging demonstrations, but if  there are some disturbances, what should our authorities, our  royal government do? They would have to react. If this  happens, one thing that you want -- that is, democracy -- will  surely be hurt. So, I beg you to have pity for the nation. It  does not mean that we are not trying to solve these problems for  you. The royal government has the duty and obligation to solve  all kinds of problems.    Second, if there are endless demonstrations, those who want  to invest in our country, and there are many who do, would be  frightened away. The investors have made me understand that  they are most afraid of endless demonstrations in our country.  They do not believe we have achieved political stability. If  we do not have political stability, they will not come to invest  in our country. We would remain poor and then where would we get  the money to improve our lot? Therefore, if we want to have  sufficient schools, hospitals, and medicine and prosperity for  the people, we should make them come in to invest, to open many  factories, and to create as many jobs for our people as  possible. Thus, we must never frighten them away. They are  very afraid of the volatile situation in Cambodia. They are  afraid of the unrest in our society more than the Khmer Rouge.  This is a fact.    Since we are talking about social stability, let us also  mention the issue of contracts with the former State of  Cambodia. If there is perpetual revision of these contracts, no  one will have any trust in the future ones. They have said that  just a few demonstrations were sufficient for us to revise  contracts. I am not saying that we must not improve on them.  We must make arrangements to improve on them, but let us not  give potential investors the feeling of uncertainty about the  future of contracts. Do not make them live in doubt about  whether we are going to revise their contracts. The investors  are most worried about the safety of their investment of  hundreds of millions of dollars.    I also would like to take this opportunity to tell you  about the Olympic market problem. In my capacity as the first  prime minister, I would like to promise that I will do my best  to solve this problem without harming the interests of both the  businessmen and the poor. Nevertheless, to solve problems one  needs to be understanding and compromising. It is not possible  to let one side win 100 percent and another side to lose 100  percent. We cannot permit one side to make excessive profit at  the expense of the other, and vice versa. Statemanship, his  majesty the king told me, is different from demagogy. I am a  statesman and not a demagogue. I would prefer not to compete  with demagogues. I would rather resign. Those who advocate  statesmanship cannot compete with those who advocate demagogy.  The people are asked to please understand that. Our government  is not even three months old yet. That is what China called  political and social stability.    The second factor, according to the Chinese, is cheap labor.  We have plenty of labor in Cambodia. At least 2,000 young  students graduate every year and they have nowhere to go. The  problem is brewing here too. We must find jobs for them. So,  we have plenty of labor and our labor is as cheap, if not  cheaper than China's.    The third factor is real estate. Our land is still cheap  compared to Hong Kong. We can solve this land problem despite  the fact that there are many land speculators. We must correct  this land situation. No one should be allowed to grab land at  will. The state should impound state land. If we do not do  this, we will not have land for foreign investors to come in and  invest their money. This does not mean that we sell land to  them. This does not mean that we Cambodians are less  nationalistic than the likes of Messrs. Deng Xiaoping, Jiang  Zemin, and Li Peng. The Chinese are doing what they are doing  for the common interest of their nation. We must imitate them.  Therefore, I beg those who are occupying land illegally to  please return it to the state so that the state can grant it to  investors for them to build factories on. The brothers who are  living in poverty will then be given land to live elsewhere by  the state and they will have jobs. They will therefore enjoy a  better future.    The fourth factor is profit sharing. Investors should be  given at least a 20 percent profit. That is in China. In our  country a 20 percent profit seems very small because investors  are not certain of their future here. Only when they see that  they might gain more than 20 percent will they invest in our  country. It is simple. We have no money at all and we want  them to come in with their investment money. If they do not  make profits they will not come.    You might want to ask me what our state will get out of it.  The other day, I was told by the Chinese that our state would  get a lot. We would have factories, for one thing. If they  build factories in our country, where will these factories go?  Where will the machinery in these factories go? In 10 years,  15 years, or 20 years they will become ours. And to say that we  have not built them ourselves. We now have no jobs and we are  so miserable but we will have jobs and will be better off.  Workers in Chinese factories are paid much better than state  officials. What I wish to have most is jobs. We will be able  to levy taxes and collect rents. The big profits we will make  will be in 15, 20, or 30-year contracts. A hotel named [words  indistinct] from Hong Kong and America built in Guangdong where  I and His Excellency Hun Sen were staying was under a 50-year  contract with China. The Chinese are not afraid to go into a  50-year contract and will you say that the Chinese are less  patriotic than we are? Not at all. They do virtually  everything for the survival of their nation and for their  economic development. China's economy is the hottest in the  world and I wish Cambodia's is like that.    Just going around saying that we need to take from the rich  and give to the poor is make believe. It is like Zorro in the  movie. You know Zorro with the black mask in the movie. That  kind of economy goes nowhere. So, I would refuse if I am asked  to go into a contest for demagogy. Statesmanship has a  different language from that of demagogy. Four or five years  from now, maybe, it will be alright for us to practice demagogy  for the elections. But now our problems are that we have no  rice to eat and our people have no medicine and no schools.    The same thing can be said of the call for pay raises. I  would like to ask those who have demanded pay raises whether the  budget of our Economy and Finance Ministry can absorb all those  adjustments? We have only $280 million now. When we no longer  get international aid, where will we get the money for the  raises? There can be raises only when our national budget  amounts to $1 billion, $2 billion, or $3 billion and not $280  million as it is now. Where can we get the extra money? [Words  indistinct] but what we need is social and political stability  so that other countries can come in and invest in tourism, where  our ancestors left us with the world's unique wonder of Angkor  Wat; in agriculture such as rubber, of which we can exploit only  50,000 hectares and need to plant an additional 150,000  hectares, and also in new crops. In the past, under Sangklum  Reas Niyum [Sihanouk's pre-1970 ruling party], we exported as  much as 800,000 metric tons of rice. We exported 800,000 metric  tons of rice in 1970. Ironically, we are short of rice now.  Those of you who are patriots are begged to please stay around  the royal government and help it solve the agricultural problem  which is a major issue, an issue of our livelihood. We all must  work to get investments and factories.    As you know, in 1997 Hong Kong will be closed. Many  countries around us want to come here. If we are not careful,  let me tell you, investors will surely flock to Vietnam instead.  Vietnam is enjoying stability and it is badmouthing us by  telling everybody not to come to Cambodia because there are  demonstrations everyday and the Khmer Rouge continue to be  intractable. Why do you want to go to Cambodia, they say. Come  to Vietnam where there are neither demonstrations nor the Khmer  Rouge. Come and invest in Vietnam. In Cambodia you have to pay  30 percent in taxes, but in Vietnam you only pay 10 percent.    I beg all of you to be understanding. Some have claimed that  they cannot sleep. Me too, I cannot sleep at night. We are  poor and we need to find ways to get money. We are getting very  little aid. Do you know that when I went to China, that China  gave us an interest-free loan of only $8 million? That is not  much. Besides that, China only asked us to go into joint  ventures in the PRC. There is neither much bilateral aid nor  much multilateral aid. So, we must seek ways to increase our  own resources so that we will earn important national capital.  In the meantime we must allow other countries to invest here.  As I have said, the main factor needed in our country is  stability.    So, in conclusion I beg of all of you for pity and  understanding. This does not mean that Ranariddh forbids  demonstrations. I would like to stress again and again that so  long as I remain first prime minister of the royal government, I  pledge that I will always respect human rights and your right to  stage demonstrations and strikes. The first thing I ask from  you is that you should stay within the legal framework and  behave yourselves like those in developed, civilized, countries.  The second thing is that you should kindly rely on the royal  government and let it take care of your problems first. You can  stage demonstrations within the legal framework only after it  fails. You should not forget that people are watching us.  Since 23 October 1991, since the general elections, and since  the formation of the royal government and the return of the  constitutional monarchy, as his majesty has said, we have  entered a new era, an era of independence, territorial  integrity, and full sovereignty and an era in which we are  making efforts to develop the nation in all fields. That is  all. I come here with all their excellencies and not just for  rest and recreation at Kep. I have to take a look there because  it is a tourist site we must promote. It is not for tourism  only because I know that China needs coconuts. Their coconut  factories are extremely successful. They are selling coconut  milk all over the world but they need 300 million coconuts every  year. Their Hainan island can produce only 100 million coconuts  and they have to import 200 million from Vietnam. I came here  to see whether Kampot Province could sell coconuts to China.  [applause]    I would like to inform you that Thailand is very successful  in raising shrimp for export. I came here also to see whether  we can be like the Thais. If they can do it, we can do it.  There should not be much difference between us. Thank you.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Court quashes Bond conviction THE long-running Alan Bond show was back on the road yesterday after the Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a fraud conviction against the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur. An emotional Mr Bond was collected by his son John from Wooroloo open prison, near Perth, shortly after the verdict. Fighting back tears he said he was 'very pleased' to be free after 90 days in jail. Mr Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation, was jailed for 2 1/2 years in May after being convicted of acting dishonestly during the ADollars 370m (Pounds 133m) rescue of Mr Laurie Connell's Rothwells merchant bank, five years ago. The charge alleged he persuaded a Perth businessman to contribute to the rescue, while concealing the existence of a ADollars 16m success fee to be paid by Rothwells to Bond Corporation. His release follows fresh evidence given to the appeal court by Mr Maxwell Healy, a former Perth building contractor. Mr Healy said Mr Connell had told him he would lie at Mr Bond's trial to ensure a conviction which would divert attention from his own forthcoming trial on Rothwells related charges. More than 20 people face criminal charges arising from the rescue, which is also the focus of a Western Australian royal commission into allegedly corrupt relationships between state politicians and local businessmen. The appeal court dismissed five other grounds for appeal and Mr Bond was remanded on ADollars 100,000 bail until October 5, when the Perth district court will set a date for a new trial. He also faces three separate regulatory investigations into the activities of Bond Corporation, the group he founded 30 years ago.</p>

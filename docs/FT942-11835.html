			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Anger at fee for Woolmark The International Wool Secretariat, which licenses the textile trademark, the Woolmark, is about to introduce a Pounds 7,000 annual fee for the symbol's use. The IWS has announced that from May 1 next year it will charge spinners, weavers and manufacturers for the use of the Woolmark and Woolblendmark, which assure the presence of a minimum of 60 per cent of new wool. Britain's wool industry has reacted angrily. The Confederation of British Wool Textiles has been critical of the flat-rate fee, which it believes will penalise small producers.</p>

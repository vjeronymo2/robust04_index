			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Awkward questions facing Hanson - Controversy surrounds withdrawal of predator's Pounds 790m takeover bid for RHM THERE WAS an audible sigh of relief from Hanson's shareholders when the Anglo-US conglomerate withdrew from the bidding contest for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK milling, baking and grocery products group. Many institutional shareholders feared that Lord Hanson, the eponymous chairman, would pay over the odds to prevent his former employee, Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, pulling off his recommended Pounds 935m deal. 'Notwithstanding the fact that another deal may have slipped through the good Lord's hands,' said one shareholder, 'he was right not to increase his (Pounds 790m) offer.' Another opined: 'His reputation for not overpaying is more important than his ability to do deals.' Yet Hanson's decision to withdraw from the bidding raises some awkward questions for the group. Regarded as the consummate deal maker of the 1980s it has failed to pull off many of its big deals in the 1990s. Last year's purchase of a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries pushed the chemical group into a much-needed restructuring. But apart from a Pounds 40m profit on selling its stake, it did little for Hanson which suffered one of the most forceful campaigns against a potential predator. After recently pulling back from bidding for Canary Wharf, the financially-troubled property development, Hanson's critics are asking whether the group has lost its touch. Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive, says such criticism is misplaced. 'There are literally hundreds of deals that we have looked at over the past few years which we have pulled back from. The public does not ever hear of these deals.' Mr Bonham draws a comparison between RHM and the failed bid for Powell Duffryn, the distribution and storage group, the first hostile offer that Hanson lost. In January 1985 the group refused to raise its original all paper offer  - which valued Powell Duffryn at Pounds 170m - and thereby lost the bid. 'We would not overpay then and we will not overpay now,' says Mr Bonham. There are, after all, many other potential deals. RHM, however, was not just another deal. Hanson believed it had found the perfect takeover candidate. As one of its advisers put it: 'This was not a case of Lord White (chairman of Hanson Industries) throwing darts at a number of potential targets to see what next to go for. Hanson's acquisition team worked on RHM for months before launching its bid.' The group broke with precedent by taking on outside consultants to look at the baking and grocery products group. LEK, the business consultants, which three years earlier looked at RHM for Sir James Goldsmith, who was then the company's biggest shareholder, tried to see whether Hanson could justify paying more than the 220p a share it originally offered for the company. After an exhaustive search it underlined Lord White's assessment that RHM was not worth more than Hanson's original offer. The failure to win the battle for RHM may tempt the conglomerate to pull off the long awaited Continental deal that it has been promising. Mr Robert Hanson, who was appointed to the board in September with special responsibilities for Europe, believes there are many undervalued and poorly managed conglomerates on the Continent. 'We have already looked at a number of different European companies. It is only a matter of time before we buy a big European group,' he said recently. Yet the Continental deal has been foreshadowed before - by Lord Hanson  - and never materialised. The group's difficulty in making deals in the 1990s was one of the reasons why its new management wanted to show that Hanson was not a rag-bag of businesses held together by the two personalities which founded the group. Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the group's North American arm, first articulared the need for Hanson to concentrate on its core businesses last year. He talked about the need for organic growth and said Hanson should no longer be regarded as a seller and buyer of businesses but as a manager on the lines of BTR, the industrial conglomerate. The message has been well received by some analysts. Earlier this year in the US Goldman Sachs, which in the UK acted for ICI in attacking the group's accounting methods and management, issued a buy note, welcoming Hanson's new strategy for the 1990s. At the time Hanson's p/e ratio was falling and its yield rose significantly above the market average. More recently, County NatWest published a note in the UK recommending that investors switch from BTR into Hanson. It believes Hanson is well placed geographically for an early return to growth (with more than half of its pre-tax profits generated from the US and two-thirds of its UK profits from tobacco). But more importantly it says Hanson's emphasis on organic growth and expansion of core businesses contrasts favourably with BTR's stated intention to make more profits from acquisition and disposal. While this goes some way to addressing the problem Hanson has in pulling off deals, the new strategy only really works in the US, where most of Hanson's core businesses are based. These are Peabody Coal; Cavenham Forests; the aggregates business Beazer USA; Grove Industries, the largest hydraulic crane manufacturer in the world; and SCM Chemicals. In the last six months, Peabody Coal, for example, has made two selective acquisitions: a coal mine and reserves from Southern Ohio Coal and Costain's Australian coal mining business. The UK core businesses, Imperial Tobacco, and building products operations, made up of ARC and London Brick, do not offer the same opportunities for expansion. This was one of the reasons why Mr Bonham was so keen to buy RHM since he believed he could create a new UK core business with the potential for expansion. There is also a further problem with the new strategy. Organic growth, even topped up with relatively small deals such as last year's Pounds 351m recommended takeover of the debt laden Beazer, is not enough to contine the unbroken record of profits growth on the same scale witnessed since Lord Hanson started the business 28 years ago. The group is expected to report the first fall in full year pre-tax profits when it announces its results next month for the year to September 30. Six years ago LEK, on behalf of an independent Imperial Tobacco which was facing a hostile bid from Hanson, produced an analysis of the group's performance which argued that to maintain its rate of growth through acquisition Hanson would have to take over a Pounds 10bn company in 1990. 'At some stage,' Imperial said, 'the music has to stop.' Hanson's supporters in the City are hoping the group will retain its opportunistic edge to prevent it becoming an eventual candidate for an old fashioned Hanson style break-up.</p>

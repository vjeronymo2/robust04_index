			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Utd Friendly action over purchase - Independent expert sought to rule on Acuma buy from Amex United Friendly, the life and general insurance company, has started legal action over its purchase of Acuma, the pension, financial consulting and life insurance company, from American Express. In a summons issued in the High Court last week, United seeks the appointment of an independent expert to rule on how much it should pay Amex for Acuma. United announced last October that it was buying Acuma Financial Products and Acuma. It made a payment on account of Pounds 11.4m in November but in February wrote to Amex saying that it disagreed with the preparation of Acuma's accounts. United now wants Mr David Cade, a partner in Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, nominated for the role by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, to help adjudicate on the final amount it should pay. The two sides have already agreed on the appointment of Mr Duncan Ferguson, an actuary at Bacon &amp; Woodrow, to help resolve other differences. United says that the terms of its deal with Amex allowed for its seeking to alter the final purchase price after it had been sent Acuma's completion accounts and net asset value statement. United's summons states that they were received on January 24. 'The final purchase price for the deal is based on quite a lengthy legal contract and we have been discussing with Amex, effectively over the last six months, the interpretation of those terms,' said Mr John Instance, chief executive of Acuma and a main board director of United. 'We feel that discussions are dragging on and our legal advisers just suggested that the use of a writ was a mechanism to expedite a final agreement,' he said. The summons states that on February 11 United wrote to Acuma Financial Services, an Amex subsidiary and a second defendant, listing its objections to Acuma's accounts. Amex then wrote back but with the two sides unable to reach agreement, United says it is entitled under the original contract to seek the appointment of a chartered accountant to rule on the accounting issues. In particular it wants Mr Cade to adjudicate on two areas of Acuma's balance sheet as of October 31, both relating to the calculation of net asset value. They are total assets less current liabilities, valued by Amex at Pounds 111.6m, and the long term business fund, stated as Pounds 107m. United's main business has been selling life assurance and general insurance to middle and lower income households. However by buying Acuma United gained access to up to 20,000 better-off households. In its annual report for the financial year to December 31 1993 Mr John Rampe, United's chairman, described Acuma as 'the most important strategic development during the year'. Mr Instance said yesterday said the dispute with Amex was not because of new bad debt provision for possible mis-selling of pension plans by Acuma sales staff. 'Acuma was doing things consistent with the rest of the industry. There have been no discoveries of anything we were not aware of before,' he said. Amex said on Friday: 'We are in the process of the reviewing the summons and we have no comment at this time.' Pre-tax profits of United dropped by Pounds 3m to Pounds 20.4m last year mainly due to a decline in motor insurance profits.</p>

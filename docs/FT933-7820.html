			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Observer: Sound advice Whatever else one might think about Lord Goodman, Britain's best known solicitor, it should never be said that he doesn't give value for money. Tucked away in his memoirs (reviewed on the opposite page) is an anecdote about one of the three Boulting brothers, better known as Peter Cotes. Lord Goodman recounts how Cotes went to see him in 1952 to complain about being offered a meagre Pounds 100 to direct a play in the West End which he said was bound to flop. The alternative was to accept 1 1/2 per cent of the box-office takings. Even in your impoverished state, advised Goodman, Pounds 100 is no great sum of money. It would be better to take a sporting risk on the box office. The play is still running and is called The Mousetrap.</p>

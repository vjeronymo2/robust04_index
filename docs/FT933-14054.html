			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / World Trade News: EC delays tariff-cutting talks - Embarrassment for Brussels officials unready to negotiate and accusations of bad faith - in Geneva yesterday as they revealed that they will not be ready to negotiate bilateral tariff-cutting deals until the last week of this month. The EC delay is contrasted with a US decision to begin bilateral tariff negotiations immediately, aimed at paving the way to a worldwide trade liberalising agreement before the end of this year, as part of the Uruguay Round of trade reform negotiations. Negotiators from the other 96 countries involved in multilateralising a widely acclaimed tariff-cutting agreement, reached in Tokyo last week by leading industrial countries at the Group of Seven summit, were perplexed and angered yesterday by European Community delays. The delay is due to an apparent need to carry out a detailed audit of the trade-generating impact of the Tokyo agreement. Responsible commissioners and trade officials say they are unable to meet to complete the audit until July 22. Their embarrassment has been made more acute by the decision by Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to call a top-level meeting of trade negotiators on July 28 to review progress. This will give European Community negotiators just three working days to hold bilateral discussions. 'This is certainly somewhat awkward for us,' an EC official admitted. 'We see the two weeks ahead as a clarification stage, rather than a negotiating stage. 'No real negotiating will be practicable in July.' Following the Tokyo breakthrough, which has raised hopes that a Uruguay Round settlement can be reached in spite of more than two years of often acrimonious delay, negotiators have been under extreme pressure to make significant headway in tabling packages of tariff cuts across manufactures and agriculture, and in opening their markets to trade in service.</p>

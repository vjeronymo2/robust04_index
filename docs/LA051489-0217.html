			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOBILE FREE CLINIC, HEALTH CARE FUNDS  </P> <P> Once again we read (May 3) the news of another part of our health care system  that is suffering from a lack of funds. This time it is the community  development council's mobile free clinic.  </P> <P> America, America, where are our values? We hear and read that health care --  something that is so necessary to the whole community -- must pay for itself in  order to survive. I ask this question: why do the Stealth and B-1 bombers not  have to pay for themselves? Why doesn't the cruise missile pay for itself?  </P> <P> Something is terribly wrong here.  </P> <P> BERNICE RANFORD  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

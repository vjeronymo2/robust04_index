			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer assure that all PPE is maintained in a serviceable condition. This employer responsibility applies whether the PPE is provided by the employer or provided by the employee. One commenter recommended that OSHA include this provision in the final rule (Tr. W2 195). This provision parallels the maintenance requirements of the general industry PPE standards. Specifically, 1910.132(b) also requires that when employees are allowed to provide their own PPE, the employer is still responsible for assuring its proper maintenance. OSHA has recognized that whether or not the employer pays for particular types of PPE that must be worn in the workplace, the employer is responsible for assuring that required PPE is adequately protecting employees from workplace hazards. The only way for the employer to assure that PPE adequately protects employees from workplace hazards is to inspect the PPE and maintain it in the condition that it was intended by the manufacturer. The final rule, in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) (PPE maintenance) and (ii) (PPE inspection), imposes such responsibilities directly on the employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to assure that all PPE is maintained in a serviceable condition, paragraph (d)(1)(ii) requires that the employer assure that all PPE be inspected before initial use during each workshift. This inspection will assist employers in identifying whether any PPE is not functioning properly so that unserviceable equipment can be repaired or replaced. This paragraph also requires that before work is commenced, the employer must repair defects or damage, or replace the PPE. The Agency considers defects and damage to be conditions that detract from the ability of the product to perform its intended function. For example, worn cuffs on leg protection that do not compromise the ability of the leg protection to resist chain-saw cuts, is not a defect or damage within the meaning of this standard. However, a cut of the leg protection and loss of the fibrous material that is used to resist the chain saw would definitely be a defect or damage. When there is a defect or damage, the PPE must be repaired so that the condition no longer affects the serviceability of the item or the item must be replaced before work commences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

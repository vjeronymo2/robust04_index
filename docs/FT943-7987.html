			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Tsingtao Brewery raises exports Tsingtao Brewery, the China beer company that last year became the first mainland enterprise to secure a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, has reported first-half net profits of Yn101.96m (Dollars 11.86m) as increased exports helped offset the rising cost of raw materials. As Tsingtao was only listed in Hong Kong 13 months ago, there is no comparison under Hong Kong accounting standards for the first half of 1993. Under mainland accounting, the net attributable profit rose 63 per cent to Yn112m from Yn68.9m in the same period last year. The reconciliation when reporting the Hong Kong accounts includes Yn2.4m of depreciation on fixed assets and Yn7.71m provisions for bad debts. There were no transfers to reserves or welfare funds from shareholders' profits during the period, as these are taken at the year end. Under Hong Kong accounting, earnings per share came in at Yn0.11. Dividends are only paid at the year-end. Tsingtao produced 170,716 tonnes of beer in the first six months, a year-on-year volume increase of 27 per cent. Foreigners accounted for Dollars 7.2m worth of exports, an 8 per cent rise on last year. Marketing efforts in Europe were spurred by the setting up of the Tsingtao Brewery European Trading Company in France in June. This office will also look at opportunities for producing the beer in French factories. Inflation sent the cost of raw materials up 15 per cent to 20 per cent; the cost of rice over the six months doubled. Exchange rate fluctuations brought good and bad news. Imports of raw materials exceeded exports, so production costs rose and profits were squeezed. To compensate, Tsingtao has increased efforts to expand overseas markets and raise exports and landed a record Dollars 9.65m order at an international trade fair in Guangzhou.</p>

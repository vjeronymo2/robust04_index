			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: SWEB to build Pounds 10m telecoms network SOUTH WESTERN Electricity yesterday announced plans to build a fibre-optic telecommunications network at a cost of at least Pounds 10m. The regional network, to be erected on the company's electricity pylons, will be leased to other telecoms suppliers. SWEB is the third of the 12 privatised regional electricity distribution companies in England and Wales to make a significant investment in the telecoms sector. Since the end of the BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991, many new operators have entered the UK market. The privatised utilities, keen to diversify and with regional infrastructures in place, are showing particular interest. SWEB's plans to have a 250km cable from Bristol to Plymouth installed by next year. Energis, the National Grid's telecoms subsidiary to be launched next year, will be a customer. The initial investment will be Pounds 1.5m. Mr John Seed, SWEB chief executive, said: 'We think we can make money out of it, and are in a position to offer services not just to Energis, but to the cable TV companies and BT and Mercury.' Since it lacks a public telecommunications operator licence, SWEB cannot offer services directly, but only through an operator with a licence. Last month South Wales Electricity launched a Pounds 200m joint venture with International CableTel of the US to build a cable TV and telephone network covering most of urban South Wales. Yorkshire Electricity is engaged in a Pounds 40m joint venture with Kingston Communications, the independent operator in Hull, to provide a regional service. Yorkshire is also a shareholder in Ionica, the independent company planning to launch a national, radio-based telecoms network in 1995. Separately, Yorkshire Water has taken a stake in a joint venture to build a cable network for Yorkshire in partnership with Singapore Telecom and Generale des Eaux, the French diversified services group.</p>

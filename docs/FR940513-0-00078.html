Qualified organization QO3B is a partner with taxable individual TP3B in upper-tier partnership P2B. P2A, P2B, and taxable individual TP2 are partners in lower-tier partnership P1, which owns encumbered real estate. None of QO3A, QO3B, TP3A, TP3B or TP2 has a direct or indirect ownership interest in each other. P2A has been established for the purpose of investing in numerous real estate properties independently of P2B and its partners. P2B has been established for the purpose of investing in numerous real estate properties independently of P2A and its partners. Neither P2A nor P2B has outstanding debt. There is no tax avoidance purpose for the use of the tiered-ownership structure, which is illustrated by the following diagram.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d43 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GraphicsER13MY94.007 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4830&hyph;01&hyph;U <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) The P2A/P1 chain (Chain A) will satisfy the fractions rule if P1 and P2A can demonstrate in a reasonable manner that they satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (k) of this section. The P2B/P1 chain (Chain B) will satisfy the fractions rule if P1 and P2B can demonstrate in a reasonable manner that they satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (k) of this section. To meet its burden, P1 treats P2A and P2B as qualified organizations. Provided that the allocations that may be made by P1 would satisfy the fractions rule if P2A and P2B were direct qualified organization partners in P1, Chain A will satisfy the fractions rule (for the benefit of QO3A) if the allocations that may be made by P2A satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (k) of this section. Similarly, Chain B will satisfy the fractions rule (for the benefit of QO3B) if the allocations that may be made by P2B satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (k) of this section. Under these facts, QO3A does not have to know how income and loss may be allocated by P2B, and QO3B does not have to know how income and loss may be allocated by P2A. QO3A's and QO3B's burden would not change even if TP2 were not a partner in P1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Tiered partnerships_independent chain approach <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . (i) Qualified organization QO3 and taxable corporation TP3 form upper-tier partnership P2. P2 and taxable corporation TP2 form lower-tier partnership P1A. P2 and qualified organization QO2 form lower-tier partnership P1B. P2 has no outstanding debt. P1A and P1B each purchase real property with money contributed by their respective partners and with borrowed money. Each partnership's real property is completely unrelated to the real property owned by the other partnership. P1B's allocations do not satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (k) of this section because of allocations that may be made to QO2. However, if P2's interest in P1B were completely disregarded, the P2/P1A chain would satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (k) of this section. There is no tax avoidance purpose for the use of the tiered-ownership structure, which is illustrated by the following diagram.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d82 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GraphicsER13MY94.008 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4830&hyph;01&hyph;U <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) P2 satisfies the fractions rule with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the P2/P1A chain, but only if the P2 partnership agreement allocates those items allocated to P2 by P1A separately from those items allocated to P2 by P1B. For this purpose, allocations of items of income or gain that may be made pursuant to a provision in the partnership agreement that charges back minimum gain, are taken into account for purposes of the fractions rule only to the extent an allocation is made. See paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section. P2 does not satisfy the fractions rule with respect to the P2/P1B chain.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (n)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

For this purpose, paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section will be treated as satisfied with respect to partnership agreements entered into on or before May 13, 1994, property acquired by partnerships on or before May 13, 1994, and partnership interests acquired by qualified organizations on or before May 13, 1994, if the guidance set forth in (paragraphs (a) through (m) of &sect;1.514(c)&hyph;2 of) PS&hyph;56&hyph;90, published at 1993&hyph;5 I.R.B. 42, February 1, 1993, is satisfied.

To satisfy the requirements of section 514(c)(9)(E) with respect to partnership agreements entered into after June 24, 1990, property acquired by partnerships after June 24, 1990, and partnership interests acquired by qualified organizations after June 24, 1990, (other than a partnership interest that at all times after October 13, 1987, and prior to the acquisition was held by a qualified organization) to which paragraph (n)(2) of this section does not apply, paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section must be satisfied as of the first day that section 514(c)(9)(E) applies with respect to the partnership, property, or acquired interest. For this purpose, paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section will be treated as satisfied if the guidance in sections I through VI of Notice 90&hyph;41, 90&hyph;1 C.B. 350, (see &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this chapter) has been followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Periods prior to the issuance of Notice 90&hyph;41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

A reasonable interpretation includes an interpretation that substantially follows the guidance in either sections I through VI of Notice 90&hyph;41, (see &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this chapter) or paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Material modifications to partnership agreements.

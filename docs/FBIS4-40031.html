			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. Buchinskiy under the rubric "Barometer of the </F> Week": "The Key to the Gates of the Crimea"]    [Text] The noisy "sorting out" between Kiev and Simferopol  remind one of a phenomenon of the recent past when the stupid  wife tried as hard as she could to keep her husband not with  charm but with the help of the party organization. But be that  as it may, the past seven days have essentially been an  international "Crimea week." On all continents and in all  languages of the planet people have written about it, spoken  about it, and waited for the appearance of another hot spot on  the map. They waited with such impatience that it would seem  that the ones that already have existed and still exist are not  enough for mankind. Probably only vampires wait for blood this  way. But here is what I wonder: In our malice and mindlessness  have we really become like these bloodsuckers? But these  "certain forces" that are interested in bloodshed and always  remain unseen--who are they? Where are they? In Kiev or Lvov,  "overseas" or in the sparse growth of trees beyond a nearby  knoll in the Crimea itself? Who can tell us about this? One  thing is unquestionable: They exist. Just as the stern young  Philistine exists, the one who is ready to kill his compatriots  for dollars. He did this in the Dniester region, Abkhazia, and  Georgia. He is doing this professionally today in Armenia and  Azerbaijan. Killing is his work, a bloody craft. He is a  mercenary. For those same interested "certain forces" who,  having given him a Kalashnikov automatic rifle and a cartridge  pouch to go with it, paid generously for murder while they  themselves remain in the shadows. Who is doing this? Perhaps a  bold journalist? I wrote about this and I shudder to think  about our colleagues in journalism who unthinkingly and in the  service of these same interested "certain forces" select words  like matches and help them to kindle the fire in their own home,  on the threshold of the homeland.    I recall several weeks ago when our newly elected parliament  had not yet begun to work and there was no discussion of  returning to the 1992 Constitution, but in a Moscow newspaper  that was once popular among the people there already appeared a  matchstick-report under the heading "War in Crimea--and  Everything Is Up in Smoke." That is how it is, and nothing less!  It was all about the president of Ukraine overturning one of the  first edicts of the president of Crimea. Let us make noise,  brothers, let us make noise.... The Russian press, writes V.  Popova, a Moscow journalist, in GOLOS UKRAINY for 31 May 1994,  from time to time reports "on tanks that have arrived in Crimea,  field hospitals that are prepared for receiving wounded from the  `Crimean front,' tens of thousands of international guards who  are right on the verge of storming the state institutions of  Simferopol. There is no doubt that somebody is skillfully  orchestrating and directing this campaign. But who and in the  name of what?"    Enough, colleagues. It is time for honor. It is unbecoming  for us to be like the extreme right-wing nationalists in Ukraine  who, in the words of the representative of the Ukrainian  National Assembly, Oleg Vitovich, are already forming  "recreation groups" who will actively propagandize Ukrainian  statehood in the Crimea. (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 26 May 1994)  This popular newspaper previously in two issues noted, fairly,  in my view, that President Yu. Meshkov is not likely to want  war. The head of the government, Ye. Saburov, and his Moscow  team do not need war either...to what has been said one can add  without exaggeration: The same thing applies to the newly  elected parliament and all of us Crimeans!    Fortunately, the smell of gunpowder, iodine, and blood comes  only from the pages of certain newspapers and also television  programs. But in the Crimea it is a nice summer. Students and  school children are taking exams. The cherries are ripening in  the sun and the grain is ripening in the fields. Last Sunday was  a holiday--Simferopol was 210 years old. There was dancing and  music, and people went walking in all the parks and on the  streets of the city, and there were colorful festive fireworks.  This is the truth. This is reality. And all the talk about war  in the Crimea or its fatal inevitability is a bluff, an idle  fabrication.    In essence there is no conflict between Kiev and  Simferopol. It was invented on the banks of the  Dnieper-Slavutich by the high leaders of the Ukrainian  independent and autonomous Ukraine. They saw in the aspiration  of the Crimeans for a little more independence and freedom than  they have now the right to decide for themselves what to do to  live better, the beginning of the long ripening schism in the  unitary state of Ukraine. And this terrifies them. They are as  afraid of this as they can be. Hence, the "war" of presidential  laws, the desire to "set them straight," to put Crimean  President Yu. Meshkov and the new parliament of the Republic of  Crimea in their places. This could be the only motivation for L.  Kravchuk's demand for the parliament of Ukraine to grant him  additional authority to impose order in the Crimea and create a  Constitutional Court. And now Rukh has also demanded that Leonid  Makarovich eliminate the parliament and the institution of the  presidency in the Crimea and introduce direct presidential rule.  All this occurred last week. Fortunately, the period when Leonid  Makarovich was dancing to the fiddle and tambourines of the Lvov  directors has passed and he made no abrupt moves. Now the  commissions of the Supreme Councils of Ukraine and Crimea are  seeking a consensus. They will find it if they take advantage of  the experience of relations between Russia and Tatarstan, where  President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin visited last  week. A half year ago they were faced with a situation there,  which was identical to the current relations between Ukraine and  Crimea. Thus, there was a bitter war of laws between the  presidents. It continued until B. Yeltsin understood that it was  pointless to wage it and proceeded to a compromise--treaty  relations between Russia and Tatarstan. The treaty became the  key to political stabilization. Here is what ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA  wrote about it in a report on B. Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan in  the issue for 3 June 1994: "Far-sighted politicians like the  president of Tatarstan, Mintimer Shaymiyev, have understood that  discussions of separatism and national independence helped them  to come to power but by no means allow them stay at the helm  since people are not fed on political ambitions and you cannot  advance the economy with them." The treaty between Russia and  Tatarstan, the newspaper continues, was a consequence of a  recognized necessity.    Publishing a detailed discussion of the favorable changes  that have occurred literally in a couple of months (the treaty  was signed in February), the newspaper notes in particular that  "Tatarstan has changed from a region which almost frightened  children into one of the most peaceful republics for the life of  people of various nationalities."    The model of the relations between the Center of Russia and  Tatarstan is now being studied in Moscow as valuable experience  and is regarded as a possible universal golden key which will  open the doors to a constructive national and regional policy.    Perhaps there is a reason why Kiev is trying to use a  similar  key to open the gates of the Crimea and not resort to breaking  and entering or looking for the key in the old trunks left over  from Mazepa's times. Think, lads, apply yourselves.</p>

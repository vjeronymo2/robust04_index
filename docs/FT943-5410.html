			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Books: Deep into the heart of Greeneland - The chronicler of 20th century man's consciousness is the subject of four new literary biographies Asked about his chances of winning the Nobel Prize, Graham Greene replied that he was looking forward to a much bigger prize: death. He thought himself 'not a bad writer,' but he would have liked 'to be mentioned with the truly great, who all seem to belong to the 19th century.' In the years since he died in 1991, it has become clear that Greene does fit in the company of the truly great. What Dickens was for the 19th, Greene is for the 20th century: the only serious literary writer to enjoy a mass audience. Like Dickens, his genius was to take a popular fictional form - the thriller, and, in books from Brighton Rock and The Power and the Glory to The Third Man and Monsignor Quixote, to turn that form into a serious work without losing its widespread appeal. His finger was always on the popular pulse and, as we now look to Dickens to understand the Victorians, so Greene's themes speak for our century: angst and neuroses, a fascination with evil, intellectual and spiritual doubt, cruelty and persecution. Nothing fixes Greene as a figure for our time better than his new role as star of that late 20th century blockbuster genre, the literary biography. In the last six weeks, three rival biographies of Greene have appeared, with a fourth due this month. The best of them, volume two of Norman Sherry's authorised Life (Cape Pounds 20), covering the years 1939-55, shows how biography has become today's equivalent of the Victorian triple-decker novel: long, leisured, heavyweight; intimate in its discussions of its hero's most raw emotions. David Copperfield, Jane Eyre, Jude the Obscure are all fictional biographies or autobiographies. In a post-modern age we have become too embarrassed and cynical to invent such lives, but reading about them is deeply satisfying and publishing them lucrative. Literary biography, therefore, which dovetails fact with fiction by showing how one fed the other, has taken the place of the Victorian fictional bestseller. And just as David Copperfield or Jude the Obscure distilled Victorian dilemmas about faith and morality, so the contemporary biography focuses on subjects, like Greene, who give voice to our own passions and problems. The new works on Greene are vastly different. Sherry's is sympathetic and full of insight, Michael Sheldon's Graham Greene: The Man Within (Heinemann Pounds 20) is critical and carping, while Anthony Mockler's Graham Greene: Three Lives ('Novelist] Explorer] Spy]') is ignorant and barely literate. The three books share, however, some uniquely anglo-saxon obsessions. Class, sex, sin and the relationship between them flood over almost every page. Since Greene, born in 1904, spans our century, this offers too a panorama of a changing England. Greene's experiences illuminate key phases in English history - the Blitz; the Cold War spy ring centred on Philby; the postwar waning of aristocratic families and their homes, with which Greene was intoxicated. The heart of these matters, for Sherry and Sheldon, is Greene's affair with Catherine Walston, the beautiful, Catholic, promiscuous wife of an English lord. She was the model for Sarah in The End of the Affair, and a crucial influence on work such as The Third Man and The Quiet American in Greene's rich middle period. Sheldon recounts the affair as if in a school report, with Greene failing every test - immoral in seducing Catherine, pathetic in failing to tempt her away from her husband, depressive and dully middle-class because he cannot chum up with her posh friends. Sherry, by contrast, describes in bitter-sweet prose a liaison reminiscent of Brideshead Revisited. Greene is the shy bourgeois artist who finds his identity through Catherine, struggles between desire and Catholic sacrifice and revels in the world of private jets and pheasant for breakfast. As a classic of English class fantasy, this is compelling - when the BBC made a film on Greene last year, producer Anthony Wall said the programme was 'a story about British toffs, the like of whom we'll never see again.' What raises it to the level of contemporary myth is the existential torment underlying the affair. Life 'on the dangerous edge of things'; the reluctance to accept love, faith, political ideologies; the desperate escapism: Sherry's Greene has the tortured inner life of his heroes, from the haunted, hunted whisky priest in The Power and the Glory in the 1930s to the suicide Scobie in The Heart of the Matter to baffled Monsignor Quixote in the 1980s. 'I had to find religion, to measure my evil against,' Greene said. It is the Manichean vision, grafted onto the thriller, that gives intellectual excitement and psychological resonance to his novels. Of the great writers, he is the one for whom content and ideas are all, while form and style hardly count. Among famous openings, compare, for example, that of Brighton Rock - 'Hale knew, before he had been in Brighton three hours, that they meant to murder him' - with those of the two other modern classics of adolescence, Lolita ('Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-li-ta: the tip of the tongue, taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth.') And Catcher in the Rye: ('If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like . . . and all that David Copperfield kind of crap.') Unlike Nabokov and Salinger, Greene is not a consciously literary writer and his cold, flat drawing of Pinkie and Ida therefore translates easily. 'A polyglot could read Mr Greene,' wrote Evelyn Waugh, 'lay him aside, retain a sharp memory of all he said and yet . . . entirely forget what tongue he was using.' Greene believed the 'splinter of ice' in his heart gave him the necessary novelist's detachment. But reading Sherry's biography, it seems as if the reverse may have been true - that Greene wrote to strip away his own coldness, to make-believe feelings he could never wholly embrace. His glacial quality, both in life - Sheldon exults in his unsympathetic responses during the Blitz, and in his frosty relationships - and in fiction, puts some readers off. Yet it is a feature, along with the almost deliberate absence of style, which makes his novels quintessentially of our post-modern, anything-goes, no-commitment times. I suspect that Sheldon has raised himself to a pitch of antagonism because in Greene we all see images of ourselves and our times which we do not care for, and that Sherry, who has devoted 20 years to retracing Greene's steps, has identified with Greene in an equally intense, but by contrast a positive, way. As a minute by minute explanation of William Golding's tribute, that Greene 'will be read and remembered as the ultimate chronicler of 20th century man's consciousness and anxiety,' Sherry's book is unputdownable.</p>

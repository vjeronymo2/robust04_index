Mieno gave the hint  at a news conference held upon returning home from Frankfurt  where he represented Japan at a meeting of top financial  officials from the Group of Seven industrialized countries on  Saturday, along with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii.    The central bank cut its discount rate to a record low 1.75  percent per annum last September. Mieno said the central bank  will "keep a close eye on the effect of past rate cuts" for the  time being.    Mieno said exchange rates had not loomed large at the G-7  gathering but he quickly added the G-7 countries had reconfirmed  the need for continued cooperation in currency and other  questions.    The yen has soared against the dollar in the wake of the  collapse of a February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton on trade issues. The  current yen-dollar levels had not been taken up at a meeting of  Fujii and his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Bentsen, which took place  just before the G-7 meeting, Mieno said.    "The currency levels should be determined by market force  and  should not be manipulated," Mieno said.    Asked about press reports that Fujii had told the G-7  meeting  that the yen's rapid appreciation in value puts a damper on  Japan's economic recovery, Mieno said the view seems to have  been understood by financial officials from other industrialized  countries although no clear-cut responses had been expressed.  He also said other G-7 countries had expressed strong hope for  Japan's economic comeback but had not sought any change in its  monetary policy.</p>

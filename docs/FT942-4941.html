			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Cox climbs to third in US cable-TV league - Louise Kehoe examines the Atlanta-based company's Dollars 2.3bn deal with the media group Times Mirror Times Mirror, the US media group, reached a definitive agreement over the weekend to sell its cable television operations to Cox Enterprises, a privately-held Atlanta-based cable television and publishing group. The complex Dollars 2.3bn deal involves the exchange of stock and debt. It will make Cox Cable, the Cox Enterprises cable unit, the third largest US cable-TV company, after Telecommunications and Time Warner, with around 3.1m subscribers. Currently, Cox Cable is the sixth largest US cable-TV company with 1.8m subscribers. The acquisition will provide Cox with the economies of scale needed to compete aggressively in the emerging market for broadband interactive multimedia communications services to the home, said Mr James Robbins, president of Cox Cable. Mr Robbins will also become chief executive of the merged operations. Through the merger, Cox will acquire cable TV systems in some of the most populous areas of southern California and Arizona. The Cox-Times Mirror deal signals renewed investment interest in the cable-TV sector, which had cooled following the collapse of two planned telephone company-cable TV deals involving Bell Atlantic and TCI, and Southwestern Bell and Cox, earlier this year. These agreements were scuttled by concerns about regulatory moves to cut cable-TV service prices by the Federal Communications Commission. 'While we are not at all happy about the current state of regulation, we believe strongly in the long-term cost effectiveness of the broadband platform,' said Mr Robbins. 'That's what this deal is all about.' The Cox-Times Mirror deal may encourage further consolidation in the cable-TV industry, analysts said. Several smaller cable-TV companies are said to be looking for buyers. The cable-TV industry is being transformed by advances in technology that herald the emergence of 'interactive' television services such as 'video-on-demand', TV shopping and news and information services. However, only the largest cable-TV companies can afford to upgrade their networks to provide such services. They also face potential competition from telephone companies which are also planning to transmit interactive TV services over their networks. For Times Mirror the deal reflects a decision, reached late last year, to refocus on its publishing operations. The group owns the Los Angeles Times, Newsday, and several other US newspapers and magazines. Analysts said that Times Mirror recognised that it would have to make substantial investments to upgrade its cable-TV operations to remain competitive and chose instead to focus on its 'core competencies' in publishing. 'With this merger, we have committed our future to the content side of the information highway and have gained substantial resources to pursue our growth strategy,' said Mr Robert Erburu, chairman, president and chief executive of Times Mirror. Times Mirror aims to become a leading supplier of information and programming for digital media services, he said. The group plans to grow 'through the application of new technologies and global expansion as well as building new positions in consumer multimedia', he declared. As part of their agreement, Times Mirror and Cox Cable will form a partnership to develop and invest in cable television programming, the companies said. Times Mirror will manage this partnership. A new Outdoor Life TV channel, previously announced by Times Mirror, will be funded by the new partnership. The companies have also agreed to explore a collaborative test of interactive information and entertainment services in Southern California. Times Mirror said that it will reduce its stock dividend, following the completion of the deal, to 'enable us to make very sizeable investments in promising information businesses'.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A stewardess and three skiers aboard a Soviet airliner foiled a hijack attempt  by a man who threatened to set the plane on fire unless he was flown abroad,  the newspaper Vozdushny Transport reported. The would-be hijacker approached  the stewardess holding a cigarette lighter in one hand and in the other a fuse  wired to a suitcase that police later discovered contained gasoline, the  newspaper of the Civil Aviation Ministry said. The stewardess gave the man a  push, then summoned help from the passenger cabin. Three skiers overcame the  man and tied him up while the pilot aborted the takeoff, the newspaper said.  </P></p>

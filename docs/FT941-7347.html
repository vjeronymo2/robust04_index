			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / City banker found guilty of Pounds 100m fraud Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the former City merchant banker, was yesterday convicted at the Old Bailey of a sophisticated Pounds 100m fraud on a number of financial institutions in an attempt to prop up the bank he had established and run. His conviction came at the end of a three-month trial thought to have cost more than Pounds 3m. The Serious Fraud Office brought the prosecution after the collapse in 1991 of Mr Smith's bank, the Wallace Smith Trust Company, with losses of Pounds 100m. After deliberating overnight the jury returned guilty verdicts on one general count of fraudulent trading involving Pounds 100m and two specific counts of obtaining property by deception. The jury cleared Mr Smith of three counts of theft. The judge also directed not guilty verdicts on two false accounting charges. Mr Smith will be sentenced on March 23 and has been released on conditional bail. Wallace Smith Trust Company began to run into serious financial problems in 1990. The court heard that to cover its increasing losses Mr Smith, the chairman and joint managing director, embarked on a series of frauds on banks and other financial institutions. This was made possible by the highly centralised and autocratic manner in which he ran his business. At the heart of the fraud was the practice of 'double-dipping' - using and re-using certificates of deposit to obtain a series of multi-million pound loans. To avoid detection Mr Smith laundered the money by routing it out of the UK into two shell companies in Canada. The money was then returned to the UK and Mr Smith's bank by charging management fees to the Canadian companies. Mr Smith told others at Wallace Smith Trust that the two Canadian companies, based in Edmonton, Alberta, had substantial assets in the form of land, oil and gas interests along with a wide-ranging portfolio of shares. Both companies were complete shams. They had no assets, employed no staff and operated out of one-room offices. To enable the scheme to work Mr Smith appointed as short-term directors of these companies accountants who were more interested in travelling the world than following City careers. They worked in London offices separate to the main bank and followed Mr Smith's instructions, signing documents as required. One former director told the court how Mr Smith had ordered him neither to discuss the business of the Canadian company with anyone from Wallace Smith Trust Company nor to acknowledge Mr Smith if the two men met in public. The scheme deceived both Bank of England supervisors and the bank's auditors, Deloitte Haskin &amp; Sells, now part of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. By late 1990 senior staff with the bank were starting to challenge Mr Smith about his methods. However, Mr Smith fended off their inquiries and in April 1991 committed his largest single fraud, cheating the Discount Bank and Trust Company of Dollars 37m (Pounds 25m) by entering into 'repo' transactions with it using Canadian bonds that never existed. This prompted further inquiries from bank staff. Mr Michael Hamilton, a joint managing director, challenged Mr Smith to prove the existence of the bonds. When he was unable to do so, he forced him to call in the Bank of England. Within two days the bank was liquidated with debts of Pounds 100m and Mr Smith arrested. Mr Smith - who once provided considerable financial support to the Bruges Group of anti-European MPs - was said in court to have no personal assets left. Last night Labour MP Mr Peter Hain demanded that the Bruges Group returned the money it had received from Wallace Smith. He said: 'They should be required to pay it back. This is stolen money.'</p>

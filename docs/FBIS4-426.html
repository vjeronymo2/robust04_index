			<p>BFN     [Text] Kampala, 12 Apr (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels Tuesday [12  April] said their forces had entered the capital, Kigali, and  were about to join a batallion of 600 fellow fighters surrounded  by government troops in the city. "Our forces are now within  eyeshot of the place where our 600-strong unit is," said  Christine Umutoni, spokeswoman for the Rwanda Patriotic Front  (RPF) office in Uganda.    She told AFP that RPF forces were not in a hurry to take  Kigali and would move slowly to avoid massive destruction of the  city. Many government troops were deserting and joining rebel  forces, she claimed. Umutoni said RPF was "suspicious" of the  French soldiers who had gone to Kigali to help evacuate  foreigners. "They are showing signs of wanting to stay around  and help this murderous regime," Umutoni said.    Some 500 French soldiers flew into Kigali over the weekend  to  ensure the safe evacuation of the 600-odd French citizens in  Rwanda. Umutoni complained the French troops were not leaving  although the rescue mission had been completed.    Reports from Kigali said the interim government left the  Kigali hotel where it had taken up residence for an unknown  destination as shooting intensified in several areas around the  city.</p>

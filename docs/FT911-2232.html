			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Multi-Purpose announces 46% decline in turnover MULTI-PURPOSE, the diversified Malaysian group, unveiled a 46 per cent drop in turnover to MDollars 279m (USDollars 101.4m) last year, reflecting the extent it has shrunk from its previous status as one of the country's largest conglomerates. Its profit margin rose, however, from 1.5 per cent to 10 per cent to help raise pre-tax profit from MDollars 30m in 1989 to MDollars 52m, the best it achieved in more than a decade of its troubled and heavily borrowed life. After-tax profit and minority interests stood at MDollars 26m, or 3.5 Malaysian cents in earnings per share, compared with 0.8 cents previously. Over the past year, the group, under Mr Lim Thian Kiat, chief executive, has shrunk from six divisions to four; banking, shipping, property and lottery. The rationalisation - which produced MDollars 110m in net extraordinary gain and MDollars 136m in attributable profit last year - still leaves shipping yet to be sold, after the trading and engineering and plantation divisions. Multi-Purpose's lottery operation remains its biggest earner, with after-tax profit doubling to nearly MDollars 34m. This is followed by banking and property. The group plans to use the proceeds from last year's sales, in particularly MDollars 478m from its plantations, to lift its Dunlop Estate stake in the Magnum lottery, leisure and finance group from 40 to 100 per cent. Last March, Dunlop raised MDollars 310m, MDollars 260m of it in 10 per cent, five-year loan stocks, to acquire 30 per cent in Magnum from a friendly party. But Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank has urged minority shareholders to reject the rest of the offer, at MDollars 7.42 a share, compared with more than MDollars 10 being traded. Reconstruction at Magnum and Dunlop is in the pipeline, by consolidating its lottery operations under a new listed group and expanding its finance operations through the acquisition of a stockbroker.</p>

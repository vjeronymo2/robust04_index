[Sastrowardoyo] We want not only economic growth, but also  equal income distribution. Foreign investors are allowed to  benefit from our business opportunities, but we must also defend  national interests. Foreign investment should not be allowed to  affect the business of local people, capture our domestic  market, corner our businessmen, or make our businessmen lose  business opportunities. I do not want that to happen. At least,  we must be equal in giving and taking things.    [Irawanto] How do you make that happen?    [Sastrowardoyo] They are allowed to set up wholly owned  foreign companies, but they must observe the requirements,  namely, their capital must be more than U.S. $50 million, their  company must be located in the approved industrial estate or in  the 15 designated provinces such as Jambi or the eastern part of  Indonesia, or they must export all their products overseas. It  must be borne in mind that foreign investors need to fulfil one  of the above requirements, and not necessarily all of them. For  instance, they can still set up wholly-owned foreign companies  if their capital is under U.S. $50 million, but their company  must be located in one of the 15 designated provinces, and their  products must be entirely for export. However, after 20 years,  they must carry out a divestment program [two preceding words in  English], which means that 51 percent of the company's equity  must be sold to local businessmen.    [Irawanto] Why?    [Sastrowardoyo] Because we do not want passive observers and  because we also want a piece of the economic cake. We do not  want to become mere laborers who have given them land, water,  and opportunities which they have grabbed.    [Irawanto] Do you think the requirements are too hard for  foreign investors?    [Sastrowardoyo] No, because the 51-percent equity can still  be split into smaller portions. For example, 31 percent for  local partners, while the remaining 20 percent can be listed in  the stock market. So the 49-percent owner can continue as the  single majority [two preceding words in English] holder.  Therefore, foreign investors do not have to worry about it. Do  not forget that local partners include not only local  businessmen, but also international financial institutions such  as the IFC [International Finance Corporation], the IMF, and the  ADB [Asian Development Bank] which the Indonesian Government is  a shareholder. The idea is not to allow foreigners to  completely dominate business opportunities in our country, while  our people remain mere spectators.    [Irawanto] But other countries do not have the divestment  program.    [Sastrowardoyo] We are competing not only with developing  countries, but also with developed ones. We must be mentally  ready and skillful in dealing with foreign investors. If  foreign investors wholly own their companies and we only supply  them with land, water, and manpower, this country will  definitely become a nation of laborers. We will never become a  nation of entrepreneurs [preceding word in English] and we will  never have management experts. As for other investment areas, I  think we have already adopted an open-minded approach. [passage  omitted on the issues of land and bureaucracy]    [Irawanto] Do you see the PRC as a threat to our investment  drive?    [Satrowardoyo] I believe the PRC is not a threat because  political stability is still a big question there while its  business regulations are inconsistent. Vietanm will probably  pose a threat to us three years from now. At present, its  infrastructure and regulations are not ready for investment, but  if they can cope with these problems, that country will be more  competitive. But for now, I see no serious threat.    [Irawanto] What is Indonesia's position in attracting  foreign investment?    [Sastrowardoyo] We managed to get U.S. $10.3 billion in  1992, but do not forget that the figure represents overall  investment, while pure foreign investment stood at about one  fourth of this amount. As of 11 December 1993, we managed to  attract U.S. $7.4 billion only. It is true that there is a drop  in investment in 1993.    [Irawanto] What is the greatest obstacle for foreign  investors?    [Sastrowardoyo] Indonesia is the only ASEAN country and the  only Asian country that does not give tax holidays [two  preceding words in English], which was abolished on 1 January  1984. This is because we need all sources of revenue, including  taxation. On the other hand, people often ask: "Why does  Indonesia have a divestment program and others not?" The answer  is, as I have explained earlier, namely, we do not want to  become mere spectators.</p>

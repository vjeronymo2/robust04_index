			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 3-A GIRLS  </P> <P> In the other 3-AA semifinal:  </P> <P> Palos Verdes 62, Estancia 48 -- Estancia High School's unexpected advance to  the semifinals came to a halt when it fell to fourth-seeded Palos Verdes at  University High in Irvine.  </P> <P> "We never thought we'd be here," Estancia Coach Lisa McNamee said.  </P> <P> "This is the farthest we've gone in nine years. It was a real growing  experience for next year."  </P> <P> Palos Verdes (27-4) used its height advantage to advance to next week's final  against Brea. The Sea Kings' tall front line of Monique Morehouse, Mary Maloney  and Kristen Jaconi dominated the backboards and Palos Verdes took a 49-33 lead  with 3:41 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> But Estancia (14-13) fought back behind the shooting of Patrice Lumpkin and  Maria Garcia to trail 50-43 at the end of the quarter. Palos Verdes rebuilt the  lead when the Eagles hit only two of 16 shots in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "Their box-and-one (defense) rattled (forward) Melody (Earle)," McNamee said.  "She normally hits all of those shots." Lumpkin and Robin Cordrey led Estancia  in scoring with 17 and 10 points, respectively. Jaconi led Palos Verdes with  19. TOM BIRSCHBACH  </P></p>

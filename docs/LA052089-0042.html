			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS LEAVE CLASSROOMS FOR PICKET LINES  </P> <P> This week, parents who are committed to keeping the schools open and orderly  have learned a lot about the schools and the strategies and tactics of United  Teachers-Los Angeles.  </P> <P> What is particularly troublesome is that in most strikes workers are up against  the company. In this week's teachers' strike, the innocent students are the  ones who are suffering, with chaos, lost opportunities for learning, the fear  of losing admission to college, and some newly learned UTLA teacher-taught  messages about disrespecting temporary authority.  </P> <P> Many parent/taxpayers understand that we (and our children) are the ones being  struck against, and while we have respect for education and for most teachers,  allowing a school to close strikes us as the community's failure.  </P> <P> Crossing the line this week, parents have had their pictures taken, been  screamed at, told they were stealing the teachers' chance at a fair shake. I  was even told by the union representative at our child's school that the  teachers would long remember who dared to volunteer at the school, and that I  should think twice about my child's future after helping to keep the strike  going. The parents aren't harboring the same kind of deep resentment towards  the teachers despite the fact that in most of the classrooms textbooks have  been removed, supplies are gone, and playground balls were deflated before the  strike just to raise the hassle factor. Kids were told by union teachers to  call the substitutes scabs, chew gum, scream and shout, walk out.  </P> <P> I want to tell union members who have used these tactics in dealing with  children and with volunteers that no matter how and when the strike ends, we're  still, like it or not, all in this together. If it is truly the future of  education and the attraction of good teachers that has taken the teachers to  the picket lines, then stop trying to scare people into agreement. Don't teach  the kids to disrespect a school system unless you've successfully taught them  to think critically on their own and voice their views, not yours. And work  with the parents, even the volunteers, just as the parents will have to work  with those who've been on strike.  </P> <P> BARBARA BRONSON GRAY  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

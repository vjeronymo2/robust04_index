			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: GPA share agreement in principle with Aer Lingus GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, has reached an agreement in principle with Aer Lingus, one of its largest shareholders, over a crucial feature of its controversial share flotation, scheduled for June. Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, has agreed in principle to 'some degree of lock-up' of shares, according to a company spokesman. The sale of new and existing shares - which could value GPA at between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn - cannot go ahead until a lock-up agreement, preventing existing shareholders from selling more than an agreed amount during and after the sale, has been reached. Although the agreement in principle represents a step forward, details of the amount of shares to be sold and the duration of the lock-up are still under negotiation. Aer Lingus wants to sell a large portion of its 9.9m shares, while GPA is trying to limit the sale to between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of the shareholding. Aer Lingus, like Air Canada, another large GPA shareholder, is keen to sell its shares to help strengthen its own balance sheet. Similarly, a number of Japanese banks are keen to shore up their capital by selling their shares at an attractive price, following the recent declines in the Japanese stock market. Mr Tony Ryan, GPA chairman, said the group expects to announce a price range for the shares next month.</p>

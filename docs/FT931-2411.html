			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Costain peace pact with Peabody COSTAIN, the UK construction company, yesterday made peace with Peabody Resources, part of Britain's Hanson conglomerate, and agreed to sell its Australian coal-mining assets to Peabody for Dollars 200m plus a net asset adjustment. The additional asset adjustment is subject to a final audit, but is estimated to add around Dollars 34m to the purchase price at current exchange rates. Peabody will also assume around Dollars 65m-worth of borrowings at the Australian coal operations. The deal between Costain and Peabody comes at the end of a long and stormy legal battle in the Missouri courts. The transaction is now expected to be completed 'shortly' and Peabody and Costain will dismiss their respective lawsuits against each other. They will also drop claims and counter-claims for damages and costs. The lawsuits arose after Costain walked away from its original deal to sell the Australian coal assets to Peabody for Dollars 200m. Instead, the British construction group announced that it would sell the business to Altus Finance for Dollars 245m. Both Altus and Peabody would have assumed ADollars 120m of debt. Peabody sued, claiming that it had exclusive negotiating rights with Costain over the assets and, in February, a US judge granted a permanent injunction preventing Costain from selling the operations to the French buyer. At that point, Peabody said that it hoped to proceed with the purchase, and talks with Costain restarted.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Europeans warned about 'Apocalypse soon' AN APOCALYPTIC future for European culture was painted by EC film producers yesterday, if the cinema and audiovisual sectors are included in the Uruguay Round of Gatt. Figures from Europe's cinema industry lobbied the European Commission yesterday to get the sector taken out of the Round, warning that unless it is 'Europe will become a Third World continent,' in the words of Mr Wim Wenders, the German film director. The Commission says it is fighting for 'cultural specificity' for the films and broacasting sector, allowing some protection and continuing subsidy. France, with backing from other member states such as Spain wants a 'cultural exception' exempting cinema altogether. Prospects last night brightened for France as the US and EC appeared to make headway in Gatt talks in Brussels towards a compromise on trade in audio-visual services. Neither Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator, nor Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, would give details, but acknowledged progress had been made on how to address problems in the sector. EC negotiators had until recently sought in vain to exclude audio-visual services from the Uruguay Round, but it now appears the EC is proposing the sector should remain in the Round, but with the focus on abolition of EC quota restrictions on imported films and television programmes. This would allow European governments to continue subsidising entertainment industries. A range of mostly French industry groups argued yesterday that Europe would be swamped by Hollywood in a Gatt-regulated open 'culture market'. They pointed out that US film export revenues rose from Dollars 750m (Pounds 490m) in 1980 to Dollars 5.5bn last year, and that Dollars 3.7bn of 1992 sales were in Europe. EC attempts to reserve most screening time on television to European work has not blunted US penetration of the EC market, they said, contrary to US claims that this was an illegal quota system. Mr Wenders said that the audiovisual industry would be the biggest on the planet in the next century. Europe had to decide whether its still modest share would continue to exist or not, before the Uruguay Round mid-December deadline. He said: 'To have a market dominated by American imagery means not only domination by American values and American ideas, but that other (EC-made) products would disappear,' because of concomitant US domination of advertising.</p>

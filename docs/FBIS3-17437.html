			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Karaganov, Deputy Director of the </F> European Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and a  Foreign Affairs Adviser to President Yeltsin; "Russia Finds  Independent Foreign Policy"]    [Text] The electoral success of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's  Liberal Democratic Party has -- naturally -- made the future  direction of Russian foreign policy an important international  issue.    The emergence of a movement like Zhirinovskiy's was  predictable. It was a normal reaction from those strata who are  suffering economically, who have witnessed the disintegration of  the Soviet Union, which they thought would be their homeland for  centuries, and who are now left with no vision of where their  country is going.    If, however, a lesson has been learnt -- and it looks as if  President Boris Yeltsin is learning it -- it is that  Zhirinovskiy is a dark cloud on the horizon but not the horizon  itself. There is still a long way to go before we glimpse  light. But the road to normalcy is the one Russia is on.    Being normal naturally means having a normal foreign policy.  This is now emerging; and it is emerging in direct reaction to  the recent past, the period immediately after the failed coup of  1991 and the emergence of Russia as an independent state.  During that period, Russia was too inclined to say "yes" to our  new friends in the West -- even before being asked to. We  suffered a temporary loss of our vision and of our ability both  to understand, and act in, our own interests. This created a  backlash.    Under foreign minister Andrey Kozyrev, an attentive  listener,  Russian foreign policy has since made big adjustments while  never changing its basic course towards strategic rapprochement  with the west. It is now better formulated and less one-sided.  It has achieved a significant success in persuading the Serbs  to pull back from Sarajevo. It is focusing much more than  before on the Commonwealth of Independent States and on former  partners in Europe. And it is active in Asia, too.    Russia has learned to express its differences with others as  well as to chorus its assent. Differences have centred on  former Yugoslavia and on the continuing inaccessibility of  Western markets to our goods; in particular, Russia's ruling  elites and the increasingly influential military oppose plans to  enlarge Nato by admitting east-central European states (but not  Russia), believing this threatens Russia with geopolitical  isolation.    At the heart of the problems and tensions between Russia and  the west is, and will remain, the relations Russia strikes with  the former Soviet republics.    In autumn last year, Russia took decisions which forced most  CIS countries out of the rouble zone. The decisions were  prompted by exasperation at the lack of reform in these states,  especially Ukraine, and by Russia's unwillingness and inability  still to subsidise them.    In any reintegration of former Soviet states, Russia will  play a different role from that in the old Soviet Union (which  was a strange combination of political metropolis and economic  colonies) or in the first two years of the CIS's existence.  During the latter, Russia was uncertain about how to proceed;  it knew lt could no longer be donor and boss but it did not know  whether to increase separation or try a new form of  re-integration.    Now, it seems, there is a growing consensus. Most feasible  regimes in Moscow (except for a national socialist one, which  would try to force political reintegration) would probably  attempt a modality under which CIS countries would remain  independent politically but be dominated economically. No sane  politician in Moscow would choose to take responsibility for  managing both the surrounding weak economies and their turbulent  societies as that would mean taking responsibilities off the  shoulders of local leaderships and free them to blame Russia for  all their ills. Russia also cannot afford total separation, nor  a policy of benign negligence.    In this model, Russia would play the role of first among  equals in interstate relations in the CIS rather like the US in  Nato, or Germany in the European Union -- but not big brother  protecting and feeding his younger kin (though elements of these  roles will remain).    Russia will also have to continue to be a local peace keeper  or peace enforcer. To do this effectively and avoid becoming a  militaristic state, Russia needs two conditions fulfilled.  First, her role as peace keeper should be legitimate; and  second, it should be part of an international effort -- under  the control of international organisations and constrained by  international law. That would deter Moscow from unlimited use of  military power and ultimately dangerous unilateralism.    Russia is now beginning to act but neither as the former  Communist enfant terrible nor as the terribly nice guy of the  late Gorbachev early Yeltsin period. Is the west ready to part  with this nice guy, this Mr Yes -- and work with an independent  partner and prospective ally? I trust the answer will be in the  affirmative -- though, of course, I well understand how nice it  was to talk with Mr Yes.</p>

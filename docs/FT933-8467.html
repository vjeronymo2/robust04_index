			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Brazil names third bank governor in year BRAZIL's chief debt negotiator has been named the country's new central bank governor in yet another shuffle of key economic personnel after a public clash between President Itamar Franco and the former governor. Mr Pedro Malan returns from Washington to replace Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes, whose turbulent five months as governor came to an end on Friday night. Mr Ximenes resigned along with the whole of the bank's board after a dispute with the president over the validity of predated cheques written before the country's recent change of currency. But the two had repeatedly come to blows over Mr Franco's low interest rate policy. Although the business community was irritated by yet another change in the economic team - there have been three central bank governors and five finance ministers in the past year - the choice of Mr Malan was generally welcomed, as was the accompanying announcement by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, that interest rates are to drop. Mr Malan is considered to have done a masterful job at negotiating a Brady deal for restructuring Brazil's Dollars 44bn (Pounds 29.5bn) commercial debt amid the country's economic crisis. The deal is due to be completed on November 30 though the timing could be jeopardised by the country's continuing failure to reach a new accord with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Malan has excellent relations with the international financial community, having lived for 10 years in Washington, where he has worked for the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank before becoming debt negotiator. Aged 50, Mr Malan also appears to have unusually long staying power by Brazilian standards. He has held his position as debt negotiator for three years despite numerous changes at the helm of the Finance Ministry. Assuming the mantle of Central Bank governor is an unenviable task, with inflation for this year nearing a record 2,000 per cent. Mr Malan has already turned down the job on two previous occasions. But he was persuaded by Mr Cardoso, with whom he enjoys close working relations.</p>

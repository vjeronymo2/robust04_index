			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Waiting for the realistic opportunities - Smiths Industries' assessment of the companies being offered in its diversification that is the rate at which offers of companies for sale have been flooding into Smiths Industries, the engineering group which is trying to diversify from its core aircraft avionics business. However, Smiths has so far concluded relatively few deals, in spite of having more than Pounds 40m in ready cash, strongly cash-generative businesses and a high reputation in the City. It is anxious to compensate for the downturn in civilian and military aircraft by building its medical systems and industrial components businesses. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, says: 'The market is not dissimilar to the domestic housing market in Britain. Quite a lot of companies would like to refocus. They tend to test the market, by selectively and secretively offering different bits and pieces around. 'Until quite recently they have been disappointed by what the market has been prepared to pay. So many of those 'sales' have been withdrawn. You'd be amazed how dreadful businesses become core businesses again, almost overnight, in the light of reality.' Smiths sees some evidence, both in the UK and US, that people are deciding that they ought to lower their sights, take what the market is offering, and use the money to get on with other things. Mr Hurn said: 'One of the frustrations of the last 2 1/2 years, of the early part of recession, has been this unreality because companies like us have obviously been keen to invest. We have been apparently offered large numbers of superficially attractive companies at unrealistic prices. That has been deeply frustrating, because we have been generating cash but have been unable to re - invest it at sensible prices.' The group did recently buy a US disposable medical products company, Intertech Resources, for Dollars 110m, about 20 times earnings. Although less than the multiple of 30 times earnings which a similar company would have fetched as recently as a year ago, it was still expensive compared with Smiths' historic multiple of about 13.5. Nonetheless Mr Gerry Mortimer, economic adviser to Smiths, believes the figures can begin to stack up favourably at this level, once account is taken of the synergies and world markets which the UK group can add to such a company, which makes 'single-use' anaesthesia and respiratory devices used in surgery and intensive care. Mr Hurn said: 'The one thing that US manufacturers of this sort of product of our sort of size are not good at, and never have been good at, is selling anything outside the US or Canada. I'm not talking about big groups such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, but the small and medium-sized players. What we bring is immediate access to a world distribution network outside North America.' One useful trend, as far as Smiths is concerned, is the virtual disappearance of leveraged and management buy-outs. Mr Mortimer said: 'Between three and five years ago we were witnessing auctions - and taking part in some of them - where the industry participants lost out to strictly financial buyers. 'We can cite several instances where those properties have come back on the market again-but not the properties they were. They have had to cut their research and development to finance their cashflow, and they still fail.' Smiths believes that engineering companies might offer some of the best buys at present, both in terms of price and the stage they are at in the economic cycle. Mr Hurn said he would like to build up both these medical and industrial businesses to a size where they are both much more equal legs on the stool, compared with aerospace. 'If we don't do that as a result of aerospace shrinking down to their size, I'd rather see them going up to meet aerospace.' Although the group was willing to make further acquisitions in the US, Mr Hurn thought the UK was going to offer some 'jolly good opportunities' for acquisitions at sensible prices at this point in the recession and for the next few months. In spite of his wish to shift the balance of the group away from aerospace, Mr Hurn does not rule out making acquisitions in that area, and emphasises that Smiths is currently investing Pounds 40m a year of its own money in developing aerospace products for customers such as Boeing. Indeed, Smiths had a very close look at Dowty, the aerospace and information technology group which TI Group won with a hostile Pounds 510m bid in June. Mr Hurn said: 'Nobody in their right mind rules out the big quantum jump. It is of a different order of risk and strategy. There obviously have been situations in the last two years when we have been talked of as a bidder in the Pounds 500m category. 'We spend a great deal of time and thought processes in looking at those large opportunities. You only get one shot at getting that wrong - and, therefore, you have to be very, very sure you get it right. I don't mean we wouldn't do it if it was right, but I certainly wouldn't bet the farm on a less solidly based business than Smiths Industries.' He concluded: 'What you never know in this game is whether you are going to pull something off. You pursue perhaps a tenth of the things you look at; of the 10 you pursue, you get perhaps two to the final stages-and then you can walk away from both of them. It's a very, very low strike-rate.'</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cater Allen buoyed by discount house side A strong performance by its discount house business helped Cater Allen Holdings, the financial services group, report a 36 per cent increase in interim profits. The pre-tax line for the six months to October 31 increased to Pounds 9.85m (Pounds 7.25m), while an abnormally low tax charge, reflecting a Pounds 1m exceptional tax credit, resulted in a 45 per cent rise in attributable profits to Pounds 7.48m (Pounds 5.16m). Earnings per share jumped from 21p to 31p and an increased interim dividend of 8p (7p) is declared. The profits advance was led by the discount house, the second biggest in the City, which reported an 88 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.87m (Pounds 2.59m). The performance mainly reflected better trading opportunities in gilt edged securities. Money market operations made a 'satisfactory contribution' during a period when there were no base rate movements. The stock lending and financial futures businesses also thrived. Low interest rates inevitably reduced the return on capital, although this was more than offset by higher volumes. As a result profits from stock lending expanded to Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 3.09m) while financial futures broking generated Pounds 440,000 (Pounds 302,000). In Jersey, lower profits from banking operations were almost offset by growth in the trust and investment management businesses and by 'a sparkling result' from the stockbroking subsidiary in its first period of ownership. Overall Jersey profits slipped to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 2.11m). The loss in the group's Lloyd's agencies widened from Pounds 838,000 to Pounds 1.12m, but included a number of special items.</p>

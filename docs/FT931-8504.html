			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Russia 'trying to paralyse Ukraine' RUSSIA is trying to bring about 'a full paralysis' of the Ukrainian economy, Ukrainian prime minister Leonid Kuchma said yesterday. Mr Kuchma said such action could present the west with a 'distorted' view of the republic's economic position, The remarks by Mr Kuchma, who has consistently sought an economic and political rapprochement with Russia, indicate a sharp deterioration in relations between the two former Soviet republics. 'Unfortunately, there is already a conflict,' Mr Kuchma said. 'Worse still, this is a conflict in which there can be no victors.' The weapons in the current struggle are oil and gas, for which Russia is demanding world prices or threatening to decrease supply, and the unresolved issue of the foreign debts and assets of the former Soviet Union. But recent comments by Russian officials suggest that disagreements over these economic issues are underpinned by political and military disputes between Russia, which is seeking to retain some of the former Soviet Union's old sphere of influence, and Ukraine, which is adamantly charting a separate course. In an effort to save the situation, Mr Kuchma said that yesterday he telephoned his Russian counterpart, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, to arrange a face to face meeting next Friday. 'I cannot understand the Russian position,' Mr Kuchma said. 'It is not motivated by economics. It can only be seen as some sort of pressure on Ukraine. But Russia must realize that to return to the former Soviet Union is neither technically nor politically possible.' Earlier this week Mr Viktor Shokhin, Russian deputy prime minister, said Ukraine would get subsidised energy only if it made concessions to Russia over the Black Sea Fleet, allowed Russian military bases to be established in Ukraine and permitted Russia to export oil and gas through Ukrainian pipelines. Mr Shokhin's statements came on top of Russia's unilateral increase in the prices it charges Ukraine for natural gas to world levels ' a jump of 2500 per cent ' and the announcement by the Russian prime minister that Ukraine would receive only 15m tonnes of oil this year, 5 million less than Russia promised in January and one third of Ukraine's energy requirement. 'They understand perfectly that to move to world prices in one day means a complete paralysis of the Ukrainian economy,' said Mr Kuchma. He said Ukraine did not receive any oil from Russia in January. Nuclear missiles in Ukraine are being drawn into the struggle. Ukrainian and Russian sources say the missiles are not being properly maintained by the Russian factories which produced them. Western diplomats in Kiev say that in a worst case scenario the missiles would not be mistakenly launched but could explode, spreading nuclear material throughout the region.</p>

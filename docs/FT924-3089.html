			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and options trading TURNOVER in stock index futures moved sharply ahead in a volatile session which saw increased rolling of positions forward into the March contract, writes Joel Kibazo. The December contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,764. However, attempts by independent traders to send it higher proved fruitless and December went into decline as some leading institutions turned sellers, sending December to the day's low of 2,753 at around 11 pm. A sizeable share of the selling was initiated by a desire to roll out of December and into the March contract, which helped add to the day's overall volume. Dealers said a reasonable amount of arbitrage was carried out at the lower levels. The drying up of such activity, coupled with dealers covering short positions, led to a turnaround in the fortunes of the December contract and it advanced throughout the afternoon. It finished at 2,775, up 18 on the previous session and around 3 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 4. Turnover reached 10,911 contracts. In traded options, the FT-SE 100 option was again particularly busy accounting for around half of the day's total volume of 24,209 contracts, just ahead of Monday's figure. HSBC was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 2,590 contracts. Abbey National was next trading a total 737 contracts.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Travel: Cuba: coping with inscrutable powers - In Havana, James Henderson encounters good fortune one moment, frustration the next, before escaping to the countryside LOOK at Cuba on the map and you will see a crocodile. It is swimming threateningly among the Caribbean islands and with a switch of its tail it might thrust them aside. A crocodile is a fitting animal for Cuba, the biggest island in the Caribbean, which appears frighteningly powerful as it moves to open up to tourism. It could drain the industry throughout the area. But angry and defiant as it is, it has one big problem - the US. Just above it, Florida hangs over Cuba like a massive incisor, poised to snatch the island in a single bite. Suddenly, the crocodile looks like a wriggling tiddler, and the accident of geography has rarely been as poignant as now. The announcement at the beginning of the year that all assistance from the former Soviet Union had ended means that Cuba needs foreign exchange more desperately than ever. Tourism seems to be its only avenue, and the country is developing it frantically. But the US trade embargo is still in force. Key West used to be just a few hours away on a car ferry, but there is no contact now. We joined a weekend tour group to Havana to get settled for the first couple of days. It is not often that I am a proper tourist, even in the Caribbean, and the whole thing made me feel rather naughty. We were shepherded into a tour bus and the guide started his routine. 'My name is Arturo, what is my name, repeat please.' A few voices sounded uncertainly, but they were drowned by a massive 'Aaaarrrtuuurrooo]]' He gave us a few skeleton details on the country - population: 11m]; exports: cigars]; national sport: baseboll] At the back, I felt an urge to heckle. But while I was tittering at my silent one-liners, I began to notice more mysterious things afoot. We would not be staying at our chosen hotel. Inexplicably, the whole party was upgraded to a better one. There seemed to be inscrutable powers moving behind the scenes, making themselves tantalisingly visible in a person or in a surprise occurrence, bringing unexpected good fortune one moment, frustrating us the next. We called them ministries - and competed with one another to give them absurd-sounding names. Next morning we sidestepped the organised bus tour and headed out into Old Havana. It is without doubt the grandest and most beautiful town in the Caribbean islands, a square mile of 16th and 17th century palaces set around cobbled plazas. I love to wander there. That day, the cathedral was closed, for some reason. But by chance we came on a cafe in a lovely courtyard surrounded by arched balconies. 'Sorry, coffee's off . . .' We steeled ourselves for lunch. We chose the famous Bodeguita del Medio, which retains something of its rumbustious nature from Hemingway days in the 1950s. You are encouraged to sign your name on the wall. We had queued for half-an-hour just to get the table and were preparing to wait, but no sooner had we sat down than the Ministry of Expeditious Meals was in attendance, and our order was with us in a flash, surpassing all reasonable expectations of speed. Havana itself is totally unlike any other West Indian town. There should have been more people in the streets, small traders doing a 'lickle business.' The single vendor was clearly the Ministry of Green Liquid Distribution, dispensing iced drinks against the tropical sun. He had a permanent queue 25 yards long. The ministries' grand illogic makes independent travel unpredictable and quite hard work. You are hardly encouraged to mix with the locals anyway, and in the present difficulties much of the explosive joy of Latin Caribbean life has gone. Most of the nightclubs have been closed for want of electricity, though I would recommend a visit to the Tropicana. Goggle-eyed, I sat in front of an acreage of taut flesh and shifting satin, all moving in bewildering sequence; headdresses cascaded, limbs flailed and skirts swirled. My wig would have blown off if I had one. After a couple of days we decided to get out of Havana, but of course this involved meeting the capricious ministries on their own ground. So we developed deviousness. I visited the girl at the hotel tour desk, but the Ministry of If In Doubt, Defer, had struck her dumb. There were no cars available, she explained. How about a trip on a tour bus? No thanks. Then you'd better try Turismo Individual. At Turismo Individual there was a lady filing her nails. No, the person we wanted was out. We waited. Could there really be a Ministry for Strategic Absence? After an hour's fidgeting we gave up and tried the train station, but standing around at the station was a bit like a part in a Beckett play. But then, by chance, we scored. In the foyer of another hotel a woman ordered a car for us in a flash - the Ministry of Haphazard Hire Cars. We felt relieved as we left the city and the embrace of the ministries receded. We headed east and skirted Varadero, Cuba's flagship resort, which is due to have 30,000 rooms by the end of the century. The beach is 12 miles long and one of the Caribbean's finest. Varadero is the passing home of thousands of proper tourists, who lie on the sand all day and dance congas at night. Beyond, the Cuban countryside is immensely fertile, strikingly green, with rich, deep red earth where a pencil might take root. We passed from fields of sugar-cane into the Escambray mountains, with their bright green tobacco fields. It has always struck me as ironic that one of the favourite luxuries of the capitalist world, the cigar, should be produced by its self-appointed arch enemy, Cuba. We visited a cigar factory. They didn't really roll them on their thighs, but it is fun to watch cigars being rolled and pressed. Instead of a radio, a woman reads to the workers from the newspaper. We even visited a crocodile farm. I peered over the 8ft metal link fence to see a heap of them snoozing in a bog, each one propped lazily on the next. They look a bit docile, I ventured. You ought to see them at feeding time, the guide replied. A lot has been written about Cuba's difficulties. But generally the people are well-fed and well-dressed and certainly did not seem rebellious. There is not much Lycra around, but then that is hardly the pinnacle of 20th century achievement. And it is worth comparing life in Cuba with the largest other latin country in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic, where there is grinding poverty. The Cubans are considerably better off. Without the random rule of the ministries, smiles began to work and simple kindness needed no reason. I was on my own in a museum (a derailed train, left as it was 30 years ago when it was stormed by Che Guevara and the revolutionaries, with sombre pictures of those who died and a monumentally ugly sculpture of an explosion cast in concrete), when a stranger approached, concerned that I was alone and therefore must be lost. Did I need some help to get back to my tour bus? The rhetoric of the revolution appears strained now; the brave days of the 1960s are past and to see Che's face everywhere brings back memories of another age. But communism is only half the story in Cuba. Long before Lenin arrived, another, more important, national hero was railing against the US. A century ago Jose Marti was predicting that Cuba would never be able to escape the overbearing influence of what he called the 'colossus in the north.' All the Caribbean islands feel the presence of the US, but with Florida poised so close, Cuba feels it that much more acutely. Memories of Havana in the 1950s are still strong: so glorious and sleazy. There was a cruel logic about money and satisfaction then, and most Cubans would not want that to return. But the dollar is the flavour of the Caribbean, and it seems unlikely that the island can survive without contact with the US. Cuba may be a frightening prospect for the rest of the area, but the crocodile is looking increasingly vulnerable.</p>

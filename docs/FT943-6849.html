			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Engineering sale helps Bridon to Pounds 3.3m Bridon, the Doncaster-based wire and wire rope supplier which has been undergoing a substantial restructuring, yesterday reported sharply higher interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.3m, up from Pounds 1.1m. The pre-tax result for the six months to June 30 included an Pounds 800,000 credit from the sale in April of the lossmaking engineering division, as part of the group's comprehensive restructuring programme, dubbed Project 360. Net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.8m). Turnover from continuing operations was flat at Pounds 139.8m (Pounds 141.5m) while the discontinued engineering businesses added Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 22.3m). Earnings per share increased to 5.1p (1.6p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.25p. Operating profits for continuing activities increased to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 1.8m after Pounds 1.2m of restructuring costs). The core wire, wire rope and associated products business contributed Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 1.5m) on turnover of Pounds 116m (Pounds 114.8m). Mr Ron Petersen, chief executive, said all of the group's distribution companies, with the exception of CIFAST in Italy where there were now signs of improvement, had improved their performance during the period. In manufacturing, while there were no further increases in the cost of wire rod in the first half, increases were expected in the second half. However, Mr Petersen said the market place remained intensely competitive. Last month the group ceased production at its Belgian rope manufacturing plant. Production of specialised crane ropes is being transferred to the UK. The Pounds 4.5m costs of closing the Belgian facility will be taken against the provisions made in the 1993 accounts. The costs of acquisitions and restructuring in the first half were more than offset by the benefits of the Pounds 13m proceeds from the disposal of the engineering division. Net borrowings at June 30 were Pounds 21m (Pounds 28m), representing gearing of 23.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Bavarians roar into elections The Christian Social Union, Bavarian sister party of Germany's Christian Democratic Union, yesterday launched its election campaigning, vowing to make its voice heard in a future CDU/CSU federal government. 'The Bavarian lion must go on roaring,' Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, told about 1,000 CSU delegates in Munich. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, speaking at the rally, accused the opposition Social Democratic party of being willing to accept support from the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to the East German Communist party. Bavarians go to the polls on September 25 to elect a new state parliament and again on October 16 for Germany's federal elections. The CSU has been rocked by scandals which gave rise to predictions that the party would lose its majority in state parliament. However, Mr Waigel and Mr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian state premier, appear to have overcome the problems. Mr Waigel predicted the party would secure an absolute majority in the state elections.</p>

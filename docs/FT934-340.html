			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Arts: From New Orleans to synthesizers - Jazz in 1993 Jazz fans have reason to be nostalgic and partisan: there really have been golden eras when new and groundbreaking talent queued for a hearing. In the 1930s, swing was the thing; in the 1940s, bebop burst on to the scene; in the 1950s the cool school opened, and in the 1960s and 1970s, free music and then fusion marked the extremes of commerciality. If the 1980s are remembered as the time bebop boomed again, alongside acid dance, what will the 1990s come to represent? A consolidation of world beat in jazz, the post-modernisation of bebop in the new chamber jazz or the return to basic principles? Well, 1993 seemed to encapsulate the lot. From the sepia-tinged New Orleans beginnings to the synthesized way ahead, the history of jazz was personified last year in the swinging Lionel Hampton Orchestra, the retro-classical trumpet tones of Wynton Marsalis, the new world of improvisation in South African Bheki Mseleku and the young urban angst of New Yorker Steve Coleman. The annual migration to Europe of sax statesmen such as Sonny Rollins, Johnny Griffin and Jackie McLean kept the movement in context while the Five Blind Boys of Alabama, as well as Harry Connick Jr, reminded us that 'jazz' can still deliver more fundamental pleasure. Who will light the way in 1994? For this critic at least, a glow of pleasure lingers from saxophonist David Murray's summer visit. The tidal energy and burning ideas which powered the trio through his own neo-bop compositions surpassed almost anything else on offer and his return is eagerly awaited. Besides Murray, two other saxophonists who continue to illuminate new fields of improvisation are Joe Henderson and Norwegian Jan Garbarek. Though one blows warm and the other cold, they share the authority and inner peace which gives their different sounds an embracing sense of purpose. For sheer excitement and exoticism, pianists like Don Pullen and Randy Weston set the standard for 1994. Weston, the beatnik's role model, continues to fleck his rich weave of Afro-jazz with Middle Eastern colour, to intoxicating effect, as seen at the Royal Festival Hall. Even Ahmad Jamal, who once provided the airy framework for Miles Davis' early recordings, is finding a more dense style and the vaulted arches of the Union Chapel last spring teemed with the splintering chords and interlinking quotes borne by the surging Jamal pulse. In contrast to the channelled exuberance of contemporary piano-led groups, the Paul Motian school of jazz has cultivated a kind of speccy and earnest introspection. This has been most noticeable in guitar players, exemplified by John Scofield. Last year the young fogeys of jazz were gently teased by guitarist Bill Frisell's cranky dissection of American composers from Ives to Madonna at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Back at the Union Chapel, as part of the new expanded London Jazz Festival, the jazz intelligentsia were exercised by the intricate workings of master guitarist Jim Hall, one of the most original yet underrated jazz musicians around today. Thoughtful and reflective music like Henderson's and Hall's will characterise the 1990s - unless their minor scales are sidelined by the pianists.</p>

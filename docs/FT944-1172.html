			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Americas free trade area easier said than done Following the bold intentions for a Free Trade Area of the Americas agreed at the Summit of the Americas, governments in the hemisphere are now facing up to the practical difficulties of creating such an integrated trade area by 2005. Most central and south American governments believe they must either integrate, or be left behind. But wide disparities in regional economies mean some are better prepared than others. 'The countries of the hemisphere are ready to be part of the wider free trade area,' says Mr Ricardo Hausmann, chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank. 'The region's economies have stabilised and there is fiscal discipline. The economies are growing at an average of 3.5 per cent for the past four years, and investment levels are rising.' Trade in the Americas grew by 5 per cent per year between 1990 and 1994 despite a global recession, Mr Hausmann said. Countries in the region are trading more among themselves, and reached a value of Dollars 28bn last year from Dollars 15.7bn in 1990. 'This will exceed South American trade with the US this year because policies which previously discouraged trade are now encouraging it. These policies include trade liberalisation and the integration of markets.' Behind these generalities, however, are many disparities between the region's economies. There is already a concern that, even with extensive changes in domestic economic policies, the smaller countries could suffer severe dislocation in the adjustments they will have to make, before they begin gain from increased trade flows. 'We agree that there is a need for economic liberalisation, and that the rising tide of economic improvement will lift all the boats,' said Mr Byron Blake, assistant secretary general of the Caribbean Community. 'But some small boats which are not well balanced will be capsized. This is the danger which faces many small economies in the hemisphere.' One problem is how to integrate - through linking existing trade blocs or via bilateral negotiations, said Mr Cesar Gaviria, secretary general of the Organisation of American States and a former president of Colombia. 'The changes which have taken place in the Americas in recent years mean that the pieces of the puzzle of a hemispheric free trade area are in place,' he says. 'But as in any assembly line, the pieces have to be put together to work properly. We cannot over-exaggerate the difficulties,' Mr Gaviria said. Stitching together the hemisphere's several trading groups is unlikely to produce the seamless whole promised by leaders at the Miami summit two weeks ago. The regional trade blocs are at different stages of development. The Andean Pact countries, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, for example, need to update their trading structure, says Mr Daniel Mazuera, Colombia's foreign trade minister. Mr Gaviria argues that some countries will need time to implement trade liberalisation policies, while the laggards must be given help so they can catch up.</p>

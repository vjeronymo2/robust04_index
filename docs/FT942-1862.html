			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Observer: Checking out If the mafia didn't get you, the rats and cockroaches surely would. But no longer. The hotel Rossiya, the world's largest and least attractive hotel, occupying a prime site next to the Kremlin, is closing. The overwhelming presence of scuttling vermin has prompted Moscow's sanitation department to shut down the Rossiya, pending fumigation. A 1960s architectural monstrosity, the hotel stands on a site which had been densely populated with churches. Its present plight is thus something of a revenge by Moscow's underlife. In the past few years a home-from-home for provincial Soviet and then Russian parliamentarians, the Rossiya has suffered the familiar miseries of rising prices and falling incomes. Its many restaurants are rarely ablaze with carefree deputies carousing on government expense accounts. The final blow came with the abolition of the Congress of People's Deputies, the full Russian parliament which met several times a year and which brought more than 1,000 legislators to town and to the Rossiya. Can the hotel be saved? It has neither the splendour of the pre-revolutionary Muscovite palaces, now home to some new western-built hotels, nor even the Stalin wedding-cake kitsch coming into vogue. The Rossiya must await a revival of interest in glass-and-concrete boxes. By then, the rats and the cockroaches may be firmly ensconced.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (5): Building society aims for a paperless office BRITANNIA Building Society has one of Europe's largest DIP installations (pictured above) with more than 113 workstations, enabling 300 staff to access the system at different levels. Britannia uses an Olivetti Systems and Networks (OSN) FileNet DIP system to automate what had been 'paper-intensive' mortgage-processing. WorkFlo software systems are allowing Britannia to design and 're-engineer' business processes and increase office productivity by 25 per cent. Britania's system redevelopment programme involves 12 departments, starting with mortgage insurance administration, earlier this year. The system will also cover account changes, redemptions, deeds movement, mortgage administration and arrears. Once information is scanned into the system, automated document retrieval takes only a few seconds, allowing staff to take on more important transactions, rather than time-consuming admin tasks.</p>

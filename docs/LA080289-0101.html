			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION SPENDING AT LOWEST LEVEL IN 8 MONTHS  </P> <P> A persistent housing slump helped push construction spending in June to the  lowest level in eight months, the government said Tuesday, but economists are  expecting at least a modest rebound as interest rates decline.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government  construction activity fell 0.8% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  $414.7 billion, the lowest level since October. The decline followed a 0.6%  gain in May and a 0.8% drop in April.  </P> <P> Construction of new housing units dropped 1.2% to an annual rate of $136.6  billion, the lowest level in three years. It was the fifth consecutive monthly  decline.  </P> <P> A yearlong campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to fight inflation with higher  interest rates ended this spring. Starting in early June, the central bank  reversed course and has eased short-term rates three times, once in June and  twice last month.  </P> <P> Long-term rates, over which the Fed has less influence, are also down.  Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.81% last week, the lowest in two  years, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  </P> <P> Economists expect rates to continue falling gradually and, as a result,  construction activity to pick up. But, softness in economic growth overall will  prevent a strong surge, they said.  </P> <P> "I don't see a big rebound. . . . At least in the housing sector, I think we  have several more slow months to come while people wait to see whether we're  going to have a recession or not," said economist James Christian of the U.S.  League of Savings Institutions.  </P> <P> "If you can't sell them, you shouldn't build them," he said.  </P> <P> Activity for the first six months of the year was only 2.9% above the same  period in 1988, an increase that doesn't even make up for inflation in  construction costs.  </P> <P> The weakness in June included a 4.8% drop in public construction, which  accounts for about one-fifth of construction activity, to an annual rate of  $80.6 billion. The decline included a 3.6% drop in spending for highways and  streets, the biggest government category.  </P> <P> Spending on single-family homes fell 1.3% to an annual rate of $113.6 billion,  while multifamily construction was down 0.9% to $23 billion.  </P> <P> Non-residential construction rose 2.8% to a rate of $100.3 billion. That  reflected strength in industrial projects, up 4.3%; hotels and motels, up 6.8%;  office building, up 1.8%, and other commercial projects such as shopping  centers, up 2.5%.  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION SPENDING  </P> <P> July '89: 414.7  </P> <P> Source: Commerce Department  </P></p>

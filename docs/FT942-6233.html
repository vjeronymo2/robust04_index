			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / European Elections: EU vision with more realism than romance Abel Matutes, 52, the outgoing European commissioner for energy and transport, now heads the list of European parliament candidates for Spain's Popular party, the conservative opposition, which is tipped in the polls for first place. Q: Who would swap a post in the European Commission for a seat in the European parliament? A: Someone who is convinced that at this moment my job is to lead the European list because of the great political significance of these elections. Q: What will the big themes of this campaign be? A: We have to make European integration compatible with a more realistic and firm defence of legitimate national interests. We have to get away from a simple romantic vision of Europe, because Europe will only be built solidly on the basis of realities. And if in the end the sums do not work out for the Spanish in this integrated Europe, the very process of European integration will be at risk because Spaniards will lose sympathy and reject it. This firmer defence of national interests has two dimensions. One is a more effective presence in European institutions in Brussels, but there is also an internal dimension - better European policy implies a good economic policy in Spain. Competition in the single market is not only between companies - a Spanish company against a German or a French company - but also between the economic policies of all the member states. Q: Do you think European issues will really be aired in this election? The campaign seems to be wholly focused on internal politics. A: I try to air them. But I have to admit internal politics are the only theme that ultimately interests people. Q: Do you believe the European parliament should have more powers than it does now? A: The parliament had its powers considerably reinforced in the Maastricht treaty. It is now not just a budget chamber, but also a legislative chamber. Obviously, its sovereignty is shared with the council of member states, which also represents democratic governments. That is just where the difficulty lies. First of all, the parliament should concern itself with those questions in which it has competence, to demonstrate not only that it deserves these powers but also that it needs more. I would like to have parliament to have more powers, but let's try first with what we have, which is a new instrument. Q: Most of the candidates on the lists are unknown figures, and are likely to remain so even after they are elected. Do you agree with the list system? A: I have always preferred a system of individual constituencies because it makes members of parliament work harder for their seats. But in Spain we have a proportional system. Here the question is whether there should be a single national constituency or smaller ones. I think the electoral district should be the whole country rather than regions, because this provides a national dimension. Q: How do you see the impact of EU enlargement on Spain? A: I am worried about it, because I am afraid the government, during the recent boom, failed to take adjustment measures and to make our economy more competitive.</p>

Rammanohar Reddy; first paragraph THE HINDU </F> comment]    [Excerpt] After seven years of negotiations, yet another  deadline (December 15) draws near for completion of the  international trade talks. Meanwhile, claims and counter-claims  continue to be made about what the Dunkel Draft holds for the  Indian economy. C. Rammanohar Reddy takes a look at the issues  of importance to India: the proposals on textiles, patents,  agriculture, services and foreign investment.    The name itself, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  [GATT], is not easily comprehensible. It is an agreement and  also an institution. It is supposed to have the last word on  trade issues but it has no powers to enforce its rulings.    In `green room' consultations at Geneva, representatives of  the `contracting parties' to the GATT separate `amber' and  `green' policies as they grapple with the aggregate measurement  of support for agriculture in each country. It is appropriate  then that one of the subjects now being discussed at the GATT  has the acronym FOGS. To add to the opaqueness of language there  is the lack of transparency in negotiations. Together they have  made possible claims that range from a strong GATT ushering in  an era of global prosperity to a GATT that will oversee  recolonisation of the Third World.    As yet another deadline (December 15) draws near for  completion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade  Negotiations of the GATT, a flurry of activity in recent weeks  suggests that this time the talks may be actually completed. A  dramatic change in either the agenda or its substance will not  take place. For the most part, the Draft Final Act--the Dunkel  Draft--with modifications here and there will be the basis for  final negotiations.    Since 1948 the GATT has overseen two aspects of  international  trade. One is the evolution of guiding principles for trade and  the other is a reduction of import tariffs. Between 1948 and  1979, seven rounds of GATT-sponsored negotiations resulted in  average tariffs on manufactured goods in developed countries  being brought down from 40 to five per cent.  <H5>  Crucial eighth round </H5>   What is unique and controversial about the ongoing eighth  round is that on the agenda are issues completely new to the  GATT. The impetus for beginning a new round came in the early  Eighties from the U.S. Struggling to cope with a huge trade  deficit and besieged by protectionist forces at home, the Reagan  administration decided that the way out was to persuade the GATT  to draw up a sweeping agenda that went beyond trade in  manufactured products.  <H5>  New issues </H5>   Thus, when the new round was finally launched in 1986 at  Punta del Este in Uruguay, of the 15 issues on the agenda three  were completely new ones (services, patents and foreign  investment) and one that had been on the fringes of GATT  (agriculture).    The other 11 items on the agenda can be grouped into three  broad areas: tariffs and trade of particular products; the  effects of trade and, third, a review of the GATT. In the first  area are tariffs; non-tariff measures; tropical products;  natural resource based products and textiles. In the second area  are safeguards, subsidies and countervailing measures; and  dispute settlement. The third area covers multilateral trade  negotiation agreements; GATT articles; and functioning of the  GATT system (FOGS).    The proposals in all 15 subjects, as they have evolved over  the past seven years, are important to India. But it has been  the ones on textiles, patents, agriculture, services and foreign  investment that have generated the most controversy.  <H5>  Inclusion of textiles </H5>   Since the mid-Sixties, textiles exports to the U.S. and  western Europe have been regulated by the importing countries.  These restrictions cover in minute detail the products and the  quantities that each developing country--the main exporters--can  sell in the advanced economies. The restrictions have been  explicitly aimed at protecting the domestic clothing industries  from external competition and they have been the inspiration for  the innumerable voluntary export restraints that now operate in  the European Community and the U.S. At present the restrictions  on textiles are covered by the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA).    Though textiles should never have been exempted from  coverage  by the GATT principles of trade, it is only in the Uruguay Round  that their inclusion has been negotiated. The agreement on  textiles, as in the Dunkel Draft, does visualise a winding down  of MFA restrictions over ten years. But the transition will be  backloaded--more of the ceilings will be removed at the end  rather than during the 10-year period. During the transition  period, only 51 per cent of textile imports would have been  freed from restrictions. The remaining 49 per cent are to be  integrated `immediately' after the transition period ends.  Moreover, products that are now outside MFA have been included  in the list of textile products that are to be freed from  restrictions; thereby further backloading the transition.    Even this transition is now under threat as the U.S.  President, Mr. Bill Clinton, during his lobbying of support for  the North American Free Trade Agreement, promised interested  members of the U.S. Congress that the tentative agreement  reached at GATT would be reviewed.    An early major controversy was the proposal to include  intellectual property rights (IPRs) in the Uruguay Round. Until  now, IPRs in patents, copyrights and trademarks have been  covered by separate international conventions. As these  conventions did not have universal coverage--many countries had  independently enacted legislation--and since the U.S. and the EC  perceived breach of their national IPRs in the low and middle  income countries, the subject was put on the GATT agenda as a  trade issue. The basic objective was to tighten IPR protection  the world over. In TRIPS, there are three areas of controversy:  the impact of proposals on the Indian pharmaceutical industry,  patenting of micro-organisms and protection for breeders of  seeds.  <H5>  Product patents for drugs </H5>   The Indian pharmaceutical industry will be affected if the  present GATT proposals on IPRs are implemented. (In copyrights  and trademarks the problem relates to stricter enforcement of  existing laws). The two main issues are product patents for  drugs and extending the period of protection.    For food products, chemicals and drugs the Indian Patents  Act  of 1970 provides only process patents. The process to make a  product can be patented but not the product. Domestic  manufacturers, therefore, have had the freedom to use a  different process to make what in another country is a patented  product. Indian companes have been able to put on the market  `patented' medicines at lower prices. The Patents Act of 1970  has also given the capability to Indian industry to quickly  exploit international markets once the product patent expires  abroad. India is not the first country to have only process  patents. Until the late Seventies, a number of countries in  western Europe provided only process patents for chemicals and  drugs.    The GATT proposals on TRIPS call for uniform application of  the product patent regime. No longer will Indian companies be  able to use the process route to make drugs that are under  product patents abroad. The life of a patent in the TRIPS  proposals has been put at 20 years, compared to seven years for  drugs in India and there is a 10-year transition period for  conforming to the TRIPS proposal.    Amendment of the Indian Patents Act will, therefore, mean a  rise in prices. The issue is by how much and for how many drugs.  The prices of non-patented drugs should not be affected. The  extent of price increases of product patented drugs is, however,  not easy to estimate before hand. If they are produced in India  they will not be priced at international rates, but they will  cost substantially more than now. Drugs covered by patents in  the advanced economies and now available here make up about  10-15 per cent of the total number on the Indian market.    The GATT proposals will hurt Indian industry in the  immediate  term. But in looking at the issue from the point of view of  health what is relevant is not the quicker and cheaper  availability, at present, of drugs covered by product patents  elsewhere but how many of such drugs are essential.    On the World Health Organisation's list of some 250  essential  drugs are 12 medicines which are under product patents in  developed countries.    However, the patents issue in drugs has to be looked at in  its entirety--research and development capability, prices and  exports. A different perspective on entirety has informed policy  changes by other developing countries. One by one, countries  earlier opposed to a product patent regime have already made  changes. Mexico, Brazil and China have all embraced product  patents and longer protection regimes. Their perspective has  been one of signalling to foreign investment.  <H5>  Patenting of micro-organisms </H5>   Also in the tentative TRIPS agreement is the proposal to  patent micro-organisms which, if implemented, could have far  reaching effects in the future. The Director-General of GATT,  Mr. Peter Sutherland, has often said that under the Dunkel Draft  the discovery of a micro-organism cannot be patented but only an  invention. This is an extreme simplification of the TRIPS  proposal.    In the GATT proposal, tabled by the U.S., a mere discovery  of  a naturally occurring gene sequence cannot be patented. But if  it is purified and multiplied and is of possible commercial  value then a patent can be taken out on the micro-organism, even  if there is no alteration of the gene sequence. The defining  difference is the order of human intervention. If it is  high--irrespective of whether or not the result is man-made  cloning as in biotechnological research--then the micro-organism  can be patented.    This particular TRIPS proposal, which is being opposed by  India, could mean that a company from one country that finds use  for a micro-organism naturally occurring in another can, after  suitable human intervention, obtain a patent. This could impinge  on customary uses of the micro-organism in the home country. The  ambiguity in TRIPS is how to decide what is a high order of  intervention and what is novel about the invention. The latter,  sui generis protection, that is on the cards is the  subject of controversy.    There are four broad issues raised by farmers' organisations  and the Gene Campaign. First, the traditional practice of  farmers retaining a part of their produce for seed will no  longer be possible nor will they be able to exchange seeds among  themselves or modify them for use. Second, domestic research  will be affected. Third, there will be an increase in seed  prices. Fourth, multinational companies will take over the  Indian seed market.    All these issues are linked to the provisions of plant  breeders' rights (PBRs) contained in one kind of sui  generis form of protection that is prevalent in western  Europe and the U.S. and which could be the model for legislation  in all countries. This is the Union Pour le Protection des  Obtentions Vegetals, a convention more commonly known as UPOV.    There is the UPOV of 1978 which was superseded by a tighter  version in 1991. The UPOV 1991 extends protection to all plants  varieties. (The 1978 version was applicable to only five  species.) It also places restrictions on farmers' [passage  omitted]</p>

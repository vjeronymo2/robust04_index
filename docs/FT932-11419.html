			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (1): A revealing tale of three cities - The various names used by local inhabitants and mainland Chinese to describe Hong Kong betray contradictory perceptions which are at the heart of the current Sino-British row about the colony TO the English-speaking world, Britain's last colony of consequence is known as Hong Kong. To the local Chinese inhabitants the place is called Heung Gong. And to the colony's future sovereign power it is Xiang Gang. In a very real sense these three ways of pronouncing two Chinese characters  -which came into usage in the 13th century and mean 'fragrant harbour' - describe different places. There are significant areas of overlap - especially in perceptions about Hong Kong's role in China's modernisation drive - but the three ways of referring to the colony betray contradictory perceptions which are at the heart of the current Sino-British row about Hong Kong. For Britain, at the tail end of its 150-year administration of the colony, Hong Kong has become a symbol of honourable retreat from empire. Mr Chris Patten, Britain's 28th, and presumably last governor, invests his task with lofty meaning described in words of high sentence. 'I'm aware of the fact that a lot people are going to see a good deal of our colonial history through the prism of how we manage things in Hong Kong,' he told this newspaper last October. 'I'd like in 1997 to have been thought to have done that job honourably and honestly. (But) I don't think it's possible, probably, to do it in a way which has everybody cheering in the grandstands.' With this definition of purpose has also come a different style of leadership, and, importantly, policy. Mr Patten has sought to redefine the relationship Britain has with China on Hong Kong matters - to forge a basis for dialogue built on equality. Where, in the past, the UK was content to strike a deal on China's terms, it has decided, at the 11th hour, to change its posture from supine to assertive. This is most evident in Mr Patten's attitude towards the colony's HKDollars 175bn airport and related projects - the holy grail of his predecessor's administration - and the way in which he made proposals for Hong Kong's political development last October 7. Before Mr Patten arrived in July last year, his predecessor Lord Wilson, and the Hong Kong government, were driven by the need to build the airport. Mr Patten has moved the airport from the centre of government policy-making. Moreover, in an attempt to make it a less valuable prize for China, he has indicated that its completion is not something by which he, or Britain, chooses to be judged. 'If we can't complete the airport it will be sad for Hong Kong and very sad for China - and sad, but not tragic, for me,' he has said. In spite of China's public position that it wants the airport built before the Union Jack is lowered for the last time at midnight 30 June 1997, the airport remains hostage to the outcome of Hong Kong's great political debate. This was initiated by Mr Patten last autumn and, until 12 days ago when Anglo/Chinese talks about his blueprint finally got underway, had brought Anglo-Chinese relations to a virtual standstill. By any standard, Mr Patten's proposals are modest. They provide for a more democratic way of electing the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's law-making body, not for more democracy in government as such, or even a partially elected government. But it was the form, as much as the substance, of what Mr Patten proposed that has so angered China's leadership. His public announcement of the proposals ran counter to the accepted way of doing things: in secret and producing the outcome Beijing wanted and with which Britain could reluctantly live. By publicising the terms of future negotiations, Mr Patten sought not only to define and limit the scope of negotiations, but to make it difficult both for Britain and China to produce an outcome that was too far from what he proposed. Whether he succeeds remains to be seen. China, for its part, has little interest in Britain's 'honourable' retreat from Xiang Gang, except if the exit can be effected on terms beneficial to Beijing. From Beijing's perspective, Xiang Gang is a symbol of China's past humiliation by the west in general, and Britain in particular. It is a piece of territory to be recovered, and recovered on terms which expunge the shame of its original loss. For the Chinese government, nationalism and the question of Xiang Gang have always been related, but the recovery of the colony has taken on added nationalistic significance. As a regime struggling to justify its legitimacy, and one moreover which has shed much of its ideological raison d'etre in the pursuit of staying in power, appealing to Chinese nationalism has become a refuge in an otherwise lonely world. In the early 1980s, China might have been prepared to back its rhetoric with action and recover Xiang Gang as a barren rock - as some of Britain's leading Sinologists in the early 1980s believed - but the costs of destroying Xiang Gang today are too high, and Beijing's leadership knows it. For that reason, it would be a mistake to see China's recovery of Xiang Gang solely in political and nationalistic terms. Leaving aside the international repercussions of 'sending in the army,' or 'turning off the water,' and the effect those actions may have of Beijing's aspirations to host the Olympics in 2000 or rejoin GATT, China has a large and growing economic interest in the colony - as does Heung Gong in China - an interest which has limited Beijing's room for manoeuvre in dealing with Mr Patten. More than 60 per cent of China's trade passes through the port of Xiang Gang and it holds about half, or USDollars 20bn, of its foreign reserves in the colony. More importantly, the relationship between Xiang Gang and neighbouring Guangdong province is one of symbiosis. The colony's businessmen employ 3m in Guangdong. Destroy Xiang Gang and risk destabilising in Guangdong, China's showcase of economic reform and the place Deng Xiaoping, the country's frail leader, said all China should emulate. To that should be added China's direct financial interest in the colony. It now openly controls companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with an aggregate market value of nearly HKDollars 70bn; it owns at least three per cent of the colony's property market, a portfolio with a value of more than HKDollars 50bn. In addition, mainland Chinese interest control thousands of private companies in the colony, not to mention the 'four heavenly sisters' - Bank of China group, China Travel Service, China Merchants and China Resources. The simple fact is that Xiang Gang is a place where mainland interests - both state but increasingly private - like to do business. Senior Communist Party officials can send their children to Xiang Gang where they will be supported by any number of local tycoons anxious to ingratiate themselves with the future landlord; they can keep their wealth in a convertible currency; and, for a price, they can arrange for the next best thing to a US passport, a 'green card' that will admit them and their families to the US if the need should ever arise. In short, Xiang Gang, presents the best of both worlds: it is Chinese, but not China. In the middle, as has so often been the case, are the people of Heung Gong. Just over four years away from the transfer of sovereignty they are still uneasy and concerned about the future. Many fled communism - or are the children of those who did so - in the aftermath of Mao Zedong's victory in the Chinese civil war which erupted in the aftermath of World War Two and ended with the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949. If these and the rest of Heung Gong's ordinary citizens share anything it is the ambivalence about their present and future condition. It has become fashionable in Heung Gong to deprecate the role of the British administration in the colony's startling economic success in favour of Heung Gong's 'hard working and entrepreneurial spirit.' But ask a local person in private and he will willingly aver that without the British, Heung Gong would be not much more than Macao with a better harbour. Probe still further and you will also find a Chinese nationalist of sorts: someone who is proud of being Chinese and is rediscovering China, possibly though the learning of Mandarin, but who is still distrustful and fearful of the communists. What he wants most is to live in a Heung Gong which retains the rule of (British) law, and all the attendant freedoms which go with protection under the law, but who is afraid that come 1997 the 'old China' habits of nepotism and corruption will re-assert themselves as they are doing so daily on the mainland. Critics of Mr Patten contend that his proposals for a fairer method of electing politicians to LegCo have divided Heung Gong. More accurately, what Mr Patten's proposals, and the subsequent public debate about them, have done is simply to make plain the divisions in society that have always been there but which were wished away by his predecessors and continue to be by his opponents. Democracy, for many in Heung Gong, is not Westminster or Capitol Hill writ small in Central, but a buffer between the colony and the mainland. It is for this reason that Mr Patten's recent comment that one of the issues in the current Sino-British talks is the 'through-train' - that China will accept the electoral judgement of Heung Gong in the colony's 1995 elections and allow those who win election to sit in the post-June 1997 legislature - found such widespread support among the people, especially the educated. Heung Gong may be divided, and it may even like Mr Patten less now than it did in the heady days after his October 7 policy speech, but it has responded positively to the colony's more aggressive style of politics and the way in which LegCo challenges the government. The greater responsiveness of the government to public opinion and the assertiveness of LegCo has troubled Heung Gong's powerful business lobby. Under an earlier pre-Patten version of colonialism it held, from the perspective of today, a disproportionate sway in government policy-making. The businesee elite's response to Mr Patten - and one which had found little favour on the streets of Heung Gong - has been to seek to recreate anew with China's communist leaders its past colonial relationship with the British. Business has responded to China's blandishments. Beijing promises the business elite maintenance of its status, power and wealth. On China's past and present behaviour business leaders post-1997 might be given a token status but it is highly unlikely that they will wield any power and, as for their wealth, they will probably have to share more of it with their future ruler. Yet conflicting and contradictory as Hong Kong, Heung Gong and Xiang Gang may be, there is a point at which the British, local and mainland perceptions intersect. This is in the commonly shared view of Hong Kong's role in China's modernisation. At bottom, all views accept that if Hong Kong has a future it is as the financial and services capital of southern China, at least. And all in their own way are working for that end. Britain, by ensuring that Hong Kong has a legal and regulatory system that bolsters international confidence in the colony's financial markets; Heung Gong, by investing pell mell in the mainland; and China, by choosing Xiang Gang as the primary location for China Inc's tapping of foreign capital. Although 1997 still has the power to mesmerize and frighten, thanks to these endeavours the reality on the ground is that, sovereignty and local politics notwithstanding, the transfer has been largely completed.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Management: Gastronomic Edinburgh, behind closed doors: James Buxton says discretion is called for if you do not want to be recognised by other lunchers Holding a business lunch in a restaurant in Edinburgh or in Glasgow can be a hazardous undertaking: it could cost you business. The Scottish business and financial communities are so small that you are bound to be recognised by other lunchers. You may not wish to have your lunch with a potential client witnessed by a rival. The danger is particularly acute for the dozen-odd fund management companies based in Edinburgh, whose staff ought to be thronging the city's eating places. As Ross Lidstone, partner in Baillie Gifford, explains: 'I wouldn't dream of taking a new client to a restaurant in Edinburgh. Someone would recognise us and the game would be up.' Baillie Gifford and other companies have private dining rooms into which guests can be sprited with little fear of being seen by the opposition. The same caution is exercised by lawyers, bankers and other deal-makers engaged in any entertaining where the identity of the lunchers could be significant. Of course the same danger exists in London but although important lunches there take place in private, eating in restaurants is less risky because there are far more people and many more restaurants. Even the most gregarious Scot who has worked in both London and Scotland will confess that he lunches out much less in Edinburgh and Glasgow than in London. But there are still plenty of restaurants in the Scottish cities, and except during the Edinburgh Festival you can usually get a table in Edinburgh at short notice. The atmosphere (especially in Edinburgh) may be rather more restrained than in London and Scots may be a little brisker than the English in getting down to the subject in hand. But a Scottish business lunch is still likely to be aimed at making acquaintances and cementing relationships rather than doing deals. 'It oils the wheels,' says Giles Weaver, of Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow fund managers, 'enabling you to get the nuances that you may not get at a hard meeting in a business-oriented room'. The meal itself is likely to be light but sustaining, and is unlikely to be overtly Scottish, though locally produced meat and fish are emphasised. Having a single glass of wine rather than a bottle is becoming more common, for those people who do not confine themselves Calvinistically to Highland Spring or Strathmore mineral water (the Scottish equivalents of Perrier). The meal will be much cheaper than London, better value for money and a tip of not more than 10 per cent will usually be well received. An excellent three course lunch for two with wine at the Grill in the Balmoral, Edinburgh's new five star hotel, costs less than Pounds 40. Gourmets might go to L'Auberge, a French restaurant which a Michelin inspector would think upheld his national standards. The top restaurant in town is probably the Pompadour at the Caledonian hotel, but people only go there when they want to be really grand. A special pleasure is Martins, small, bright, personal (Martin Irons, the proprietor, is always in friendly attendance) and with an emphasis on herb flavourings, organic vegetables and Scottish cheeses. It has a private room for which there is no extra charge for those wanting discretion. For more bustle there is the Oyster Bar, off St Andrew's Square, a fish restaurant with no hang-ups about using butter and cream, heavily patronised by people from the Royal Bank of Scotland head office next door. The fact that someone with a little knowledge of the Scottish business scene should be able to put a name to a fair number of the lunchers in one of the good restaurants adds to the spice of the occasion. Nowhere would that be easier than in the New Club, the Edinburgh club where the high command of the Edinburgh establishment and lawyers, bankers, accountants and art gallery directors all sit down together for lunch. 'You're not supposed to discuss business but people do,' says an informant. In Glasgow a jollier atmosphere is noticeable the moment you step off the train. The financial community congregates at Rogano, an art deco restaurant in Exchange Place. If you want to experience the new Glasgow, go to the Ubiquitous Chip in the city's West End; for luxury and superb food go to One Devonshire Gardens, a sumptuous small hotel in the same area. Glasgow's equivalent of the New Club is the Western Club, full of advocates and men of affairs. The food may be a little stodgy but each day after lunch there are two or three tables of bridge players, where people cut in at end of a rubber.</p>

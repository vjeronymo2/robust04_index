			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: UK follows rallies in Europe and US THE LONDON stock market stood up bravely yesterday to the disturbing political developments reported from Russia overnight. While not underestimating the potential seriousness of the situation, UK investors took heart from the rallies in other European markets and the FT-SE 100 Index, down 26.6 in early trading, finished nearly six points higher on the day, comfortably regaining the 3,000 mark. Even the initial setback of around 0.9 per cent in London was less than suffered elsewhere in Europe, and considerably less than the fall in UK stocks at the time of the abortive anti-Gorbachev coup. Little selling was reported and a good lead from stock index futures soon brought bargain hunters into the stock market. Firmness in the dollar helped US-influenced blue chips, with the pharmaceutical sector standing out well while awaiting formal publication of President Clinton's health care proposals. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 up 5.9 at 3,007.5. Equities had opened lower as London digested the news from Russia and the subsequent 38-point fall in the Dow Industrial Average and 292-point setback in the Nikkei average. Within one hour of the official opening, the Footsie was down to 2,975, some 4.5 per cent below the trading peak reached at the end of last month. Had the market continued to fall, equity strategists would have been looking hard at the next support levels, believed to be in the Footsie 2,960 area. However, the mood changed as Europe became more optimistic ahead of the opening of the new session on Wall Street. Led by a good premium on the December stock index contract, UK equities regained confidence, although gains were restrained at first as some UK houses sold equities against their holdings in the stock index futures. The market moved upwards steadily, helped by early firmness in New York. When London closed for the day, the Dow Average was showing a 4.75 gain. 'Expect a recovery in share prices unless there is a civil war (in Russia),' commented the European equity team at Goldman Sachs. A civil war, which the analysts regard as unlikely, would mean a 5 to 10 per cent decline, with Germany suffering most. However, the Goldman team accepts that other outcomes to the Russian situation are possible. The success of the UK market in again holding to the Footsie 3,000 benchmark raised hopes that, barring serious developments in eastern Europe, London share prices may have seen the worst of the September shakeout. Yesterday's performance from equities was all the more positive because corporate trading news, still a major concern for investors, remained somewhat inconclusive. Spring Ram, a house-fitting group which had been a market favourite, closed firmly in spite of disclosure of dismal trading figures and the dismissal of some directors and City advisers. With second-line issues somewhat brushed aside yesterday, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index dipped 1.5 to 3,427.5. Seaq volume picked up late in the session to reach a total of 670.7m shares, compared with 538.4m on Tuesday, when retail, or customer, business revived strongly to record a value of Pounds 1.13bn.</p>

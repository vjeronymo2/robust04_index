			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREED CHINESE DISSIDENTS TELL OF BRUTALITY IN PRISON  </P> <P> Chinese caught in waves of arrests after the army's suppression of the  pro-democracy movement are emerging from prisons with descriptions of  overcrowded prison cells, beatings and brutal interrogations, foreign diplomats  said Sunday.  </P> <P> At least 5,000 people have been arrested in Beijing alone, the diplomats added,  quoting informed Chinese sources.  </P> <P> The Chinese capital has been under martial law since May 20. Arrests are often  made at night by plainclothes police in unmarked cars. Suspects disappear  without their families being informed.  </P> <P> "You don't know where you are taken. You don't know where you are," said one  former prisoner.  </P> <P> Conditions vary. One well-known intellectual, who was detained for several  days, said he was treated humanely and had no complaints, according to the  diplomats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unbearably Hot Cells  </P> <P> Several others described small, unbearably hot cells packed so tightly with 40  to 60 people that there was no room to lie down. The toilet was a bucket.  </P> <P> Nobody who has been in prison and later released wants to be identified in  reports by journalists. Most do not want to talk at all, the diplomats said.  </P> <P> Interrogations are sometimes preceded by a beating, according to two accounts.  A student was hit by electric prods, a writer by rifle butts.  </P> <P> Martial law troops and police alike use violence -- the worst beatings  apparently administered to workers and unemployed youths who fought the army  with Molotov cocktails and rocks when armored troops crashed through Beijing to  Tian An Men Square on the weekend of June 3-4.  </P> <P> It appears that many Chinese arrested have been released and then some detained  for a second or third time, the diplomats said.  </P> <P> Also on Sunday, the new head of China's Communist Party put his stamp of  leadership on the governing party with the release Sunday of an essay on  discipline.  </P> <P> Jiang Zemin took a hard line on fighting corruption and enforcing obedience to  central leadership -- both issues that senior party leaders have accused his  predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, of neglecting. Zhao was ousted as party leader last  month.  </P> <P> Jiang's essay was printed in full in the magazine Party Building and summarized  in leading newspapers Sunday.  </P> <P> "We must sternly observe unified party discipline, namely: The individual obeys  the group, the minority obeys the majority, the lower levels obey the upper  levels, the whole party obeys the center," Jiang said.  </P> <P> "We cannot allow the unchecked spread of individualism, separatism and money  worship."  </P> <P> The People's Daily said the essay was written in May.  </P> <P> It was the second essay by Jiang to be widely disseminated in recent weeks. In  the first Jiang wrote about the "dangers" of allowing businessmen to get too  rich from private enterprise.  </P> <P> In the essay published Sunday, Jiang said: "Today many people's thinking is  lively, and they dare to express various views, which of course is a good  thing. But we party members must ponder deeply new ideological trends and  public opinion and keep clear heads."  </P></p>

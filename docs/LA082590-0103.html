			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETAIL GASOLINE PRICES SOAR, BUT FUTURES DIVE;  </P> <P> PETROLEUM: PRICES AT WESTERN PUMPS WERE HIGHEST, AT $1.359 A GALLON. A CONSUMER  GROUP SAYS SIMPLE GREED IS THE CULPRIT.  </P> <P> Profit taking drove crude oil and gasoline futures prices down sharply Friday,  but a new survey showed that prices at the corner gasoline station have jumped  to their highest levels since Independence Day, 1982.  </P> <P> By Friday, pump prices had risen to an average of $1.274 a gallon nationally  for self-serve unleaded regular gasoline, a sharp 3.7-cent increase over  Monday's figure and up 19.9 cents since Aug. 1, the day before the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait, according to a survey by the American Automobile Assn.  </P> <P> Prices were highest in the West, where they averaged $1.359 a gallon, and  lowest in the Mid-Atlantic states, where they averaged $1.236, according to the  survey of about 5,000 stations. California averaged $1.316 a gallon, a  17.7-cent increase since July 4, the last time the association surveyed  California prices.  </P> <P> Oil industry officials said the sharp increases reflect companies' attempts to  avoid runaway demand by middlemen and motorists, the increasingly high  replacement cost of crude oil and the high price of gasoline on spot markets.  </P> <P> But a consumer group repeated charges that the price increases reflect simple  greed by oil companies eager to reap windfall profits from the current Middle  East crisis -- charges that industry officials denied.  </P> <P> On the New York Mercantile Exchange, meanwhile, crude oil and gasoline futures  prices were way off after reaching record highs a day earlier, as traders took  profits before the weekend amid continuing uncertainty about political and  military events in the Middle East.  </P> <P> "It was a bit of a strange day," said Kevin M. Kelly, manager of futures  trading for Chevron Corp.'s international oil company in San Francisco. "The  mood of the day was simply profit taking in the absence of any substantial news  in a market that was already quite long."  </P> <P> The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark grade of  crude oil, closed at $30.91 a barrel, a drop of $1.02. Unleaded gasoline for  September delivery closed at $1.0466, down 3.89 cents from its record level  Thursday.  </P> <P> On Thursday, oil prices finished at their highest levels since 1983. At one  point Thursday, the October contract traded at $32.35 a barrel, equal to the  all-time high reached Aug. 2, 1983. In the last week, gasoline futures have  been closing at their highest levels since trading began in 1984.  </P> <P> Trading throughout the day was volatile. Prices went down immediately after the  opening but rose at various points on word of refinery problems at Lyondell  Petrochemical Co.'s Houston refinery and a false rumor that President Bush had  suffered a stroke, traders said.  </P> <P> Prices were ultimately driven down partly in response to the drop on London  markets, where traders cashed out their positions in anticipation of a British  three-day holiday weekend. Some fears may have eased on news that Iraq had  pulled back elite troops from the border with Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Prices also fell on prospects for a meeting Sunday by some members of the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss boosting production  quotas to offset the shortfall in world crude oil supplies resulting from the  international embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude, some traders said.  </P> <P> But other traders discounted the OPEC news. It was not clear Friday how many  OPEC members will actually attend the meeting, or whether any useful agreement  will come of it.  </P> <P> In any case, traders agreed that Friday's price drop was likely to be  temporary, given continuing anxiety about the Iraqi situation, and that prices  could zoom up again Monday if the Middle East heats up over the weekend.  </P> <P> "The market's really still trading very much on news," said Tom Bentz, director  of futures trading at United Energy Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> Gasoline prices could resume their upward trajectory if continuing refinery  problems threaten to constrain gasoline supplies. The automobile association  reported Friday that gasoline supplies remain adequate for now.  </P> <P> But on Friday, a unit at the Lyondell refinery in Houston was shut down after a  line ruptured and spewed a nontoxic catalyst into the air.  </P> <P> No fire was reported, but the unit -- which each day processes about 90,000  barrels of heavy fuel oils into light petroleum products, mainly gasoline --  will be closed for about 10 days. That will reduce the refinery's total  production of gasoline by about a third, said David Harpole, a spokesman for  Lyondell, which is 49.9% owned by Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co.  </P> <P> Also on Friday, Chevron said it would take down a catalytic cracker unit at its  El Segundo refinery for routine maintenance for three weeks beginning Sept. 7.  The unit normally makes about 40,000 barrels of gasoline a day. But a spokesman  said supplies of gasoline have already been stockpiled to tide the refinery  over.  </P></p>

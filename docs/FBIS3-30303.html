			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, January 28 (CTK) -- The Committee for the  Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted (VONS) has called for the  dismissal of Justice Minister Jiri Novak, accusing him of not  sufficiently purging the judiciary of judges who breached human  rights before the November 1989 revolution with their unjust  verdicts.    In the past four years, the overall state of the judiciary,  the prosecutors' offices and of the prison service has not  changed much, and representatives of the former regime continue  to exercise their influence in these areas, VONS says in an open  letter sent to Novak today, the content of which they revealed  at a press conference.    Representatives said they had been asking Novak to purge the  judiciary in accordance with the law. They gave him their notes  on 42 judges who had life appointments but who before November  1989 had "seriously and often more than once breached basic  human rights by unjustly giving them unconditional prison  sentences."    The list was then reduced to 24 because some of the judges  have left the judiciary. After negotiations with Novak ten more  were removed from the list, but VONS insists that the remaining  14 should leave the judiciary.    VONS is an organization founded by 16 charter 77 signatories  in 1978 to protest against political imprisonments. Among them  was Vaclav Havel, who has since 1989 asked for his membership to  be revoked. In 1989 the organization had 32 members, now it has  23.    VONS representative and Vice Chairman of the Christian  Democratic Party (KDS) Vaclav Benda said that he had told  Premier Vaclav Klaus several days ago about VONS' demand that  Novak be removed. Klaus is chairman of the Civic Democratic  Party, the party which on the basis of coalition agreements was  given the position of justice minister to fill. Klaus had not  commented on his proposal, Benda said.    VONS committee members said that Interior Minister Jiri  Ruml,  a VONS member, had also been informed of the organization's  request.</p>

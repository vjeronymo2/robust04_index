			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA writer Marina Denisova: "Newspapers </F> Appear on Television"]    [Text] The desire of Yegor Yakovlev's OBSHCHAYA GAZETA to  have their own television air time has been fulfilled. On  Wednesday, 26 January, viewers of Rossiya Channel were able to  see a program presented by the new television company  Oblik--"Off Guard, or Newspaper Stories." The cofounders of  Oblik along with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA were the independent  television company REN-TV and Tatyana Menshikova (past director  of the Politika Studio in Ostankino).    The information base for the new television program is made  up of published and unpublished materials (from investigations  to "Love Story") of journalists from various newspapers: NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, IZVESTIYA, LITERATURNAYA  GAZETA, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, and others. This certainly does not  mean that the journalists will be running with microphones and  cameras in hand after heroes for their articles. "This  absolutely does not mean that `Newspaper Stories' will be a  symbiosis of commentary and pathos," says Tatyana Menshikova.  "And this program does not intend to exist as a television  version of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, although we do not deny that we  subscribe to its ideology. In general the system of constraints  has been thoroughly developed: No coverage of catastrophes on  the screen, no direct assessments of events and phenomena, no  interviews with politicians, not a lot of talking during the  sequence--everyone is tired of this already."    In terms of form "Newspaper Stories" will be four 10-minute  films. They will be films because the program is made by movie  makers--die-hards of domestic television documentation like  director Aleksandr Orkin and the young people from the VGIK  [All-Union State Institute of Cinematography].    "Newspaper Stories" is fundamentally positive in terms of  direction and intends to actively advocate nonviolence in the  best traditions of pacifism.    The example of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA is being followed by other  publications: CHASTNAYA ZHIZN, which is known for its  predilection for the spicy and the racy, along with the  independent studio Antrepriza HCD on a parity basis will begin  to film the half-hour, absolutely apolitical program "Television  `Private Life'" which will air in Moscow once every two weeks  starting on 13 February. The program will be a television  version of the newspaper, and many rubrics of "Private Life"  ("He and She," "Candid Interview," "C'est la Vie") will begin  their television life soon.</p>

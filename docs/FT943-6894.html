			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Putting a finger on security Identifying people by fingerprints has long appeared an attractive way of combating fraud. Startek, a Taiwan-based company, has devised a fingerprint identification system which it believes is reliable enough to be used as a security device. It uses a small scanning device to take a 'picture' of a fingerprint, which is compared with one previously registered in a computer system, in a process lasting about three seconds. It says that fewer than 1 per cent of prints are falsely rejected, while fewer than one in 100,000 prints is falsely accepted. Startek Engineering: Taiwan, tel 886 35 785388; fax 886 35 787089</p>

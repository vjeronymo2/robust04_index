			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The items discussed above are relative and can be defined differently among the applicants from various geographic regions. Each pre-application should define these items and terms as they relate to the specific project. Include a succinct explanation of how the project can serve as a model in other settings and how it addresses a high-priority environmental justice issue. The degree to which a project addresses a high-priority environmental justice issue will vary and must be defined by applicants according to their local environmental justice concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. How Much Money May Be Requested, and Are Matching Funds Required?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ceiling for any one grant is $20,000 in Federal funds. Depending on the funds appropriated by Congress, EPA's 10 regional offices will each have approximately $300,000 to issue awards.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicants are not required to cost share. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Who May Submit Pre-Applications and May an Applicant Submit More Than One?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any affected community group (for example, community-based/grassroots organization, church, school, education agency, college or university, or other non-profit organizations) and Tribal government may submit a pre-application upon publication of this solicitation. Applicants  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> must be incorporated and non-profit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to receive these Federal funds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Individuals are not eligible to receive grants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The qualifications of the project manager and other individuals participating in the proposed project will be an important factor in the selection process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider only one pre-application per applicant for a given project. Applicants may submit more than one pre-application as long as the pre-applications are for separate and distinct projects or activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants who were previously awarded funds may submit an application for FY 1995. The FY 1995 pre-application may or may not have any relationship to the project funded in FY 1994. Every pre-application for FY 1995 will be evaluated based upon the merit of the proposed project in relation to the other FY 1995 pre-applications, regardless of whether the proposal would expand a project funded in a previous year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Are There Any Restrictions on the Use of the Federal Funds?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Yes. Among other things,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA funds cannot be used <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as matching funds for other Federal grants, for construction, legal/attorney fees, or buying furniture. Refer to 40 CFR 30.410 ``How does EPA determine Allowable Costs?''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Pre-Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. What is a Pre-Application?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The pre-application contains four parts: 1) the ``Application for Federal Assistance'' form (Standard Form 424/SF 424), 2) the ``Budget Information: Non-Construction Programs'' form (Standard Form 424A/SF 424A), 3) a work plan (described below), and 4) certifications/assurances forms. These documents contain all the information EPA needs to evaluate the merits of your pre-application. Finalists may be asked to submit additional information to support their projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. How Must the Pre-Application Be Submitted and Specifically What Must the Standard Forms (SF) 424 and (SF) 424A, and the Work Plan Include?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant must submit the original pre-application signed by a person duly authorized by the governing board of the applicant and one copy of the pre-application (double-sided encouraged). Pre-applications must be reproducible (for example, stapled once in the upper left hand corner, on white paper, and with page numbers).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described above, a pre-application contains an SF 424, SF 424A, a work plan, and certifications/assurances. The following describes the contents and requirements of the SF 424, SF 424A, the work plan, and the certifications/assurances forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The percentages next to the items discussed below are the weights EPA will use to evaluate the applicant's pre-application. Please note that certain sections are given greater weight than others. The required forms described below can be obtained by calling or writing to the EPA contacts listed at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Application for Federal Assistance (SF 424). An SF 424 is an official form required for all Federal grants which requests basic information about the applicant and the proposed grant project.

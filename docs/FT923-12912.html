			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Bundesbank knows its credibility is at stake / Preview of today's council meeting. The outcome is awaited eagerly at home and abroad CREDIBILITY is a fragile thing. That uncomfortable thought will be in the minds of the Bundesbank's council members when they sit down today for a meeting whose result will be awaited apprehensively in Germany and abroad. With the money supply growing well beyond the target for 1992, the Bundesbank's credibility is clearly at stake - both in the financial community and among Germany's stability-conscious citizens. Inflation is still above 4 per cent a year and recent wage settlements have been higher than the Bundesbank would like. But drastic action by the central bank would have severe consequences for other European countries. Nor does the Bonn government, struggling to put its finances in order under the weight of the high cost of unification, want to see the German economy hit by another interest rate blast. Economists' opinions on what the Bundesbank will do vary widely. The consensus is that it will take some action to show concern over monetary developments, but be careful not to go too far. After all the advance speculation, a decision to do nothing could harm credibility. 'They've got to do something,' says Mr Jurgen Pfister, economist at Commerzbank. 'But they will want to keep its effects limited. Thus it will be largely a symbolic move to show that they are worried and want others to take the problem seriously, but they also want to avoid any disruptions in the European Monetary System or harm to other economies.' So he and others reckon a further half-point rise in the discount rate to 8.5 per cent is most likely. This would narrow the gap with the more important Lombard rate (now 9.75 per cent), which would be left alone. It could be combined with technical measures to limit commercial banks' access to central bank funds. 'Jacking up the Lombard doesn't seem to be on the cards,' believes Mr Richard Reid, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew's Frankfurt office. 'Most attention is focused on the discount rate or access to Lombard credits.' Action on these fronts would, he says, 'have a signalling effect without a disruptive effect'. Apart from not wanting to overbalance the EMS, the Bundesbank is also aware that the monetary data are far from clear. Much of the pressure behind the 9 per cent annualised growth in M3 this year has come from high lending to finance east Germany's economic reconstruction; investment subsidies make a large part of this insensitive to interest rates. Uncertainty over the government's caused funds to pile up in high-yielding short-term deposits. Moreover, M3 has been swollen by large holdings of the D-Mark in eastern Europe. Bank lending, up by an annualised 12 per cent this year, has also financed property purchases. According to Mr Martin Hufner, economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, 'the high credit expansion is less threatening than it looks at first sight. The restrictive policies are working.' The problem, however, recognised by Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger and his colleagues, is that its target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent for M3 growth in 1992 looks embarrassing in view of this year's monetary pace. It is unlikely that the target will be changed. That would damage credibility further. But meeting it is also virtually impossible now. Moreover, changes in monetary policy take at least a year to have an impact. So the real concentration is on ensuring the right conditions for slower M3 growth in 1993. But that does not mean the Bundesbank's council members have to act now, some argue. 'It would be best if they sit on their hands, bite their lips, and say they will wait until M3 comes down,' says Mr Nigel Rendell, economist with stockbrokers James Capel in London. Mr Paul Brunker of Robert Fleming also opposes any in-between measures. 'The logical alternatives are to raise the Lombard or do nothing.' The dilemma for the Bundesbank is how to balance the need to be effective with the desire not to be disruptive. Thus what the Bundesbank says today about the confused monetary scene could be just as important as what it decides. Despite international concern, it will regard its main audience as the politicians in Bonn and citizens throughout Germany.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- THE SCENE ON THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Heinrich Schreiner, Rhineland Palatinate 'Says Little'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Wilheim Nolling, Hamburg 'Explosive'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Dieter Hiss, Berlin, 'Thinker'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Hans-Georg Hermann, Bremen vice-president 'standing in'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Jurgen Mollemann, Bonn economics minister, No vote, 'just visiting'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Helmut Schlesinger, President 'Stubborn Bavarian'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Hans Tietmeyer, Vice-president 'tough negotiator'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Lothar Muller, Bavaria 'Arch-Schemer'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Johann Wilheim Gaddum, Credit markets 'Friend of Chancellor Kohl'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Gunter Storch, Personnel 'Galvanised by unification'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Warner Schulz, Schleswig-Holstein 'Thrusting'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Reimut Jochimsen, North-Rhine Westphalia 'Keen political antennae'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Hans Jurgen Koebrick, Saar 'Ex-mayor of Saarbrucken'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Helmut Schieber, Banks 'Competent insider'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Wendelin Hartmann, Payments 'Computer expert'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Guntram Palm, Baden-Wurttemberg 'Newcomer'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Otmar Issing, Economics 'Amiable but orthodox'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Karl Thomas, Hesse 'Thoughtful hawk'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Helmut Hesse, Lower Saxony 'Sensitive professor'  ------------------------------------------------------------------- German monetary policy is thrashed out round a big oval table at the Bundesbank's forbidding headquarters in Frankfurt.  Eighteen men have a vote (never disclosed): the Bundesbank's seven permanent directors and the heads of 11 regional central banks.  Bonn's economics minister can drop in for the council meetings but cannot vote.  Decisions emerge from a complex interplay of financial juggling and political sensitivity, influenced by the widely differing regional and personal backgrounds of the players and their personal characteristics.  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

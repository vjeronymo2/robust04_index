			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTRIGUING SAGA  </P> <P> Congratulations to Evelyn De Wolfe for her continuing series on the issue of  asbestos in buildings. As a former executive for a large, publicly held  asbestos removal firm and as current owner of Asbestos Advisory Associates (a  consulting firm) it has been intriguing to watch the asbestos saga unfold.  </P> <P> A material originally installed to safeguard the public and help conserve  energy is "suddenly" declared a carcinogen by the government. Clean up and  related costs run in the hundreds of billions of dollars. An industry is  created almost overnight to deal with the problem, but legislation needed to  both regulate that industry and to inform and protect the public is nonexistent  or conflicting at best, from agency to agency, jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  </P> <P> It is my hope that Ms. De Wolfe's series will continue to fulfill the public's  need for increased awareness relative to this still-confusing issue.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER K. GALE  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

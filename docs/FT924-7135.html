			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Loyalist' PPSs chosen FIVE Conservative back-benchers from the 1992 intake yesterday took their first steps towards government by becoming parliamentary private secretaries  -the unpaid 'eyes and ears' in the Commons for ministers. Downing Street described those promoted as 'loyalists' in an unspoken reminder that Euro-sceptics and other rebels must mend their ways if they seriously seek preferment. The appointments were: Mr Stephen Milligan (Eastleigh), PPS to defence minister, Mr Jonathan Aitken; Mr George Kynoch (Kincardine and Deeside), for Mr Alastair Goodlad, junior foreign office minister; Mr Hartley Booth (Finchley), for Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister; Mr Jonathan Evans (Brecon), for Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister; Mr Michael Bates (Langbaurgh), for Mr Nicholas Scott, social security minister.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Massey tractor sales rise 22% UK sales of tractors from Massey Ferguson's plant in Coventry will be 22 per cent higher this year than last, reflecting an overall surge in the purchases of farm machinery. The group said that by the end of the year it would have sold 2,300 Coventry-made tractors in Britain compared with 1,880 last year. A further 2,000 Massey Ferguson tractors made in Beauvais, France, would also be sold in the UK. The company claims to be the largest tractor producer in the UK, but usually 80 per cent of its output is exported. The domestic market leader is thought to be Ford, followed by Massey Ferguson and then Case and Deere. Between them the four supply 80 per cent of the market. The Agricultural Engineers Association estimated that this year UK farmers will buy 18,000 tractors and that there will be sales of a further 1,100 compact tractors with a power output of less than 40 horsepower. Total sales for 1993 of 19,100 compare with 14,296 in 1992, the most depressed year for tractor sales since the second world war. The UK market has been exceptional in Europe. 'Farmers have had money put in their pockets,' said Mr Aaron Jones, managing director of Massey Ferguson. 'UK farming has had a good year, but it has been fortuitous. This is derived from the downward movement of sterling against the Ecu,' said Mr Chris Evans, chief economist of the Agricultural Engineers Association. This year farmers have on average received about 15 per cent more revenue than they expected, he added. The availability of cash coincided with latent demand built up because of low equipment purchases in recent years and the opportunity to take 40 per cent capital allowances until last November. Massey Ferguson noted a start to the domestic buying surge last April. The rise in sales was one factor behind revisions to its production schedules and the hiring of 160 fixed-contract staff to supplement its normal 1,550-strong workforce. In early 1993 the Coventry plant expected to build 13,500 tractors this year. Now it expects annual output to be about 17,000 for markets worldwide as, Mr Jones claimed, Massey Ferguson wins a larger market share in Europe and as distributors in Europe and North America build up stocks.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Poland's hero strikers fall from grace: A sea-change in the country's labour relations POLAND'S reputation for powerful, strike-prone trade unions is due for revision after the collapse of a seven-week strike at the FSM-Fiat car plant in southern Poland. The strike began as one of a clutch of labour stoppages in coal and copper mines and at the Mielec aircraft factory which greeted the new coalition government headed by Ms Hanna Suchocka in mid-July. All have now ended without direct government intervention, sending a clear signal to workers and foreign investors of the new government's intention to change the basic rules of labour relations. The outlines of the policy were revealed earlier this month when Ms Suchocka unveiled an 'enterprise pact' calling on the unions and workers to draw up privatisation plans for their enterprises and involve themselves in collective wage bargaining with management. The government's refusal to get drawn into the summer strikes, even that at FSM which threatened to derail Fiat's planned Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) takeover of the company, was the first sign of its determination to change the political and emotional climate surrounding labour issues. Mr Henryk Goryszewski, the deputy prime minister with overall responsibility for economic matters, said: 'We have to do away with the old idea that strikers are national heroes, fighting for a free Poland against communism. Poland is now a normal country. Strikers' rights to wave the national flag really ended with the first free elections.' Such forthright views represent a sea-change in a country headed by Mr Lech Walesa, probably the most famous strike leader in history, where strikes were the main weapon against the regime for decades. The groundwork for the new policy was laid by former Solidarity activists like Mr Jacek Kuron, now the labour minister. He not only has to wean the unions away from strike action but also persuade pensioners that their payments must be cut to avoid an inflationary budget deficit. All these unexpected new developments were only dimly perceived by strikers at FSM demanding wage increases which, if granted, would have driven a coach and horses through the government's economic strategy. A deal which the strikers could have claimed as a victory would have fuelled inflation and discouraged potential foreign investors already put off by a year of political uncertainty. For the strikers, however, it was difficult to understand how achieving a 'decent living wage' could have had such catastrophic consequences for the Polish economy. 'We are producing cars of a European quality on the latest machinery. So why can't we be paid more like our counterparts in Italy?' one of the workers asked. But the demand for wages equivalent to 10 per cent of the retail value of Fiat's new Cinquencento model lost them support from unions representing workers in other state enterprises who have seen their real wages fall by more than 15 per cent over the last year. Having already been promised a 30 per cent increase by Fiat, the FSM strikers demand for more was perceived as both unrealistic and excessive by other unions. The still-Polish management, backed by Fiat, agreed during talks in July to raise pay 30 per cent above the current average gross wage of around 3m zlotys (Pounds 113) per month. Fiat agreed to pay the rises only when it took over its 90 per cent ownership of the plant. This it refused to do while the strike continued, leaving the financial costs to be borne by the Polish government. But the strike lost Fiat the production of more than 15,000 of its newest and most popular models and ruined an expensive advertising campaign. To its chagrin, Fiat saw Subaru of Japan grab a toehold in a key sector of the Italian market by selling 6,000 of its own small cars in a market deprived of the Polish-made Cinquencento. The strike also stopped recruitment of an additional 2,000 Polish workers needed to man a third shift designed to raise output from 160,000 to 240,000 cars a year. Faced with government refusal to intervene, lack of support from the Catholic church and growing pressure from the 18,000 non-striking workers at FSM and the older plant at nearby Bialsko Biala, the isolated strikers finally accepted defeat. But the actors in the drama have paid a high price for the resolution of a conflict. Polish labour relations will never be quite the same again, but it will take all Fiat's management skills to erase the legacy of bitterness. Editorial comment, Page 18</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Bar exams inquiry - Legal Briefs THE UK Commission for Racial Equality has confirmed that it is to conduct a formal investigation into the Council for Legal Education, which runs the finals course for the Bar. The inquiry follows complaints about the high failure rate of ethnic minority students. Preliminary inquiries have produced sufficient grounds for belief that discrimination may have occurred in the Council's examination system (the Bar exams), the CRE says. The start of the formal investigation will be delayed until September, however, to allow an interim report by the Council's own inquiry team to be published in August.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Nac Re to establish reinsurance arm in UK NAC RE Corporation, the eighth largest US reinsurance company, intends to inject Pounds 50m into a new London-based reinsurance subsidiary. The move signals growing investor interest in international reinsurance markets where rates are increasing following heavy losses in recent years and represents a vote of confidence for the London reinsurance market which has seen a number of withdrawals in recent months. 'The accelerated pace of change in the London market and the need for stable, financially secure reinsurers, presents Nac Re with an exceptional opportunity to expand and diversify its client bade,' said Mr Ronald Bornhuetter, president and chief executive. 'We believe that London remains the best location to assess high quality international reinsurance business,' he added. Several large companies, including Victory Re, the subsidiary of International Nederlande Groep and NWRe, the joint venture between Winterthur of Switzerland, Norwich Union and Chiyoda, pulled out of the market earlier this year and a number of other players have reduced their exposures. Nac Re is establishing a London contact office for the new venture, pending regulatory approval. Mr Charles Catt, formerly assistant general manager with NWRe, is to head the new venture. Mr Bornhuetter said Mr Catt 'shares our commitment to financial security, disciplined underwriting and superior client service.' Nac Re underwrote gross premiums of Dollars 366m (Pounds 238m) in 1992.</p>

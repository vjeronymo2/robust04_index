			<p>BFN     [Text] The honorable minister of home affairs, Mr. Lesao  Lehohla, this morning issued a statement clarifying the  so-called task force which is being reported as preparing to  come to Lesotho.    In his statement the minister said it had come to the  attention of the government that the publication of news over  the foreign radio stations and other media, in connection with  the so-called task force coming to Lesotho, had again spread  confusion in the ranks of some of the country's armed forces.  The statement said, as previously, the issue of the task force,  which resulted from the recent police strike, was a  demonstration of the enthusiasm of SADC [Southern African  Development Community] countries to help in the resolution  through peaceful means, the difficulty of the lack of stability,  not only in Lesotho but in other countries in the region, in the  interest of bringing about peace and economic development in the  region.    He said the issue of the task force should therefore be  understood as a group of people, in the present circumstances,  foreign ministers who have been charged with the responsibility  to make an in depth investigation into the cause of the lack of  stability in Lesotho.

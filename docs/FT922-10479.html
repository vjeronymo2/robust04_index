			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'No alternative to tobacco crop' GROWING ALTERNATIVE crops such as cut-flowers or fruit is not a viable option for most tobacco producers, according to a report from the International Tobacco Growers' Association. The report, published yesterday, is the growers' answer to campaigners against tobacco, who claim that a reduction in the land and labour devoted to the tobacco industry would help to stop people smoking. Tobacco production in Zimbabwe, Malawi, the US and Canada is studied in the report, which identifies Canada as the only case where substitution might be possible, given the country's climatic disadvantages, falling domestic consumption and failure to find new export markets. In Zimbabwe and Malawi, however, many of the possible alternative crops 'are limited by instability, risk or difficulties in marketing and could take several years to yield their first returns'.

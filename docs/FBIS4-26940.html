			<p>BFN     [Text] Recently, our staff reporter Wu Naitao conducted an  exclusive interview with Feng Bing, deputy secretary-general of  the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System  (SCRES). Feng answered a number of questions raised by our staff  reporter concerning China's economic system reform.    QUESTION: What influence will the 1994 reform measures exert  on China's economy and social stability?    ANSWER: This year will be crucial for China's economic  system  reform, and a series of reform measures for the finance,  taxation, banking, foreign trade, enterprise and social security  systems have been published and put into practice. The  difficulty, complexity and importance of the work have in no way  been underestimated. The programs per se and the influence  which may be exerted by the reform measures have been  comprehensively considered and countermeasures have been worked  out by relevant departments.    For instance, implementation of the system whereby tax  revenues are shared by central and local authorities will  undoubtedly be of great importance for bringing about a better  balance in the distribution relations between the central and  local authorities. It will also promote the rational growth of  government revenue and properly strengthen the financial might  and macro-economic control ability of the central government.  The reform fully considers the interests of both local  governments and enterprises. The existing interest pattern of  local governments will be maintained and the goal of reform will  be gradually reached. The amount of tax revenues to be returned  to the local governments by the central authorities will be  based on 1993 figures. Subsidies of the central authorities,  the amount of tax revenues turned over to the higher authorities  by the local governments and the settlement of accounts involved  in the original systems will temporarily remain unchanged  following implementation of the new revenue sharing system.  After a period of time, the items will gradually be  standardized and supplemented by other auxiliary measures to  ensure smooth implementation of the new system.    Implementation of a unified 33 percent income tax rate for  domestic enterprises will naturally have a positive impact on  fair tax burdens and opportunities for equal competition among  enterprises, and will bring about orderly competition and stable  growth of the Chinese economy. In consideration of the actual  situation in regard to the low profits earned by some  enterprises, various appropriate transitional and preferential  measures have been adopted. In terms of other reform measures,  transitional measures for the continuity of policies have been  planned and special consideration has been given to vested  interests. The reform will furnish a relatively stable interest  mechanism for the smooth establishment of the new system.    In short, following 10-odd years of economic system reform,  the psychological tolerance of the Chinese people has been  greatly enhanced. In terms of the relative advantages or  scientific nature of the new system, consideration contained in  the reform measures for vested interests and appropriate  transitional arrangements provide ample conditions for  implementing the new system. Necessary measures will be adopted  to overcome certain problems that may surface, such as the  latent losses of enterprises becoming open losses, low profits  turning into losses, and enterprises finding it difficult to  raise funds. The measures will also ensure the smooth  establishment of the new system.    Q: What is the role of China's public economy, and what is  the target for reform of public ownership?    A: China is a socialist society, and the essence of  socialism  is to liberate and develop productive forces, eradicate  exploitation, remove polarization and in the end to attain the  goal of common prosperity. The establishment of socialist  public ownership is designed to liberate productive forces and  attain the goal of common prosperity. Whether or not the  superiority can be brought into full play depends on the  flexibility of the allocation of resources and efficiency.  Prior to reform and opening to the outside world, China  basically implemented a system based on a planned economy, and  the system was characterized by a high degree of centralism and  a rejection of the functions of market mechanisms. The system  led to the irrational allocation of resources and low economic  returns which seriously hampered the enhancement of the  comprehensive might of the state and the vitality of  enterprises. Practice of reform and opening over the past  decade and more has proved that the substitution of the market  economy for the planned economy signifies the further liberation  of productive forces. This aspect, plus the effective  macro-economic control of the government, will further bring the  superiority of the socialist public economy into play. Socialist  public ownership is indeed harmonious with the market economy.  The orientation of reform is to enable socialist public  ownership to better suit the demands of the market economy and  to meet the objective demands of market competition.    China's market economic structure has merged with the basic  system of socialism. Along with the deepening of reform and  continued improvement of the socialist market economy, in terms  of the structure of ownership, a pattern will be shaped which  features the long-term common development of various economic  sectors, with public ownership serving as the main body and the  national economy as the leading factor and which is supplemented  by the individual, private and foreign-funded economies.  Different economic sectors can voluntarily engage in various  forms of associated operations, and state-owned, collective and  other enterprises can enter into the market. State-owned  enterprises will play a leading role in the practice of equal  competition.    Q: What measures will China take to reduce the imbalance  in development between different regions, and how will China  solve any negative impact which may arise?    A: The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues  Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic  Structure has, in a sense, offered various avenues and real  possibilities for narrowing the imbalance between various  regions throughout the country. At present, most of the vast  economically underdeveloped regions in China are sparsely  populated and are rich in natural resources. In line with the  goals of reform, development of the basic role of market  mechanisms in the allocation of resources will help the regions  have access to more extensive and fair earnings and gain  compensation through market exchanges. The central government  will, as always, place top priority on the economic and social  development of these regions. For example, during the financial  and tax system reform, the financial payment ability of various  localities has been appropriately balanced by using the methods  of the financial transfer payments. By instituting tax  regulation, the establishment of a social security system and  various other social redistribution means, central authorities  have solved problems related to extensive gaps caused by the  preliminary distribution. In terms of price system reform,  prices of a few products such as the means of production, coal,  crude oil and natural gas covered by the state plans have been  gradually decontrolled, and have in turn benefited inland  regions. Through the investment system reform, the government  has mainly implemented preferential industrial policies and  steered domestic and foreign funds toward investments in  infrastructure facilities and basic industries, particularly  those related to improving the transport and telecommunications  sectors and strengthening energy production in the central and  western regions. With regard to opening to the outside world  and to supporting economic development in various remote border  regions, preferential policies common in international practice  that suit market economic demands will be adopted toward these  regions.    Fundamentally speaking, however, development of the central  and western regions will be realized through market competition.  They will gradually attain common prosperity by relying on  their own efforts and enhancing efficiency. The government  encourages developed regions to cooperate with less developed  regions. Each will supply the needs of the other, bring their  advantages into play, and in the unified market, compete and  support each other for common progress and prosperity.    Q: China's economic reform has been successful and the  country has adopted numerous other major measures for economic  reform in 1994. However, will China coordinate political  restructuring with economic reform?    A: Over the past 15 years, China has not only scored  remarkable achievements in economic reform, but has also made  great headway in restructuring the political system and  strengthening construction of the democratic and legal system.  For instance, we have formulated and promulgated more than 140  important laws and regulations and have continuously improved  the people's congress system. People's congresses at all levels  are playing an increasingly important role in legislation,  supervision, and decision-making on important matters, as well  as the appointment and removal of personnel. The Communist  Party of China, the ruling party, has implemented a system of  multiparty cooperation and democratic consultations with the  country's eight democratic parties, which have also taken part  in discussions of state affairs. The system has constantly been  improved in recent years. We are restructuring the government  administration, separating the functions of the government from  those of enterprises, and implementing the public service  system. Success in these areas is inseparable from our economic  reform. Economic reforms have indeed brought changes in both the  political and social structure. Along with the deepening of the  economic reform, we will continue to promote reform of the  political system. Our unswerving goal is to implement democratic  politics and we will continue to vigorously promote the  construction of democratic politics. At the same time, we hold  that China's political restructuring can only be conducted in  light of China's specific conditions. In terms of democratic  and legal construction, we will use the experience of other  countries for reference, but will refrain from indiscriminately  copying the patterns of other countries.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTICIPATED SHORTFALL MAY FORCE COUNTY TO CUT SERVICES;  </P> <P> BUDGET: OFFICIALS HOPE THE SITUATION ISN'T AS BAD AS IT LOOKS. BUT  ACROSS-THE-BOARD REDUCTIONS ARE POSSIBLE.  </P> <P> Ventura County residents could face cutbacks in health care, welfare and other  county services next year because of a possible $8.4-million shortage in  anticipated revenues, county officials warned this week.  </P> <P> Officials said, however, that they hope the preliminary projections will prove  to be too conservative when actual figures from the state budget and local  property tax income due the county are available in May.  </P> <P> "We hope we will make the entire shortfall," said Bert Bigler, manager of  budget and administrative services. However, Bigler added, "If we still have a  shortfall at that time, we would have to recommend reductions."  </P> <P> Bigler said it is too early to be specific, but there probably would be a  percentage cut in each department's budget.  </P> <P> The county's mental health services may be the exception because of a  $16-million, four-year state grant to upgrade services.  </P> <P> Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg reported the budgetary outlook  to county supervisors on Tuesday. At his suggestion, the board approved  measures to continue cost-savings plans implemented last year.  </P> <P> Wittenberg said the possible shortfall is the kind of dilemma faced by county  governments throughout the state. The state requires counties to provide  programs such as welfare and health and hospital care for the poor but does not  provide adequate funding to pay the bills, he said.  </P> <P> "County finances are essentially captive to the frequent federal and state  mandates, political stalemates, allocations priorities and administrative  whims," he told the board in his report. "Your board has very limited control  of the county's future budget destiny."  </P> <P> For example, Wittenberg cited the county's receipt of $6.7 million this year in  new money from Proposition 99, the tobacco tax initiative. About half of that  amount went to private doctors and hospitals. Another $2 million went to pay  back the county's general fund for a loan made earlier to the county medical  center.  </P> <P> That loan, Wittenberg said, was for treatment for the poor because of a state  decrease in its allocations for the medically indigent last year.  </P> <P> Another problem is that the county's library system spent its entire reserve of  $318,000 to fund 10 new positions last year, and that will leave this year's  budget tight, Bigler said. The library system also wants to build two new  facilities at a cost of about $20 million but has no money.  </P> <P> The possible shortfall could also increase the chances that the county will be  unable to build a proposed 800-bed jail.  </P> <P> Officials already are having to scale back plans and will settle for a jail  half that size to meet their budget constraints. The county now has $41 million  in state money for the facility, but an 800-bed jail would cost nearly twice  that.  </P> <P> For the county to fund the balance with long-term debt, it would need a means  to repay the loan, which it does not have, said Robert Hirtensteiner, assistant  to the chief administrative officer.  </P> <P> He said the county is hoping to maintain the status quo with services.  </P> <P> "We're going to try to hold the line," he said. "We will try to maintain the  current level of services, improve our inefficiencies and cost-effectiveness."  </P></p>

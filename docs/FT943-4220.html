			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Landesbank in note plan Bremer Landesbank, the regional German bank 75 per cent-owned by Norddeutsche Landesbank, said yesterday it would establish a Dollars 1.5bn medium-term note programme. The decision follows the granting of an Aa1 rating by Moody's, the credit rating agency, writes John Gapper, Banking Editor. It is the latest Landesbank to gain an investment-grade rating. Bremer operates both as a regional commercial bank in north-west Germany and a central bank for 17 local savings banks. Mr Peter Hasskamp, chairman, said it was important to have a recognised rating, both to diversify its funding base and because of increased interest from international investors in the German bond market, where it gains most funding. The programme, to be launched next month with Morgan Stanley as lead arranger, will include sales of French debt instruments, and placements with Japanese investors.</p>

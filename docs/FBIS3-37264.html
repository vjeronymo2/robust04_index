Particularly, the former adviser of the president reported  that the directors of profitable enterprises (cognac and jewelry  factories etc.) are being assigned by V. Siradegyan. During an  entertainment trip of Vano Siradegyan to Paris a Moscow Armenian  accompanying him spent 200,000 dollars. The Ministry of the  Interior has not only organized the attempt of Serzh Jilavyan's  murder but was also suppressing the opposition parties.  Siradegyan established complete control over the sphere of  economy. Four leaders are illegally living in the governmental  summer residence and they are taking governmental decisions  during the parties. Police officials are spending their summer  holidays in United Arab Emirates. More than 10 KGB agents are  involved in the current government. A report including all  names and details regarding the export of copper from the  republic has been sent to the President.</p>

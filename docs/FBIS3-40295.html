Markovic: "Air Defense of the Republic of </F> Srpska Ready for Attack; Respond to Fire With Fire"]    [Text] The military of the republic of Srpska have the  powerful "Kub" and "Volhov" missile systems, which are effective  at altitudes up to 30 kilometers. U.S. officers compare military  action in Bosnia to searching for a needle in a haystack, but  Serbian commanders see it as an adventure endangering the entire  region.    The latest threats of military intervention and NATO air  strikes did not surprise the military of the republic of Srpska.  The military air defense of this youngest Serbian republic was  in full readiness even before the threats. The military  commanders, who take these new threats very seriously, are  inclined to believe that "all this serves to pressure the  Serbian side before the pending talks in Geneva."    However, if the threats of the trigger-happy Western war  planners were to be fulfilled, resulting in a military action,  it would be dangerous for the entire region. The military of the  republic of Srpska, who are known to have a mass of antiaircraft  artillery weapons and night-capable missile systems, believe  that nobody needs this kind of adventure.    The first thing the soldiers of the republic of Srpska like  to display are the most modern antiaircraft "Bofors"-type guns  made in Sweden. They have laser sights which guarantee maximal  precision in hitting aerial targets. They are also capable of  high fire concentration, several thousand rounds per minute.  Serbian fighters are also proud of their mass of portable  shoulder-launched "Strela" [arrow]-type laser-equipped devices.  "Strelas" are effective within a range of 3.5 kilometers against  approaching or departing targets; they represent a particular  threat to fighter-bombers because their range covers the  altitude most suitable for fighter-bomber attacks on ground  targets.    The "Kub" is a highly maneuverable missile system; it  consists of three launchers on a single vehicle; it is designed  for medium- and high-altitude targets. But the most powerful  missile system is the stationary "Volhov"-type system. This  system involves the most powerful missiles in the air-defense  arsenal of the republic of Srpska military. The system has been  modified to incorporate new guidance devices. These missiles are  effective even at an altitude of 30 kilometers, and their speed  matches that of the most modern NATO planes.    The terrain configuration is very advantageous for the  Serbian air defense forces; it makes it very difficult for even  the most modern electronic equipment to detect targets. Thus,  our commanders feel that the probability of destruction is  negligible. Their views are supported by data which show that  such destruction of ground targets (as proposed by the Western  war planners) is hard to achieve even in training exercises. The  Gulf War experience also confirms this fact; there were only 17  percent direct hits there.    Higher-ranking U.S. officers compare the possible military  action against the Serbs in Bosnia to searching for a needle in  a haystack. They have publicly expressed their skepticism about  air strikes despite the variety of weapons possessed by NATO  forces. Although they are aware that the Serbian military does  not have fighter planes (interceptors), the high-ranking U.S.  officers respect the air defense of the republic of Srpska's  military, pointing out that the Serbs could easily conceal their  heavy weapons in wooded mountainous areas and settlements. U.S.  officers expressed the opinion that this would make pilots  reluctant to attack.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kirpichnikov: "The Duma Will Support the </F> Serbs on 11 May: The Delegation Will Report on Its Trip to the  Former Yugoslavia"]    [Text] As we all know, having returned from its trip to the  former Yugoslavia, the official State Duma delegation intended  to report immediately, but the assassination of Deputy Aydzerzis  and the Duma's move to Okhotnyy ryad prevented this. The report  was postponed until the first day after the holidays. The  two-week delay has changed the context of the Yugoslav  "showdown": both in consequence of the dynamic situation in the  Balkans and on account of the Accord Treaty. Chapter One of the  document contains clause 6, which was absent from the drafts of  20 and 26 April: "The subscribers to the treaty undertake to  contribute in every possible way... to implementation of a  unified national foreign policy course."    The set goal of the delegation was to visit the territories  of the parties to the conflict and to conduct an impartial  investigation. Representatives of all registered factions headed  by General Nikolay Bezborodov, from the communists, set out for  the Balkans. There was piquancy in the fact that Deputy  Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the Defense Committee, being a  member of the Communist Party, is part of Sergey Baburin's  Russian Way group of deputies. And reporting on his trip to the  Balkans, the latter had back on 8 April not only advocated the  abandonment of sanctions but also proposed how this be done,  spitting in the face of the world community: delivering  commodities by ship along the Danube, and if Bulgaria or Romania  "order us to stop, we are not required to do so." Considering  the supremacy of the "railroad engineer"-general and the  presence of the Zhirinovskiyite Vyacheslav Marychev, whose  position, like that of his faction boss also, is a whole lot  worse than that of Mr. Baburin, there were serious doubts as to  future impartiality. This would in jury selection have sufficed  for rejection, here, however, it remained to hope that those on  the assignment would overcome the actual stereotype.    A rough idea of the course of the future discussion was  provided by the news conference given by the delegation, already  described in SEGODNYA, which was held on the Duma's final day of  business on Novyy Arbat. The first conclusion was that, contrary  to Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, vice speaker from the  LDPR--Zhirinovskiy Party--the trip was not "political tourism":  Thanks to the Foreign Ministry and the embassies in Yugoslavia  and Croatia, the members of the Duma were able to visit  Yugoslavia, Croatia, Bosnia, and the republics of Serbia and  Serbian Krajina and to meet with their top leaders and also with  the representative of the UN secretary general and the commander  of the UN force in Bosnia.    The second was based on the communique on the preliminary  results, which affirmed four positions: the anti-Serb  information campaign and violation of the principle of equal  responsibility, the need for the lifting of sanctions and  preservation of the embargo on arms supplies, a weakening of the  role of the United Nations thanks to the delegation of a number  of functions to the North Atlantic bloc, and mistakes of the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the diplomatic  recognition of Bosnia-Hercegovina and in the approval of  sanctions. It was proposed that the efforts for their  cancellation be made exclusively within the framework of the  United Nations here.    The third conclusion concerned the members of the  delegation.  General Bezborodov was a pleasant surprise. He approached the  problem in military fashion: If an objective investigation is  needed, investigate objectively we will. And the other members  of the delegation, while supporting their Yugoslav and Serbian  brothers, did not go beyond the framework of the communique and  did not propose exotic means of a lifting of the blockade like  the said breakthrough along the Danube or the basing of the  Russian Navy on the Adriatic coast (the suggestion of that same  Vice Speaker Vengerovskiy). Mr. Marychev was, naturally, the  exception: To SEGODNYA's question as to who "the geopolitical  forces of evil" in the region visited actually are, the deputy  named NATO and only NATO. Indeed, it followed from the news  conference that the NATO people are suffering from "Captain  Tushin's disease" and that the UN representatives are having  difficulty keeping them from pulling the trigger of the "hanging  gun." And that in tactical ability General Mladic has repeatedly  gotten the better of General Rose and that the latter is annoyed  at this. But it was not NATO that began the war in the Balkans  and slaughtered peaceful inhabitants, and General Mladic is more  significant than Yeruslan and, judging by his conduct and his  relations with Mr. Karadzic and his remarks about NATO, bears a  striking resemblance to the words of Mr. Marychev. The fact that  the latter remained in the minority at the news conference  permits the hope of the similar location of his faction on 11  May.    The day promises to be, if not sensational, then tumultuous.  The first three points of the communique, although they could  arouse the deputies' ardor, will for all that most likely be  approved by the Duma. But discussion of the fourth  point--charges leveled at the Foreign Ministry--promises to be  serious. Andrey Kozyrev is a member of the Russia's Choice  faction, and it was not fortuitous that it was only the Russia's  Choice representative who failed to sign the communique as a  whole. It was he, Aleksey Sarychev, incidentally, who raised at  the news conference the question of the need for a closed  sitting on 11 May. Why so open a discussion would inflame  passions in the Balkans, whether such will be the opinion of the  faction and whether it would be approved by the Duma, and,  finally, whether it would not be better to follow the words and  styles than take umbrage at journalists getting information by  the "tainted telephone" from the garrulous members of parliament  remained unclear.    One thing, however, is clear: The discussion will lead to  recommendations for a change in Russia's Balkan policy, and  possibly to demands for personnel reinforcement of the Foreign  Ministry also. And whereas the Duma lacks the constitutional  license for the latter, as the Mr. Yerin incident shows, it  could make recommendations, as mentioned at the news conference,  law. It could, if turned down by the Federation Council or the  president, be approved, all the same, by the Duma by a  two-thirds vote--and, judging by the news conference, it has  this.    I believe, however, that following the Accord Treaty the  president would not go against the Duma, especially since  movements at the Foreign Ministry are obvious. In addition, the  two-week breathing-space has most likely been used for active  consultations between members of the delegation and the Duma  leadership and Russian diplomats. Of course, observance of the  clause concerning a "unified foreign policy course" could be  impeded--if the Duma devotes its first sitting to a discussion  not of Yugoslavia but of the methods by which Ivan Rybkin won  from the lower house the right to sign the treaty and if this  treaty signature is disavowed. But such a development of events  is unlikely and constitutes a different subject, what is more.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUCK JUMPS FREEWAY, SMASHES INTO 2 HOMES  </P> <P> North Hollywood residents renewed their pleas Wednesday for a sound barrier  along the Hollywood Freeway after a flatbed truck loaded with barrels of  asbestos insulation careened off the roadbed and plowed into two houses.  </P> <P> The accident occurred north of Saticoy Street shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday.  The driver fled after asking the startled resident of one of the damaged houses  on Babcock Avenue to call 911 for help, said California Highway Patrol Officer  Randy Klucker. CHP investigators were seeking the driver, whose name was not  released.  </P> <P> The truck was removed from the back yards of the two houses Wednesday morning  after the Los Angeles County Health Department determined that none of the  sealed containers of asbestos had been opened in the accident.  </P> <P> A group of North Hollywood homeowners formed a coalition last July to push for  construction of freeway sound walls in several locations, including the section  of freeway that was the scene of the accident, said Bob Brice, a Babcock Avenue  resident who helped organize the neighborhood.  </P></p>

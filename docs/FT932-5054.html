			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): No double tax relief on these dividends FULLY-FRANKED dividends from Australia are subject to a 39 per cent Australian imputation tax, and I believe an Australian resident receives the net amount without paying further taxes. My bank subjects the net amount received here in the UK to full UK taxes, without any double tax relief. Is this procedure correct, since dividends are then doubly taxed? The new Australian tax system, where there is an imputation credit attached to each dividend, means there is no further tax payable for Australian residents. Shareholders who are not resident in Australia normally receive dividends subject to a withholding tax of 15 per cent deducted at source on the gross amount of the dividend. However, dividends received in franked form are free from dividend withholding tax but no refund of the imputation credit is available. It follows that, as the imputation credit is not a tax as such, the dividends are not taxed in Australia and are, therefore, fully taxable in the UK. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

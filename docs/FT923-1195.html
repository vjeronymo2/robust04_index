			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Ford call to unions raises job fears FORD has called meetings in London today with its production and staff unions, raising fears of further short-time working and possible job cuts against the background of depressed UK new car sales, John Griffiths writes. Union leaders, including Mr Jimmy Airlie of the AEEU and Mr Jack Adams of the TGWU, have been told that Ford wants to discuss the industry's capacity, the state of the market and related difficulties. However, both sides last night made clear they regard as groundless rumours that Ford might be considering plant closures in the UK.</p>

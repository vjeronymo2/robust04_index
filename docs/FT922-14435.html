			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Labour stresses housing 'crisis' LONDON homeowners have seen the value of their houses decline by Pounds 27bn in three years, Labour claimed yesterday. Outlining a seven-point plan to ameliorate the capital's housing problems, the party said the 'crisis' was affecting all sectors from the homeless to those 'with mortgage debts bigger than their houses are worth'. The party also moved to reject Conservative claims that a government under Mr Neil Kinnock would bring higher mortgage rates in its wake, arguing that interest rates were historically higher under Tory governments. 'The record is incontrovertible - every time you elect a Tory government, you guarantee that interest rates will rise,' said Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary. 'That's what would happen again if people were silly enough to re-elect a Tory government.' Labour's plans include an emergency programme for the homeless, considering letting first-time buyers concentrate tax relief in the early years of their loans and setting up a national housing bank to increase the supply of homes for rent without directly adding to government spending. Among its other functions, the bank would offer a way of recycling local authority capital receipts back into housing without adding to the public sector borrowing requirement. The party is still non-committal about how quickly this recycling would occur, however. Housing is viewed as a particularly important issue in the 84 seats of Greater London, where it is thought the votes of heavily-mortgaged C2s - the skilled working classes - will have a crucial bearing on the outcome in several marginal constituencies.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FLORIDA SLAYING SUSPECT FOUND GUILTY IN BEATING  </P> <P> A suspect in the slayings of five college students in Gainesville was convicted  Wednesday of beating his grandmother.  </P> <P> Edward Lewis Humphrey, 19, had tears in his eyes upon hearing the conviction on  a reduced charge of battery on a person over age 65.  </P> <P> Sentencing was set for Nov. 8. Under state sentencing guidelines, Humphrey  could receive probation or up to 22 months in prison.  </P> <P> It took six Brevard County jurors about an hour to convict him of beating his  79-year-old grandmother, Elna Hlavaty, on Aug. 30.  </P> <P> Humphrey could have been convicted of the more serious charge of aggravated  battery on a person over 65. Conviction on that charge carries a penalty of at  least three years in prison without parole.  </P> <P> "Truth is, Ed Humphrey beat his grandmother. I had no qualms with the jury. It  is difficult when they have a victim testifying for the defense," state  attorney Norm Wolfinger said.  </P> <P> Humphrey has been held on $1-million bond. No testimony was given about his  status as a suspect in the serial slayings in August of five students in  Gainesville.  </P> <P> Hlavaty, who testified for the defense, was upset by the verdict.  </P> <P> "I am heartbroken that I have a crippled grandson that is being railroaded in  hell until they find the Gainesville murderer," she said. Humphrey had been  injured in a car accident.  </P> <P> After the alleged beating, Hlavaty called police and said her grandson had hit  her. She later said she did not want to press charges.  </P> <P> Prosecutors tried to show that Hlavaty was harmed intentionally and suffered  bodily harm, permanent injury or permanent disfigurement.  </P> <P> The alleged attack on Humphrey's grandmother occurred after the discovery  earlier that week of the bodies of four female students and one male student in  off-campus apartments. No one has been charged in those killings.  </P></p>

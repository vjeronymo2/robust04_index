			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Republic </F> of Abkhazia Supreme Council, by Wojciech Gorecki in Gudauta;  date not given: "There Will Be a State"]    [Text] [Gorecki] Could you define the present status of  Abkhazia? Is it formally a part of Georgia, a part of the  Russian Federation, or is it a fully sovereign state, albeit one  that has not been recognized by anyone in the world?    [Ardzinba] Abkhazia is, in fact, a sovereign state and it is  worth pointing out here that the Abkhazians have a tradition of  statehood that goes back to the 12th century. We want to join  the family of democratic countries: Our parliament accepts all  the norms of international law and has ratified all human rights.    Unfortunately, the path toward the recognition of Abkhazia  on  the international arena is a long and complicated one. We have  to proceed along it; however, we have already succeeded in  taking the first step.    [Gorecki] How would you personally assess Russia's policy  toward Abkhazia? On the one hand, your biggest neighbor has  sent a contingent of peacekeeping forces while, on the other, it  is imposing a blockade upon Abkhazia and restricting the supply  of electric power to five hours a day....    [Ardzinba] Russia is behaving in a strange manner toward us  and I view the steps taken by Moscow as harmful and unjust.  Following a war that lasted many months, in which people were  killed, villages and towns destroyed, and material losses  amounted to approximately 2 trillion rubles, our country wants  peace. In order to ensure the latter, we have turned to Russia  and international organizations for help. We were counting on  the fact that world opinion would condemn Georgia as the  aggressor and impose sanctions upon it. Meanwhile, although  Georgia is constantly violating the terms of the Sochi agreement  (that formally brought the war to an end -- W.G.), repressive  measures are being taken against us. Why is this happening?  Please ask the authorities in the Kremlin.    [Gorecki] How do you view Abkhazia's future? What are the  main problems facing your republic?    [Ardzinba] Until we sign an agreement with Georgia on the  regulation of bilateral relations and receive political  guarantees that peace will be maintained, we will not view the  war with this state as being over. We, for our part, are ready  to negotiate.    The most important problem is, of course, the normalization  of daily life and the strengthening of Abkhazian power  throughout the republic. Once the Russian Federation has lifted  the economic blockade, our fundamental task will be to conclude  a bilateral treaty with it.    In the near future, the draft of the new constitution of the  Republic of Abkhazia will be submitted to the Supreme Council.  The general public will decide upon its final form in a  referendum.</p>

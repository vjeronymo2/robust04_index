			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANOI AGREES TO REPATRIATION OF 'BOAT PEOPLE'  </P> <P> Britain, Vietnam and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees have  reached an agreement that could lead to the repatriation of thousands of  Vietnamese "boat people" from overcrowded camps in Hong Kong, officials in  Hanoi said Saturday.  </P> <P> The joint statement, released in London, said that Vietnam had agreed after two  days of talks to take back refugees who have not volunteered for repatriation  but are not opposed to returning.  </P> <P> There was international condemnation after 51 Vietnamese, categorized by  Britain as non-refugees, were forcibly sent home from Hong Kong in December,  1989. The wording of Saturday's statement was careful not to suggest any forced  repatriation.  </P> <P> The statement said the U.N. office, rather than the Hong Kong government as in  the past, would be responsible for coaxing the 50,000 boat people to leave  camps in Hong Kong and return home. Most do not qualify as refugees under  international criteria and are ineligible for resettlement in the West.  </P> <P> The meeting was initiated by Vietnam and represented a turnabout in thinking by  Hanoi, which in the past has refused to accept any refugees who had not  volunteered to return home.  </P> <P> The change in policy from Hanoi comes at a time when Vietnam is hoping for a  European Community aid package and is looking to improve relations with its  Southeast Asian neighbors.  </P> <P> Negotiations are continuing on the matter of those boat people who are refusing  to return.  </P> <P> British officials described the agreement as a breakthrough, and said they are  confident they will be able to send back large numbers of refugees without the  use of force.  </P> <P> David Colvin, head of the British negotiating team, said he hoped the program  could get under way in a matter of weeks.  </P></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Caterpillar in truck pact with Russians CATERPILLAR of the US, the world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, said yesterday it had reached an agreement with Zil, Russia's biggest truck manufacturer, to pursue an industrial and marketing arrangement for diesel truck engines and fuel systems. Neither side would disclose details of the agreement, the second between a big Russian truck producer and specialist US engine maker. Cummins, the world's largest independent producer of diesel engines, and Kamaz, the heavy truck maker, formed last year a joint venture aimed at the eventual manufacture of Cummins engines in the then Soviet Union. Zil produces about 200,000 trucks a year but its Moscow plant has suffered from under-investment since the 1970s. The trucks it has been producing are little changed from those of the 1950s. It is shortly to begin making 75,000 newly-designed diesel engine trucks, some expected to be fitted with Caterpillar's engines. Mr Donald Fites, Caterpillar's chairman, said he believed the two companies could build a mutually-beneficial truck diesel-engine business and 'together make a strong contribution to Russia's transportation system with engines that have good fuel economy and low emissions'. Mr Evgueni Brakov, Zil's general director, said that co-operation with Caterpillar could make his group's trucks more competitive in Russia as well as in the global market-place. The deal would appear to have similar potential to the Cummins-Kamaz venture. The latter envisages producing about 25,000 engines a year by the late 1990s. Local engine assembly could begin by the mid-1990s. Cummins has said that, at maturity in the next decade, production volumes could reach 150,000 engines a year.</p>

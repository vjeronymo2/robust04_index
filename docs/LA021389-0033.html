			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President Bush moved on his promised review of U.S.-Soviet relations in a  meeting at his weekend retreat in Kennebunkport, Me., with a group of academics  in the field. Earlier, Bush and his wife, Barbara, marked the first Sunday of  Lent by attending an hourlong service at the First Congregational Church where  they were warmly welcomed. After lunch, the President met the professors from  Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Fletcher School of  Law and Diplomacy and a fellow from the Brookings Institution who were brought  in on short notice. Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the discussion was  meant to be "open-ended and not designed to focus on any particular facet of  East-West relations." Also at the meeting were National Security Adviser Brent  Scowcroft and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state-designate.  </P></p>

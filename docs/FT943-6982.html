			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging Markets Recent weeks have been dominated by elections in the world's emerging markets, polling having taken place in both Mexico and Sri Lanka. Investors are now keeping a close watch on the performance of Brazil, which has presidential elections in October. The Sao Paulo stock market has been encouraged this week by new opinion polls which have suggested that the former economy minister, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has extended his lead over the other main candidate, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. A period of profit-taking is expected in the short term, given the market's strength in recent sessions. However, over the longer term analysts remain positive on Brazilian stocks, helped by positive economic signals, particularly in the form of lower forecasts for inflation data covering August and September.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Dollar terms                     No. of        Aug. 19    % Change     % Change Market              stocks           1994   over week   on Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America        (209)         734.68        +5.9        +12.9 Argentina             (25)         921.99        +1.7         -7.3 Brazil                (57)         395.99       +14.7        +70.2 Chile                 (25)         693.22        +3.0        +25.6 Colombia1             (11)         895.45        -5.0        +38.9 Mexico                (68)         969.41        +3.3         -3.7 Peru2                 (11)         141.29        +1.4        +16.8 Venezuela3            (12)         550.99        +4.4         -6.9 Asia                 (557)         276.91        +3.0         -4.9 China4                (18)         102.46        -5.4        -31.4 South Korea5         (156)         130.66        +0.8        +10.6 Philippines           (18)         316.96        +0.8         -6.9 Taiwan, China6        (90)         152.09        +2.0        +12.5 India7                (76)         140.54        -1.0        +20.7 Indonesia8            (37)         106.08        +4.0        -14.9 Malaysia             (105)         312.03        +3.7         -8.0 Pakistan9             (15)         399.76        -0.2         +3.0 Sri Lanka10            (5)         184.89        +1.5         +4.3 Thailand              (55)         428.05        +5.0        -10.4 Euro/Mid East        (125)         128.68        +4.4        -24.0 Greece                (25)         229.08        -1.9         +0.6 Hungary11              (5)         195.91        +2.1        +17.6 Jordan                (13)         163.12        -0.9         -1.5 Poland12              (12)         773.69        +9.5         -5.4 Portugal              (25)         125.38        +0.8        +10.2 Turkey13              (40)         132.27        +9.2        -37.8 Zimbabwe14             (5)         249.77        +2.1        +23.6 Composite            (891)         361.93        +4.5         +1.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Local currency terms                          Aug. 19    % Change    % Change Market                      1994   over week  on Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             565,756.15        +1.7        -7.3 Brazil             1,324,674,019       +13.2    +1,203.5 Chile                   1,161.59        +2.7       +21.9 Colombia1               1,293.52        -5.0       +39.5 Mexico                  1,411.94        +2.7        +4.6 Peru2                     190.07        -0.4       +19.5 Venezuela3              2,153.31        +4.4       +51.5 Asia China4                    111.13        -5.5       -32.3 South Korea5              138.02        +0.7       +10.0 Philippines               392.45        +0.0       -11.6 Taiwan, China6            151.19        +1.9       +13.0 India7                    155.47        -1.0       +20.7 Indonesia8                124.49        +4.0       -12.6 Malaysia                  293.18        +3.3       -13.0 Pakistan9                 549.71        -1.0        +4.1 Sri Lanka10               197.43        +0.8        +3.4 Thailand                  425.24        +5.0       -12.0 Euro/Mid East Greece                    361.87        -2.8        -5.9 Hungary11                 254.64        +1.7       +26.1 Jordan                    233.54        -0.9        -2.5 Poland12                1,114.14        +8.5        +0.9 Portugal                  136.16        -0.1        -1.4 Turkey13                1,942.95        +9.7       +33.6 Zimbabwe14                297.42        +2.1       +39.2 Composite  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

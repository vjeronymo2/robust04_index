			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: USAir forced to delay delivery of new aircraft USAir, the US airline in which British Airways holds a minority stake, has postponed delivery of 40 Boeing 737 jetliners and cancelled options for another 76 Boeing aircraft, it emerged yesterday. Separately, a ballot among the airline's 8,000 fleet service workers indicated they were set to join a labour union in an attempt to win better protection against the shake-out in the US airline industry. USAir, which faces acute pressure to cut costs because of competition from low-cost airlines making inroads into its east coast market, had planned to take delivery of the 40 737 jets between 1997 and 2000. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows it has deferred delivery of the airliners to dates between 2003 and 2005. It has also cancelled options for 63 737s, 11 757s and two 767s, but it will still take delivery of 18 757s between now and 1996.</p>

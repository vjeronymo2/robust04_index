			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: IRI postpones disposal of SME canned foods unit IRI, Italy's state holding company, will postpone until at least September the sale of Cirio-Bertolli-De Rica (CBD), the canned foods division of its foodstuffs group, SME. It claims the bids received are inadequate. The IRI board approved on Thursday the disposal of its 62 per cent stake in SME's frozen and baked foods division, Finitalgel, for L437bn (Dollars 273.4m) to Nestle, the world's largest foods group. Finitalgel's main subsidiary, Italgel, is the second-largest group by sales of frozen foods and ice cream in the Italian market after Unilever, while its Gruppo Dolciaro Italiano makes cakes. Nestle has a big presence in several food sectors in Italy, but none in ice cream or frozen foods. The purchase would give it a 27 per cent stake in the ice cream market and 15 per cent in frozen foods. The failure to find a suitable buyer for CBD represents a setback after a smooth start for debt-burdened IRI's privatisation programme. Among those bidding for CBD, which has the best-known brand names in Italy's canned goods sector, was Unilever. The IRI board reportedly felt the final offers were from bidders interested only in parts of the business. There has been strong union pressure to keep CBD intact to preserve jobs, especially in southern Italy. IRI is likely to begin talks with the final bidders, as well as those who had pulled out, such as Parmalat and Eridania Beghin Say. It hopes to establish which group wants to buy specific parts of CBD and ensure the benefit of the break-up price is retained. Nestle had long been a front-runner to buy Finitalgel. Analysts said the deal would significantly raise the size and profitability of the Swiss group's ice cream and frozen foods divisions. Nestle said it aimed to develop some Finitalgel brands in other European countries. The deal values Finitalgel shares at L1,550 each. On this valuation, the whole company, with brand names such as Alemagna and Motta, is worth L700bn. Nestle estimates Finitalgel sales will reach the equivalent of SFr900m (Dollars 596m) this year.</p>

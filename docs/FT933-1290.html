			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Parkdean Leisure lifts holiday weeks sold by 7% PARKDEAN Leisure, the holiday park operator which is coming to the stock market next month, increased the number of holiday weeks sold in its parks in the 1993 summer season by 7 per cent, with caravan and retail sales rising by a smaller percentage. The figure was revealed in the group's pathfinder prospectus which was issued yesterday to institutional investors at the start of its marketing campaign for its share placing to such investors. The placing is expected to raise about Pounds 8m and value the company at between Pounds 13m and Pounds 15m. The prospectus shows that Parkdean's operating profits have risen from Pounds 789,000 in the year to November 1990 to Pounds 1.3m in 1992. A profit forecast for the current year will be contained in the final prospectus. Parkdean incurred an operating loss of Pounds 439,000 in the six months to June 2, but said the seasonality of the holiday business meant a loss in the first half was normal. The prospectus also reveals that Parkdean has appointed Mr Ralph Iley as non-executive chairman. Mr Iley, formerly a managing director of Cookson Group is still a non-executive director of Cookson. The placing is intended to enable Parkdean to repay debt, which amounted to nearly Pounds 6m in the 1992 balance sheet, and give it a capital base from which it can expand. The company says it believes it can increase the number of parks under ownership and management from the current seven, without a significant increase in central overheads. No acquisitions are under consideration at present. Parkdean also believes it can increase profits from acquisitions. The document says that operating profits from its Grannie's Heilan' Hame holiday park, bought in 1989, rose 70 per cent between 1990 and 1992. Of the group's turnover of Pounds 8.51m in 1992, 41 per cent came from hiring caravans, chalets and apartments and from touring charges for caravans and tents; 14 per cent came from sales of caravans and chalets and 45 per cent from retail activities such as bars, amusement arcades and shops. The prospectus says the group's fortunes depend on high occupancy rates which lead to high retail income; in the 1992 season this was 77 per cent. Pricing is expected on October 6. The sponsor is Charterhouse Tilney.</p>

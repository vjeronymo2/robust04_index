			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: Why ballet is blatantly heterosexual - The romance of dance Blatantly heterosexual. In using those words, or other words to their effect, Jane Brown, the head teacher who recently stopped her young students attending a free performance of Kenneth MacMillan's ballet Romeo and Juliet at Covent Garden, has stirred up gales of both rage and laughter. Rage, not least because the kids could easily have seen the ballet on TV in December anyway. And laughter, of course, because, for heaven's sake, this is a ballet. Isn't ballet full of sexless anorexics and poofs? The current Private Eye carries a cartoon of two poncy danseurs indignantly reading the words 'blatantly heterosexual'; one of them is saying 'I'll sue.' As a comment on the ballet Romeo and Juliet, 'blatantly heterosexual' is apt enough. MacMillan's 1965 choreography, probably the ballet version of Romeo best known across the world today, was inspired in part by the famous Zeffirelli RSC staging of the Shakespeare play and by West Side Story. This Romeo jazzes up its crowd scenes with three harlots, who are good at supplying Verona's men with those things in which the city's honest, drab, churlish housewives are deficient: ie lusty snogging, frothing skirts, bawdy humour. (In other Romeos, there are more boy-boy scenes than boy-girl. Here, however, the harlots flirt with Mercutio, Benvolio and, sometimes, Romeo, and so keep the hetero- content to the fore.) And Lynn Seymour, the Juliet for whom MacMillan conceived this Romeo, used to make it quite clear that in Romeo she discovered her own sexuality. Gauche until she met him, she became so transformed that when waiting for him in the moonlight she used to caress her whole upper body against the balcony - arms, shoulders, neck - in a wave of voluptuous impatience. (Prim ballet-goers who preferred more pious Juliets used to say 'She's no Juliet, she's a whore.') But the intensely sexual nature of many MacMillan ballets (Romeo and Manon - both of them have been set texts for A-level Dance, by the way  - are among his milder efforts) obscures the larger issue of sexuality in ballet. What kind of sexual content exists in classical ballet - the grand formal kind of ballet, with women in stiff tutus being supported by attentive cavaliers? Deep down, classical ballet is (a) blatantly sexist (b) essentially heterosexual. No other art is so profoundly based upon the dichotomy between male and female. The woman rises onto point; the man may not. He remains mortal; she becomes in part divine. He is there to partner her; she uses his support to expand herself yet further. That she might support him, or that he should rise up onto point too, is inconceivable. Ballet is an expression of chivalry, of old-style noble heterosexual etiquette. Yes, there are quite a few gay men in ballet (though, for those of you who like to know, most of the Royal's current Romeos are straight) and, yes, the audience has its quota of gay men (though less, I would say, than opera) and lesbians too. But all of them, consciously or otherwise, are sharing a vision in which only male-female love obtains. (The choreographer Mark Morris, when a young dancer, left a ballet company because 'I got tired of pretending to be a straight guy in love with a ballerina.') So why do gay men go to ballet? Less, I think, to ogle pretty boys in white tights than you might suppose. The real spell of ballet lies in its Romantic core - the sense of radiant erotic doom that unites the Swan Queen's fate to Siegfried's, that links Giselle to Albrecht even beyond death. Every heroine finds the hero she has been waiting for; and gay men, watching, can bask in that. But the sexual content of ballet goes deeper than the idea of 'Some day my prince will come'. Though there are feminists who have claimed that women are being demeaned every time a male dancer lifts a girl off the floor (which happens in most modern dance too), sexual relations in ballet are often profoundly expressive. The great adagios of the classical repertory - those strange formal rituals in which the danseur stands patiently with extended arm supporting the ballerina while she, on one point, performs superb feats although scarcely addressing him - express not only a woman's need for a man but also, paradoxically, her need to be independent of him. She does not keep on giving herself to him. In fact, she keeps using him; in some pas de deux, she keeps eluding him. It is essential that she maintains her own space, and keeps her distance (arm's length - literally) from him. There are meanings here for any feminist to investigate. If Jane Brown loses her job as head teacher, someone should employ her as a ballet critic. She will have her work cut out.</p>

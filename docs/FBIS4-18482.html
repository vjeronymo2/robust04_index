			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Will Not Reach Deficit </F> Reduction Target, According to Planning Bureau"]    [Text] The Hague, 31 March -- In 1994, the cabinet will not  reach its targets of reducing the budget deficit to 3.25 percent  and not allowing the collective tax burden to exceed a ceiling  of 53.7 percent of national income. The budget deficit will be  4.1 percent this year, according to the CPB [Central Planning  Bureau]. The collective tax burden (taxation and social  premiums) will remain at 54.3 percent. This forecast was given  by CPB director G. Zalm this morning at the presentation of the  Central Economic Plan.    In order to keep the budget deficit within the limits, "use  was often made of coverage which was not included in the  planning a year ago," Zalm said. "They have wandered a fair way  off the original targets," Zalm said this morning. The Planning  Bureau director pointed out that "all in all, there were many  mitigating circumstances for why the targets have not been  reached." But Zalm said this did not prevent the fact that the  present governmental team "has not made it easier for the next  cabinet."    In comparison with other countries, the Netherlands has not  done badly, according to the CPB. The budget deficit dropped  between 1990 and 1994. The deficit still dropped when the  increasing one-off coverage criticized by the CPB is taken into  account. The situation has also improved if the European  definition of the budget deficit (the so-called current account  deficit) is used. In the 12 European Union countries, the total  government current account deficit increased from an average of  4 to 6 percent between 1990 and 1994, the CPB said, but in the  Netherlands it dropped from 4.6 to 4.0 percent. In the 24 rich  Western industrial countries which are OECD members, the current  account deficit increased from 2.1 to 4.0 percent in the same  period.    The Central Economic Plan contained another positive point  for government finances. Total collective expenditure would  drop by nearly 3 percent in 1994 and 1995, according to the CPB  forecast. The CPB said this was not connected to volume growth,  which would continue to increase slightly, but to striking  developments in price levels. The price levels in collective  expenditure will increase slower than gross national product in  1994. That was due to the "moderate wage developments,  particularly by the collective sector, and above all the  reduction in social security payments," according to the CPB.    The CPB was less positive about unemployment. The unemployed  working population would increase by 80,000 this year and by  10,000 more in 1995. Without the recent reduction in employers'  contributions (2 billion guilders), 5,000-10,000 more persons  unemployed.</p>

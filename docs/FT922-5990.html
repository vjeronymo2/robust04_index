			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Canadian banks advance despite O&amp;Y provisions BOTH Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third and fourth biggest banks respectively, lifted second-quarter earnings despite their sizeable exposures to troubled property developer Olympia &amp; York. BMO, which disclosed CDollars 318m (USDollars 267.2m) in loans to O&amp;Y, boosted net earnings to CDollars 143.5m, or CDollars 1.07 a share, in the three months to April 30, from CDollars 128.4m, or CDollars 1.01 a share, a year earlier. The improvement was due largely to a slower rise in expenses than revenues, and to a substantial growth in lending volumes, especially to small and mid-sized businesses. Total assets have jumped by almost 8 per cent in the past year to CDollars 104.2bn. BNS's earnings advanced to CDollars 171m, or 75 cents a share, from CDollars 163.3m, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. The bank ascribed the rise to wider margins as both domestic and foreign interest rates continued to decline. BNS has lifted its fiscal 1992 loan loss provisions by CDollars 200m, or 45 per cent, to reflect its exposure to O&amp;Y, totalling CDollars 630m, and to other troubled borrowers. But this was exactly offset by a recovery in Third World loans. Its second-quarter provision of CDollars 110m is unchanged from the previous three months. The provision in the second quarter of 1991 was CDollars 85m. Non-performing loans, net of provisions, rose to CDollars 1.87bn on April 30 from CDollars 1.74bn three months earlier. The bank did not disclose how much of this increase was accounted for by O&amp;Y loans. BMO has classified its entire O&amp;Y portfolio as non-performing, but has left its forecast for fiscal 1992 loan losses unchanged at CDollars 500m. The bank said that its loans to O&amp;Y are secured by specific office buildings which continue to generate cash flow, and by listed marketable securities. It is not involved in Canary Wharf or in any of O&amp;Y's large syndicated financings. Although they are among O&amp;Y's biggest lenders, the Canadian banks are generally well-equipped to absorb substantial losses. BMO reported that its risk-weighted capital-to-assets ratio improved in the second quarter to 9.1 per cent from 8.5 per cent three months earlier. BNS's capital ratio has edged up to 8.6 per cent from 8.5 per cent. Both banks still have a return on equity well into double digits. Four other Canadian banks will report second-quarter earnings over the next week.</p>

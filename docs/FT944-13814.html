			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / People: De Villiers - the man to decide whether Disney will beam up Etienne de Villiers, managing director of The Walt Disney Company in the UK, has been promoted to the newly-created post of president, international television for Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications. De Villiers, a qualified civil engineer and Rhodes scholar who was once responsible for running South Africa's largest cinema chain, is at the moment mainly in charge of international sales, marketing and distribution of Disney programming to broadcasters. The job at the head of the newly created division will involve responsibility for television production and a number of international television businesses previously managed as separate entities, such as pay-TV, satellite television and cable. One of the important tasks of the new division will be to concentrate on the establishment of Disney family channels throughout Europe and in other parts of the world. In August, Disney announced its first significant new media investment in Europe - a plan to launch a German satellite television channel in January in partnership with CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcaster. It was made clear at the time that the deal could be a model for other satellite channels based on family entertainment. De Villiers said yesterday that he hoped to decide by Christmas whether or not to launch a Disney-backed satellite channel in the UK. 'We have finished the qualitative research and are now working on the quantitative research,' said de Villiers, who first joined Disney in 1988 as president of Buena Vista International, the main programme sales arm. The company wants to try to establish how many people would watch and what they would pay for a Disney channel on satellite and cable. Apart from deciding whether or not to go ahead, de Villiers is also considering whether such a UK channel should be launched by Disney alone or with partners.</p>

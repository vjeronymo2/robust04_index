			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Sincere N.K. Follow-up steps"] </F>   [Text] It is certainly a welcome turn of affairs that  Pyongyang has at long last found itself obliged to abide by the  rules of the international community. After nerve-wrecking  months of dickering and bickering with the United States and the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], North Korea decided  to open some of its nuclear facilities to international  inspectors -- just a few days before the IAEA was to convene its  general meeting to decide whether it should refer the North  Korean nuclear issue to the Security Council of the United  Nations.    Although the North Korean stance in this regard is still  clouded in ambiguity, it is our sincere wish that the  to-be-resumed inspection will help Pyongyang shed the infamy  earned in the international community for its obstinate  obsession with nuclear armament and other unsavory behavior.  The North Korean decision to remain within the framework of the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), if accompanied by  necessary deeds including reopening of the now-deadlocked  dialogue with Seoul, can surely clear stumbling blocks for  Pyongyang to progress in talks with the United States and Japan  toward rapprochement.    All is not settled with the decision alone, however. What is  important, and perhaps more crucial, is how sincerely Pyongyang  abides by the terms of the NPT. North Korea must act without  intentional procrastination while abiding faithfully by all  provisions of the NPT, and readily and honestly submit its  nuclear installations to international inspections including  those, for example, in the suspected Yongbyon and other areas.    The Pyongyang regime is advised to accept IAEA inspections  as  soon as possible so as not to arouse unnecessary suspicion  unless it has an ulterior motive for lingering. Surely, the  sooner the better for the North if it is really interested in  obtaining the confidence required to salvage its faltering  economy. It should waste no time in issuing visas to IAEA  inspectors who are all packed and ready to travel.    Regrettably, North Korea has so far rejected Seoul's  repeated  calls for mutual inspections of suspected sites in both Koreas.  An early conduct of such trial inspections would certainly  relieve Pyongyang of any suspicions that might arise in the  course of implementing procedural steps. The inter-Korea  inspections, based on the denuclearization declaration of the  Korean Peninsula, will be an important step that can, if  followed up by action, lead Pyongyang to gain international  trust badly needed for its viability.    Now that it has decided to allow IAEA inspectors into its  nuclear facilities, North Korea has no option but to sincerely,  and more importantly, quickly, implement required measures. It  would be folly for North Korea to remain under suspicion simply  by fumbling with excuses. There will be no way to conceal  Pyongyang's ulterior nuclear intentions, if any.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Shell Judging by the 3 per cent share price fall that greeted Shell's annual results, the market was less than impressed with its 4 per cent dividend increase. BP would have liked to pay a more generous dividend, but was constrained by its weak balance sheet. Shell had no such excuse; another percentage point increase would have cost the group a mere Pounds 20m. Granted, the dividend is only 1.2 times covered by net income, but the cost of a more generous pay-out would have been marginal in the context of its enormous cash flow. It is a measure of the group's strength that its investment programme has so far been unaffected by the downturn. The question is what message Shell intended to convey. Its statement on trading conditions was decidedly bearish, so the answer is probably that dividends will merely match inflation, at least until its chemicals and US businesses perk up. More generally, the market is obviously thoroughly disenchanted with the oil sector; Shell shares have fallen by more than 12 per cent since mid-January. The mood can be partly explained by investors' belated realisation that oil companies are not the safe haven they were thought to be. In the last two recessions, the companies were protected by oil price increases which fostered the illusion that they were intrinsically defensive. This time, the weak oil price has exposed their cyclical nature. Shell shares may have further to fall before they fully reflect that perception, although a historic yield of 6.5 per cent looks about right. By the same token, when the cycle turns there should be big rewards. In 1988 Shell's chemicals division earned Pounds 1bn. Last year, it made Pounds 23m.</p>

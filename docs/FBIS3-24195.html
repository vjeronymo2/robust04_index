Funds designated for consumption  during that period amounted to 611.2 billion rubles, with wages  accounting for 89 percent of the total and financial assistance  and special incentives accounting for 11 percent. Funds for all  personnel were equivalent to 10.5 percent of the total  production output. The average wage of people employed in oblast  industry in November was 317,300 rubles, and the figure in the  southern zone was 123,600 rubles.    In December there were work stoppages in some production  units at 17 industrial enterprises (3 in the Khanty-Mansiysk  Autonomous Okrug and 14 in the south). They included the  Nadezhda joint venture, the Zavod ATE joint-stock company, the  Ishim Machine-Building Plant, plants of the Ishim Agricultural  Machinery Production Association, the electrical machinery  plant, the DSP-250 plant, and other enterprises.    The main reasons were difficulties in selling products and  shortages of material resources. The stoppages led to the  dismissal of 151 workers in December, including 125 from Ishim  Machine-Building Plant. Another 4,012 workers had to take an  unpaid leave at the administration's request.    Production Expenditures: Expenditures per ruble of  commercial product were 14.3 percent above the figure for  January-November 1992 and amounted to 82.7 kopecks. Expenditures  decreased by 5 percent at enterprises in the oblast's southern  zone and amounted to 70.68 kopecks. Expenditures per ruble of  commercial product increased in all branches of industry except  the chemical and petrochemical industry, machine building, and  metal working.    Expenditures were much higher than they had been the  previous  year at the Chernogorneft closed joint-stock company (by 145.8  percent), the Langepasneftegaz joint-stock company (58.5  percent), enterprises of the Nizhnevartovskneftegaz Association  (31.7 percent), the Megion, Mezhdurechenskiy, and Pionerskiy  timber associations, the Lina joint-stock company, the  electrical machinery plant, and other enterprises.

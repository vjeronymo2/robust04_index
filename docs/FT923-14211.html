			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to address backbench concern LABOUR backbenchers are taking steps to counteract the possibility that Mr John Smith might develop a 'bunker mentality' after he is elected leader of the opposition at the end of next week. After years of behind-the-scenes griping that Mr Neil Kinnock's staff overprotected the leader from his troops, several MPs are taking precipitate action to ensure clearer lines of communication are kept open to the new leadership. Yesterday, Mr Graham Allen, the Nottingham North MP, won unopposed support at the parliamentary Labour party weekly meeting for a general review of the organisation and workings of the PLP, aimed at involving backbench MPs more closely in decision-making. Aware of the mood within the party, Mr Smith had already promised such a review when he made his leadership campaign presentation to the party last month. Mr Derek Foster, the chief whip re-elected last week, also made representing backbench interests an important element in his campaign. In a letter to MPs, Mr Allen emphasised his motion for a review committee was 'entirely constructive'. He added yesterday: 'In the past, in order to get a helpful suggestion considered you had to create a campaign or a row. There should be a mechanism whereby good ideas as well as discontent can be expressed.' Under his proposed review committee, the PLP chairman, three nominated shadow cabinet members and three elected MPs would meet regularly to discuss issues and report back to the PLP. Supporters of Mr Smith say he will conduct his leadership in a more collegiate style than Mr Kinnock, thereby provoking less of the 'insiders and outsiders' divisions complained of by the left. However, some more cynical MPs say that whatever the well-meaning intentions of the party's leader-to-be, the fierce rivalries within the PLP inevitably lead to a bunker mentality emerging.</p>

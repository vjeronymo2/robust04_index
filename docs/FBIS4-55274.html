			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, May 11 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia warned  Croatia that it will undertake measures to move around 1,000  refugees out from its holiday resorts on the Adriatic coast near  Novigrad where they are staying. The refugees, predominantly  Croats from the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  refused to leave Slovenia, where they have been accommodated, by  April 15, as was envisaged by a Slovenian-Croatian agreement on  governmental level. In a note to Zagreb, Ljubljana demands that  Slovenian ownership of the resorts and interstate agreements be  respected.    Failing to specify the diplomatic measures it will resort  to,  Slovenia threatened that the refugees would be moved out, with  the explanation that its future moves are politically and  morally justified.    Slovenian-Croatian relations have in recent weeks again  deteriorated, as can be seen from Ljubljana's cold response to  President Tudjman's invitation to Slovenian President Milan  Kucan to pay an official visit to Croatia.    Besides the problem of the resorts, i.e., ownership,  Ljubljana and Zagreb have also failed to regulate a number of  other important political and economic issues. The delimitation  of the border on the Adriatic coast and the delivery of power  from the Krsko nuclear power plant and the payment for it have  also been reasons for dispute. The constant drop in the  exchange of goods between these former Yugoslav republics is a  consequence of these disputes.</p>

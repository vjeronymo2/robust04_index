			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Observer: X marks the spot Clearly disgruntled with the South African government's foot-dragging in restructuring apartheid-era institutions, Benny Alexander, the ebullient secretary general of the radical Pan Africanist Congress, has struck his own blow for change. It registers scarcely a squeak on the Richter scale of international explosions, entailing an alteration of his name to 'Khoisan X' and a denunciation of his previous appellation as 'a symbol of victory for our former oppressor.' Khoi, explains the former Alexander, who claims descent from the indigenous Khoisan peoples of the Cape, means 'one who can manage people.' And the X? That is 'a mathematical variable denoting that which exists but is yet to be accurately identified.' Oh yeah, of course.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Copyright Office is of the firm opinion that it is not the successor agency or office to the Copyright Royalty Tribunal. The Reform Act represents a radically different approach for adjusting rates and distributing royalties for the copyright compulsory licenses, and is not an absorption of one agency by another. The Tribunal is replaced, not moved or merged, by ad hoc Arbitration Panels which are to be administered by the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress. The Office is therefore not simply picking up where the Tribunal left off, but is responsible for administering a completely new system of ratemaking and distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the Copyright Office is not a successor agency, it is our preliminary finding that all proceedings pending before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination were terminated at that time. In other words, the Office will not continue to conduct and handle matters and proceedings which were before the Tribunal, but will require that all parties which had pending business before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination must, if they desire the matter to receive further consideration, file the matter anew before the Copyright Office. Thus, for example, the Librarian will not automatically convene a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel to pick up where the proceedings left off for the 1990 cable distribution, but will require the parties who participated in that proceeding to refile their case with the Office in accordance with the rules and regulations proposed below. While the Office understands that the parties may be somewhat burdened by duplicating at least a portion of their case, it is necessary that the Office wipe the slate clean and, for purposes of the operation of the proposed rules and administrative efficiency, begin anew the matters pending before the former Tribunal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An issue related to the termination of proceedings pending before the former Tribunal and the requirement of new filings is the legal effect of orders and decisions issued by the Tribunal during those proceedings. New section 802(c) of the Copyright Act states that Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels ``shall act on the basis of *&blank;*&blank;* prior decisions of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal *&blank;*&blank;*'', but does not bind the Panels to those decisions; the effect of those decisions on the Librarian or the Copyright Office is not mentioned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Copyright Office has no intention of questioning or reopening matters decided by the former Tribunal with respect to ongoing proceedings. However, we understand that the termination of pending Tribunal proceedings and the requirement of new filings will likely raise again some of the issues previously decided by the Tribunal. The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress makes a preliminary finding that, while we will look to the Tribunal's decisions and orders for guidance, neither the Office nor the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels are legally bound by those decisions. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  All legal issues related to proceedings pending before the Tribunal at the time of its elimination may therefore be resubmitted to the Copyright Office and, where appropriate, to the Arbitration Panels for consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Copyright Office acknowledges that it is of course bound by rate adjustments and distributions that the Tribunal had conducted and concluded before its elimination. Thus, for example, the Office will not entertain any petitions to reexamine cable distributions for years earlier than 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Revising the former Tribunal's rules is a particularly complicated task, given the division of authority between the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels and the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress. Under the old law the Tribunal acted as a single autonomous body; in contrast, the distribution of royalty fees or the setting of royalty rates under the new legislation will often be a multistage process. For example, in order to adjust a compulsory license royalty rate, the Librarian of Congress, with the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, must appoint an arbitration panel and then review the panel's report and, with the Register's recommendation, either approve the report or substitute his/her own judgment. This new system renders many of the former Tribunal's rules and regulations inappropriate, and requires creation of a new framework to allocate responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, the Library and the Copyright Office recognize the desirability of preserving as much continuity as possible between the old and new systems. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rules are based upon and seek to track the structure and organization of the former Tribunal's rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The need for continuity is underscored by the Reform Act's instruction that the Tribunal's rules be fully adopted upon enactment, to be later amended or superseded. See 17 U.S.C. 802(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Library and Copyright Office have thoroughly reviewed the entire body of the former Tribunal's rules and regulations and considered the extent to which they fit with the new bifurcated system of ad hoc Arbitration Panels administered by the Library and the Office. The results are today's proposed rules, which are intended to preserve the essential elements of the Tribunal's system while taking into account the requirements and complexities presented by an independent arbitration process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the outset a technical change is required by the regulations governing the Code of Federal Regulations itself; the former Tribunal's rules are being moved from Chapter III to Chapter II of Title 37, CFR. Chapter III is repealed, and Chapter II is restructured to accommodate the new body of regulations. Chapter II, which until now has contained five individual parts (Parts 201&hyph;204 and 211), will be divided into two subchapters. Subchapter A will contain the five original parts of Chapter II, and new Subchapter B will contain the entire body of the former Tribunal rules, along with today's proposed changes. And future rule changes or additions bearing upon the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels will appear in subchapter 8 of Chapter II, 37 CFR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

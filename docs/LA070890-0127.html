			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: RAISED BY PUPPETS ONLY TO BE KILLED BY RESEARCH BY ANDREI  CODRESCU (ADDISON-WESLEY: $8.95)  </P> <P> Romanian-born poet Andrei Codrescu offers his sardonic reflections on the  follies and inconsistencies of contemporary culture in this anthology of  commentaries from NPR's "All Things Considered." Codrescu has an eye for the  off-beat image.  </P> <P> In the title essay, he muses on the giant puppets used to teach tame sandhill  cranes how to socialize with wild birds, and turns the experiment into a  metaphor for the problems of human communication. In one of his more outrageous  pieces, he suggests that Americans eliminate the federal deficit by fining  themselves 5 cents "every time they use the F-word." ("Eddie Murphy . . . who  has never spoken a whole sentence without using the F-word five or six times,  would contribute quite a good deal. From each according to his needs.") These  concise essays are both entertaining and thought-provoking, but it's impossible  for anyone who's listened to "All Things Considered" to read them without  hearing the author's distinctive, nasal voice.  </P></p>

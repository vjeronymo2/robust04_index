			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Compass to acquire catering from SAS COMPASS GROUP, the health-care and catering company, is to move into continental Europe through the acquisition of the airport restaurant and contract catering business of SAS Service Partner, the subsidiary of the Swedish airline. The Pounds 71.9m purchase price is to be funded through a six for 19 rights issue at 420p, 20 per cent below Tuesday's close. The rights issue will raise Pounds 86.8m. The acquisition will give Compass a presence in eight mainly northern European countries, and 34 airports. It will also provide an entry into the fragmented continental contract catering business, although most of the SAS contracts are in Scandinavia or in the off-shore sector where growth prospects are limited in the short term. UK analysts have recently been concerned that Compass has been better at improving margins through tight purchasing than increasing sales. But the market reacted enthusiastically yesterday. The shares rose 1p to 528p as the City digested the company's statement that the acquisition and rights issue will be modestly earnings enhancing in its first full year. Compass also reported an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 17m to Pounds 18.2m for the six months to end March on sales up 18.6 per cent at Pounds 209.4m. Earnings per share rose from 16.8p to 18p and the group is to pay a 4.44p interim dividend, up 6 per cent. The board forecast a final dividend of not less than 8.56p which, if paid, would mean a 5.7 per cent increase over 1992. Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said the catering division had performed well with operating profits rising 8 per cent to Pounds 14.6m. The group has also implemented a reorganisation into seven divisions which it hopes will provide a better structure to pursue contracts. Profits in the healthcare division grew 6.7 per cent to Pounds 6.7m. Acquisitions during the period pushed borrowings from Pounds 38m at the start of the year to Pounds 67.2m, but interest cover was at least seven times. Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, brought the SAS deal to Compass and underwrote the rights issue with Lazards. Background, Page 22 Lex, Page 20</p>

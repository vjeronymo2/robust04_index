			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH OFF TO SLOW START, MOST IN POLL SAY  </P> <P> George Bush is off to a slow start in his four months as President, say 59% of  Americans surveyed by ABC News and the Washington Post. The survey also  determined that slightly more than half of the respondents felt Bush was  lacking "clear goals where he wants to lead the country" or were uncertain  whether he has a plan. According to the survey, 47% felt Bush had clear goals,  43% said no, and 10% said they did not know. Of those who said Bush was off to  a slow start, 79% said they were concerned about it. Still, two in three people  approve of the way Bush is doing his job, the survey said. The telephone survey  of 1,009 Americans was conducted May 12 to 16 by ICR Survey Research Group of  Media, Pa., and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.  </P></p>

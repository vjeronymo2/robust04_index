			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Dealers await World Bank's DM3bn offering THE World Bank is expected to launch its first D-Mark global bond offering today. The DM3bn issue, via Deutsche Bank and Salomon Brothers, is likely to have a 10-year maturity and be priced tomorrow. The World Bank has already said that the bonds will be priced to yield single digits over the underlying German government bonds. The indicated price range being talked about in the market yesterday was five to seven basis points. Some syndicate managers said that a yield spread of less than five basis points could limit the success of the deal because it would leave little room for the bonds to outperform. Turkey also tapped the D-Mark sector late yesterday with a DM1bn five-year issue, via DG Bank. The bonds were priced to yield 190 basis points over the 5 5/8 bonds due September 1998 issued by Treuhand, the German privatisation agency. Turkey raised Pounds 125m in the Eurosterling sector last week through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. Syndicate managers took Turkey's swift return to the Eurobond market as a sign that it was eager to raise as much money as possible before Moody's, the international rating agency, took a decision on whether to lower the country's long-term rating from an investment grade to a speculative grade. Moody's placed Turkey's rating under review for possible downgrading on October 8. Elsewhere, Sweden, Dresdner Bank and Treasury Corp of Victoria (TVC) injected fresh liquidity into the long end of the EuroCanadian dollar, Eurodollar and Australian dollar sectors, respectively. Issuers have been keen to tap the demand for long-dated paper but the pricing of these bonds has often been hindered by the lack of government benchmarks. Sweden's CDollars 250m offering of 15-year Eurobonds was priced to yield 28 basis points over the interpolated yield curve. Dresdner paid 60 basis points over the curve for its Eurobonds which raised Dollars 200m in subordinated debt. The pricing was broadly in line with spreads in the secondary market for other 15-year Eurodollar issues launched earlier in the year. The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate dollars.</p>

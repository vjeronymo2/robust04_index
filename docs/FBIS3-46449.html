Qiao Shi, chairman of the China's National People's Congress  (NPC) Standing Committee, made these remarks at a luncheon in  honor of him hosted by Heinz Fischer, president of the National  Council of Austria, here today.    Qiao, who is paying an official goodwill visit to Austria as  the guest of Fischer, said over the past two days, he has had  very good meetings and talks with the Austrian leaders.    "We have shared identical views on most of the major issues,  and also had temporarily different views on some other issues,"  he said.    However, he said, there is a hope we can gradually reach  identical or similar views through further discussions."    He said, since China and Austria established diplomatic ties  in 1971, the two countries have enjoyed sound relationship.    Looking toward the future, he said such ties will become  closer, he added.    Fischer said he has talked a lot with Qiao over the past two  days. To exchange views with each other is of great  significance, he added.    He said he believed that at the end of Qiao's visit to  Austria, he will feel that he has visited a country full of  friendly sentiments toward China.    Fischer wished China prosperity and development.    The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.</p>

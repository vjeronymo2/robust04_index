			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CANDIDATES' FORUM ON SPECIAL EDUCATION  </P> <P> Eight Ocean View School District board candidates speaking before parents of  special education students proposed ways of bringing those students into the  mainstream and improving communication with the students' families.  </P> <P> The candidates' forum held Wednesday was the first ever sponsored by the West  Orange County Special Education consortium, which represents five school  districts in northwest Orange County.  </P> <P> Carolyn Hunt, a nine-year board member seeking election to an unexpired,  two-year term, said she advocates "mainstreaming these children into as many  activities as possible," including lunchtime events and other extracurricular  programs.  </P> <P> Hunt's only challenger, Steve Buhrig, said he believes that can best be  accomplished by channeling more money into special education programs and  establishing a network among parents of those students.  </P> <P> Randy Vanderhook, one of nine candidates for three full four-year terms being  contested, agreed that the special education consortium should expand  interaction among parents. But, he added, given the statewide budget  constraints, the group should not rely only on dwindling funds from individual  school districts.  </P> <P> Many of the parents said that networking among themselves is difficult because  districts cite privacy laws in refusing to provide names and addresses of  parents who have special education students.  </P> <P> To help improve communication, candidate Tracy Pellman said she favored holding  district forums among parents and board members -- an idea proposed at a  previous candidates' forum by challenger Carolyn Kanode.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's meeting, Kanode suggested that when parents agree to accept  special education programs for their children, they fill out address cards to  be distributed to a parents' consortium and other advocacy groups.  </P> <P> Challenger Julie Engquist suggested that the district establish parent contacts  at each school to deliver information to other parents of special education  children.  </P> <P> Challengers Lottie Hobbs and Flint Morrison also stressed communication.  </P> <P> Hobbs, referring to her involvement in Ocean View's debate last spring over  closing three schools, said that "all parents were frustrated with the  process." When the question is addressed again next spring, she said, parents'  specific concerns will be better addressed because firm solutions will be  directly proposed by district staff members.  </P> <P> Morrison said he supports on-site, school intervention teams to deal with  special education problems.  </P> <P> Absent were board president Charles Osterlund, a 15-year member who is seeking  re-election, and challengers James M. Ball and Randall J. Clifford. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

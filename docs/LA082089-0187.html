			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH'S SUCCESS BUILT ON BLEND OF YUPPIES, MARKETING  </P> <P> When pastor Rick Warren asked his burgeoning Saddleback Valley congregation for  money to build a permanent church, Don and Hootie Hill were willing to do what  they could.  </P> <P> The couple sold their four-bedroom, three-fireplace lakeside home in Lake  Forest, moved to a smaller home in Mission Viejo and contributed the profit to  the church building fund.  </P> <P> Others in the congregation, which numbers 4,000 on Sundays, gave recreational  vehicles, stocks and cash generated from retirement accounts, second mortgages  or vacation funds.  </P> <P> "We all have a strong desire to build a house for the Lord," Hootie Hill said.  Warren "had the vision and he had us catch it. . . . He's a motivator, no doubt  about it."  </P> <P> At a time when an estimated 95% of Orange County's young congregations are  stymied by prohibitive land and building costs, Warren's Saddleback Valley  Community Church, a 9-year-old congregation of many previously unchurched baby  boomers, has been able to purchase a $3.5-million, 113-acre site in the  semirural Foothill-Trabuco area. Even more unusual, the Southern Baptist church  has proposed a controversial $55-million compound that would include the  county's largest sanctuary with 4,800 seats.  </P> <P> Hill believes it was "a total miracle of God." Others credit Warren's charisma,  shrewd timing and marketing techniques -- like sermons based on surveys and  "Jacuzzis for Jesus" baptisms -- with the church's success. Saddleback  Community Church is among the fastest growing congregations in the country,  according to a recent study done at Southwest Baptist College in Bolivar, Mo.  </P> <P> "Evidently we've got a message that is meeting a real need in people's lives,"  Warren said.  </P> <P> The church has spawned 13 "daughter" congregations in Southern California and  Warren holds seminars on church growth for pastors of various denominations.  One this year drew 500 pastors from as far away as Asia and South America.  </P> <P> "It's a whole philosophy that basically says we're trying to take a traditional  message and communicate it in a contemporary way," Warren said. "Our big  emphasis is on people: What do you need? Where are you hurting?"  </P> <P> The son of a Baptist preacher and a high school librarian, Warren, 35, grew up  in Redwood Valley, a rural town north of San Francisco, and graduated from  California Baptist College in Riverside and Southwestern Baptist Theological  Seminary in Fort Worth.  </P> <P> After seminary in 1979, Warren said he made a demographic study of areas likely  to need new churches and discovered Saddleback Valley was the fastest growing  area at the time in the fastest growing county.  </P> <P> He and his wife moved in 1980 with "no members, no friends, no building, no  income," he said. "We pulled into a real estate office and met a guy named Don  Dale. I said, 'Hi, my name's Rick Warren, I'm here to start a church. We have  no money.' Within two hours, he showed us a condo, got us the first month  rent-free and became our first member."  </P> <P> Warren designed his church based on his own door-to-door survey of 500  residents. He discovered his target was "Saddleback Sam," a prototypical yuppie  who believes in God but has not attended church since childhood. The "Sams"  told him they weren't going to church because sermons were boring, people were  aloof, child care was a problem and -- curiously in light of his later success  -- pastors were too interested in money.  </P> <P> Warren believes the days are gone when people go to church out of habit.  </P> <P> "A lot of baby boomers would attend church if it used their kind of music, the  pastor talked in real-life terms of people's problems of paying bills, stress  and freeways and what the Bible says about raising kids."  </P> <P> (What does the Bible say about freeways? "Be patient," Warren said.)  </P> <P> The church, for example, has no creed or statement of faith and does not use  the word Baptist. To attract the unchurched, Warren has:  </P> <P> * Placed full-page ads in the local Saddleback Valley News with grabber  messages for Saddleback Sam: "Some Days Nothing Seems to go Right!" "Most of Us  Live Our Lives the Way We Watch TV." "Is Your Marriage Hurting?" "Are You  Making More Money But Enjoying Life Less?"  </P> <P> * Sent brochures with photos and comments from converts to 35,000 homes.  </P> <P> * Based on a survey of the radio listening habits of his congregation, formed a  band with electronic keyboard and synthesizers for Sunday worship and scheduled  top Christian singers like Debbie Boone for Easter services.  </P> <P> * Developed dozens of activities for individuals and families such as bowling,  fishing, a luau for singles and 26 small Bible study groups. The church also  sponsors 15 softball teams.  </P> <P> From 146 members in 1980, the church has grown to 1,500 official members with  voting rights on land purchases and budgets. Four thousand generally attend  Sunday services at Trabuco Hills High School and 13,000 names of visitors are  in a computer. The church has 12 ministers and a support staff of 35.  </P> <P> Like most young Orange County churches, the Saddleback Community congregation  was a wandering tribe, holding Sunday services for five years at Laguna Hills  High School before moving to Trabuco Hills, and using other church or school  district facilities for its programs.  </P> <P> Without a permanent building, Warren uses the ocean, lakes, swimming pools and  "What we call Jacuzzis for Jesus" -- a member's back yard hot tub in Nellie  Gail Ranch -- for baptisms.  </P> <P> Though arranging meetings in far-flung facilities is frustrating and costly --  last year, the church paid $200,000 in rent to Saddleback Valley School  District -- Warren put off his building program "as long as possible" to let  the congregation grow, said executive pastor Glen Kruen. "If 200 people are  giving, or 4,000 people are giving, it's a big difference," he said.  </P> <P> Following the initial $1.5 million raised in the fall of 1987, an equal amount  in pledges is coming in at $500,000 a year, he said.  </P> <P> Four years ago, Warren won county approval to build a 5,700-seat church on 72  acres in Rancho Santa Margarita, said church planning consultant Mel Malkoff.  The plans fell through when a Newport Beach developer bought the property while  the church sought financing, he said.  </P> <P> "This is the first time they were able to tie up enough land to build the  church program at an affordable price," Malkoff said.  </P> <P> To potential neighbors who cry that a seven-story, 4,800 seat church would ruin  the countryside or that churches should not be allowed to build recreation  fields, church leaders say the compound they propose provides multiple  community services -- such as day care and recreation -- and should be treated  as if it was a school or community center.  </P> <P> Churches, particularly those in Orange County, are developing in a manner  similar to malls, which replaced neighborhood shopping centers, Malkoff said.  Saddleback Community Church typifies the trend of a larger church offering  specialized services such as counseling and recreation, he said.  </P> <P> "That's what we're trying to do -- be a community service institution and  provide a lot of amenities builders don't want to provide, such as day care,"  Warren said.  </P> <P> "A verse in the Bible says Jesus moves in four ways: physically, spiritually,  intellectually and socially. We believe the purpose of the church is to be able  to help people be better in all areas."  </P> <P> In an Aug. 10 letter to County Planning Commissioner Steve Nordeck, Warren  wrote: "It is not the duty of county staff to define what a church should or  shouldn't have as part of its ministry. Our attorneys have informed us that  this is a clear violation of the separation of church and state issues."  </P> <P> The church's popularity dictated its size, he wrote. "If the residents didn't  want the church, they wouldn't attend and the size could be scaled down!  </P> <P> "You can't tell 12,000 residents to stop liking their church and to go form a  smaller one!"  </P> <P> Warren concluded: "We believe this is God's piece for a beautiful community  amenity that will benefit the people who already live there. After meeting  nearly ten years without our own permanent home, we are committed to this  piece."  </P></p>

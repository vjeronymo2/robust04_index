			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Japanese corporate earnings  showed bright signs in the January-March quarter with sales  rebounding and profits and capital investment slowing their  declines, the Finance Ministry reported Friday [17 June].    A ministry official, briefing reporters, said the quarterly  business survey indicated "signs of a gradually recovering  economy."    The survey covered 23,053 companies capitalized at 10  million  yen and more, and excluding financial institutions and insurance  companies. The number of respondents came to 19,366 companies,  or 84.0 percent.    Combined pretax profits for the quarter fell 5.8 percent  from  the previous year posting the 15th consecutive decline, but the  yearly decline slowed from the October-December quarter's 6.2  percent and the July-September period's 21.6 percent, the report  said.    Sales rose 0.8 percent after falling for seven quarters in a  row as sales of non-manufacturers rose 3.0 percent after  declining for six straight quarters.    Capital investment shrank 11.7 percent for the ninth  straight  decline, but the rate of decline slowed from the previous  quarter's 16.8 percent and the July-September period's 15.8  percent.    In reflection of improving earnings, the officials noted  progress in inventory adjustments as capital stocks at  manufacturers rose a scant 0.8 percent compared with a 2.8  percent gain in the previous quarter.    The official said, "recovering domestic demand is apparently  starting to contribute to corporate earnings."    Manufacturers saw their pretax profits fall 12.2 percent on  4.4 percent lower sales, improving from the previous quarter's  16.5 percent drop in profits and 4.5 percent decline in sales.    The official said the improvements reflected their  cost-cutting and other restructuring efforts.    For non-manufacturers, pretax profits fell back 1.9 percent  from a 3.9 percent rise in the previous quarter, despite the  rebound in sales.    The official attributed the profit decline to falling prices  at the wholesale level amid a discount trend among consumers.  But he said the trend was yet not evident at the retail level.    On an industry basis, pretax profits jumped 108.3 percent  among food makers, reflecting improved consumption, and 8.9  percent among petroleum product makers thanks to lower crude oil  prices on the higher yen.    Electric machinery and equipment makers enjoyed a 13.3  percent rise on buoyant demand for semiconductor devices at home  and abroad and for household appliances from continued strong  housing investment.    Also buoyed by housing spending, construction firms saw a  4.4  percent rise in their pretax profits, and real estate firms were  4 billion yen in the black from the previous quarter's pretax  losses of 133.1 billion yen.    Steel Makers suffered 123.8 percent lower profits, and  wholesalers and retailers faced a combined decline of 16.7  percent.    Capital investment by manufacturers fell 20.6 percent,  almost  unchanged from the previous month's 20.0 percent drop, and that  by non-manufacturers improved to a 7.4 percent decline compared  with the previous decline of 15.2 percent.    The official said bright signs were seen among  manufacturers,  with a 2.2 percent rise in capital investment by electric  machinery and equipment makers after eight consecutive quarters  of decline.</p>

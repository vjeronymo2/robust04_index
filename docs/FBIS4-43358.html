			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Christophe Lamfalussy: "A Vote for Nothing"] </F>   [Text] Millions of European electors have just voted,  testing their leaders and governments despite themselves,  apathetic here, excited elsewhere, in elections which avoided  many of the major European issues. The elections lacked emotion  over the war in Bosnia, lacked correctness in a true debate on  structural employment, and did not address the soul and contours  of the current enlargement process. Commenting on the results,  which leaders referred on Monday [14 June] to the Austrian  decision to join the European Union (EU)? The Twelve now know  they will become 13, and perhaps more on 1 January 1995. This  event has not been stressed enough and has more importance in  European history than a furtive and temporary snapshot of public  opinion.    The paradoxical result of this non-European vote, unworthy  of  Europe's democratic tradition, is that it does not fundamentally  change the Strasbourg parliamentary balance any more than it  endangers European construction.    The Socialist group remains the leading political force in  Europe, followed by the Christian Democrats. These two groups  together hold the keys to all the pro-European votes in  Strasbourg. Therefore European construction will not suffer from  the emergence of anti-Maastricht votes like the Villiers list in  France and the June Movement in Denmark.    However, it would be wrong to not reflect upon what has  happened in France and Denmark. The two countries saw a  significant rise in participation rates. This is not by chance,  because they were the only countries, along with a more  unanimous Ireland, to organize referendums to approve the famous  European treaty.    Flattered that its views were asked, public opinion in these  countries has become fired up, far more than elsewhere. Europe  has been the subject of major debates, sometimes out of place  but often legitimate. And it is these major debates which were  so cruelly lacking in the other Europe, the one which voted so  undecidedly, openly displaying its indifference when the vote  was not obligatory.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW MASON SHOW IS LIKE THE OLD MASON  </P> <P> Jackie Mason set himself a tall order when, in "Jackie Mason Brand New," which  opened Wednesday at the Henry Fonda Theater, he promised a show that would  consist of completely new material. With the exception of a solitary joke  having to do with guarding your health while your grandfather steals your  money, he's succeeded, even if it's deja vu all over again.  </P> <P> It's good to see that he's back strong after his "Chicken Soup" TV debacle, and  that he's even chosen Hollywood, which forgives everything except failure, as  his comeback site.  </P> <P> In an era in which a comedy boom billows out of the collective energy of  self-satisfied amateurs whose shallow efforts are bent on parlaying 20 minutes  of material into a show-biz career, Mason plays well by contrast. His timing is  incomparable. His jokes are delivered with the utmost economy, and he knows how  to cluster them around themes that often develop like cadenzas. And he has of  course that old-fashioned Brooklyn Jewish persona that's as thick and  distinctive as borscht. What the jokes are about, though, is another matter.  </P> <P> Thomas Wolfe has a passage in one of his novels about a character who can't  help but utter cliches every time he opens his mouth. Even when he thinks he  has an original thought, and even when he says something that's true or of  merit, it sounds stale. That's one of the problems with Mason. He's struggling  for freshness, and sometimes you're with him, as when he does a number on  George Bush's militant effort to annihilate the wimp factor (Bush to Gorbachev:  "You better not come here with broccoli!").  </P> <P> Still, he falls into his old drumbeat in which Jews squabble their inept lives  away with sour envy, price-tag mania and nouveau riche affectation; gentiles  are eminently practical ("Jewish ingenuity stopped in 1874. That's when  Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, and the Jew realized he could  call a gentile to do the job"), and marriage is a prison sentence.  </P> <P> Mason thinks he's bearing the comedic burden of telling us the truth when, in  fact, he's relating the narrow perspective of the self-described Brooklyn Jew,  memorably pungent in small doses, but not something that describes a world of  experience.  </P> <P> A complete review runs in Friday's Calendar section.  </P></p>

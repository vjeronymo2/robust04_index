			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Sales growth cushions traders from impact of MetroCentre THE IMPACT of the Gateshead MetroCentre, Tyneside's out-of-town shopping centre, on existing retail areas appears to have been softened by a general growth in retail sales. When the MetroCentre - Britain's first out-of-town shopping centre - opened in 1986 there was concern that it would have a severe impact on established shopping centres, say researchers from the Oxford Institute of Retail Management. Their report, monitoring the centre's first five years of operation, indicates that although sales growth in nearby shopping centres was checked in 1987, it generally resumed in the following two and a half years. By June 1988, when the MetroCentre was estimated to have an annual turnover of between Pounds 220m and Pounds 240m, it was attracting around 7 per cent of the available retail expenditure within its 30-minute-drive catchment area, say the researchers. By mid-1989 it employed almost 5,000 people with 46 per cent of that total full-time staff. The report says: 'The evaluation did not show any kind of 'disaster' in trade elsewhere, despite all the indications of changing trends.' It estimates that between 1986 and 1989 regional retail sales increased by more than a quarter. However, the report cautions: 'The 1980s were exceptional in post-war times in retail sales growth.' It also notes that the MetroCentre's impact was more severe in weaker shopping areas. Retail change on Tyneside and the Impact of the MetroCentre.

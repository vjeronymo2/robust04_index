			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Rome, 28 Jan -- Today Viktor Chernomyrdin, the  chairman of the Russian Government who is paying an official  visit to Italy, met with Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the president of  the Republic. During the meeting in the Quirinale Palace he said  that Russia considers Italy as its priority and reliable partner  on the European continent. This was reported by a well-informed  source in the Russian delegation after the meeting.    Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that the confidence of contacts  between the leaders of the two countries has risen which allows  them to introduce new elements of partnership and to attach more  dynamism to Russian-Italian ties. He also said that Moscow  attaches big importance to a forthcoming visit by Boris Yeltsin,  president of Russia, to Italy in July 1994 in connection with  his participation in a G-7 meeting in Naples.    Speaking about the bilateral economic ties the Russian  premier said that the government of the Russian Federation  intends to undertake maximum efforts to creat a favorable  climate for foreign investors among whom, he believes, Italian  partners are, as before, in the forefront. During the meeting  he spoke out for extending cultural ties between the two  countries and for improving their contractual basis. Viktor  Chernomyrdin expressed his gratitude to the Italian people for  supporting Russian reforms in this difficult time.    Today, Viktor Chernomyrdin also met with representatives of  Italian business circles in Rome. In the headquarters of ENI  [Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi], a major Italian state fuel  concern, the Russian Premier replied to journalists' questions.  He expressed the hope that fruitful Russian-Italian economic  cooperation will "serve to step up the pace of reforms in  Russia." Viktor Chernomydin also reported that several other  projects were discussed today besides the recent Gazprom-ENI  contract, which he considers to be "the contract of the century  in terms of its significance for Russia and Italy." "We would  very much like ENI to step up its work not only in the oil and  gas sphere, but also in such spheres as chemicals and foodstuff  production. The task which I set during this meeting will stir  the management of the company to further cooperation, the  development of which should not be delayed any longer," he said.  The joint development of oil and gas fields in the Barents Sea  and on Yamal were among the projects which Viktor Chernomyrdin  said were discussed today.</p>

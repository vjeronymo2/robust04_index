			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (7): A special breed of savers - Deborah Hargreaves meets the contract energy managers FROM energy-saving light bulbs to the installation of their own power plants, companies across the UK are perceiving the benefits of efficient energy management. Even moderate users of fuel can make significant cost savings by conserving energy and, in the current recession, all efforts at reducing costs are under review. In an attempt to cut down spending on energy, many industrial users, as well as public and private institutions are contracting out the management of energy consumption and resources to specialist operations. Mr John Ashcroft, managing director of AHS Emstar, the UK's largest contract energy manager, says the company has seen a steady climb in business in recent years, 'which hasn't in any way been diluted by the recession'. Contract energy managers offer to make cost-savings for their customers which range from the largest companies to public libraries, leisure centres and hospitals, by taking over the responsibility for energy provision. Energy saving is not just about turning off unnecessary lights: these specialist companies offer a variety of services ranging from fuel purchasing to funding the installation of a company's own power plant which the contract manager will then operate. Mr Simon Lloyd, business development manager at BP Energy, an offshoot of British Petroleum, reckons a company can look to save 10 per cent or more in its energy costs by bringing in outside managers. Contract energy management companies will provide tailor-made contracts for their customers which can be as complex or as simple as required. But, in many cases, a manager is developing a strategy for a company in the rapidly-changing UK energy market. 'The energy market has started to look more complicated following the government's privatisation initiatives and many of our customers are not geared up to searching for fuel at the best price,' said Mr Ashcroft. The company will build up an approach to the energy market with its corporate customer stretching over a period of time. The contract manager will force down costs and keep them down, regularly reporting energy costs to the company's management - 'there is a danger that in some companies energy management becomes flavour of the month and is then forgotten about, but you can't afford to turn your back on it as the energy market is rapidly changing and strategies need constant updating.' This is why typical contracts with energy managers extend over five to 10 years and often longer. BP Energy, for example, recently embarked on a 10-year contract with English China Clays to provide a combined heat and power station for the company's Par Harbour site - its largest facility which has an energy bill of Pounds 4m a year. While helping to cut the company's overall energy costs, the new plant will also reduce English China Clays' exposure to electricity price volatility as well as cutting down its emissions of greenhouse gases. Combined heat and power schemes (CHP) provide many environmental benefits for large energy users. AHS Emstar has provided Northumbrian Water with a plant for recycling energy which offers significant cost savings. The operation involves heating sewage sludge and collecting the bio-gas given off. This is then passed through a CHP plant where it is used to generate electricity to run the pumps at the sewage plant. The heat generated is used again to heat up the sludge. The specialist contract energy management company will often provide access to funding for CHP plants and other installations which are then largely paid for in cost savings made for the company. AHS Emstar recently provided Pounds 10m for Tunnel Refineries to build a CHP plant which is saving the company Pounds 500,000 a year in energy costs. The recession is forcing many companies to reduce energy bills, but contract energy management companies estimate that their services have touched very few of the UK's potential customers. Mr Ashcroft reckons that eight per cent of the potential market is being supplied at a total value of roughly Pounds 200m a year. Mr Lloyd says that turnover at BP Energy has doubled in the past two years as awareness of contract energy management has grown, along with a trend that has led many companies to contract-out various corporate functions. AHS Emstar was created a year ago by the merger of Associated Heat Services with Emstar, previously part of the Shell group. The company now offers a panoply of energy management services as well as bulk purchasing for fuel. However, companies specialising in specific areas of the energy management business are also carving a niche in the market. Ex-Or, for example, is a company which designs and produces energy saving lighting control systems for industrial and commercial use. The company has recently set up a system for Marks and Spencer's largest warehouse at Hayes in Middlesex which ensures that lighting is turned off on the building's 249 storage racks when they are unattended. Since lighting can make up three-quarters of the electricity costs for such a facility, switching the lights off can make huge savings. Contract energy management is a growth area in spite of the declining size of many UK companies. So far, intensive energy users such as paper processing plants and industrial processes which require a lot of fuel have proved the most eager customers. But the energy managers claim that most industrial and commercial operations have much to gain from taking their energy needs in hand. With only a tiny percentage of the potential market supplied, contract energy management could be one of the few growth areas in the current recession.</p>

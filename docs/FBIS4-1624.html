			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Three young priests  have been elected vice-chairmen of the Beijing Patriotic  Catholic Association or the Beijing Religious Affairs Committee,  marking the entry of a younger generation of clergy.    Officials of religious affairs said that more younger  clergymen have been trained in Beijing and nearly half of all  the 400-plus religious teaching staff in the Chinese capital are  young or middle- aged.    In the past several years, a few theological institutes  including the Christian Yanching Theological Seminary, the  Catholic Monastery, the Institute of Islamic Theology, and  seminars including the Buddhist Monks' Class and the Lama Class  at the Yonghe Lamasery have been restored in Beijing.    Since 1989, some 22 graduates from the Catholic Monastery  have become priests. Three others have been sent for  theological studies in the United States and another two are  scheduled to study in Hong Kong.    In addition, 18 young sisters from the Catholic convent have  become leaders of religious affairs and scores of graduates from  religious schools have become imams, lamas and nuns.    The religious officials said the emergence of these younger  clergy has greatly reduced the lack of successors to carry on  religious affairs.    So far, there is a 35-year-old monk acting as vice-president  of the Beijing Buddhist Association, and a number of other young  clergy have been elected leaders of monasteries or the Beijing  Islamic Association.</p>

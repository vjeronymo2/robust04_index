Protect and  Safeguard Restored Communications Lines and Facilities"; place  and date not given]    [Text] The tragic events that have taken place  recently in Samegrelo [Mingrelia], quite aside from terrible  human and moral losses, have greatly damaged many economic  sectors, including communications. Communications workers  undertook restoration work as soon as the combat stopped. They  worked very diligently, and often at the risk of their lives;  they restored various connections and phone, television, and  postal facilities. We asked Deputy Communications Minister  Vakhtang Todua to answer a few questions on what has been done  and what still has to be done.    [Narmania] Batono Vakhtang, you spent quite a long time in  the Samegrelo region. What was the situation there and how much  were you able to get done?    [Todua] First we went to Samtredia with a brigade of  specialists; there we were joined by experienced local workers,  and we immediately started working to restore inter-city  telephone connections, television relay lines, and postal  services. As for the situation, we found communications  facilities so badly wrecked that we hardly knew where to begin.  If it hadn't been for the Samegrelo regional provisional  emergency committee's help it would have taken us a lot longer.  The lack of fuel hurt us the worst.    We started in Samtredia and soon went to Abasha, then  Senaki,  Khobi, Zugdidi, Tsalendzhikha, Dzhvarzeni, Chkhorotsku, and  Martvili. The most difficult section was  Zugdidi-Tsalendzhikha-Dzhvarzeni, where restoration work is  still going on. Thirty kilometers of cable were completely  damaged or stolen; to replace it, the Ministry brought its last  stocks of connecting cable to the site. We worked without let-up  for almost two months. Let me emphasize once more that we were  greatly aided by local cadres, especially Vani's communications  workers. The local population also helped out; they did most of  the dirty work, in snow, slush, and cold. Our heartfelt thanks  to them.    [Narmania] We have already reported the work you have done  in  the Samegrelo region. How much money was spent, and does any  particular factor stand out?    [Todua] The work cost about 150 million Russian rubles. It's  a lot, but it's justified: any place there are no  communications, you know, there is no state. So this money has  been spent for the sake of independent Georgia's better future.  As for your second question, we need to emphasize that the most  important thing now is to deal properly with criminals of every  kind in order to ensure that our country's very vital  communications facilities are not destroyed again.    [Narmania] In your opinion, who does the most damage to our  communications--the armed gangs who don't care about anything  except making money by any means, the general population, or  (forgive me for being so blunt) certain dishonest--to say the  least--workers in your own system who know what is going on and  where and therefore have easy access to booty? And, in your  opinion, what must be done to stop this disgracefulness?    [Todua] Communications facilities are extremely vital, which  is why we have held many meetings with the local population to  explain the necessity of safeguarding them. The smooth operation  of our facilities now plays an especially vital role. That's why  Eduard Shevardnadze, when he was in the conflict zone, went  first to the post offices and instructed us to restore their  operation as soon as possible, also communications in the cities  and villages. "That's the way to restore life to normal," he  added.    That's the absolute truth, which is why we worked so  tirelessly. That's why enemy forces tried to stop us and  attacked our communications workers. If it hadn't been for the  help provided by operations personnel of the MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs], we couldn't have done much. Still, unless a  special service is created to provide reliable protection to  communications, we'll still be in trouble.    [Narmania] You mentioned attacks. Were they very frequent?    [Todua] Quite frequent. One such attack occurred on the  Zugdidi-Dzhvarzeni road where we were hauling equipment to  repair a mast to restore television in Tsalendzhikha. A 20-man  gang attacked us; they riddled our bus with bullets, disarmed  our guards and took them prisoner, and forbade us to do the  work. Despite these difficulties, we managed to complete some  solid and important work, though not all of it.    [Narmania] Do you have much more work to do in Samegrelo?    [Todua] There's still a lot to do. We're doing everything we  can to stock up on necessary materials and components, take them  to the sites, and complete the rest of the restoration work.</p>

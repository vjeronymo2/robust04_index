			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Kohl switches tack in bid to reach solidarity pact deal CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the main party in the Germany's ruling coalition, is considering a new system to finance the soaring cost of unemployment and retraining in east Germany, to spread the burden of paying for unification. The move could provide the key to a compromise with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and trade unions over Mr Kohl's planned 'solidarity pact', currently bogged down in differences over where to cut government spending, and how to share the financial burden. Prospects for an early conclusion to the negotiations over the pact worsened yesterday, when the CDU admitted to continuing divisions within its own ranks and postponed its next meeting to February 9, and the SPD tabled tough conditions for any new round of talks. At the same time there was gloomy news on the wages front, with German construction workers tabling a pay demand for 6.9 per cent, and immediate wage equalisation for workers in east Germany - a move in complete contradiction to the wage restraint Chancellor Kohl is calling for in the solidarity pact. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, the leader of the public sector workers' union, oTV, also rejected any move to slow down the pace of wage rises in east Germany, in spite of evidence from many parts of industry that high eastern wages are undermining investment plans. In spite of the bad news, the latest indication of compromise from Mr Kohl's party provides confirmation that the negotiations for the pact are still on track, even if delayed. The Chancellor announced that he intended to be ready to present legislation to his cabinet on February 17, to put the pact into effect. The move within the CDU is to consider a switch in financing of the Federal Labour Office programmes in east Germany, which bear the brunt of western subsidies for unemployment, job creation schemes and retraining, from national insurance contributions to some form of direct tax ation. That is precisely the area in which the SPD is demanding greater 'social justice' in paying for the recovery of east Germany. The opposition wants to levy a special tax on the better paid, primarily to pay for labour market subsidies.</p>

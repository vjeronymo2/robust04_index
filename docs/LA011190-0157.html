			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> POLICE WILL HELP JUVENILES  </P> <P> The Culver City Police Department will be taking a small group of juveniles  under its wing in a pilot counseling program designed to steer them away from  gangs, drugs and crime.  </P> <P> Approved by the City Council on Monday, the program will offer tutoring,  counseling, leadership training and sports to eight to 10 youths between the  ages of 14 and 17, said Capt. Lars Sederling.  </P> <P> The teen-agers will also go on a outdoor expedition with Outward Bound, which  works with urban youths on building their self-esteem.  </P> <P> The Police Department will work with the Human Services Department and Culver  City High School to sponsor activities and find volunteer tutors, Sederling  said. "We're going to exclude hard-core gang members, hard-core addicts, people  we're pretty sure can't change."  </P> <P> The program will operate for six to eight months on $14,500 in Police  Department funds derived from seized cash, cars and other property.  </P> <P> An additional $500 from the department's seized-asset funds will go to a  continuing city project to install deadbolt and window locks at homes of senior  citizens, Sederling said.  </P></p>

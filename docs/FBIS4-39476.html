			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lyudmila Bildyugina report under the "Regional Policy" </F> rubric: "Buy and Sell, As Long As It Is Not Land. Letter to  the Russian President"]    [Text] Stavropol Kray -- The Stavropol Kray State Duma has  sent a letter to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin and the  Russian Federation Federal Assembly "requesting that legislation  permitting the purchase and sale of land should not be  implemented and that components of the Federation should be  granted the right to independently determine the procedure for  regulating land relations on sub-departmental territory."    In the letter, which was adopted unanimously, the deputies  attribute their request to the fact that the State Duma is  extremely worried about the sociopolitical situation prevailing  in the kray in connection with the upcoming adoption of  legislation regulating land relations in the purchase and sale  of plots of land.    At present, representatives of over 200 nations and  nationalities live on the kray's territory, and many of them  have settled in ethnic population centers. The purchase and  sale of land could lead to a change in the existing ethnic  status quo and exacerbate already tense relations. Furthermore,  peoples for whom land has never been in private ownership  (Cossacks, Turkmens, Nogai, and others) live on the kray's  territory in close-knit communities.    The implementation of the purchase and sale of land, the  deputies are convinced, could lead to a loss of ethnic control  of a priceless asset of the Russian people, that is, Mineralnyye  Vody in the Caucasus.    The Stavropol Kray State Duma believes that land and other  natural resources may be held in state, municipal, or private  ownership. However, the right to buy and sell should be  extended only to truck garden and dacha plots, as well as to  land occupied by structures and buildings which are privately  owned.    It can be said with a great degree of certainty that the  State Duma deputies' view corresponds to the mass mood of the  Stavropol population, almost half of which is rural. The basis  for this conclusion is a kind of referendum on the question  conducted among kray inhabitants by the popular newspaper  STAVROPOLSKAYA PRAVDA, which has been publishing the most varied  opinions over a long period of time under the "Land and Will"  rubric, including those of ordinary private farmers, kolkhoz  chiefs, agriculture specialists, leaders of administrations, and  pensioners in the city and in the country.... The editorial  office also familiarized its readers with the stance of  supporters and opponents of private ownership of land living in  other regions of the country. Statistics and the analysis of  the opinions and readers' responses which the editorial office  carried out make it possible to draw the simple conclusion.    Many specialists in Stavropol believe that the squandering  of  the land stock must be prevented, that it would be best of all  to use plots of land as social shock-absorbers -- as a kind of  compensation for the socioeconomic losses that Russians have  suffered in consequence of the shock without therapy. This  would ease social tension today in many respects and help  compensate for the sharp depreciation in the population's  financial investments and other securities.</p>

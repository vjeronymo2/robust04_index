			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BENCHED JUSTICE;  </P> <P> IN PURSUIT OF JUSTICE REFLECTIONS OF A STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BY JOSEPH R.  GRODIN WITH A FOREWORD BY JUSTICE WILLIAM J. BRENNAN JR. (UNIVERSITY OF  CALIFORNIA PRESS: $20; 200 PP.; 0-520-06654-5)  </P> <P> Lawyers -- and therefore, in our system, judges -- are really rather dreary  people. Books about lawyers are thus, by definition, not likely to excite  interest unless they excite hatred, ridicule and contempt. Books by lawyers are  likely to have even less sex appeal. Judicial autobiographies -- or "My Life as  a Judge" -- have not been among our most exciting forms of literary expression.  </P> <P> I once made a living as a legal historian, writing about judges. I found  judicial autobiographies, especially those from the 19th Century, highly  revealing -- normally unintentionally. They are certainly not regarded as  literary masterpieces, quite rightly so. Judges, like university presidents,  tend to have a rather pompous, authoritarian style.  </P> <P> It is, however, important to study judicial biographies. We think we can learn  a great deal about poetry by learning about the poet; we similarly think we can  learn a great deal about the interpretation of novels by studying the life --  with its adequacies and inadequacies -- of the novelist. For some reason,  because we live with the wonderful myth that law is, somehow or other, a series  of self-contained rules, we do not study the lives of the judges or the lives  of lawyers who make it.  </P> <P> Justice Joseph R. Grodin has offered us an opportunity to remedy this lacuna.  He has written an engaging book. It is not a book for everyone; it may be too  technical for the layman and too colloquial for the lawyer. Yet it is a book  that deserves study.  </P> <P> Justice Grodin began life as a lawyer, dabbled in being a law professor, served  in the Jerry Brown Administration, found himself on the Court of Appeal in  1975, moved onto the Supreme Court of California, and was defeated with Chief  Justice Rose Bird in 1986. With this background, it is scarcely surprising that  the good Justice, who has now returned to teaching law, does a certain amount  of special pleading. At the same time, Grodin has a good deal of common sense.  He is obviously a person of integrity and decency, and while lawyers will  prickle at the simplistic approach he takes to explaining the common law and at  some of his forays into constitutional issues, they are issues that we all need  to address in one form or another.  </P> <P> Like Gaul, "In Pursuit of Justice" is divided into three parts. The first,  "Structure," deals with the mechanics of becoming a judge and how the appeals  process works in the state of California. It is both useful and reasonably  entertaining. It will, however, disappoint the aficionados of the gossip  column, since it does not "spill the beans" about how the Supreme Court of our  state operates, or did operate, in certain crucial cases.  </P> <P> Some issues are brushed over. It is easy to write platitudes about the "legal  explosion" that is going on in this country, but Grodin dismisses it rather  casually. One would expect a society that did not have a tradition of  autocratic government, or even a tradition -- especially in the West -- of a  clearly delineated hierarchy, to resort to those concepts we know as law as a  means of deciding disputes and of influencing decisions. Yet, as a society, we  have to make some important choices here, and it would have been attractive to  hear what Grodin thought.  </P> <P> At the same time, he explains the confirmation process of a judge in  extraordinarily human terms, and as he looks back to his predecessors, he  reminds us how recent the history of our state is. That, in itself, explains a  great deal.  </P> <P> Perhaps inadvertently, Grodin also raises some interesting issues of  jurisprudence. He challenges our intelligence by making us think about the "at  will" concept of employment. He raises the jurisprudential -- or constitutional  -- issue raised by the city of Azusa, which banned fortunetellers but not  stockbrokers in its ordinance against psychics. The court had to decide whether  fortunetelling was a fraud, while stock market prediction was a science. That  is a distinction worthy of an intellectual tussle.  </P> <P> In part two, "Function," we are taken on a quick tour of the common law. Again,  the study is going to satisfy no one. The treatment of products liability might  intrigue a high school civics class, but it might not. The foray into the  criminal law again underlines the distorting effect of the death penalty -- a  distortion that has gone on since the 17th Century. Perhaps the most  interesting part of what one might call the "action" part of the book concerns  the initiative process.  </P> <P> As an immigrant to California, I found it difficult not to be intrigued by the  initiative process. I realize that, in many ways, it is sacred to progressives  and conservatives alike. Coming out of the muckraking period, it is a process  much endorsed by those who stand at any particular time to benefit from it.  Grodin takes the position that Magleby does, namely that too often the  initiative process is not really giving "power to the people," but is much more  the "instrument of special interest groups."  </P> <P> As Grodin looks at Proposition 14 in 1966 (the proposition that appeared to  allow discrimination in housing and purported to forbid the Constitution ever  to allow an anti-discrimination provision), and as he describes Proposition 8  in 1982 (the so-called Victim's Bill of Rights), I can understand his concern  about the process. I suspect that, if we had an initiative process at the  Federal level, Brown vs. The Board of Education and the Miranda decisions might  well have led to changes in the Constitution: not, for me anyway, an attractive  prospect.  </P> <P> I have only had the privilege of voting once in California. I still have the  old-fashioned notion that my delegates to Sacramento and Washington ought to be  spending their time thinking through the logical way of balancing the public  interest in everything from taxation to insurance. I certainly do not give up  my right to criticize them, but I wonder if I should have the constant right to  overrule them and second-guess them. Recalls and initiatives sound so  wonderful, but just as judicial review can be misused and can undermine the  legislature, is it not possible that the California initiative system has gone  overboard? Are we really taking away the sense of responsibility from our  legislators? Grodin does not go quite as far as I would go, but he raises some  interesting and important issues and ones that we all ought to be discussing  rather than being influenced by the manipulators and the media, who would have  us believe that their paymasters know better than the legislature.  </P> <P> Indeed, throughout the book, Grodin raises some interesting questions about  constitutional law and the constitutional process. His notions of "independent  state grounds" in developing the California Constitution are attractive. Again,  I would have wished he had raised some more basic issues about basic laws. When  the Supreme Court has decided -- as it did in 1972 -- that the death penalty  constituted cruel and unusual punishment, did it really make sense to have that  overruled by the initiative process?  </P> <P> The final part of the book, "Perspective and Evaluation," is in its own way  quite disappointing. There is a fascinating passage where Grodin, the liberal  Democrat, finds himself surprisingly sympathetic to Judge Robert Bork in his  public hearings in Washington. The personal reactions to the common-law and the  election process, however, seem somewhat flawed.  </P> <P> The excursion is obviously necessary to get to the last chapter of the book,  which deals with the election of judges. Parts of that chapter make good  reading. There is a useful survey -- historically somewhat inaccurate -- about  the growth of the elective process. When I was practicing law in England -- and  from the time I spent as a law teacher there -- I frequently regretted that I  did not have the ability to vote against certain judges. On the other hand,  running for office and the role of the judiciary, one would have to admit, may  not be entirely complementary.  </P> <P> As Grodin describes his own unsuccessful attempt at reelection, it is  impossible not to feel sympathetic. He could defend his record. He could make  no promises. Elections tend to be decided on promises. A French skeptic in the  19th Century noted that lawsuits existed to decide who could afford the better  lawyer. Grodin takes the position -- although he does not articulate it -- that  the judicial elections exist to see who has the deeper pocket to influence the  electorate. It turned out that Chief Justice Rose Bird and Associate Justice  Cruz Reynoso did not.  </P> <P> At the same time, the so-called commission system, which is now used  increasingly in the other states, understandably has its detractors. Such  commissions tend to be dominated by establishment lawyers who put in  establishment judges. Much silliness is written about the establishment, but  here is a worry that a judiciary like ours, which has to make important policy  and even political decisions, should not be so insulated from public opinion  that it is totally insensitive to it. It has to operate in a Cardozo-like  atmosphere sensitive to public values.  </P> <P> Like the preview at the movies, my job is to titillate rather than satisfy.  Grodin's book is not a must; it is, however, a good read. I wish I felt clearer  about the audience he intends to address, but I do have a feeling that those  who care about the governance of this state should read it more than casually.  </P></p>

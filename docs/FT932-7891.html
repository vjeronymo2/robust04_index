			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scottish water future uncertain THE PRIME minister yesterday again refused to say whether Scottish Water will be privatised. Mr Major said during question time that the government was still considering the options set out in a consultation paper. 'When we have finished our consideration we will announce our results,' he told Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. Mr Foulkes urged him to end the 'uncertainty' and give a 'clear and unequivocal pledge that there will be no privatisation of water in Scotland'.</p>

The international environmental organization  Greenpeace has drawn attention to the trainload of harmful,  toxic substances and demanded that France remove the dangerous  consignment from Russia.    What is the nub of the issue here? "The train comprising 16  cars carrying waste products arrived in Orsk for reprocessing at  the Yuzhuralnikel combine, but the waste products turned out to  contain high levels of harmful substances such as cadmium (up to  15 percent), thallium (2-3 percent), and arsenic. The train was  sent further into the steppe -- to the Buruktal combine, in  Svetlinskiy Rayon. We do not have the techniques for detecting  these toxic substances," Chief State Inspector Viktor Blinov,  first deputy chairman of Orenburg Oblast's Environment  Committee, said.    It is impossible to send the train back, as we have no  address, he stressed, explaining: "As soon as the cargo crossed  the border at St. Petersburg the consignor relinquished all  responsibility. The customhouse at Astovo station let the train  in. It clearly should be called to account. And it is strange  that the certificate of quality for the raw materials was a week  late in coming, by which time the train was already in Buruktal."    Viktor Blinov is worried: With the onset of spring the  likelihood of the cadmium, thallium, and arsenic "escaping from  the sacks into the environment" increases. He considers that  "each sack must be placed in a separate metal container. This  constitutes a lot of labor-intensive work requiring not just  caution but also huge amounts of money."    Svetlinskiy Rayon administration chief Vasiliy Yeremenko has  "evicted" the train from his territory. It has been moved in  the direction of Orsk. The wagons are now halted in a railroad  siding.</p>

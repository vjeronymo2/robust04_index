			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Ukraine delays N-treaty vote Striking a blow to US nuclear disarmament efforts, Ukraine will not accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) this year, said the country's parliamentary chairman, Mr Alexander Moroz. He indicated a vote would not come until January, adding: 'We cannot be indifferent to the NPT's shortcomings.' Ukraine has been pressed by the West formally to declare itself a non-nuclear state under NPT, and President Leonid Kuchma was expected to ask parliament to vote on the treaty next month. But Mr Moroz's opposition makes that unlikely. Ukrainian leaders complain that the US has delivered less than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m) of Dollars 350m promised for dismantlement as part of a January agreement to deploy Ukraine's nuclear arsenal to Russia. They say the US keeps moving the target for smooth relations and economic aid, from the January agreement to the NPT.</p>

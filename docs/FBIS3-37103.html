The social and economic development for 1993 and the reforms  were discussed during it. Sergiu Certan, minister of national  economy, presented a report in which he stated that social and  economic situation is "quite serious," and that it is determined  by "very unfavourable internal and external factors." Although  a stabilizing trend is observed in economy from June 1993, the  people's living level keeps falling. Certan pointed out that  from the first month of 1994, the production in many fields  started to fall again under the existing political divergences.  President Snegur said that industrial production decreased in  January 1994 in comparison with the same period of 1993 by 20  percent. Snegur said that nevertheless "warehouses are full of  goods." The president blamed the audience of inconsequence in  promoting the reforms and demanded them to add to the adopted  decisions facts, terms and concrete responsible people because  the proposed project contains nothing but slogans.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Boycott ends as LDP agrees on bribery probe JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party and opposition parties last night agreed terms for a parliamentary hearing into a bribery scandal, involving Kyowa, a bankrupt steel frame maker and property developer. Opposition parties called off a two-week boycott of the Diet (parliament) staged in order to force the LDP to allow a full examination of the affair. The deadlock has delayed debate over the government budget for the new fiscal year which starts in April and other government business. It also provoked renewed criticism of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, for his alleged failure to defuse the row. The politician most deeply involved in the scandal is Mr Fumio Abe, a former cabinet minister, who has been charged with receiving a total of Y90m (Pounds 405,400) in bribes in return for supplying planning information. Mr Abe was originally charged with receiving bribes worth Y80m. The charge was later amended to Y90m. The Tokyo district public prosecutor's office this week closed its investigation of the affair and indicated that no action would be taken against other politicians who also took money from Kyowa. Mr Abe will probably not be summoned before the Diet since his case is sub judice. But the LDP agreed to demands from opposition MPs to call two other leading LDP members who are alleged to have accepted large political donations from Kyowa - Mr Jun Shiozaki, a former junior minister, and Mr Zenko Suzuki, a former prime minister. Both have denied any wrong-doing. Mr Suzuki, who was prime minister in 1980-82 and is now 81 years old, had resisted giving testimony before a Diet committee on the grounds of ill health. He offered to give testimony at home. But the LDP has now agreed that both Mr Suzuki and Mr Shiozaki should give evidence in televised hearings next Tuesday. Even though the Kyowa affair is seriously disrupting Diet business, it is a preliminary event before politicians begin to argue in earnest over a much larger scandal involving Sagawa Kyubin, a transport company, under investigation by the public prosecutor's office for giving loans and loan guarantees totalling Y530bn for questionable purposes. Among the recipients of the company's favours was Mr Susumu Ishii, the former head of Inagawakai, Japan's second largest gangster organisation. The Sagawa Kyubin group also gave hefty financial support to around 100 politicians, including several leading LDP members. Those who have acknowledged receiving funds include aides to Mr Kakuei Tanaka, the former prime minister, who was involved in the Lockheed bribery scandal in the 1970s. Yesterday an aide to Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, another former prime minister, acknowledged that a political research institute established by Mr Nakasone after he left office in 1987 may have received donations from Sagawa-related companies. But he said that if Sagawa made donations they were legal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Shoichiro Toyoda, Chairman  of Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp., welcomed reports  Tuesday [24 May] that Japan and the United States have agreed to  resume deadlocked negotiations for a new framework for bilateral  trade.    "The decision to resume (the negotiations) is welcome, and I  strongly hope constructive discussions will be made for the  further development of favorable bilateral relations," he said.    Toyoda, however, said the automobile issue is basically a  private affair and it is necessary for industries of both sides  to join forces to arrive at a settlement.    Toyoda, who will become head of the powerful Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren) on Friday, pledged that the  Japanese automobile industry will faithfully implement its  action program announced in March to steadily increase imports  of auto parts from U.S. suppliers.    Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., said the  Japanese industry will contribute toward settlement of the  automobile trade issue between the two countries.    A senior government official said Toyota President Tatsuro  Toyoda will call on U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale in  a few days to discuss the automobile issue.</p>

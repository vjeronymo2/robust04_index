			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo falls 3% as profits are taken in JR East THE Nikkei average fell nearly 3 per cent following heavy institutional selling of JR East and further negative news about the economy, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index tumbled 499.45, or 2.7 per cent, to 18,125.71, having seen the day's high of 18,661.67 in the morning, before losing ground steadily throughout the session to register a low of 18,048.50 in the last hour of trading. Volume increased to 322m shares from the 242m registered on Monday. Declines overwhelmed advances by 937 to 100, with 116 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dropped 39.05, or 2.5 per cent, to 1,531.28. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.24 to 1,236.80. Large-lot heavy selling of JR East by corporate shareholders depressed sentiment, the shares closing Y28,000 down at Y451,000. Earlier in the day, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, told a parliamentary committee that the government had not made any mistakes in the listing. The shares have lost nearly 25 per cent since trading began on October 26. Banks were dragged down by Topix-linked arbitrage selling, with Industrial Bank of Japan shedding Y120 to Y3,220, Mitsubishi Bank losing Y120 to Y2,950 and Fuji Bank declining Y120 to Y2,260. High-technology stocks were weak on profit-taking: Toshiba slipped Y8 to Y683, Sharp declined Y20 to Y1,520 and Hitachi retreated Y22 to Y803. Investors also took profits in large-capital issues, and Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, relinquished Y14 at Y317 and Mitsubishi Heavy surrendered Y10 to Y641. In Osaka, the OSE average declined for the sixth consecutive day, losing 463.57 to 20,301.24 in volume of 17.8m shares. Roundup WITH A few exceptions the region's markets reflected the heavy decline in Tokyo. SEOUL, however, took its own path and saw its highest level since October 1990, with investors particularly active in large-capitalisation stocks. The composite index climbed 4.73 to 780.20 in turnover of Won1,020bn. HG Asia in London commented that the market's recent rise was partly due to the fact that it had lagged behind recent gains elsewhere in the region. In addition, they said, good data showing an expansion in exports from the car, semi-conductor and steel sectors had boosted enthusiasm for equities. There were also rumours that the timetable for increasing the limit of foreign investment, from 10 to 15 per cent, might be brought forward, with domestic investors already taking positions in those stocks that are likely to be favoured by overseas institutions. Samsung Electronics went limit-up, rising Won1,600 to Won50,200, and Hyundai Motor hit its daily upper limit of Won1,300 to close at Won33,400. HONG KONG was weaker as investors turned cautious after Tokyo's plunge. The Hang Seng index was finally 89.48 off at 9,088.47 after swinging between a high of 9,273.17 and a low of 9,059.14. NEW ZEALAND regained 2 per cent after Monday's sharp fall, but the market remained nervous in the current uncertain political situation. The NZSE-40 index finished 43.79 better at 2,090.59. With the final election result not due to be known until the weekend - votes from nationals living overseas have yet to be counted - volatility is expected to remain. AUSTRALIA eased on afternoon selling, the All Ordinaries index dipping 3.4 to 2,050.8. Turnover amounted to ADollars 408.3m. BHP shed 4 cents to ADollars 17.20 and, among the banks, NAB fell 10 cents to ADollars 12.40. SINGAPORE closed lower after volatile trading, with the Straits Times Industrial index 15.50 down at 2,053.30. Singapore Telecom gained 8 cents at SDollars 3.90 ahead of its announcement, after the market closed, of an 18.8 per cent rise in half-year earnings. TAIWAN was lower for the fifth trading day in a row amid persistent profit-taking after the recent rally. The weighted index had rebounded slightly at the opening but soon fell to finish 23.38 off at 4,172.44. Turnover was a fairly active TDollars 27.78bn, against Monday's TDollars 28.88bn. Sentiment was cautious due to the approach of the November 27 local government elections, but selling was not heavy on the view that the government would not allow the market to post sharp falls before the polls. KUALA LUMPUR saw an early rebound interrupted by Tokyo's fall, but the composite index still closed 16.14, or 1.75 per cent, higher at 937.66, after a day's peak of 944.89. The index had fallen 55.54 points over the previous two trading days on forced selling caused by margin calls. COLOMBO continued to attract heavy speculative demand, which took the all-share index ahead 24.21 to 870.73 for a three-day rise of 8.9 per cent. Turnover was also sharply higher at SLRs208.8m from Monday's SLRs114.9m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Nov 15 (CTK) -- The Austrian and Slovak  environment ministers, Maria Rauch-Kallat and Jozef Zlocha,  signed a memorandum on understanding and cooperation in  environmental protection today.    At a press conference held later by both ministers, Zlocha  explained that the memorandum legalized and extended the  existing cooperation. Rauch-Kallat pointed to joint projects  already underway, such as air and water quality protection,  protection of the Morava river region which forms the border  between the two countries, and a study of the effective use of  energy sources.    As well as increasing the exchange of data, the memorandum  is  also intended to promote cooperation in establishing the legal  norms and economic tools to be used in the monitoring and  protection of the environment.    Rauch-Kallat said that Austria would provide 105 million  Austrian schillings in support of Slovakia's environment  protection efforts. The sum was destined for a waste water  treatment project for the river Morava and the monitoring of  emissions from the Duslo Sala chemical factory among other  things, she said.    On the question of the waste dump in Berg which could  pollute  Bratislava's drinking water, Rauch-Kallat reported that the  project had not yet been approved by parliament. If it did have  a negative influence on the local environment, she would oppose  it, she told journalists.    Rauch-Kallat said Austria was interested in supporting  Slovakia's withdrawal from nuclear power production. There is  one nuclear power plant in operation in Slovakia, at Jaslovske  Bohunice, and a second under construction at Mochovce, western  Slovakia. She said there was an agreement on the exchange of  information from the Slovak nuclear industry.</p>

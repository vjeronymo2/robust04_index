			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 27 Apr (MENA)--A Yemeni military source in  Sanaa today accused the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] of causing  the military situation in Yemen. In a statement this evening,  the source said that at 1330 today while the military committee,  accompanied by the U.S. and French military attaches, was  visiting the 1st Armored Brigade and the 3d Armored Brigade in  the 'Imran Camp in Sanaa Governorate, armed groups led by YSP  member Yahya Dahish 'Alyan, an "old officer expelled from the  Armed Forces," stormed the camp and began firing various small-,  medium-, and large-caliber weapons as well as tank, artillery,  and rocket fire. The source pointed out that the bombardment  targeted the headquarters of the 1st Armored Brigade, the  soldiers barracks, the central security camp nearby, and  residential areas in the city of 'Imran.    The source said that the intensive bombardment caused heavy  losses in lives and property. Dozens of people were martyred  and others were injured, but the casualty toll has not been  determined. The Yemeni military source expressed his regret for  this incident. He said that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  followed up on the situation from the very beginning and  immediately issued instructions to the defense minister and the  general chief of staff to quickly contain the situation and  prevent any military deterioration.</p>

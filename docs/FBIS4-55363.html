			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Sharkov] </F>   [Text] Sofia, May 11 (BTA) -- The government had not  prepared answers to the proposals by the Confederation of  Independent Trade Unions (KNSB) and came up with three versions  of a document on cost-of-living bonuses to public sector  employees, KNSB leader Krustyu Petkov told the press today after  the official talks on the union demands. The KNSB has warned  that it will call a general strike on May 17. It was decided  that the government proposals would be discussed by a working  group as of May 13. Prof. Petkov also said the government was  ready to put forward its ideas on the other proposals by the  KNSB, including the curbing of inflated prices and giving an  impetus to the structural adjustment of the economy and  privatization, which are now at a standstill. Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov headed the government delegation to the talks as  Prof. Petkov had insisted.    While suggesting certain measures, the KNSB has failed to  suggest ways and means to solve problems, Deputy Prime Minister  Evgeni Matinchev said after the talks. The trade union should  comply with budget austerity in 1994, as well as with the  agreements with the IMF on the cabinet's domestic economic  policy, Matinchev said. The document proposed by the cabinet is  incomplete and needs updating, trade union leader Petkov said.  Tomorrow the KNSB will present to Finance Minister Stoyan  Aleksandrov a draft document on the protection of deposits of  individuals from inflation. The trade union will press  parliament to amend the Confiscation Act and pass a bankruptcy  law and a law on the separation of social funds from the budget,  Petkov said.    On April 4 the KNSB announced it would call a general strike  and made social and union claims on the cabinet, which were  further developed. The trade union calls for state programmes  for economic stabilization. The KNSB insists on the  rehabilitation of the economy and clarifications on certain  questions of foreign policy. An appeal to the political forces  approved by the trade union yesterday calls for "a new reform,  new parliamentary elections and a new government." The KNSB  pledged its assistance and at least two years of social peace to  any party or coalition that would win the elections by  democratic means and would implement a national reform  programme. Should the political forces, parliament and the  government persist in trying to implement a reform forced on  this country, which poses a threat of lasting instability and a  return to totalitarianism, the KNSB will block this reform, the  document says.    The other most influential trade union, Podkrepa, officially  stated yesterday it would not support the KNSB strike. Podkrepa  affirmed that it is against the present cabinet and called for  parliamentary elections. Podkrepa leader Konstantin Trenchev  informed Krustyu Petkov that Podkrepa was considering  "unconventional forms of protest" against a new government if it  allowed the "plundering of the country" to continue behind its  back.    The Association of Democratic Trade Unions announced a day  of  union action today and staged protests in Sofia. In an appeal  to the state institutions the association called for amendments  to Labour Code provisions on cooperation between the cabinet,  employers and the trade unions, and on collective bargaining.</p>

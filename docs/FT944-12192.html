			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Bank calms market nerves about higher rates Sterling lost some of its lustre yesterday after the Bank of England released a fairly benign quarterly inflation report, writes Philip Gawith. Traders assumed that the Bank's report makes less likely a decision to raise interest rates at today's monthly monetary meeting between the UK chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England. The report prompted a sharp rally in short sterling futures as traders scrambled to cover short positions they had taken ahead of the report's release. The pound closed in London at DM2.4510, from DM2.4583, and at Dollars 1.6347, from Dollars 1.6306. After the report was released, it fell to DM2.44 and below Dollars 1.63, before recovering. The dollar traded sideways, finishing at DM1.4994 from DM1.5077, and Y96.755 from Y96.95, in spite of a US purchasing managers' report showing stronger than expected price pressures. In New York the US currency ended at DM1.4947 and Y96.65. Trade elsewhere was fairly thin, with most of Europe closed for All Saints Day. The D-Mark was stronger against the lira, rising to L1,027 from L1,023. It was also firmer against the krona, trading yesterday evening at SKr4.804 from SKr4.780. The three-month sterling LIBOR rate firmed to 6 3/16 per cent, from 6 1/16 per cent, as traders became nervy about the prospect of higher rates. It later eased to 6 1/8 per cent when the Bank's report, saying that the inflation outlook had improved, was released. In the short sterling market, prices jumped in after-hours' trading, with the March contract rising around 15 basis points to 92.75. Analysts said the market was experiencing a massive short-covering rally. The core conclusion in the report was that the inflation outlook had improved. The Bank now expects underlying inflation to be around 2.5 per cent in two years time, down from the forecast in its last report of about 3 per cent. Although the market's response was very bullish, some analysts said that an early interest rate rise had not been ruled out. Earlier there had been little to be gleaned from the Bank's daily money market oper-ations. It provided Pounds 15m late assistance, after earlier supplying Pounds 677m liquidity at established rates. The daily shortage was Pounds 900m. Overnight money traded between 5 1/4 and 6 1/2 per cent. One seasoned money market observer said the old days of reading the monetary 'tea leaves', for hints of the direction of policy, were past. While it was fair to assume that a sustained period of easy money rates had the acquiescence of the Bank, it would not be correct to assume that tighter monetary conditions necessarily conveyed any signal about the Bank's intentions. As likely as not, he added, this reflected technical factors, such as who was holding treasury bills, and whether or not they wanted to sell them to the Bank. 'Now the focus is on the monthly monetary meeting. We have the Ken and Eddie show,' he said. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, said the market would anyway be very suspicious of any message the Bank was alleged to be sending through its daily market operations. Many in the market were caught offside when the Bank last lifted rates on September 12. They mistakenly inferred then that the Bank planned no policy change when it set a two-week repurchase agreement, at established rates, a few days before it raised rates. One point made in favour of maintaining the status quo is that the trade-weighted sterling index has appreciated by 3 per cent, from 78.6 before the last rate rise to yesterday's close of 80.9. This, according to a rule of thumb sometimes cited in the market, is equivalent to an increase in interest rates of about 75 basis points. Some analysts felt that the Governor of the Bank, Mr Eddie George, had boxed himself into a corner with his recent rhetoric. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC, said that if rates were raised against the backdrop of recent 'emollient' comments about inflation, 'this would render totally ineffective the speeches he gives on a weekly basis; what the market needs is a period of stability, not a period of central bank induced instability'. The dollar weakened in line with bonds after the NAPM report was released, with the inflation component rising to 79.9 from 77.1. It later regained some ground after comments from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, eased concerns about trade tensions with Japan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov, </F> Vyacheslav Tomilin, and Georgiy Shmelev]    [Excerpt] Beijing, 26 Jan -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev arrived in China on Wednesday [26 January],  starting an official visit that will focus on Russian-Chinese  border trade. Kozyrev, whose visit will last until 29 January,  is to meet with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Beijing on  Thursday.    Moscow regards mutual relations with the PRC as a  traditionally high-priority and independent direction of its  foreign policy and as an important component part of its general  strategy of ensuring national-state interests through  partnership with the surrounding world. To a great extent we  link cooperation with China with the prospects of fulfilling the  unique Euro-Asiatic potential of Russia, the economic upsurge of  the rayons of Siberia and the Far East and integration into the  economic life of the Asia-Pacific region.    The Russian side values highly the results achieved in  recent  years of cooperation with China that has been carried out on  many levels and is satisfied with the stable and positive  development along all paths of bilateral links. The bringing of  Russian-Chinese relations on to a higher level -- that of  constructive partners -- accords completely with the national  interests of our countries and peoples, the head of the Russian  Federation's foreign policy department told ITAR-TASS  correspondents at Beijing airport.    The coming talks and meetings in Beijing are expected to be  a  new step forward on the path of strengthening  good-neighborliness and deepening mutual understanding and trust  between Russia and the PRC, while the documents signed during  the visit will expand the treaty and legal base of bilateral  relations.

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Electricity price review starts A REVIEW of electricity price controls was launched yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator. It is the first review into the cost of supplying electricity since the regional distribution companies of England and Wales were privatised nearly two years ago. It comes at a time when consumers have been complaining about rising electricity prices and what are seen as excessive profits made by the regional companies. The review will be 'searching and thorough', Prof Littlechild said. 'My main aims are to secure a good deal for customers and promote more effective competition, whilst ensuring that companies can finance their licensed activities and have an incentive to purchase electricity efficiently.' The review will lead to a new price regime to be introduced in April 1994. The regional companies will be able to challenge the new regime with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Supply costs account for about 5 per cent of electricity bills. There will be a later review of prices charged for distributing electricity, for implementation in April 1995. Those prices account for about 24 per cent electricity bills. Questions listed in a consultation paper include: should controls cover sales to all customers or only those who do not have the benefit of competition among their suppliers? Prof Littlechild is seeking comments by December. Electricity prices are governed at present by a formula that is intended to keep increases below the rate of inflation. The regional companies have come under fire over profit levels and one, Seeboard, has voluntarily given a rebate to customers. The Major Energy Users Council, which represents industrial electricity users, has also mounted a campaign for tighter price controls.</p>

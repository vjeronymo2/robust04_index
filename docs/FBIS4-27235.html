			<p>BFN     [Text] Ho Chi Minh City authorities recently held a  conference to review anticorruption work during the period  November 1992 to April 1994.    Reports presented at the conference revealed that during the  period, 604 corrupt cadres received disciplinary punishment  including 72 cadres removed from their positions. A number of  directorate-level cadres, who had been prosecuted before but  still remained in the party, have been expelled from the party.    Law enforcement agencies are presently handling 321  corruption cases. Eleven corrupt persons received life  imprisonment terms. There are, however, still some serious cases  that have not been finalized as expected. During its 13th  session held October 1993, the city People's Council urged  authorities to finalize quickly 58 backlog cases. Nine of them  remain unsolved. Among six major cases that had been reported  to the government, only four were completed. Many other  important cases such as the Go Vap State Pharmacy, which  involved the former director of the finance office, or the case  of the (?Sakefin) Food Staples Company, still have not been  brought to court though the prosecution process started over two  years ago.    The rate of property recovered from corruption activities  stays very low. In comparison with 151.7 billion dong,  $857,737, and 824 taels of gold recorded as losses, the amounts  recovered were 13.3 billion dong, $205,686, and 167 taels of  gold.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / GEORGE L. PERRY: EXPERIMENTAL INDEX WILL TEST  TRADITIONAL THEORIES  </P> <P> The index of leading indicators is familiar to many business-cycle observers.  Developed in 1937 at the National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley  Mitchell and Arthur F. Burns, and amended by Geoffrey Moore and others, the  index averages the movement of several economic variables chosen for their  ability to anticipate booms and recessions.  </P> <P> The index for August, the last available month, declined sharply, consistent  with the emerging view among most forecasters that the economy is slowing.  </P> <P> Amid this growing concern about recession, a new forecasting index -- the  experimental index of leading indicators -- has produced a startlingly strong  forecast of nearly 4% growth in the economy the next several months. A  companion index places the probability that the economy will be in a recession  next February at a minuscule 3%. Why such a big discrepancy between these  predictions and the conventional ones? And should we stop worrying about  recession and plan for a boom?  </P> <P> The XLI has serious credentials. It is the result of sophisticated statistical  research by James Stock and Mark Watson, two highly regarded econometricians  working under the auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their  index is constructed in much the same spirit as the official leading indicators  were but presumably benefits from using the extensive database and  number-crunching capacity that is available to econometricians today.  </P> <P> The official index of leading indicators contains 11 variables, chosen because  they have shown predictive power historically. They are: hours worked in  manufacturing, initial claims for unemployment insurance, manufacturers' new  orders for consumer goods and materials, vendor performance, contracts and  orders for plant and equipment, building permits, change in unfilled orders,  change in sensitive-materials prices, stock prices, the money supply and an  index of consumer expectations.  </P> <P> The XLI is a weighted average of seven variables. Although the list includes  building permits and unfilled orders -- in common with the official index --  and an index of workers employed part time, it contains several financial  market variables that have not been part of the leading indicators. These are  the trade-weighted U.S. exchange rate, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the  spread between interest rates on six-month commercial paper and six-month  Treasury bills, and the spread between interest rates on 10- and one-year  Treasury bonds and bills.  </P> <P> The last two variables are contributing the most to predictions of economic  growth.  </P> <P> It is easy to see why these variables might help predict recessions. The spread  between private and Treasury borrowing costs should reflect the risk of default  on private debt. If lenders foresee a recession, they will see a greater risk  of default and require a higher interest rate to compensate.  </P> <P> Thus, if private investors are able to forecast recessions, a wider spread  between private and Treasury interest rates should signal a higher probability  of recession and a smaller spread the opposite.  </P> <P> The yield spread between long- and short-term Treasury bonds and bills is  interpreted as a forecast of the course of interest rates. Rates fall in  recessions. So if investors expect a recession in the near future, they will  push down long-term rates relative to today's short-term rates.  </P> <P> Also, to the extent that recessions are brought about by the Federal Reserve  raising short-term interest rates to slow down the economy, recessions will be  preceded by a period of exceptionally high short-term rates and a narrow or  even inverted spread between long- and short-term rates.  </P> <P> Why might these stories be wrong this time? The long-short spread is most  persuasive when monetary policy is raising short-term interest rates to slow  inflation and, incidentally, causing a recession. That behavior was an  important factor in many of the past recessions. But a recession emerging from  sources other than a tightening monetary policy would not be preceded by a  strong signal from the long-short spread. The present situation may fit that  description.  </P> <P> In addition, long-term interest rates may be exceptionally high today for  special reasons. The flood of long-term borrowing for the thrift industry  bailout and the apparent withdrawal of some Japanese investors from our bond  market are two that come to mind.  </P> <P> Lack of a recession signal from the private Treasury spread is a bigger puzzle.  Indeed, it may just be that the official series used in the XLI is simply not  reflecting what is going on in credit markets. Recently, credit ratings of  well-known firms have been downgraded. In addition, the yield spread between  junk bonds and Treasuries has soared. On this interpretation, an alternative  indicator of the risk premium on private debt might be telling a very different  story.  </P> <P> The XLI is an interesting addition to the business-cycle literature. Perhaps  its next reading, due at the end of this month, will tell a gloomier story than  the last. If not, the index will either become a sensation for correctly seeing  strength in the economy where others saw weakness, or Stock and Watson may want  to go back to their data bank to make some alterations. That is the nature of  research, and it is why experimental is the first name of the new index.  </P></p>

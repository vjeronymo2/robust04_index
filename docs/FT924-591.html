			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Hungary steps up sell-offs THE HUNGARIAN government intends to follow up on the success of its latest two stock market privatisations with up to 20 more launches next year, a minister announced yesterday. The privatisation authorities plan in 1993 to float 10 to 20 state companies, including Matav, the national telecommunications utility, said Mr Tamas Szabo, privatisation minister. The authorities' affection for popular privatisation comes as a political reaction is gaining force against the predominance of foreign investors, which have provided 70 per cent of Hungary's Ft67bn privatisation proceeds in the year so far. Nevertheless, Mr Szabo admitted yesterday that few Hungarian companies were suitable candidates for the Budapest stock market. The other prong of the conservative government's privatisation strategy is therefore to allow the Hungarian public to purchase on easy terms run-of-the-mill companies which cannot be floated. Mr Szabo said the government had decided to stimulate domestic investor interest in privatisation by opening to the public a low-rate and long-maturity 'existence' credit facility. The new wave of privatisation flotations has gained impetus from the share offering this month of Danubius, a hotel chain, and Pick, Hungary's leading salami producer, and their unexpected success. The popularity of the Danubius issue in particular showed to the Hungarian authorities that tax preferences, easy payment terms and bonus shares could draw the public to invest in privatisation. The first round of Czechoslovakia's ambitious privatisation scheme was a success with nearly 93 per cent of available shares sold, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Prague. Some 21.55m shares (7.2 per cent) remained unsold from the 299.39m offered early in the year when the scheme started with 8.54m people, more than half of Czechoslovakia's population of 15m.</p>

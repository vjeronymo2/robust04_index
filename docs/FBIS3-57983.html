			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wolfgang Schweitzer] </F>   [Text] Vienna, Jan 5 (AFP) -- Croatian and Bosnian  Presidents Franjo Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic are to hold a  summit in Bonn on Saturday [8 January], it was announced here  Wednesday as officials met to secure a cease-fire in central  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The talks came amid growing pressure on Tudjman as U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright warned  Croatia that it might face possible international sanctions if  it did not stop meddling in the Bosnian conflict.    Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic denied assertions by  EC  mediator Lord Owen due to be broadcast on British television  later Wednesday that regular Croatian troops were stationed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but he acknowledged the presence of  "volunteers" there.    The talks here were expected to focus on a cease-fire  between  Croat and the mainly Moslem government forces in central Bosnia,  internal borders, and access to the sea for the Bosnian  Government side.    Granic said after Wednesday's meeting with Bosnian Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic and international mediators Owen and  Thorvald Stoltenberg that a "small but real step forward" had  been made.    A definitive ceasefire between Bosnian Army forces and  Croatian HVO [Croatian Defense Council] militia would be  discussed in Bonn, Granic said, adding: "It is important for us  that the Moslem side stop its offensive in central Bosnia."    Silajdzic said he was "encouraged" by a Croatian pledge  supporting Bosnian proposals to allow residents of Mostar, the  capital of Herzegovina where Croats are besieging the Moslem  eastern half of the city, to return home.    In a joint statement the delegations said that prior to the  Bonn summit the two sides would make "a major effort to prepare  a plan for a cease-fire on all front lines, to halt all military  operations, and to create conditions for a lasting halt to  hostilities, the protection of populations and strengthening of  confidence measures."    They said that areas of dispute over territorial boundaries  "must be resolved solely by peaceful political means."    Owen and Stoltenberg are to attend the Bonn meeting after a  visit to Belgrade for talks with Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic.    Owen warned against putting too much stress on the  cease-fire, saying that "real problems" should be discussed  including Mostar and the Adriatic port of Neun, which the  Moslems want to give them access to the sea.    Albright, arriving in Zagreb at the start of a European  tour,  said the issue of Croatian troops in Bosnia "comes up frequently  and...is a great concern and might in fact lead to sanctions if  there is not some change in that behaviour."    She said Washington had specifically warned Zagreb on the  subject.    "The conflict in this region has no justification.  Aggression cannot be justified. War crimes cannot be  justified. Blockage of humanitarian aid shipments cannot be  justified. It is time to stop the excuses and start making work  on many of the unfulfilled promises," she said.    Owen, in an interview with Channel Four television,  commented: "We all know there is...a very substantial element of  the Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina," and said the  international community should address the issue "more strongly."    Granic however denied Owen's assertions in an interview with  BBC radio. He said that though there were Croatian volunteers  engaged in the conflict, Zagreb had no intention of intervening  militarily.    In Zagreb, the Croatian Catholic Church announced that  primate Cardinal Franjo Kuharic left Wednesday for Sarajevo at  the head of a group of several bishops who are to attend the  ordination of the new auxiliary bishop for Sarajevo, Petar Sudar.    The UN Protection Force had guaranteed transportation for  the  bishops from Sarajevo airport to the archbishop's office in the  Bosnian capital.    A significant number of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are  aligned with the mainly Moslem Government side.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): 'Tis the season for Christmas cards - Why charities often get a bad deal Summer is over, and it is time to choose the corporate Christmas card. But companies should be warned: many of the old faithful designs have fallen from grace. Christ may have been born on Christmas day, yet in these multi-cultural times less than 1 per cent of companies send cards depicting Christian themes. Cartoons and any attempt at wit are also widely avoided. Instead, the height of fashion in cards is an international theme, according to card printer Almanac Gallery. A spherical fruit cake with a map of the world on it, or a dove of peace are both trendy choices. Cards with animals and a conservation message are also catching on, while trusty corporate favourites such as London scenes and snowy landscapes are as popular as ever. Almanac's market research shows that companies send out on average 400 cards a year, and that chairmen, who order their Christmas cards separately, send on average 150 each. Larger companies and those in the service sector send out far more: one company in the leisure market sent 50,000 cards last year and a merchant bank sent 30,000. However, the number of companies opting for charity christmas cards is fairly low - just 8 per cent of the market. Part of the problem for charities is that the print quality is sometimes poor. Another more fundamental difficulty, especially for smaller ones, is the expense of marketing the cards, which often leaves little profit after sales. Not all companies are potential buyers of charity cards: architects and designers nearly always use the card to advertise their own talents while banks like to commission their own. Accountants and solicitors tend not to send out cards at all. Even with such groups excluded, the market has great promise. 'At least 70 per cent of the potential charity Christmas card market remains undeveloped,' estimates Darryl Williams of Almanac. In order to increase sales a charity must keep updating its mailing list, even though it stands little possibility of building a solid customer base. This is because companies normally decide to buy a charity card on the strength of the card itself, not of the charity. This means that even if a charity sells to a company one year, the chance of a repeat sale next year is about one in 10. Almanac believes it has come up with the perfect marketing solution that will allow charities to sell their cards more cheaply. It has launched 'The Christmas Collection', a catalogue devoted to cards from many different charities. It features the requisite global christmas puddings and snowscapes and represents a range of charities from household names like Oxfam to more obscure charities like The Movement for Non-Mobile Children - Whizz-Kidz. All the cards are different, removing competition between charities based on the picture design. The idea is that one charity may lose this year's clients next year, but it may pick up those clients lost by other charities. To advertise in the catalogue, the charities pay only the printing and distribution costs. The catalogue is effectively a clearing house for cards and the charities receive all profits from sales. So how does Almanac benefit? It hopes to persuade charities to choose Almanac to print their cards. 'We are trying to create a climate where it is not on if companies do not to send charity cards,' he says.</p>

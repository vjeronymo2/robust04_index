			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / US-EC conflict looms on coal US coal producers may ask Washington to retaliate against the EC for allegedly restricting US coal imports and disrupting world trade with hefty subsidies to Community coal mines. The National Coal Association (NCA) of the US is considering action because British Coal has complained to the European Commission about alleged 'dumping' of cheap US coal in the European market. That complaint has been stalled in Brussels since February because of the political sensitivity of the case. But the NCA has now raised the temperature with a letter to Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative. In the letter the association denies the dumping charge and says it is examining possible 'defensive action' under Section 301 of the 1988 trade act, which provides for retaliation against third countries. The NCA adds that it is considering 'the option of an antitrust claim' against British Coal and other EC complainants, although the basis for such a claim is unclear. If the NCA asks Mrs Hills to look at EC subsidies under Section 301, she will have to launch an investigation, although it is up to President George Bush to decide whether retaliation would be politically advisable. A formal investigation would certainly increase trade tension with the EC and add to a growing list of bilateral disputes between the trading partners over such issues as oilseed subsidies, steel dumping, and public procurement legislation. It could also damage the chances of agreement in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. The European Commission is acutely aware of its vulnerability to counter-claims on coal subsidies. Most European producers charge well above the world market price for coal, with German and Spanish mines among the most heavily subsidised. The framework policy for such aid expires at the end of next year and the Commission's energy directorate has prepared controversial proposals for a replacement system which would try to bring the highest coal production costs in the Community down to the 1992 average of around Ecu110 (Pounds 77.77) per tonne by 1997. France and Britain are already producing coal at below the average cost, but Germany - which produces at Ecu137 per tonne - and Spain would both have to cut costs. If they failed they would be disqualified from further operating aid until they had closed inefficient mines. The Commission - which also wants to introduce greater transparency into aid schemes - is likely to approve the new scheme and submit it to EC ministers in the autumn, but it will then require the unanimous approval of member states.</p>

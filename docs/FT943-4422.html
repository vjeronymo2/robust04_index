			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Danish unemployment edges up Danish unemployment rose to an average 12.5 per cent in July, compared with 12.3 per cent in June, the Danish national statistics office said yesterday. The seasonally adjusted number of people out of work rose from 344,600 people in June to 349,400 people in July. This also shows a rise from July 1993, when an average 12.4 per cent or 347,100 people were out of work. The rise follows three months' decline in the jobless rate, after which the government said the tide had begun to turn on unemployment. It said the rise was due to many people in new jobs taking summer holidays on unemployment benefit, as they were not entitled to holiday pay. The opposition Liberals claimed the government's economic policies had failed. The jobless rate not corrected for seasonal adjustments was 11.8 per cent in July, up from 11.7 per cent in June. The trade surplus in the Netherlands in May rose 16 per cent to Fl 2.2bn (Pounds 815m) from Fl 2bn a year ago, the Dutch government reported. France's broad M3 money supply aggregate gained 1.2 per cent in July after a 0.3 per cent gain in June, the Bank of France said yesterday. The M3 aggregate was down 3 per cent on an annual basis in July.</p>

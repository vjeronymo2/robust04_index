			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Alcazar It was always going to be tough getting Alcazar off the ground, given the complexities of negotiating between four airlines, six governments and a host of trade unions. But after compromising over so much, it seems odd the merger should come juddering to a halt over the seemingly innocuous issue of which US airline partner to choose. That suggests the principle of the merger itself may have become an issue, rather than just the practicalities. In any event, the carriers have little option but to seek new alliances. The experience of the low-cost Southwest Airlines in the US has shown that size is not the only criterion for aviation success. But the four European carriers have all inherited high cost bases and geographic limitations. Only the economies of scale deriving from mergers are likely to solve their competitive problems. SAS appears in most urgent need of an alternative. A restructured deal with KLM must remain possible. The big three European airlines, however, will be quietly chuckling at their smaller rivals' difficulties. British Airways will press ahead in Europe through TAT and Deutsche BA. Air France can keep trying to defy economic gravity for a little longer. But the biggest beneficiary of Alcazar's failure could be Lufthansa. Austrian Airlines now seems likely to succumb to its advances. And, despite its links with Delta and Singapore Airlines, Swissair, too, may find it hard to resist being drawn into its orbit.</p>

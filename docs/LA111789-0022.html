			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 HELD, LINKED TO BOMB MADE FROM STOLEN DYNAMITE  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies arrested two men Wednesday in connection with the  construction and planting of a dynamite time bomb found outside an abandoned  store in El Cajon earlier this month.  </P> <P> James Jacobson, 30, a mechanic of San Diego, and George Vanderwall, 26, of  Santee, were arrested after officials searched their residences, said Sgt.  Connie Grayson of the Sheriff's Bomb and Arson Squad. They were linked to the  bomb through fingerprints lifted from the device by the Sheriff's Department,  he said.  </P> <P> Both men are suspected of possessing and manufacturing a destructive device and  receiving stolen property, Grayson said. Vanderwall also faces charges of  possession of marijuana.  </P> <P> Grayson said the dynamite found Nov. 2 in El Cajon was part of the 800 pounds  of explosives stolen from the Gordon Carter Construction Co. in Ramona in  March, 1988. Officials have recovered several hundred pounds of the explosives  in 17 different incidents since the dynamite was reported missing, he said.  However, Grayson said a couple of cases of the high-powered dynamite have not  been found.  </P> <P> "It's the hottest thing in the county right now," he said, adding that a single  stick of the dynamite, which sells for as much as $200, could easily destroy a  car and kill all occupants. Investigators would not say whether the pair are  suspects in the original theft.  </P> <P> Searches of both Jacobson and Vanderwall's residences did not uncover any more  dynamite, Grayson said. However, Gerald E. Clifton, 43, of the same address as  Vanderwall, was arrested on suspicion of possessing methamphetamine and  marijuana, and possessing methamphetamine and marijuana for sale, he said.  </P></p>

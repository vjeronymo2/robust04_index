			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> AUDIT TO BE DONE AFTER ELECTION;  </P> <P> OXNARD: VOTERS WILL BE ASKED TO APPROVE A TAX INCREASE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT  CAUSED THE TOWN'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> Despite repeated assurances from city officials, an audit designed to uncover  the cause of Oxnard's financial crisis will not be completed before voters go  to the polls Tuesday to decide a 5% utility tax measure.  </P> <P> The audit, scheduled to be completed Thursday, will not be done until at least  June 19, officials announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> Opponents of the utility tax increase immediately criticized the delay, saying  it is unfair to ask voters to approve a tax increase without first proving that  the increase is justified.  </P> <P> "I don't think that it's reasonable to ask voters to approve the tax without  knowing the reasons" for the fiscal crisis, said Marc L. Charney, a lawyer and  member of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce. Some opponents said they think the  city purposely delayed publication of the audit to avoid an embarrassing report  just before the election, a charge city officials deny.  </P> <P> The 5% utility users' tax increase was designed to raise $5 million annually,  wiping out a $2.8-million deficit in the current budget. The tax would be added  to telephone, cable television, electricity, gas and garbage collection fees,  and would cost the average household an extra $4 a month.  </P> <P> City officials have warned that if Measure C is rejected the city will have to  make cuts in city services and personnel, possibly including laying off police  and firefighters.  </P> <P> At the recommendation of a citizens advisory committee, the city decided in  February to pay Cresap Management Consultants of Washington, D.C., $250,000 to  audit the city books. The results were scheduled to be released May 31.  </P> <P> However, Bill G. Evans, president of Cresap, said in an interview Wednesday  that city officials had recently raised new questions that required further  study. He refused to say what those questions were.  </P> <P> "We do not believe it would be in the best interest of the city to deliver an  incomplete report," he said.  </P> <P> He said he asked city officials to extend the deadline until June 19.  </P> <P> When completed, Evans said the audit will outline the reasons for the city's  financial problems and recommend solutions. Despite the fact that the audit is  not yet complete, Evans said, he believes that the city will need additional  taxes to fund city services at current levels.  </P> <P> In a letter to the City Council received Wednesday, Evans said that while the  results of the audit "will recommend actions to reduce costs without reducing  services, these actions, if adopted, clearly will not be sufficient to be a  substitute for additional taxes."  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager John Tooker said it is up to the council to decide  whether to penalize Cresap for failing to meet the deadline.  </P> <P> Terry Dempsey, campaign manager for Citizens for Public Safety, a group  supporting the tax proposal, said he does not think delaying the audit report  will hurt the measure's chances of passage next week.  </P> <P> "The city needs the revenues regardless of how it got in this shape," he said.  </P> <P> Council candidates Paul K. Dolan and Scott Bollinger disagreed. They said it is  vital that voters know what caused the financial crisis before they decide on  the tax increase.  </P> <P> "They should know why they are giving good money to the very people that got  them in this situation in the first place," Bollinger said.  </P> <P> Dolan said he believes "deals were cut" at City Hall to delay the issuance of  the report, a charge city officials deny.  </P> <P> Dolan and Bollinger said they believe the fiscal problems are due to corruption  and mismanagement in City Hall and mailed a letter Wednesday to the U.S.  attorney general's office asking for a complete investigation.  </P> <P> A special City Council meeting had been scheduled for Thursday afternoon to  receive and discuss the results of the audit. City officials said the meeting  will be held as planned.  </P></p>

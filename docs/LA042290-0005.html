			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN'S FALL  </P> <P> Reagan will go down in history as the least intelligent, laziest, uninformed  ideologue ever, in spite of his folksy smile and corny jokes to hide what was  really happening. Nancy will follow as the most selfish, vindictive First Lady,  who blamed everyone else for her husband's ineptitude. They will need more than  a P.R. man to polish their tarnished image.  </P> <P> BILLIE HANSEN  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

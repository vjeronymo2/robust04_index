			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock scoffs at Majorism - Prime Minister's questions BRITAIN would face 'perma-nent high unemployment' if the general election resulted in a fourth successive Conservative victory, Mr Neil Kinnock said in the Commons yesterday. With Labour's hopes of pulling ahead in the opinion polls now resting on the depth of the recession, the Labour leader seized on the latest figures showing a rise in the number of long-term unemployed to charge that the government had to bear the blame. During another angry exchange at prime minister's questions, he insisted: 'Majorism is not working.' Labour will return to the theme later today, when Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, opens a full-scale Commons debate on the effect of the recession on manufacturing industry. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said: 'The only way of getting these figures down permanently is to have the right structure of development within the economy - low inflation and stable exchange rates.' Government policies were designed to achieve these objectives, while Labour policies would lead to 'permanent slump - no jobs, no prospects, no hope for the future'. Mr Kinnock sought to associate the prime minister directly with the view of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that rising unemployment and the recession had been the price 'well worth paying' to get inflation down. Mr Major retorted: 'I have said no such thing and neither, in context, has the chancellor.' This denial brought furious protests from Labour with Mr Robin Corbett, MP for Birmingham Erdington, recalling the occasion in May when Mr Lamont first referred to the price 'well worth paying'. Downing Street later emphasised that in correcting what it called a misquotation the prime minister had not sought to distance himself from the chancellor. In the Commons exchanges Mr Major argued that if Mr Kinnock was really concerned about unemployment he would not be advocating policies which would 'cripple' industry. These included bringing back flying pickets and restoring the legal immunities of unions 'with all the difficulties we saw in the 1960s and 1970s'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the government's commitment to recovery could best be judged by the fact that last week's announcement of a 53,000 increase in unemployment had been followed by a Pounds 171m cut in the training budget. Mr Major stressed that the provision for training was the highest Britain had ever known. He cited the Bundesbank's statement that Germany was now in recession as further evidence that Britain's current difficulties had not been caused by government policies.</p>

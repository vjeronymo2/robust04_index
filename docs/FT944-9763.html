			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Bears look for aggressive move by the Fed - Capital &amp; Credit All eyes are on the Federal Reserve now as bond traders wait to see how aggressive the central bank is willing to be in tackling inflationary pressures in the economy. News last week that the producer price index fell by 0.5 per cent in October  -analysts had expected a 0.1 per cent increase - did little to change the opinions of those economists who believe the Federal Reserve will boost the federal funds rate target by at least 50 basis points, to 5 1/4 per cent, at its open market committee meeting tomorrow. Analysts say this anti-inflationary stance should cheer the bond market, but most believe investors have already accounted for such a rise. If the Fed decides not to act, however, the market could take a serious tumble. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers says: 'Inaction would be a significant negative for the market as it would fly in the face of recent data that the economy is above trend, instead of decelerating, as the Fed said it had expected.' The Salomon economist is one of a number on Wall Street who believes inflation is a bigger threat than the decrease in producer prices would indicate, because declining car and energy prices within the producer price index masked a 0.3 per cent increase in intermediate (partially-processed) goods. He believes the Fed might well increase the interest rate target to 5 1/2 per cent in order to 'convey immediately somewhat more aggressive action and suggest that more action would come soon'. Mr Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Lehman Brothers, believes a full point increase would be the best way to put the brake on inflation, but does not see this as likely in the absence of clear signs of dangerously resurgent inflation. The key to managing inflation is timing, says Mr Sinai. 'The game is to prevent inflation from picking up, but by the time it is accelerating and the producer and consumer price indices are picking up, I believe it is too late to prevent the inflationary process from getting out of hand.' He believes the Fed is attempting to act early and moderately to prevent inflation. 'I regret that members of the central bank have done so little to explain to the public what they are doing and why.' However, not all economists are so worried by inflation. Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities, believes the bond market is reacting bearishly to a phantasm of inflation. By his calculations, increases in commodity prices have been nearly wiped out by decreases in durable goods labour costs, which he puts at down 5.2 per cent from the same period last year. 'People have a tendency to emphasise things they see a lot,' he says. 'You see commodity prices every day, labour only comes out four times a year.' This is the only explanation Mr Brusca sees for the bearish mood exhibited by the market last week. Markets were buoyed only for the briefest of moments on Thursday morning by the positive producer price figures before falling by  13/32 to 92 23/32 late in that session, which was the last of the week because the market was closed on Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. 'On the one hand I have to say this is crazy,' Mr Brusca says of Thursday's extremely volatile session. 'On the other, you have to say people are sceptical that inflation can stay low.' Mr Brusca worries that overly tight monetary policy will depress the economy next year. While others ask whether a 50 basis point increase in rates may not be enough, Brusca turns the query around: 'The question is: is 50 points too much?' he says. Certainly, traders will now be looking to Wednesday's release of consumer price information for more clues about inflationary pressures. Uncertainty about the impact of strong Republican gains in last Tuesday's mid-term elections will also play out in the markets. Initially, news that the party would control both houses of Congress sparked a rally but later, comments by Republican leaders that they planned to decrease taxes and increase defence spending caused consternation and helped push markets down. Some analysts fear that grid-lock between the Republican Congress and Democratic president could hurt the value of the dollar and hit bonds by deterring foreigners from investing in US instruments, but few are willing to predict the long-term effect of divided government. In addition to promising more tax cuts and defence spending, the Republicans have pledged to work toward a balanced budget. Salomon's Mr Lipsky believes the debate over whether to approve the Uruguay Round agreement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will provide an important indication of future relations between the Congress and the executive. But he adds, 'in the near-term the defining events are going to be economic fundamentals and monetary policy'.</p>

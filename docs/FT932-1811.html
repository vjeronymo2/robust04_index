			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Kingfisher expands Charlie Browns KINGFISHER, the retailing group, is expanding its Charlie Browns motor parts and fast-fit superstore chain by buying 18 similar outlets from the Unipart Group. The purchase, for about Pounds 3m, will increase the Charlie Browns network to 79 outlets. The Unipart outlets are concentrated in the Midlands and Wales whereas the existing Charlie Browns network is mainly in the north of England. Unipart, which defied the recession last year to increase pre-tax profits by 29 per cent to a record Pounds 19.1m, is quitting the aftermarket superstores sector, partly in order to concentrate on its manufacturing activities. It has acquired component supply contracts with Toyota and Honda, as well as with Rover Group, its former owner. It regards the UK's expanding car manufacturing industry as more attractive than the fiercely-competitive, and still heavily depressed, aftermarket sector. However, both Charlie Browns and the Unipart outlets were said by their respective owners yesterday to be operating profitably. Unipart confirmed yesterday that it is continuing to negotiate the possible purchase of Multipart, the parts distribution operation for Leyland trucks, based in Chorley, Lancashire. Whereas both the truck and van making arms of Leyland DAF have been sold by the receivers to management buy-out teams, Multipart remains in receivership. Unipart is competing for the profitable Chorley operations against a management buy-out team, but denies reports that bids of up to Pounds 100m might be in prospect.</p>

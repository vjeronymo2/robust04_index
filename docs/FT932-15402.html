			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Little comfort for Moscow in Cossack land: Chrystia Freeland finds dismay and yearnings for autonomy IN MOSCOW, the on-going struggle between Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the Congress of People's Deputies is often painted as a showdown between the forces of good - Mr Yeltsin and his reform team - and the forces of evil - the ex-communist legislature. But along the fertile banks of the Don river, once home to the free-booting Cossacks who defended Imperial Russia's periphery, the contest, and the referendum on April 25, which is meant to decide its outcome, are cast in a different light. 'All that the referendum represents is a choice between Bolsheviks and Communists,' says Vladimir Dzhanibekov. 'They are all from the old system and are merely fighting among themselves for power.' A 32-year-old private businessman dressed in the leather jacket, blue jeans and Reeboks of Russia's nouveaux riches, Mr Dzhanibekov represents what should be Mr Yeltsin's key constituency - the nascent bourgeoisie. But, like many of the citizens of Rostov-on-Don walking past the city's Lenin statue on their way home from work, Mr Dzhanibekov is so disgusted by his country's politics that he does not intend to vote. The same disenchantment prevails amid the emerald green fields of winter wheat in the Rostov region countryside. 'I will vote for anyone but Yeltsin,' says Mr Alexander Martynenko, the 52-year-old head of one of the work teams at the 'Illych's (as in Vladimir Illych Lenin) Testament' farm 50 miles south of Rostov-on-Don. 'All that presidential rule has given us is a new layer of bureaucrats who are like blood-suckers on the people.' Even Yeltsin supporters no longer display the enthusiasm which inspired 70 per cent of Rostov-on-Don's eligible voters to back Mr Yeltsin in the presidential elections 18 months ago. Irina, a smartly dressed 21-year-old accountant in the municipal government, says: 'I will probably vote for Yeltsin. He is the best of two evils.' This pervasive disillusionment is bad news for Mr Yeltsin. Earlier this month Mr Yeltsin dropped plans to hold his own plebiscite and agreed to face a much tougher referendum set by the congress. The congress's poll includes one potentially crippling condition: to win, Mr Yeltsin needs the support of 50 per cent of registered voters, not just a simple majority. The mood in Rostov-on-Don, which ranges from outright hostility toward Mr Yeltsin to lukewarm support, suggests the Russian president may be unable to clear the congress's hurdle. This is a possibility which Mr Mikhail Gaychuk, deputy head of the regional legislature, forecasts with evident glee. 'I think that there will not be a high enough voter turn-out to give the referendum legal validity,' Mr Gaychuk said, sitting beneath a black-and-white portrait of Lenin. 'And if the referendum is not valid, the congress will be proven right and Mr Yeltsin will have thrown money to the winds.' One flight of stairs away, in the massive white building which houses the various layers of government in Rostov oblast (province), Mr Vladimir Chub, head of the regional executive and thus a Yeltsin appointee, is rooting for the president. Mr Chub thinks that Mr Yeltsin can win the required support of 50 per cent of eligible voters - but only if a massive election campaign is launched immediately. Yet even Mr Yeltsin's man on the Don poses a potential threat to Moscow. A proud descendant of the Cossacks, who ran the region through their own social and political structures before 1917 in exchange for fighting for the Tsar, Mr Chub sympathises with the demands of modern Cossack organisations for greater local autonomy. Mr Chub thinks that Rostov oblast should be granted the same rights accorded to the autonomous republics which make up the Russian federation. This bid for regional devolution of power could, in the long run, be even more dangerous for Mr Yeltsin than a defeat in the referendum. Local leaders are aware that they possess a powerful bargaining chip. Rostov oblast, which produces between 7m and 8m tonnes of grain annually, is Russia's leading supplier of grain. Since the collapse of the former Soviet Union, which deprived Russia of control over Ukraine and Kazakhstan, its traditional granaries, Rostov's fertile steppes have become more critical than ever. If grain is Rostov's trump card, the Cossacks are the regional wild card. According to Cossack activists, nearly 2m young men in southern Russia have registered as Cossacks. In the spirit of their warrior ancestors, these modern Cossacks have rushed to the armed defence of Russians against non-Slavs in hot-spots such as the Trans-Dnestr region of Moldova. At home in Rostov-on-Don, they strut through the streets sporting the wild moustaches favoured by Cossacks of old and tsarist uniforms. Public sentiment in the riverside town is decidedly hostile toward these gun-toting, vodka-swilling defenders of the Orthodox faith. But they appear to have struck a chord with Mr Yeltsin, who last month issued a presidential decree recognising Cossack organisations. The decree was promptly struck down by the congress. As a result, the Cossacks say they will back the president in the referendum. But it is another reason some citizens of Rostov-on-Don cite when explaining why they plan to vote against Mr Yeltsin.</p>

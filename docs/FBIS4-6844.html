			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>   [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen urged Japan to do more to stimulate domestic demand in a  meeting with Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii on Sunday,  a senior U.S. official said. The U.S. treasury official said  Bentsen "urged Japan to do more to stimulate domestic demand and  to bring down the (trade) surplus" during talks with Fujii.    Fujii, however, emerged from the meeting saying the U.S. had  not made any particularly strong requests.    The 30-minute talks were held at the Treasury Department  ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from  the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in the afternoon.    Bentsen "also emphasized the importance of steps by Japan to  open up its financial services and insurance markets to foreign  competition," the official said, suggesting an unchanged U.S.  stance to await further Japanese moves to restart the stalled  "framework" trade talks.    The treasury official termed that talks "useful" for  reviewing bilateral developments prior to the G-7 gathering.    Both sides declined to reveal what Bentsen and Fujii  discussed about exchange rates.    Fujii said he told Bentsen that the record 15.25 trillion  yen  stimulus package adopted by the Japanese Government in February  is proceeding "steadily" and "the economy is gradually showing  brightness" and is not as weak as the recent projections by the  International Monetary Fund (IMF).    The IMF predicted in its twice-yearly world economic outlook  that Japan's economic growth in terms of real gross domestic  product (GDP) would be 0.7 percent in 1994. The Japanese  Government is projecting a 2.4 percent growth for fiscal 1994.    Japanese officials briefing reporters said Fujii spent most  of the 30-minute session with Bentsen trying to explain the  current state of the Japanese economy.    They said Fujii assured Bentsen that the new cabinet to be  formed when Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is elected premier  will continue the policy of deregulating the Japanese economy  and carrying out economic reform.    The Japanese finance minister said he also explained that a  policy accord newly reached Friday by the coalition parties  endorsed the direction for "comprehensive" tax reform to be  decided in June and enacted by the end of the year.    Regarding the framework trade talks with the United States,  Japanese officials said Fujii emphasized the importance of  Japan- U.S. relations and Japan's desire to resume the talks as  soon as possible.    Fujii also explained that Japan's trade surplus has started  to decline, noting the Japanese current account surplus shrank  in yen terms last year, the officials said.</p>

A church spokesman said the father and nuns were  kidnapped in Lira District by members of a religious sect  calling itself Lord's Resistance [two preceding words in  English], who were followers of the religious sect of Alice  Lakwena in the 1980s.    Rebels in Uganda have increased attacks against soldiers and  civilians since peace talks with the government collapsed last  month.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / People: Piol puts Acorn in his school Elserino Piol, who takes over as chairman of Acorn, the UK schools computer maker, from Ernesio Musumeci, this week, is one of the stalwarts of the European computer industry. Now 63, Piol (right) has spent his working life keeping pace with a computer industry which has continued to change at ever increasing speed; he has been with Olivetti, the Italian computer manufacturer which has a majority stake in Acorn, all that time. His latest responsibility is a further indication of the importance Olivetti is attaching to multimedia and the infor-mation superhighway. Piol is chairman of Olivetti Telemedia, a grouping of the company's international ventures in the multimedia area. Omnitel-Pronto Italia, the mobile phone consortium in which Olivetti has a significant stake is not part of the group. It includes Acorn, however, and its subsidiary Online Media, launched this year to exploit the market for interactive multimedia. Online Media is part of a consortium which has mounted an experiment on Cambridge Cable in the UK's fenlands. The project, started this year, involves a range of services including home shopping and home banking. Its chief executive, Malcolm Bird, has been named an Acorn director. It is all a far cry from the computer industry Piol enteredin 1953, when he joined Olivetti-Bull, an Olivetti subsidiary, after studying economics and business at the Catholic University of Milan. From 1959 to 1963 he was director of marketing and sales for Olivetti's computer division and in 1966 became director of group marketing. After a spell in the US as senior vice-president of Olivetti Corporation of America, he served in a number of top positions and was elected to the Olivetti board in 1987. As chairman of Olivetti Telemedia, he has responsibility for Olivetti's operations in a market which could eventually be worth Dollars 3bn.</p>

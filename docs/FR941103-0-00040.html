			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Guidance Regarding Proposals That Do Not Conform to the Traditional Revenue Requirement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe that a non-conforming proposal that results from a diverse group such as an RTG, with fair and nondiscriminatory governance and decisionmaking procedures, would more easily be found just and reasonable than a non-conforming proposal from an individual utility, for the same reason we would afford more deference to a conforming RTG transmission pricing proposal than an individual utility conforming proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Commission has been willing, under appropriate circumstances, to permit market-based pricing for sales of generation, the Commission intends to treat market-based transmission rate proposals as non-conforming. Such rates obviously are not cost-based and the Commission does not believe market-based transmission pricing is appropriate at this time. Although the transmission system has multiple owners, the basic provision of firm transmission service is not competitive in most, if not all, circumstances. Rather, each owner can exert considerable market power by controlling the access, pricing and expansion of its portion of the grid. In addition, regulatory approval for new transmission lines is increasingly difficult to obtain and franchised owners are typically the only entities that possess rights of eminent domain. In these circumstances, unlike for sales of generation, the Commission cannot rely on competitive market forces to discipline prices for firm transmission service. Accordingly, any transmission owner advocating a market-based transmission pricing method must demonstrate how it has alleviated these serious concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some cost-based pricing approaches adhere to a traditional embedded (depreciated original) cost revenue requirement more closely than others. Replacement cost methods and long-run marginal cost methods of pricing, for example, may result in revenue levels that would exceed the traditional revenue requirement. Pricing methods designed to allow a transmission owner to recover more than its traditional revenue requirement (depreciated original cost) are non-conforming and would need to satisfy the procedures and criteria for non-conforming proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Alternative Institutions and Associated Pricing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is aware that industry participants have begun to discuss alternative institutional arrangements, such as ``pool companies'' and ``transmission companies.'' Some of these institutions apparently are intended to facilitate efficient wholesale power trading, and may require alternative approaches for the pricing of transmission services. We believe that these alternative institutions hold great potential. They may assist in the resolution of some difficult federal-state jurisdictional issues and in developing mechanisms for resolving or minimizing stranded cost issues. While we are encouraged that such ideas are under discussion, and are open to considering the particular pricing needs of alternative institutions, these concepts are currently in an early, formative stage. The concepts associated with these ideas have not been adequately explored in this pricing docket or in any other Commission forum. Therefore, concurrent with issuing this Policy Statement, we are opening a separate docket to initiate an inquiry regarding alternative power pooling institutions and their particular pricing needs. <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Alternative Power Pooling Institutions under the Federal Power Act, Notice of Inquiry, FERC Stats. and Regs. &para; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The transition to a competitive wholesale bulk power market depends on the availability of comparable transmission services. Comparable transmission service, in turn, must have appropriate prices, terms and conditions. To that end, the Pricing Inquiry has provided the basis for a productive dialogue among the various entities affected by and participating in the transition to a post-EPAct competitive bulk power market, including transmission owners, transmission users, and Federal and state regulators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is critical that transmission services be priced in a manner that appropriately compensates transmission owners and creates adequate incentives for system expansion when such expansion is efficient. Of course, any transmission pricing proposal will have to be evaluated under the standards of the FPA. The Commission must ensure that any such proposal is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. A great many of the approaches discussed in this proceeding have the potential to provide better ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , more efficient) price signals. But they also have the potential to complicate and prolong the process of determining appropriate rates for transmission services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Policy Statement provides a framework for understanding these competing interests, as well as a basis for continuing the transmission pricing dialogue. The Commission has consciously avoided endorsing any particular commenter's specific pricing methodology. Instead, the Policy Statement attempts to provide guidance while still encouraging industry efforts at innovation. Indeed, a great many of the proposals that were submitted during the Pricing Inquiry are highly theoretical and would need to be tested and evaluated in the context of individual cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: EAST GERMANS TEST FOR DOPING  </P> <P> East Germany is stepping up doping controls and has begun testing athletes for  banned performance-enhancing drugs during training, the official news agency  ADN said.  </P> <P> ADN said that the country's leading sports doctors met with East German  reporters after a two-day symposium to inform them of the new regular tests for  detection of banned drugs.  </P> <P> "Sports figures and trainers must be made aware that doping is not the proper  means to enhance performance, and that hard training cannot be substituted by  something else to achieve top performances," ADN quoted the doctors as saying.  "Now tests are being conducted and positive results will be made public."  </P> <P> After denying for years Western newspaper reports that some East German  athletes were using drugs, East Germany earlier this month admitted that 14  athletes had failed drug tests last year.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RETHINKING THE FACTS  </P> <P> Knowing that most Americans are firm believers in the First Amendment guarantee  of free speech, believe that news reporters report the news while editorialists  express opinions, I always believe 100% of the facts presented in news  articles.  </P> <P> Therefore, after reading the news article ("The Great Communicator," Nov. 28)  on the radio talk show interview between KSDO host Michael Reagan and his  father, former President Ronald Reagan, I will make the following changes in my  thinking and writing:  </P> <P> If writing an article which necessitates the mention of Mikhail Gorbachev, I  will be certain to change the spelling to the Americanized "Michael," which the  L.A. Times used.  </P> <P> When deciding to shop, I will make an effort to figure out whether I will go to  Sears or Montgomery Ward. The L.A. Times doesn't seem to know the difference.  </P> <P> When I receive my Sunday New York Times, I will remind myself that, although  I've always believed their best seller list is the authority on book sales, the  Los Angeles Times must know something I don't. The New York Times list placed  former President Reagan's book, "An American Life," in eighth place on the  nonfiction list as of Nov. 25. But the Los Angeles Times' story states that the  book is selling dismally.  </P> <P> Oh well, I've been wrong a couple of times before.  </P> <P> VICKI PORTER ADAMS, San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The record evidence indicates that the proposal on verification would merely specify in the order the investigative authority already provided in the Act. Section 945.80 should be amended to specify that the Secretary and the committee, through its duly authorized employees, would have access to any premises where handlers' potatoes are held and, at any time during normal business hours, would be permitted to examine any such potatoes and any and all records with respect to matters within the purview of the order. Handlers would be responsible for furnishing labor as may be necessary to facilitate such examinations. The Secretary and duly authorized committee employees would thus explicitly have the authority to examine and audit the records of all handlers to determine compliance with provisions of the order. The committee would report the results of such examinations and audits to the Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> So that the committee would be able to perform investigations effectively and to verify compliance under the order, each handler should be required to maintain complete records which accurately show such handler's acquisition and disposition of potatoes each season, including the quantity of potatoes held, sold, and shipped. Such information is generally maintained by handlers in the normal course of business and maintenance of such records would not impose additional costs and reporting burdens on the handlers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, should it be found necessary, the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, should have the authority to issue regulations which would establish the types of records which must be maintained. Handlers would be required to keep such records for at least two succeeding fiscal periods. This period should afford the committee's employees adequate time to examine and review such records in the event of alleged program violations by handlers. This requirement should not impose an undue burden on handlers, since such records are likely retained for a similar or longer period under normal business practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is hereby recommended that &sect;945.80 be amended by adding new paragraphs (b) through (d) as discussed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

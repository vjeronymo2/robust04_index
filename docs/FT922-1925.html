			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Maxwell brothers face Pounds 135m fraud charges MR Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, sons of the disgraced publisher Robert Maxwell, and Mr Larry Trachtenberg, a US business associate, were yesterday facing fraud-related charges after being arrested at their London homes. The early morning arrests came eight months after Maxwell's death in the sea off the Canary Islands and during one of the most complex investigations carried out by the Serious Fraud Office. The police made the arrests with the SFO's investigation only half completed, and the decision to move yesterday took place against a background of mounting pressure for action and intensifying press coverage. More than Pounds 900m remains missing from a variety of Maxwell companies and pension funds affecting thousands of Maxwell pensioners. The three men face a total of 15 charges of conspiracy to defraud and theft involving Pounds 135m. Mr Kevin Maxwell, at 33 the youngest Maxwell son, and a former chairman of Maxwell Communication Corporation, was charged with two counts of conspiracy to defraud and six of theft. The charges include the alleged defrauding of the Swiss Bank Corporation of Pounds 55m and the Swiss Volks Bank of Dollars 35m. Mr Trachtenberg, the 39-year-old former London School of Economics lecturer and financial adviser to the late publisher, was charged with two counts of conspiracy to defraud SBC and Volks Bank and four theft charges. Mr Ian Maxwell, the former Mirror Group Newspapers' chairman, was charged on a single count of conspiracy to defraud Volks Bank of Dollars 35m. The charges relate to only three of the five areas of inquiry still being pursued by the SFO, and all but one of the alleged offences are said to have taken place after Maxwell's death. The five lines of inquiry are into the circumstances surrounding a Pounds 55m loan from Swiss Bank Corporation, the MCC pension funds, money missing from MGN, an alleged share support operation and cash and investments removed from MCC. Accountants tracing Maxwell assets on behalf of creditors and pensioners said yesterday that the charges against the three men would have no effect on their investigations. Following the arrests, the three men were taken to Snow Hill police station in the City of London - not far from both the headquarters of the collapsed empire, and the offices used by the brothers recently in an apparent attempt to relaunch their business careers. They were brought to the police station just after 7am and were detained without being questioned before being charged. Reporting restrictions were not lifted on their first court appearance, lasting just over one hour at the City of London Magistrates, and all three were released on conditional bail to reappear on September 1. The trial  - likely to be the largest case of alleged fraud ever to come before the UK courts - is not expected to start for two years. Mr Kevin Maxwell was bailed on sureties of Pounds 500,000, Mr Ian Maxwell on sureties of Pounds 250,000 and Mr Trachtenberg on sureties of Pounds 300,000. In all cases, the sureties were provided by friends and family. All three were ordered to surrender their passports, not to leave the UK and to live at their home addresses. After the hearing Mr Kevin Maxwell said he would oppose all the charges against him. 'After seven months of trial by rumour, of trial by innuendo, of trial by selective press leaks and of prejudicial media reporting, I am really looking forward to being able to defend myself in a court of law where I intend to vigorously and strenuously contest all and any charges against me,' he said. The arrest of Mr Kevin Maxwell began in something close to farce. When two police officers rang the doorbell of his Pounds 1.7m house in Jubilee Place, Chelsea, his wife Pandora mistook them for reporters. She opened an upstairs window and shouted to the officers: 'Piss off - we don't get up for another hour.' When the officers rang the bell again she called out: 'I'm about to call the police'. They replied: 'We are the police, madam. Would you please open the door?'

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico to tighten rules on banks' borrowings THE Mexican authorities will act to prevent the country's newly-privatised banks from side-stepping central bank regulations aimed at limiting the build-up of their foreign currency debts. Measures introduced last year limit Mexican banks' foreign currency borrowings to 10 per cent of total liabilities. However, banks have issued peso-denominated debt instruments carrying clauses which promise to cover the holder against the risk of a devaluation against the dollar. Authorities estimate the banks have issued about Dollars 5bn of such debt instruments abroad, usually in maturities of three to six months. 'This is something we do not like at all,' said a government official. 'We would like to put a cap on this amount and see a gradual liquidation,' he added. Last year's measures were aimed at curbing the highly-profitable practice by Mexican banks of borrowing in dollars at relatively low interest rates and lending on the funds in pesos at much higher interest rates. This exposes the banks to potential currency losses. Banks face Bank of Mexico limits on their dollar exposure of around Dollars 20bn. The new instruments evade the regulations by being nominally denominated in pesos, even though they present the same risk as dollar instruments in case of unexpected devaluation. Mexican banks are also under acute pressure to meet international capital requirements that come into force at the start of next year. These require banks to have capital equivalent to 8 per cent of their liabilities, adjusted for risk. A government official said that some banks would not be able to meet that limit by January. However, he added that 'some tolerance will be shown' if banks are moving towards meeting the requirements.</p>

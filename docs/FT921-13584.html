			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Medeva acquires Glaxo brands MEDEVA, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday acquired more than 30 brands from Glaxo in a deal worth Pounds 13.5m. The products, which range from treatments for paracetamol poisoning to nose inflammation, have a turnover in the UK and the Republic of Ireland of about Pounds 6.5m a year. The purchase price is to be paid by instalments over a period of two-and-a-half years. The move follows a series of acquisitions by Medeva, which aims to have sales of Pounds 500m by 1995. In 1989 the group had revenues of less than Pounds 1m. Mr David Lees, Medeva's finance director, said yesterday: 'These treatments are more fitting in a company our size where they will be first and second rank products while at Glaxo they were in the fifth-rank.' Mr Lees said Medeva should make profits of Pounds 15m this year. That would compare with Glaxo's profits last year of Pounds 1.2bn on turnover of Pounds 3.4bn. Mr Bernard Taylor, Medeva's chairman, was formerly Glaxo's chief executive. Glaxo said it was selling niche generic products of which Medeva could make more use than itself. It added that it did not have enough time to give them the attention they deserved. The acquisitions fit into Medeva's existing sales and distribution channels, said Mr Lees. The company already manufactures some of the products and will sub-contract the others. No additional capital expenditure was required to set up manufacturing, he added. Mr Lees said he was particularly pleased with the timing of payment which would make the deal cash-flow equal. Last October Medeva bought Adams Laboratories, a Texas-based branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, for Dollars 77.2m (Pounds 43m).</p>

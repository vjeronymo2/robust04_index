			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Outcry over vodka price rise The new leadership in Belarus raised vodka prices yesterday by 75 per cent and hard-pressed drinkers accused President Alexander Lukashenko of going back on election promises to make food and drink cheaper. The price of a 0.7 litre (11 oz) bottle leapt to 6,900 Belarussian roubles (Dollars 2.50). Mr Lukashenko won last month's presidential election by a landslide on pledges to root out corruption and roll back price increases for food and drink. But since taking office, he has appointed a reformist prime minister and resolved to introduce market measures quickly and to tackle alcoholism. Yesterday's price increase for vodka was the second since his election and prices of bread and milk have risen fivefold.</p>

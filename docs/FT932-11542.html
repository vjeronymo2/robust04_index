			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Clarke warns over pit takeovers BRITISH COAL has warned private companies it will not let them take over the corporation's unwanted pits unless it is on a long-term basis. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said in an interview with The Times that this approach was necessary to prevent companies taking over mines on a 'rape and pillage' basis. He said the corporation would revoke companies' licences to run pits if they did not stick to the long-term approach. Carving a niche, Page 20</p>

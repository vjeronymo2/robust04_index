			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Spectre of 1990 poll haunts Hewson: Australia's opposition may yet fail to oust Labor TWO weeks into Australia's five-week federal election campaign, the conservative opposition parties are increasingly confident of ending a decade of Labor rule. Buoyed by an unexpectedly strong performance by Mr John Hewson, the opposition leader, the Liberal/National Party coalition has built up a lead of 6-12 percentage points in the opinion polls. At face value, the polls suggest a comfortable margin for the coalition, which requires a uniform national swing of only 0.9 per cent on March 13 to win the six seats needed to take power. But, as polling day draws nearer, detailed local polling suggests that the gap is much smaller in marginal seats that will decide the election. That raises the uncomfortable prospect for the conservatives of a repeat of the 1990 election, when the coalition won the biggest share of the popular vote, but failed to win enough seats to take power. The key to victory lies in about 20 marginal constituencies, many of which are being fought on local issues that tend to insulate voters from the national trend. The government is weakest in Western Australia, where it holds four seats by majorities of less than 2.5 per cent; South Australia, where it would lose four seats on a swing of 3.8 per cent; and the sugar belt of northern New South Wales and Queensland, where it holds six seats by margins of less than 5 per cent. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, can do little to defend the Western Australian seats except hope that the defeat of a Labor state government earlier this month has assuaged voters' anger against the party. However, Labor is fighting hard in the sugar belt, where it has offered to exempt sugar farmers from its tariff reduction proposals for the duration of the next parliament. The coalition, which also holds a highly marginal sugar belt seat, has matched the government's offer with a ADollars 145m (Pounds 69m) package designed to compensate for its own proposed tariff cuts. Mr Keating tried last week to shore up Labor support in South Australia by offering ADollars 600m in federal funds to rescue the state Labor government from the financial consequences of a ADollars 3bn loss by a state-owned bank. However, the critical battle will be fought in the conservative-controlled states of New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria, where the conservatives are defending six seats with majorities of less than 3.3 per cent. Labor's chief hope is in Victoria, where the party lost heavily in 1990, and was defeated in a state election in October. Government strategists believe the conservative vote in the state may have peaked. An analysis of local opinion polls published in The Age newspaper in Melbourne concluded that Labor would benefit from a swing of between 0.5 per cent and 3 per cent on present voting intentions, which could translate to a gain of three or more seats. If the coalition does well elsewhere, Victoria will not matter. But in a close election, Labor gains in the state could keep the conservatives out of office, or reduce the size of their majority in the House of Representatives. That would be a severe blow for the coalition, which is relying on the moral authority of a substantial majority to force controversial legislation through the Senate. Unlike the House, the Senate is elected by proportional representation, which usually delivers the balance of power to the Australian Democrats, a populist left-wing party which has never won a House seat. Senator John Coulter, leader of the Democrats, says the party will oppose key conservative proposals to expand private health insurance, deregulate the industrial relations system and introduce a goods and services tax. Unless Senator Coulter backs down, that would ensure that large parts of the conservative agenda would be blocked, leaving Mr Hewson with little choice other than to seek the dissolution of both houses and a second election. Many Australians, already grumbling about compulsory voting every three or four years, would regard that as the worst outcome of all.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Oskar Lafontaine, SPD deputy chairman and </F> minister-president of the Saarland, by Helmut Loelhoeffel; place  and date not given: "Those Who Do the Right Thing by the  Environment Will Be Rewarded"]    [Text] Loelhoeffel: Your name is synonymous with  the social democratic concept of "ecological renewal of  industrial society." The SPD's government program quite  intentionally focuses on work, social security, and economics.  Why is it that you allow the ecological component to be  shortchanged?    Lafontaine: Ecological modernization is a pivotal  reform project as far as we are concerned. Work, social  security, and ecological renewal are not contradictions by any  means. We wish to combine work and the ecology and make it clear  that ecological renewal will result in more jobs and that it is  a social task our society must deal with, because intolerable  ecological conditions cannot be permitted to exist from a social  point of view.    Loelhoeffel: But the Greens and the environmental  groups are saying that the draft program does not contain very  much solid language aside from some general declarations of  intent. They doubt that the SPD is serious about new initiatives  on the environment. There even are critical voices from inside  the SPD itself.    Lafontaine: From the point of view of the Greens I  can understand that criticism. They are a political party in  competition with us and they would like to cast doubt on our  credibility on ecological issues. What is more, they do not want  to come out as they did in the last Bundestag election when they  failed to gain any seats. By now the voters have a very good  idea of where the SPD stands on environmental issues. We already  stated in the last Bundestag election campaign that an SPD  government would take decisive steps aimed at ecological renewal  which would be markedly different from the practices of the Kohl  government. One of the central projects still is an ecological  tax reform.    Loelhoeffel: The draft program merely refers in  general terms to an energy tax, however. Michael Mueller, the  spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group, and others deplore the  lack of a clear statement on higher mineral oil taxes for  example. One cannot leave the transportation sector out of the  equation. After all, it accounts for about 25 percent of energy  consumption.    Lafontaine: Unfortunately both the public and  large segments of the political parties still do not understand  what ecological tax reform is all about. It is not designed to  provide funds for this or that project; it is not a way of  making people pay more taxes but a way of setting new price  signals. The principal idea behind this reform is to place less  of a load on work and to raise taxes on the consumption of  energy and materials harmful to the environment. This will  create incentives to use less energy and to put new products on  the market which conform to environmental standards. Those who  do the right thing by the environment will be rewarded.  Employees will have more money in their pockets because income  taxes or other payroll deductions imposed by law will be cut.    Loelhoeffel: Why put the blame on the public  rather than admit weak points in selling the program?    Lafontaine: I have seen 100 headlines which read  "fuel taxes to rise." But I have not seen a single headline  referring to the ecological tax reform which said "deep income  tax cuts" or "cuts in payroll deductions." Not a one. The media  almost always focus on the seemingly negative aspects, and those  that are positive are suppressed. And that does harm to this  important reform project.    Loelhoeffel: But it is difficult to understand  your project, if one cannot gauge its consequences.    Lafontaine: The consequences are that there is  less strain on the environment and that the working population  is relieved of unnecessary burdens--and that creates more jobs.  Employees get to keep more of what they earn and can decide on  their own what they wish to spend and consume. That needs to be  understood because we need to obtain the approval of the public  for this ecological tax reform. Better environmental policy can  only succeed and the proposed lessening of the strain on the  environment can only be achieved if the majority of the voters  is for it. Unfortunately a good many environmentalists fail to  see the connection. Those who would like to see the price of one  liter of gasoline raised to 5 marks [DM] may salve their  conscience. They may even gain the support of a number of  delegates to a party congress. But they make it impossible to  win a majority of the voters over to their position.    Loelhoeffel: Just the same, we would like to hear  some real numbers. Who will have to pay how much when?    Lafontaine: It would be both irresponsible and  unwise from the point of view of economics to decide on scope  and timing without taking the economic situation into account.  For instance, the decisions reached would depend on whether the  automobile industry were doing well or doing poorly. Many other  factors would also play a role. That applies to all decisions  which have economic and social consequences.    Loelhoeffel: What other factors contribute to the  SPD's credibility with regard to environmental protection?    Lafontaine: The second important point in addition  to ecological tax reform is that we believe the production of  electric power from nuclear reactors is untenable and therefore  wish gradually to relinquish that option. In talks I have had  with the environmental groups I got the feeling that this  particular demand for which many protest demonstrations were  held over the years has been all but checked off because it has  long since been included in all the wish lists. Real progress in  the nuclear energy field alone provides an ecological  justification for a change of government in Bonn. The third  point I would like to mention is the restructuring of research  policy which needs to be focused on the environment. We have to  build a bridge into the solar age, i.e. all technologies which  conserve energy, lessen the strain on the environment, and  develop renewable forms of energy, including the use of solar  and wind energy, must be supported in entirely different ways  from now on.    Loelhoeffel: The current version of the SPD  government program puts the ecological tax reform off to the  time "European Union [EU]-wide regulations" have been adopted.  That sounds like procrastinating a solution and shifting  responsibilities. What is it that the SPD can and will push  through?    Lafontaine: We have a first draft in hand. It goes  without saying that we will not wait until every EU country has  understood the need for ecological tax reforms. I am in full  agreement with Rudolf Scharping on that point. Let me remind you  of the debate on the catalytic converter and lead-free gasoline.  If we had waited then until all the EC countries availed  themselves of that technology, it would have been introduced on  a Europewide scale at a much later date. We took the lead and  the result was that the technology spread all over Europe. As a  consequence, new jobs were created here in Germany as well.    Loelhoeffel: Is there a need to change, clarify or  augment other passages of the ecology segment of the present  draft? Do you yourself think more forceful language is needed?    Lafontaine: There is a debate on speed limits. The  present draft states that we must have speed limits that are  ecologically suitable and contextually meaningful. There is a  specific reference to the need for a 30-kilometer speed limit in  residential areas. Independent of the debate on speed limits as  such our principal aim is to make progress on the introduction  of new environmental technologies. The most important item on  the agenda are automobiles that conserve gas by using two to  three liters per 100 kilometers.    Loelhoeffel: Are you giving any thought to  dictating fuel consumption limits to the automobile industry? Or  how else do you propose to bring about the development of more  efficient and ecologically friendly engines?    Lafontaine: I am opposed to more regulations, and  that goes for the ecology as well. The main thing is to cut down  on energy consumption. That, after all, is the political goal.  The political establishment should exercise restraint with  regard to setting exact technical standards on specific  environmental targets. That should be left to the technicians  and to competition. That is why I am in favor of restricting  ourselves to achieving the goal of lower consumption. And that  is where the price signal comes in which we are putting up with  the ecological tax reform.</p>

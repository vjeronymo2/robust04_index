"As  far as military deployment in the former Yugoslavia is  concerned, we Germans are the worst advisers," Kinkel told the  Erfurt THUERINGER ALLGEMEINE (Wednesday edition). One should  await tomorrow's NATO session. Kinkel also appealed to the  Social Democratic Party to give up its opposition to changing  the Basic Law on the issue of out-of-area deployment of the  Bundeswehr. Otherwise, he feared, "Germany would be harmed if  we have to carry on behaving as we do now in such crises."</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel Eurotunnel's coyness about the value of its extended concession is a little irritating. Still, while the present value of an extra 10 years of revenues 50 years from now is doubtless modest, the company has resolved another of its apparently infinite number of disputes. That alone should be enough to boost the shares when the market has the chance to offer its verdict. On the other side, the pain of forgone revenues to governments who find planning over five years difficult is presumably zero. The settlement may also reassure those considering private-public joint ventures that the government can be reasonable, provided it does not cost real money.</p>

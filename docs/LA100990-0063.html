			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVATION / SAVING ADOBE;  </P> <P> A DOWN-TO-EARTH ASSAULT ON AN AGE-OLD PROBLEM;  </P> <P> EXPERTS WILL GATHER IN NEW MEXICO TO SHARE WAYS TO PRESERVE STRUCTURE AND  SPIRIT OF MUD-BRICK BUILDINGS.  </P> <P> Out in the New Mexico desert, rows of man-made adobe walls lined up like  tombstones are being treated with chemicals and soaked with water. Not far  away, remnants of a 19th-Century adobe fort sit under a canopy of fabric  specially color-coordinated to blend in with the Southwestern landscape.  </P> <P> These simple structures at Ft. Selden soon will be the object of intense  scrutiny as representatives of 30 countries from China to Chile gather next  week in nearby Las Cruces to share research in how to halt deterioration of one  of the oldest building materials on Earth.  </P> <P> Co-sponsored by the Getty Conservation Institute of Marina del Rey and five  other public and private agencies, the sixth International Conference on the  Conservation of Earthen Architecture -- the biggest so far and the first to be  held in the United States -- will bring together scientists, archeologists,  architects and conservators.  </P> <P> Although the conference will focus on the preservation of historic monuments  made of sun-dried mud brick, organizers hope it will have a broader  application, especially for developing countries. Nearly half of the world's  population is believed to live in homes constructed from adobe, whose earliest  known use (in unbaked form) dates to nearly 8000 BC in Jericho.  </P> <P> Participants will hear from New Mexicans involved in community programs to  maintain local churches and Moroccans attempting to revitalize oasis villages.  "People will be brought into communication in a way that does not deal only  with, shall I say, dry-as-dust structures," said Neville Agnew, director of  scientific programs for the Getty institute, "but also with social history,  social interaction and the maintenance of traditions."  </P> <P> In the United States, adobe usually is associated with the Southwest, where it  is used in everything from multimillion-dollar haciendas to Department of  Housing and Urban Development units built for Pueblo Indians. But adobe  structures of varying architectural styles are found in various parts of the  country.  </P> <P> Despite its many virtues -- it is cheap and accessible and adapts to desert  climates -- adobe is vulnerable to rain, earthquakes, wind, fluctuation in  temperature and humidity and damage from insects and rodents. Many important  historical sites are showing the effects of long-term neglect.  </P> <P> Since 1972, New Mexico state officials have been conducting conservation  experiments at Ft. Selden, a military post built in 1867 to protect the  surrounding Mesilla Valley and abandoned 100 years ago. In 1987, the Getty  Conservation Institute, funded by the J. Paul Getty Trust, added its scientific  expertise and resources to what was essentially a "folk" experiment testing  "all sorts of interesting things" from store-bought chemicals to cactus juice,  according to Thomas J. Caperton, director of New Mexico State Monuments.  </P> <P> Getty scientists report promising results from two types of chemicals that can  be applied to adobe walls. One -- alkoxysilane -- is more easily absorbed than  the other but is very expensive. The second -- isocyanate -- is cheaper but  more difficult to work with. Both have "a tendency to slightly darken the  appearance, and this might not be acceptable to people, especially to  conservators," said Richard L. Coffman, a Getty geologist.  </P> <P> Experimenters have not used chemicals on historic relics, choosing instead to  build new walls for test purposes. "A big buzzword in conservation science is  'reversibility,' " or the ability to undo the test, said chemist Charles  Selwitz, a Getty institute consultant.  </P> <P> Reversibility explains the appeal of the so-called hexashelters developed by  Getty scientists. These are tent-like structures made of loosely woven fabrics  -- called "aerotextiles" -- and secured by concrete footings. They can be  placed over monuments, protecting them from the elements while still allowing  access for visitors.  </P> <P> But, like most conservation measures, this has a downside, according to Michael  Taylor, a National Park Service archeologist who is co-chairman of the  conference with Agnew. The shelter itself may exacerbate wind turbulence, he  said.  </P> <P> Agnew and his crew are working with other materials to protect newly dug-up  relics from disintegration. Scientists have learned that the safest place for  the discoveries is right back underground. Wrapping them with so-called  geotextiles keeps insects and rodents away and enables archeologists to easily  retrieve them.  </P> <P> In New Mexico, scores of sites have been "reburied" while awaiting new  technology that will ensure their future existence, Taylor said.  </P></p>

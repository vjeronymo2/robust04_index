			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "People": "Kazimierz </F> Ujazdowski"]    [Text] The Conservative Coalition (KK)--such is the name  given to the new Polish right-wing group that was formed  following the secession of seven of the 15 members of the Main  Administration of the Conservative Party (PK). They claim to  have the support of half of the local PK affiliates. The head of  the Coalition, Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski, would like to bring  about a quick integration of the right, together with Center  Accord (PC), the Christian National Union (ZChN), the RdR  (Movement for the Republic), and the PL (Peasant Accord). The  founding congress of the Conservative Coalition will probably  take place in March, and Ujazdowski himself is mentioned as one  of the chief pretenders to the leadership of the  national-Christian right camp.    The 30-year-old Kazimierz Ujazdowski was born in Kielce and  was graduated from the Department of Law of Lodz University. In  1990 and 1991, he was secretary general of the Forum of the  Democratic Right [FPD, founded in summer 1990; merged with ROAD,  Citizens Movement-Democratic Action, to form UD, the Democratic  Union party]. As a member of the presidium of the UD, he was  deputy to the secretary general of the party. However, he  deserted UD and, together with Aleksander Hall, created in 1992  the Conservative Party. Before last year's September elections,  he negotiated with the ZChN leaders to accept the Conservative  Party into the "Ojczyzna" [Fatherland] electoral coalition, of  which he was an ardent supporter. From that time on, a conflict  between him and Hall grew, leading to the division in the  Conservative Party.    Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski was a Sejm deputy in the first  term and was a member of the Parliamentary Club of the  Democratic Union and later of the Parliamentary Club of the  Polish Convention [Konwencja Polska, a 33-member parliamentary  club consisting of deputies from the FPD, the PChD (Party of  Christian Democrats), and the SL-Ch (Peasant-Christian Party)].  He is the founder of the "Kraj" ["Country"] association and of  the Alexis de Tocqueville Democratic Foundation.    He is married and has one son. He likes to spend his free  time reading belles lettres literature and traveling.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> STATE CASH SEEN AS LAST HOPE TO AVERT TEACHERS' STRIKE  </P> <P> As teachers packed up materials and some students skipped school, leaders of  both the teachers' union and the Los Angeles Unified School District held out  hope Friday for a last-minute contract settlement based on an infusion of  additional money from the state.  </P> <P> Campuses throughout the district struggled through a confusing last day of  classes before a scheduled teachers' strike, as pressure grew for a settlement  -- or at least a postponement of the Monday walkout. Los Angeles-area  legislators and PTA leaders called for round-the-clock negotiations. In  Sacramento, there was much talk of how a strike could influence Gov. George  Deukmejian's expected announcement of a revised budget next week and Democratic  plans for the state tax revenue surplus.  </P> <P> United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson, in an interview at his  office, said he met Friday morning with two members of the school board and  characterized the discussions as "positive and friendly" but stressed that  there had been no breakthrough.  </P> <P> "Our communications are like a professional boxing match in the first round. We  are sort of feeling each other out," he said.  </P> <P> Johnson added that he hoped "the meetings might get us to a point where we feel  we can make a deal and then make one."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good Communication  </P> <P> Board member Jackie Goldberg, who showed up at a morning press conference by  Democratic legislators, urged lawmakers to help free up additional money.  "Communication is going on very nicely," she said, referring to informal talks  with the union. "The problem is whether we can agree."  </P> <P> Dick Fisher, the district's chief negotiator, stressed Friday that the district  is committed to using 60% of any new state monies to fulfill the current offer.  He said the offer guarantees teachers 21.5% over three years -- 8% this year,  5.5% in 1990 and 8% in 1991 -- and pledges to raise the second year to 8% if  the district receives sufficient additional state funds. That would allow the  district to offer a total raise of 24% over three years.  </P> <P> But Fisher said a stumbling block is the union's reluctance to agree to a  settlement based on the contingency of the state funds. "If those funds occur,  it gives the contingent part of our offer more hope," he said. "We see no  possibility of the board going beyond" a 24%, three-year increase.  </P> <P> The seven-member school board is reported to be badly divided on how quickly to  make a new offer, and that was compounded by uncertainty about the size of the  state surplus. On Friday, board members talked informally, clustering in groups  of twos and threes, in district headquarters hallways. Board President Roberta  Weintraub said that a closed meeting of the school board was scheduled for  today.  </P> <P> Several well-placed sources on legislative staffs and among Sacramento  lobbyists on Friday offered three scenarios for the use of what many expect  will be a $750-million revenue surplus. The most optimistic scenario for a  strike settlement is that the Legislature will allow all the provisions of  Proposition 98 and the Gann spending limit to take effect, sending about $560  million to schools and community colleges; under that, the Los Angeles district  might receive $60 million, most of that with no strings attached.  </P> <P> Another possibility will be offered next week by Democratic leaders. That will  shift budget limits around, allowing only $300 million extra for schools, with  $33.7 million going to Los Angeles, according to the experts. The Los Angeles  share available for salaries could be much lower if legislators and the  governor require that education funds go for school maintenance or textbook  purchases.  </P> <P> "But the informal thinking is that most of it would be available for local  districts to do what they want," said one legislative aide. Yet an influential  lobbyist stressed that there is much Republican hostility toward the  overwhelmingly Democratic Los Angeles district and its teachers' union.  </P> <P> The third option is that two-thirds of both houses of the Legislature, and the  governor, move to suspend Proposition 98, the measure passed last fall by  voters that guarantees much state funds for schools. A suspension could mean no  extra monies for schools. "The big question mark on this is where the governor  is," another source said.  </P> <P> The governor, who was in Los Angeles Friday, refused to comment on the surplus.  He is expected to present his budget revisions by the end of the week. The  Senate Budget Committee is expected to discuss this Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> At their downtown press conference Friday, nine Democratic state lawmakers  called for pressure on the school board and the teachers to settle without a  strike. Los Angeles Assemblywoman Maxine Waters warned that a walkout could put  more students on the street and increase the risks of gang violence. While not  taking sides, Sepulveda Assemblyman Richard Katz hinted that the Los Angeles  school system could have trouble getting funding and programs through the  Legislature if a strike occurs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PTA Chides Both Sides  </P> <P> While emphasizing their collective political clout, the lawmakers sidestepped  questions about using that influence to help increase state funding for the  district so the board can boost its pay offer. Citing the uncertainty of how  much money will be available, and the complexity of the legislative process,  Waters said, "for us to commit on (future) dollars that will be available would  be irresponsible."  </P> <P> During their own press conference, leaders of Parent-Teacher Assns. around the  district echoed that call for negotiations and criticized both the union and  the district. "It is clear that rancor has been building for many months,  resulting in the current lack of trust between the parties. If a strike occurs,  there will be no winners," the PTA announced.  </P> <P> State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, saying he has been in touch with  both sides, called on the union to delay a strike until after the fact finder's  report comes out on Wednesday and the governor's update on state revenues is  released next Friday. "If there is an offer on the table that's substantial and  there is a chance of more money, it seems to me that (a strike) is not a  responsible action."  </P> <P> Attendance at some schools dropped as much as 15% Friday, with absent students  figuring that little would be accomplished in the tense pre-strike situation.  Feelings of division grew between those teachers who are committed to a strike  and those who say they will go to work on Monday. Some faculty lounges were  said to be as unpleasant Friday as border state households were on the eve of  the Civil War with different sons heading to opposing armies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Seniors Expected  </P> <P> At Marshall High School in the Los Feliz-Silver Lake area, Principal Donald  Hahn said that about 600 students -- 50 more than usual -- were absent out of a  total enrollment of 2,800. He estimated that, if there is a strike on Monday,  only about 1,600 students would come to school. "I expect most of the seniors  will come in because they want to ensure graduation," he said. But younger  students have less at stake, he explained.  </P> <P> About 150 students at Palms Junior High School walked out of classes for about  an hour Friday to show support for teachers but also to express concern that  striking teachers pledged not to file student grades next week. Principal  Minnie Floyd described the rally as "extremely orderly."  </P> <P> At Nightingale Junior High School near downtown Los Angeles, about 100 students  left campus during a break Friday morning, but school officials persuaded most  to return to class, Principal Jess Bojorquez said.  </P> <P> "Nobody mentioned anything about the strike but there's a lot of anxiety and  uncertainty going on," Bojorquez said.  </P> <P> Both district and union leaders expressed concern about possible violence on  campuses next week if there is a strike. District police canceled all vacations  and training programs and are placing officers on longer shifts as of this  morning.  </P> <P> Teachers committed to a strike were also reviewing their finances, as they  could face weeks without pay during a lengthy walkout. To aid them, the  teachers' credit union announced Friday that it would allow a moratorium on  payments due on car and personal loans for the duration of a strike but that  mortgage payments could not be postponed.  </P> <P> During breaks Friday, teachers carried the last boxes full of personal  belongings and teaching materials from classrooms to their cars. School-owned  materials were tucked away in locked storage closets, and classroom bulletin  boards were stripped of their construction paper displays.  </P> <P> "It's really a hard day," said Adele Mallin, a drama teacher at Reed Junior  High School in North Hollywood. "You don't know when you're saying goodby to  these students whether you're going to ever see them again."  </P> <P> Teachers who decide to work can earn as much as three and four extra hours  worth of pay each day of the strike by teaching extra class periods, as well as  for admitting extra students to their regular classes, school officials said.  </P> <P> The job of scheduling and operating classes during the strike will rest with  individual school principals and their administrative staffs. The district has  insisted, however, that all schools remain open. Room keys were collected from  teachers as they left school Friday.  </P> <P> Administrators at Huntington Park High School mailed letters to parents on  Friday, directing students to meet at various locations -- such as the  cafeteria, library and gymnasium -- according to grade levels.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, June 8 (AFP) -- UN special envoy Lakhdar  Ibrahimi urged the warring sides in Yemen Wednesday [8 June] to  stop fighting and start negotiating as battles raged outside the  southern bastion of Aden.    Ibrahimi arrived from Cairo and was due to hold talks later  with northern government officials, before meeting President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Thursday.    "The in-fighting between brothers must stop and must stop  now, and give way to resuming negotiations," Ibrahimi, a former  Algerian foreign minister, said as he arrived on a fact-finding  mission.    He has been sent under the terms of a UN Security Council  resolution adopted last week calling on Salih's forces and those  of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid to cease hostilities  immediately.    A ceasefire announced Monday by northern leaders collapsed  within hours, and the UN has reported that up to one million  people could be in need of humanitarian aid following the month  of fighting.    Salih warned Wednesday that the war would last longer  because  the international community had become involved in the conflict.    "Bilateral, direct discussions are the best way. Since it  has become an international issue the conflict will take much  longer."    And he added that international observers in Yemen would be  "a flagrant interference in our internal affairs."    Meanwhile, 27 civilians, mainly women and children, were  killed and 45 wounded in an attack on Dar Sa'd village 15  kilometers (10 miles) north of Aden, officials at the  al-Jumhuriyah hospital said.    The morgue in the southern city was reported to be  overflowing, and head doctor Muhsin 'Awad told AFP "we have 20  bodies outside the morgue."    Southern officials accused the north of shelling the village  late Tuesday.    More shelling could be heard from Aden on Wednesday.    Correspondents reported that female militia forces from the  south's Yemen Socialist Party were deployed Wednesday at  roadblocks on routes leading into Aden to press gang men into  fighting.    Ibrahimi told reporters on his arrival that he was starting  his mission "with an open mind and a very strong desire to help  the brothers in Yemen solve their problems."</p>

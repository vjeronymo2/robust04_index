			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 </F> 0524): "Development and Reform Should Proceed at the Same Time"]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- The beginning of the new  year has turned a new leaf for China's economic development.  This new year will be a year in which the nation's reform and  opening up endeavors and economic construction will gather speed  on the basis of the experiences and brilliant successes gained  and achieved in the past 15 years.    Media at home and abroad commonly maintain that China's  economic reform and development will both gather speed and will  be successful, provided that the country proceeds carefully and  practically, taking advantage of its economic and political  stability.    How can China's economic reform and development proceed  faster? The nation's economic development in 1993 shows a new  economic system must be established through reform and a new  course should be set for development, and that these are two  mutually dependent requirements. This is due to the fact that  only by building a new economic system through reform can  productive forces be significantly liberated and a sustained,  fast, and healthy national economic development be ensured. The  entire macroeconomic development shows that, compared with 1992,  the nation's economy in 1993 grew approximately 13 percent,  industrial output grew 19.5 percent, and investment in fixed  assets grew 47 percent. Such high rates of economic growth did  not give rise to any major problems specifically because reform  has enabled us to control the economic "express train" by means  of macroeconomic regulation and control, and consequently our  enterprises' production and operations have become more vital  and our country's overall economic strength has grown. Last  year's macroeconomic regulation and control replaced the  previous practice of simply relying on administrative measures  with a combination of economic, administrative, and legal  measures, emphasizing economic measures. Moreover, as result of  replacing direct regulation and control with indirect regulation  and control, the nation has achieved results totally different  from those of the past: The chaos in the monetary and  distribution spheres were brought under control, fast economic  growth was maintained, and dramatic economic ups and downs were  avoided.    When viewed from another perspective, however, the major  economic problems in 1993 are also problems that need to be  resolved through reform. For example, 37.3 percent of state  enterprises were operating in the red and their losses seriously  restrained the growth in the returns of state businesses; and  excessive investment in fixed assets and irrational investment  seriously upset supply and demand. The solution to these  problems lies in stronger reform measures, gradual establishment  of a modern system for enterprise operations, pushing  enterprises to take part in market competition, and fully  restructuring the current investment pattern. Economic  authority maintains: The current opportunity is one of  development and reform, and if we disregard the opportunity of  reform, we will lose the opportunity of development; there will  hardly be development without carrying out reform; there will  not be fast growth without accelerating reform; and reforms  during the new period must target those deep-rooted problems  obstructing fast and healthy economic development.    According to relevant state authorities, with an  approximately nine percent economic growth this year, the nation  will still have "sustained, fast, and healthy" economic growth.  Although this figure is smaller than that of last year, it is  still quite high when compared with the economic situations of  most countries. Economic experts assert that the principle of  maintaining "sustained, fast, and healthy" growth has the  following profound meanings: The real nature of socialism is to  liberate and develop productive forces, achieve common  prosperity, and speed up the process of liberating productive  forces, which are the core of socialist construction; China's  fast growth should not be tentative or short- termed, but should  be fast and sustained; and the development must be healthy,  meaning that it is in line with law, it is subjected to  macroscopic regulation and control, and it is supported by law.  The reform over the past 15 years proves that whenever a place  has been successful in reform, it also enjoys fast growth.  China's fast economic growth over the past two years is the  result the nation has achieved while speeding up reform and  opening wider to the outside world after Comrade Deng Xiaoping  gave his important speech in southern China and after the  convocation of the 14th national party congress.    The current situation of reform is very good because the  opportunity for reform is there and the goals have been clearly  defined. However, the tasks of reform are also formidable.  Under the situation where reform and development are both  gathering speed, we should be aware that we cannot afford to  carry out reform by suspending development. Fast growth is the  result of reform, and only through reform can we master the  "high tech" -- namely the new system -- for controlling the  national economy during fast economic operations. We must learn  the skills of speeding up reform under the circumstances when  the economic development is fast and changes in the economic  sector are fairly complex. The year 1994 is critical for  China's reform and economic development and it should be a year  in which China will be successful in these two areas.</p>

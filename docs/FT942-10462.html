			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (23): 'The filling in the sandwich' - Asians have a powerful grip on many sectors of the economy What could sum up better the powerful intermingling of Asian and African cultures on the east coast of Africa than a restaurant in Mombasa called the Swahili Curry Bowl? Long-standing residents, economically indispensable but regarded with suspicion and sometimes hostility, Kenya might best be seen for the Asians - to borrow an American phrase - as less of a melting pot and more of a salad bowl. Some observers talk about Asians as 'the filling in the sandwich', conveniently providing a political buffer to prevent greater economic domination of the country by the Kikuyu, Kenya's largest tribe. It does not take long to see the influence of the group. The ubiquitous black African faces in many organisations belie ultimate control by an Asian or white. Asians have a powerful grip on many sectors of the economy, notably in leisure and tourism, finance, construction and general commerce. The economic strength of the community is far out of proportion to their numbers. At the latest census Asians accounted for an estimated 59,000 out of a total population of more than 26m: the largest single ethnic group but far smaller than the black majority. Yet take an internal flight, eat in a higher-priced restaurant or stay in a comfortable hotel within Kenya, and the proportion of Asian faces rises substantially above these levels. Given the proximity to the Indian sub-continent, the east coast of Africa was a logical entrepot over many centuries for Asians - who are often referred to as 'Indians' by black Africans regardless of their country of origin. Many of the ancestors of today's settlers came from the states of Gujerat and Punjab, and arrived in Kenya as indentured construction workers to help build the railways in the country in the late 19th century for its British colonisers. Others came to settle with the encouragement of the authorities after the second world war. They tend to live in relatively closed communities. There is little social mixing with other Kenyans and they rarely intermarry. 'It would not work,' says one Sikh with an arranged Indian marriage whose father came to the country from Punjab in the 1940s. 'We are from different religions, cultures, and backgrounds.' Many have shied away from politics, and often sought support from within their extended family and religious networks for financial backing rather than turning to the banks. 'All the banks want is interest and charges,' says one Indian businessman. As a result they are far more closely associated with business than any other aspect of Kenyan society. 'They have set the moral tone for the government,' says one black Kenyan. The stereotypes can be overplayed. Yet the Asian community has certainly often proved the scapegoat at times of political crisis within Kenya. While escaping the severe persecution and mass flight that took place under Idi Amin in neighbouring Uganda during the 1970s, many remember tense periods. Asians point to the 'Africanisation' taking place at that time, when Asians  -particularly those without Kenyan passports - found it difficult to obtain licences and permits to trade. There was harassment of individuals, confiscation of property and Asian-controlled businesses were taken over. More significantly, they recall 1982, the time of the attempted coup, when there were reports of riots, looting of shops and rapes. It was this perception - as much as any real risk - that caused many families to send their women to relatives in Tanzania and elsewhere during the elections in 1992. 'We keep ourselves separate,' says an Indian Muslim. 'The Africans are a very different people. They have the intelligence but don't like taking the responsibility.'</p>

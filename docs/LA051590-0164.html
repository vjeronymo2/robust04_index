			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DAUGHTER TAKES KING'S PULPIT  </P> <P> More than 20 years after Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last sermon at  Ebenezer Baptist Church, one of his daughters stepped up to the same pulpit to  deliver her first as a minister.  </P> <P> In an emotional service Monday that drew more than 300 people, Bernice  Albertine King, 27, became the second woman ordained at the historic church.  </P> <P> Bernice King, the youngest of King's four children and the only one to go into  the ministry, also graduated Monday from Emory University with doctoral degrees  in law and divinity.  </P> <P> "This is the most humbling moment for me in my life," King said. "I am not  worthy of this high calling. No blood, no sweat, no tears could earn me this  high calling."  </P></p>

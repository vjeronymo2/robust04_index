			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RYAN WHITE'S BATTLE AGAINST IGNORANCE, AIDS  </P> <P> The life struggle and death of Ryan White inspires everyone, touches everyone  and silences one and all with respect. He is a genuine hero.  </P> <P> My comments are directed to the multitude of sad-eyed newscasters and  hypocritical politicians who made such a point of mourning this particular  victim of AIDS. I am appalled by the double standard of compassion exhibited by  the public. No, Ryan White never "deserved" what he got and he fought  valiantly. Remember, however, he is one of the hundreds of thousands who have  gone "quickly into the night." Many victims of AIDS have had to keep their  affliction a secret. Inevitably, they lost their jobs, their homes and most  died without family near them.  </P> <P> How dare you, Joe Public, cry for only Ryan White! He was safe to mourn! Mourn  for those dying daily, their deaths hastened by cancelled insurance,  exorbitant, unreachable black-market drug prices and a federal policy that  ignored the existence of AIDS because it was considered a "homosexual" disease.  </P> <P> We need a federal policy cognizant and sympathetic to the realities of testing  HIV positive. And we all need to let the compassion and spirit that brings us  together to mourn the passing of Ryan White open our eyes and hearts to the  harsh reality of dying going on around us daily.  </P> <P> FRANCES J.

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: SETTING SAIL FOR POLYNESIA  </P> <P> In Tahiti there is a law -- or at least an enforced tradition -- that hotels  should not be higher than a palm tree. I thought of that when the gleaming  sails of the Wind Song unfurled silently as we left Papeete harbor.  </P> <P> We were not a hotel, of course, but certainly more than a yacht. And those  square-rigged sails, on masts reaching 204 feet above the waterline, were not  only higher than a palm tree but higher than the tops of some cruise vessels  sometimes sighted in these South Pacific waters.  </P> <P> From the volcanic hills of Huahine to churchyards on Raiatea, the tall masts  were the landmark I used to find my way back to the dock after a ramble on  shore.  </P> <P> I had not visited French Polynesia in several years, and always before by air.  Approaching from the sea stirs up wild visions; lagoons slowly grow more blue,  reefs more fearsome, mountains more craggy. Natural ridges and ramparts  resemble the man-made fortresses of medieval Europe -- of Carcassonne or San  Marino.  </P> <P> Islanders who gather for the Wind Song's weekly call claim that the approaching  ship creates equally entrancing illusions: its size and a silhouette changing  under rain showers, or sunsets or a full moon.  </P> <P> I peered from the porthole of my cabin as we tied up on Raiatea. Schoolgirls  with ponytails were jumping a long rope and chanting the cadence. Barefoot boys  were pushing hoops along the pier. And, straight ahead, the town square was  curtained in bright cotton: the blues and greens, the reds and golds of native  pareus.  </P> <P> The pareu is an eminently useful garment, the boldly printed sarong of  Polynesia, which also serves as a loincloth for men. It is a piece of cloth  about four feet by six that can be used as a curtain, a tablecloth, a stole or  a tied-at-the-waist cover-up for a swimsuit. A pareu also makes a dandy duffel  bag.  </P> <P> A group of children from Raiatea were coming on board to sing and dance for us  that evening. They arrived at the gangway with their crowns and costumes  wrapped in pareus, which were tied at either end like bulging bananas, and  slung over bare shoulders. Small drums also were carried in the sturdy cotton  slings.  </P> <P> Before the show we strolled the streets, buying diet sodas and a French  newspaper at the Magasin Yee Foo. We exchanged dollars at the air-conditioned  Banque de Polynesie, where the lone teller told us that the rate had improved  since we left Tahiti and that the spiky pink blossoms we had admired in the  Papeete marketplace are called opuhi.  </P> <P>  The teller, who had a bouquet of opuhi near her calculator, printed the name  on a deposit slip.  </P> <P> The whole town smelled of cotton candy. We sniffed at the sweet evening breeze  and realized that it was the heady scent of vanilla beans, which grow here in  profusion.  </P> <P> At sea, amid the simple pleasures of these islands, the Wind Song performs as a  computer-controlled marvel; courses can be altered, sails furled and unfurled  from a sleek bridge of flashing screens and panels.  </P> <P> But there are officers on that bridge to do what a computer cannot: answer  passengers' questions.  </P> <P> "How much draft do we need?" a Floridian asked as we pulled up anchor in the  clear waters of Moorea's Cook's Bay.  </P> <P> "About 13 feet," replied Dag Dvergastein, the Norwegian captain who seems  taller than a palm tree.  </P> <P> "But it says 42 feet on the side of the ship," protested the Floridian.  </P> <P> The captain smiled.  </P> <P> "That's 4.2 meters," he said. "Only you Americans measure everything in feet."  </P> <P> On the afternoon we left the lagoon of Bora Bora the breeze picked up and the  captain set a southerly course. We were humming along at nine knots, savoring  the odd, homey creak of a yacht.  </P> <P> "I love it," a woman called as she leaned from the railing. "I wish we could go  on like this forever."  </P> <P> "But we cannot," said the captain. "Pretty soon we must bring in the sails and  turn on the engines to go to the east. If we kept on this course we would go to  Cape Horn."  </P> <P> Having been through the tumultuous waters off Cape Horn, I was content to have  him turn on the power and continue our glide through the gentle seas of  Polynesia.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (CNS) -- With the promulgation of  the Provisional Regulations on Management over Settlement, Sales  and Payment of Foreign Exchange worked out by the People's Bank  of China, the Shanghai foreign exchange trading centre went  operation on April 4, indicating reform of the foreign exchange  management system in the country was proceeding at a profound  level.    The centre's headquarters is located in Shanghai with its  trading business already connected with those in Beijing,  Tianjin, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Chengdu and Xiamen and by the end  of June this year, such business will expand to 18 main cities  in the country. The centre is a non-profit-making organ,  practicing a membership system with its members coming from  banks entitled to do foreign exchange business, some non-bank  financial institutions and some foreign- funded banks. They can  make their deals both at the Shanghai centre and at other  cities' exchanges. Its trading at present is only available for  U.S. dollars and HK [Hong Kong] dollars and its opening hours  are from 9:00 to 11:00 am from Monday to Friday each week. The  People's Bank of China will, when necessary, intervene in the  foreign exchange market in order to regulate the supply and  demand of such currencies and push down trading prices.    In the first three days after the centre went into  operation,  trading prices saw little fluctuation and the trading business  there was booming. On April 6, trading of U.S. dollars against  renminbi was basically kept at between 8.69 and 8.70 with the  daily total transaction value put at over U.S.$100 million while  trading between the HK dollar and the renminbi was maintained at  between 1.12 and 1.3 with a daily total transaction value of  HK$10.35 million.</p>

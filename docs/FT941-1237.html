			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (7): Perkins, Cummins take off the gloves - US engine makers' British subsidiaries use contrasting tactics in their contest for sales of the smaller range of diesel power packages / Diesel Engine Wars We are happy to show anyone interested in seeing world class manufacturing around our plant,' says Mr Tony Gilroy, chief executive of Perkins, the Peterborough-based diesel engine producer. 'Except Cummins of course,' he adds with a grin. The feeling is mutual some 160 miles north at the Cummins engine plant in Darlington, which Mr Denis Welch, plant manager, believes can show competitors a thing or two. The two plants are the biggest producers of diesel engines in the UK, and compete directly at the smaller end of the market. Each plays a vital role in the worldwide competitive battle that pits Indiana-based Cummins Engine and US-owned Perkins against each other and a handful of other big US, European and Japanese producers. The history, appearance and size of the plants is very different - the Perkins plant opened in 1947, so looks older and still employs 2,750 overall. At Darlington, Cummins only began manufacturing in 1965 and at its peak employed 3,100 people. It now employs 650, of which 500 are involved in UK manufacturing. But there is one striking similarity: although the starting points may have been different, both plants have been through considerable upheaval over the past three to four years. In particular, there has been a fundamental cultural change based on teamwork and 'empowerment' which encourages the workforce to think for themselves and make suggestions. 'People are paid to improve the business, not just perform to the status quo,' says Mr Welch. At both companies, the concept of 'customer-led quality' has been adopted with enthusiasm - and an acceptance that competitive pressures in the industry make the need for continuous improvement imperative. The transformation of the two plants leads observers to conclude that UK diesel engine manufacturing is in pretty good shape. 'It's alive and kicking,' says Mr Allan Rawnsley, an industry consultant. 'It's significant that Cummins has made the UK a major base while Perkins, with its roots in the UK, has built on local strengths.' The achievements of the industry are all the more remarkable because of the complexity of diesel engine production. At Peterborough, Perkins has more than 13,000 part numbers and at any time 8,000 part numbers will be going through the production system, says Mr Miles Coleman, general manager for manufacturing at the main Perkins Engines (Peterborough) business unit. It is mass production, but flexibility has to be built-in too. Perkins produces 720 engines a day at Peterborough with an average batch size of five, says Mr Gilroy. At Darlington, meanwhile, there are 1,600 'live' engine specifications and 200 specification alterations a month, says Mr Dave Womersley, manufacturing manager. In 1986, the plant only handled 84 specifications, showing how customers' demands have changed. Production levels also vary widely, requiring action to ensure plants stay profitable at lower capacity usage levels. Cummins is producing 105 engines a day now, but Mr Welch cannot remember a quarter where production has not varied by less than 15 per cent from the previous three months. At Cummins, what Mr Welch calls the 'major vehicle for change' has been the so-called Cummins Production System, a system of improved material flow through the factory which aims to reduce manufacturing lead times by shortening production routes and to eliminate waste through Japanese-style Kaizen or continuous improvement methods. 'Continuous improvement beats postponed perfection,' says Welch. The system uses five guiding principles which are translated into 10 practices to help improve performance. They are: 'the customer comes first' 'quality in everything we do' 'people make the difference' 'education and training are the foundation for improvement,' and 'we are in it for the long haul'. In production terms, the specific aim was to iron out bottle necks which were restricting output to nine or 10 engines an hour. 'We said, 'what do we have to achieve to get production up to 16 an hour?'' says Mr Welch. The system has reduced the average throughput time from 4.5 days to three days since 1986, and Mr Womersley is looking for a further 30 per cent improvement over the next 18 months. The 16-engine-an-hour target has been achieved, and installed capacity has been improved from 40,000 engines a year to 56,000. Darlington is essentially an assembly plant but Peterborough has historically done a great deal of its own machining. About five years ago, however, it decided only to make internally what it could do better than outside suppliers. The result, says Mr Gilroy, was the sale of all manufacturing of parts such as flywheels and manifolds, which are still produced in Peterborough by Precision Components, a Triplex Lloyd unit. Perkins still machines basic parts such as engine blocks and cylinder heads. This was followed in 1991 by a major total quality initiative. That was a relatively late move into TQ by international standards, but, as Mr Rawnsley comments, Perkins have grasped the nettle. An external investigation by Quest consultants had established a year earlier that, by world class standards, Perkins was suffering from poor product and service quality, and Mr Gilroy was determined to change that. The programme has three interlocking elements - 'customer led,' 'continuous improvement' and 'involvement and culture change'. Each began with a set of goals, followed by a number of key steps for achieving them. The 'customer-led' element, for example, had three goals; to anticipate customer needs by knowing its business, to be seen to add value to customers' business, and to be first choice in diesel selection. Using approaches such as setting joint improvement plans with customers and distributors and fixing aggressive targets for improving performance, achievements have included reducing engine lead times from 12 to two weeks for major customers. Delivery reliability has also been increased. Some elements of the changes on the factory floors at both plants are similar. Both companies have, where appropriate, adopted line-side storage to give individual teams a highly-visible means of controlling their stocks. Cellular manufacturing, with its inherent flexibility and multiskilling, has also been introduced where possible. At Cummins, reorganisation of cylinder head sub-assembly has reduced floor space by nearly 40 per cent, cut throughput time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes and halved employment from four to two. A larger section at Perkins for the assembly of engine blocks has seen employment fall from 17 to 14, while quality and productivity have been enhanced through a computer-based system that shows workers which parts to use and makes it easier to cope with mixed production runs. Cummins also uses error-proofing techniques to ensure flexibility is not compromised by lapses in assembly. Significantly, both companies say that no worker will lose his or her job because of the improvement programmes - although there may be other reasons such as market conditions. This is a vital pledge. Not only does it help smooth the path to improvement in heavily unionised environments, it could also be one reason why the workers at both plants are willing to make suggestions for improvements. Both companies have spent heavily on training as part of the cultural change programmes, in an effort to maximise employee involvement in the business and, as Mr Gilroy puts it, to 'change attitudes so that workers can feel they are making a contribution to the business'. Highly public, incentivised methods are used to recognise quality and other improvements, through everything from noticeboards to medals, and special events. By training to achieve true teamwork, the pay-off comes from suggestions made by the teams, who are often in the best position to make them anyway. At Cummins, workers on the oil cooler assembly section worked out a simple, pc-driven system to identify the right parts for each different unit. The parts, which until recently were piled in a heap, have been sorted out on racks to reduce errors and improve stock rotation. There have been many such 'low-cost or no-cost' improvements, says Mr Womersley. At Perkins, says Mr Coleman, 'we are encouraging and tapping into people's suggestions'. An example was a suggestion last year from a TQ team for barcoding to be used on engines, replacing an often difficult to read sticky tape. Another example quoted proudly by Mr Gilroy involved a shopfloor worker drawing up a 'process map' for engine production that covered an entire table. This was the basis for a successful initiative simplifying the map. As for results, sales per employee have risen dramatically. At the Cummins plant they have leapt from Dollars 65,000 in 1986 to Dollars 408,000 last year. At Perkins, for the same period over the company as a whole sales per employee rose from Dollars 77,000 to Dollars 185,000 at Perkins. And neither company is resting on its laurels.</p>

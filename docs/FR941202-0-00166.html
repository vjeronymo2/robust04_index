			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several aviculturists commented that the approved list of captive-bred species should include species where captive breeding of the species is needed to conserve the species. The Service recognizes the contribution that captive breeding may make to the conservation of some species, but the statute does not instruct the Secretary to list a species on the approved list of captive-bred species using such criteria. If an ex-situ captive-breeding program is needed for a species' conservation, wild-caught or captive-bred birds may be imported from approved overseas breeding facilities, from countries with approved management plans, and for scientific research, zoological breeding, and approved cooperative breeding programs under WBCA permits available from the Service. The Service notes that cooperative breeding programs encourage such conservation efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several aviculturists commented that the approved list of captive-bred species would cause a loss of genetic diversity in captive populations of birds in the U.S. and restrict access to new bloodlines for a species' conservation. The Service disagrees and notes that birds which are not on the approved list of captive-bred species may still be imported into the U.S. under the WBCA in several other ways: from approved overseas breeding facilities, from countries with approved management plans, and for scientific research, zoological breeding, and approved cooperative breeding programs. Congress included the exemptions for zoological breeding and cooperative breeding programs for just this purpose. The Service notes that it is not the intent of approval of captive-bred species to enhance conservation of a species, but rather to facilitate imports of specimens that in no way impact wild populations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous aviculturists (including 2318 represented by form letters), a representative of the pet industry, avicultural groups, and several importers commented that any species that is regularly captive-bred, and that is prohibited from export for the pet trade by its country of origin, should be listed on the approved list of captive-bred species (regardless of enforcement concerns). For example, they recommend that all species which are regularly bred in captivity and are indigenous solely to Australia, a country from which there is no legal avian trade in wild-caught birds, should be listed on the approved list of captive-bred species. The Service disagrees. There remain problems in adequate regulatory and enforcement mechanisms in many countries of origin for species which are subject to illegal trade. Adoption of this recommendation would lead to the logically absurd conclusion to list all indigenous parrots of Mexico on the approved list of captive-bred species because Mexico bans their export. Since there exists a flourishing domestic trade in wild-caught parrots in Mexico and their subsequent illegal export to the U.S., such inclusion on the approved list would undermine species conservation, as well as Mexico's enforcement efforts. We cannot adopt this recommendation, which is counter to the purpose of the statute and the intent of Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

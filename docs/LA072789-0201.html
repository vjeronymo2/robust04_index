			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON ;  </P> <P> PAIR OF LAWNDALE ANGLERS TRICK BLUE SHARK AND RESCUE THEIR BIG HALIBUT  </P> <P> James Scott and Steve Larkin of Lawndale were drifting for halibut 500 yards  off Point Dume in their boat the Ghetto Queen when Scott hooked a 23 1/2-pound  flat fish on 15-pound test line with cut squid. As he reeled in his catch,  several blue sharks appeared near the boat.  </P> <P> Larkin cast a baited line to keep the sharks off Scott's catch. One blue bit  the hook and took off, peeling 100 yards of line.  </P> <P> Scott brought his halibut to the surface and had a net in hand when one of the  sharks bit off the tail of the catch while taking the line to the bottom. But  Scott brought the halibut back to the surface and into the net ahead of another  hungry shark.  </P> <P> Larkin, meanwhile, battled the blue on his line. After 17 minutes he raised the  shark to the surface. Scott stood ready with a gaff, but the catch snapped the  line just before surfacing. The blue escaped, just another big one that got  away.  </P> <P> They estimate that the hooked blue weighed about 80 pounds.  </P> <P> John Darro of the Torrance Rod and Reel Club returned last week from a halibut  trip to Homer, Alaska, where he won a 25-minute battle with a 76-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Russ and Edna Trager of the King Harbor Marlin Club had an unusual double hook  that lasted 35 minutes in Cabo San Lucas, Baja California. Russ landed a  120-pound marlin and Edna brought in a 115-pound catch.  </P> <P> Don Haynes, a member of the same club left Redondo Pier aboard his boat the  Fisherette and returned with a 63-pound thresher shark caught on cut mackerel.  </P> <P> Walter Lehman of San Gabriel, fishing on The Victory, won the jackpot with a  19-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> The Venice Anglers Club holds its third annual shark derby Saturday and Sunday.

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Observer: Hard cheese No such thing as ageism at the top of Swiss companies. Fritz Gerber, chairman of both pharma group Roche and Zurich Insurance, and who is 65, has just told Weltwoche magazine that he has no intention of retiring. 'I will go on working as long as I feel I am able to fulfil my task,' he announced. The heads of Switzerland's other big pharmaceutical groups are almost equally good, if not better, advertisements for their drugs. Alex Krauer, boss of Ciba, is a mere 63, but Marc Moret continues to dominate Sandoz at 70. And financiers and industrialists are clearly pretty good customers of the above. Nestle boss Helmut Maucher is nudging 67, Credit Suisse's Rainer Gut is nearly 62 and Peter Spalti, Winterthur Insurance boss, is a sprightly 63. 'I hope I will be able to recognise when it is time to step down,' Gerber said gracefully in his interview. Providing he does, who would complain?</p>

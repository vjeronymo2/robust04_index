			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: CYCLING THROUGH HOLLAND WITH A BARGE IN TOW  </P> <P> This country is ideal for cyclists. Not only is it possible to pedal alongside  the canals but your hotel can meet you at a different point each evening.  </P> <P> Two years ago a Dutch company, Cycletours, introduced moderately priced tours  that combined bicycling with canal boat accommodations. It's been so successful  that a second route is being introduced this year.  </P> <P> About 11 million of the Netherlands' 14 million people are cyclists and, as  taxpayers, have supported a 6,200-mile network of bike paths and lanes that  crisscross the country.  </P> <P> With Cycletours, bicyclists cover 20 to 30 miles a day, either with the group  and guide or at their own pace, following a specific set of route instructions.  </P> <P> The lodging, aboard a converted 108-foot canal barge, sails through the canals  and meets the riders each evening. Cyclists, when they choose, can take breaks  during the seven-day trip and relax on board.  </P> <P> Barges have a galley, a large dining/lounge area and two showers. They sleep up  to 24 passengers in two- and four-berth cabins.  </P> <P> Individuals who book into four-berth cabins are charged 695 guilders (about  $390 U.S.) a week. A twin cabin is 795 guilders (about $447 U.S.) per person a  week. Rates include bikes, breakfasts, dinners and self-packed lunches.  </P> <P> The seven-night Cycletours programs leave Amsterdam each Saturday until  mid-September. You'll find its office at Keizersgracht 181 in Amsterdam.  </P> <P> The Netherlands is also well-suited to the "do-it-yourself" cycle tourist.  Rental bikes are available at more than 100 rail stations throughout the  country at an average rate of $4 a day or $15 a week.  </P> <P> If you want to get away from Amsterdam for the day, join Ena's Bike Tours.  Daily departure during the summer is at 10 a.m. from Amstel rail station.  </P> <P> Guided groups visit a working windmill, a cheese-making farm and take a boat  ride. The $21 fee includes use of a bike. And take along a bathing suit for  swimming.  </P> <P> A new company, Yellow Bike Guided Tours, also is offering bike programs.  </P> <P> Several times a day, starting at 9 a.m., it conducts a 3 1/2-hour guided,  historic, city cycling tour, departing from Beurs van Berlage, Damrak 247. Cost  is $14.  </P> <P> But don't try Amsterdam by bike right after an overseas flight. Get over jet  lag first. Also, watch out for vehicles. Although most Dutch drivers respect  the cyclists, it's the other drivers who contribute to the confusion.  </P> <P> If you prefer to cycle away from the city, join a 6 1/2-hour Waterland Tour  that goes 19 miles north through a nature reserve to a windmill, a  cheese-making farm and a wooden shoe factory.  </P> <P> The end is at Marken, famous for its colorful wooden houses and residents in  traditional Dutch costumes. Participants return to Amsterdam by bus.  </P> <P> Cost is $22. The tour departs at 8:30 a.m. from Beurs van Berlage, or at noon  from the Tourist Information Office at Amsterdam's Central Station.  </P> <P> More information, such as route suggestions, package tours, cycling events,  traffic rules, accommodations, maps and detail on transporting bicycles is  covered in the publication "Cycling In Holland."

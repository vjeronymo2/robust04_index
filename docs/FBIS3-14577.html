The  first goal of the Majles in cutting expenses is to reform the  government's administrative and financial structure.    The above was announced yesterday in an interview with  RESALAT'S parliamentary correspondent by Engineer Hashem  Rahbari, deputy from Tehran and member of the Majles Plan and  Budget Commission.    He said: The Plan and Budget Commission believes that the  administrative organizations can be managed in a more limited  form than the present one and that this amount of cost is not  needed for the nation's administrative organizations. If the  price of foreign exchange is going to rise on the one hand and  on the other hand the organizations are going to expand, no kind  of structural reform will take place.    Continuing, he added: To cut unnecessary government  expenses,  the Majles has made a policy that strict economy will be  observed in the purchase of buildings, land, automobiles, and in  changing decorations and carpets, and this is the will of the  Majles. On the one hand, in view of outstanding foreign  commitments, to establish a positive direction, 50 percent of  the cuts made in the government's proposed budget, in the event  that additional revenues are obtained, will be used to pay  commitments, which will protect the nation's credit.    Continuing this interview, Engineer Rahbari said: It is the  Plan and Budget Commission's view that the finished costs of  goods and services announced by the government are not that  high, and that by adopting certain measures the finished costs  can be reduced.    He added: In view of the presence of concerned specialists  and existing resources, more reliance can be placed on domestic  construction, and the finished cost can be reduced by reforming  procedures, economizing, and creating more efficiency,  productivity, and profitability, in order to make the pressure  on the consumer just and logical. Because this measure is in the  interest of the people, they will accept it. For this reason,  all the price increases proposed by the government were not  accepted by the Majles.    The Plan and Budget Commission member emphasized the fact  that the Majles places great importance on solving the economic  problems of the people. He added: To achieve this goal, the  Majles increased the subsidies on some goods needed by the  people. The amount of subsidies for drugs was increased from the  government's proposed $330 million to $400 million, the  subsidies for basic goods were increased from $695 million to  $800 million, 220 billion-rials[R] credit was approved for  education and training and R70 billion was approved for student  scholarships and food.    He then discussed the credits allocated for the deprived  areas. He said: The Majles added R50 billion to the credits for  this sector. Credits were approved to provide water service in  1,000 villages. The government proposed to provide electrical  power to 500 villages, and the Majles increased this to 1,500  villages. In addition, the Majles has provided for the expansion  of electrical power in 300 cases. Likewise, the Majles has made  provisions in next year's budget to install telephones in 500  villages. He noted that to expand gas delivery service, the  Majles allocated R100 billion for the year 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995].    He emphasized: While the Majles has set out to economize, it  is moving in the direction of implementing social justice.</p>

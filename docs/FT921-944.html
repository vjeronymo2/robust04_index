			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: US-style minimum tax rule considered LABOUR is still considering introducing a US-style 'minimum tax' rule for those on the highest incomes, Mr Neil Kinnock indicates today. Such a rule - designed to prevent the highest-paid cutting tax bills by extensive use of allowances and tax avoidance - was suggested in last year's policy document 'Opportunity Britain'. The document said that a Labour government would ensure that the 'richest' could not reduce their tax bills to below the level paid by ordinary people 'either by setting a cash limit to the total reliefs which can be paid or adopting the US policy of a 'minimum tax' for those on top incomes'. There is no mention of this idea in the party's manifesto but in an interview in The Times published today Mr Kinnock revives the possibility. He said that if people on 'exotically' high incomes were 'paying less of a fair share than people on more generally normal incomes, it would be a case for introducing the American system of guaranteed basic liability'. He added, however, that the suggestion was not a 'policy promise'.</p>

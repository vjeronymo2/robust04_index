			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHLORINE FUMES AT SWIM MEET INJURE 12  </P> <P> Two children were hospitalized and 10 other people were treated for inhalation  of chlorine fumes after a pipe burst during a swim meet Saturday at El Toro  High School.  </P> <P> The unseen but smelly chlorine fumes sent the 450 swimmers and about 1,000  spectators into the parking lot while police and county firefighters sealed off  the area, rerouting traffic away from Serrano Road.  </P> <P> Justin Urban, 8, of Mission Viejo and an unidentified child were treated at  Saddleback Community Hospital and released. The children complained of chest  pains, upset stomach and itchy eyes, said County Fire Department Battalion  Chief Jerold Hunter, who directed the response team.  </P> <P> Jackie Blacketer, 37, of Anaheim, who had been beside the pool timing her  16-year-old son Brian's race when the leak occurred, said she smelled chlorine  and then coughed and "felt sick to my stomach. My eyes were burning."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Evacuation Went Smoothly  </P> <P> Merritt Julson, 45, of El Toro, a swim meet coordinator, said the evacuation  was done "very smoothly, with no panic."  </P> <P> "These people are swim people and they understand chlorine; you don't screw  around with chlorine," Julson said.  </P> <P> Mark Brill, 20, a pool maintenance employee, said he had noticed water flowing  under the door of the chlorine room. When he opened the door, he said, he saw  "a big leak" in a chlorine pipe. He was unable to contain the leak before  firefighters arrived and shut off the flow.  </P> <P> The pipe contains a highly concentrated mixture of chlorine and water that is  automatically monitored and fed to the pool.  </P> <P> Another swim meet official, Stan Reaves, 41, of El Toro, said he was carrying  his 7-year-old daughter, who had just competed in the meet, toward the corner  of the pool where the chlorine system is stored when "we got nailed" by a heavy  whiff of chlorine.  </P> <P> "Everybody picked up on it real fast and moved on it," he said.  </P> <P> Announcers for the meet used the public address system to order an evacuation,  which already had begun. Meet secretaries dialed 911 and the County Fire  Department dispatched a hazardous-waste unit, two fire engines and a paramedic  team.  </P> <P> "None of the injuries seemed serious," Hunter said. "In 15 or 20 minutes, it  (chlorine) should get out of their systems."  </P> <P> El Toro High School Principal Don Martin, who was in his office at the other  end of the campus when the pipe burst, said: "We just shut down the tank.  There's no danger now at all."  </P> <P> Swimmers and spectators streamed back into the pool area and, in just over an  hour, the invitational swim meet, sponsored by Saddleback Valley Aquatics, was  reopened.  </P></p>

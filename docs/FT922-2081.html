			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: End seen to Riva/Hugin dispute THE LONG-RUNNING saga of the Pounds 10m 'black hole' in the accounts of Hugin Sweda, the Anglo-Swedish retailing systems manufacturer acquired by Riva Group in 1989, may be close to a conclusion. It is believed that Riva is now anxious to agree Pounds 1m in settlement of its dispute with both the former executive directors of Hugin Sweda and with its own former advisers, Peat Marwick McLintock, the accountants. Peat Marwick said yesterday that negotiations were still continuing and refused to comment on the size of any possible settlement. The story has involved three years of sabre rattling but little action. At one stage Riva issued a writ claiming Pounds 15m damages against the Hugin Sweda directors and was planning to sue Peat Marwick, which resigned as Riva's auditors last year, for a similar sum. The dispute began when Riva, a Bolton-based manufacturer of electronic point-of-sale equipment, discovered unexpected liabilities of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m in the accounts of Hugin Sweda, which it had bought hoping to benefit from its European distribution network. It is thought that Riva is keen to settle now rather than continue with expensive and time-consuming litigation which might bring no substantial increase in the amount awarded. News of a possible settlement may bring some comfort to Riva's shareholders, who have otherwise little to cheer about. The company yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.2m in the year to end-December 1991 compared to a profit of Pounds 778,000 last time. Operational losses were comparatively low at Pounds 105,000, blamed on difficult trading conditions together with low levels of demand. The net cost of borrowings, however, totalled Pounds 1.95m and there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.15m made up of Pounds 365,000 costs associated with refinancing arrangements approved last month and restructuring costs of Pounds 789,000. Turnover fell 13 per cent to Pounds 57.3m (Pounds 65.9m), partly as a consequence of strategic withdrawal from unprofitable market segments. Losses per share amounted to 12.3p (2.4p earnings). There is no dividend. The directors said the resumption of dividend payments could only be envisaged once the group returned to profitability and reduced bank borrowings significantly.</p>

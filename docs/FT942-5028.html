			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 3: Carlsberg sees China as top market - The global reach of a brewer that (probably) exports more than 80 per cent of its output Anyone who believes Danish business is parochial should look carefully at Carlsberg. Around the world, brewing is for the most part a parochial business: perhaps unsurprisingly, since a product consisting almost wholly of water is expensive to ship. Carlsberg, however, sells less than 20 per cent of its beer in its home market. With the exception of Heineken of Holland - which Carlsberg sees as its main rival - no other big brewer has the same international reach. In theory, at least, this is a very enviable position to be in. Rather like the tobacco industry, brewing in the western world has seen its prospects transformed in recent years by the opening up of vast new markets in China and eastern Europe. Unlike the tobacco companies, most of the world's big brewers are scarcely equipped to take advantage of the fact. Carlsberg, by contrast, has been outward looking since its beginnings, if only because the smallness of its home market forced it to be. Founded in 1847, it first shipped beer to England in 1860. By the turn of the century, as Carlsberg executives will tell you today, it was putting up advertising posters in China. The attraction of China is no less powerful today. 'By the turn of the century,' says Mr Michael Iuul, Carlsberg's head of international operations, 'China will probably be the biggest (beer) market in the world: bigger than the US.' At present, he puts the Chinese market at 70-80m barrels a year. His forecast is for 130m barrels or more. As with tobacco, the overseas share of that market is still minute, if only because foreign beer is so much more expensive than the local brands. But Carlsberg has breweries in both Hong Kong and mainland China, and its subsidiary Danbrew - a specialist in building breweries in the developing world - has built 10 breweries for Chinese customers to date. Even so, Carlsberg is not currently the leading foreign brand in China. That position, it concedes, probably belongs to San Miguel of the Philippines - though, Mr Iuul says, 'there is very little information available.' Besides China, Carlsberg has big breweries in Vietnam and Thailand, and has spent the past five years trying to develop its business in Russia. Its chief advantage lies in its strength as an international brand: and in this respect, Mr Iuul says, its competition is 'Heineken again and again'. The big US brewers, owners of such domestically dominant brands as Budweiser and Miller, seem to have made little impact so far. However, given the record of US global brands Marlboro and Coca-Cola, it would be unwise to assume this state of affairs will last for ever. As Mr Iuul remarks of the US brewers, 'they certainly have the financial muscle'. To an extent, all this depends on how far brands manage to establish themselves as a global force in brewing, as they have in spirits or soft drinks. 'In some mature markets,' Mr Iuul says, 'you are getting cheap own-label products moving in. But in growing markets, you have a lot of people with social aspirations. And when it comes to beer, most of the (international) brands reflect higher quality as well.' But however global the future may prove, Carlsberg's immediate outlook is dominated by Europe, where it still sells around 85 per cent of its volume. This might suggest a kind of race between a big declining European business and a small but fast-growing overseas one. Mr Iuul does not accept this. 'The market is not losing ground in some of the traditional wine-growing Mediterranean countries,' he says. 'Germany is a battlefield, and the UK and France have certainly had difficult years during the recession. Over the next few years, I see Europe as stagnant, but not declining.' The UK market, however, is of central importance to Carls- berg's fortunes in the near term. In 1992, it put its UK operations into a 50-50 joint venture with Allied-Lyons, the UK brewer. The venture, known as Carlsberg Tetley, is one of the biggest brewers in the UK and, according to out- side estimates, Carlsberg's half share contributes close to half the group's worldwide profits. This makes it all the more important that the two part- ners should see eye to eye. Allied recently went out of its way to reaffirm its com- mitment to the venture. But in the longer term, its ambitions are in the global business of wines and spirits, not the domestic business of UK beer. Carlsberg, Allied hints, is in the long run the more natural owner of the business. Mr Iuul shrugs this off. 'I don't know', he says. 'You can have a married couple where one says 'I want a divorce' and the other still sees the marriage as happy. We are quite happy with the partnership. It had its problems at the outset, but any merger has. And Allied say they are committed and confident.' That apart, the European market is far from stable. 'There will be a shake-out in Europe,' Mr Iuul says. 'There is strong price competition in many markets, which will lead to a shake-out in production costs. Competition has also been promoted by concentration in the retail sector. A 'cheapie' sector has established itself and gained some volume, and it won't go away.' Similarly, he argues, the UK market is in transition. 'There is no doubt that brewing in the UK has to be rationalised. The cost per barrel being produced is in many cases higher than on the Continent. With further harmonisation of beer duty, the costs have to come closer together.' The obvious question is how far Carlsberg wants to play a part in that process. Suppose that, as some believe, the UK market - probably the most important to Carlsberg in the world - is doomed ultimately to end up a brewing duopoly along American or Australian lines. Does Carlsberg want to be a player? Mr Iuul does not answer the question directly. The duopoly hypothesis, he says, is a long way off. 'In general terms, we like to spread our risk. But the UK market is one we feel comfortable with. We've been there a long time. When you go into a country like Vietnam, your knowledge of local conditions is bound to be more superficial.' To venture a paraphrase: Carlsberg is looking to a brave new world, but it cannot afford to turn its back on the old world either.</p>

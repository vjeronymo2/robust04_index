			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Surprise and relief follows failed bid - Michael Skapinker on reaction to Airtours' unsuccessful offer for Owners Abroad AFTER YEARS of dealing with upheavals ranging from hurricanes to corporate collapse, the holiday business should have learned to shrug off surprises. Many in the industry have, however, observed Airtours' proposed takeover of Owners Abroad, which finally failed last Tuesday, with a mixture of wonder and dread. The wonder was that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last month casually shrugged aside the Office of Fair Trading's recommendation that the bid be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Many were surprised, too, at the market's rejection of a bid that was widely expected to succeed. The dread was that Airtours' success might lead to a price war with Thomson, the market leader, which could have ruined smaller companies. Many were apprehensive, too, that Thomson and the enlarged Airtours would have used their own travel agents, Lunn Poly and Pickfords Travel, to exclude small operators and agencies from the market. Some believe Airtours' failure means that life will return to what it was before. Mr Paul Brett, chairman of the Thomson Travel Group, the parent company of Thomson Tour Operations, Lunn Poly and Britannia Airways, said: 'They tried something, they failed, it's back to square one.' Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators and an outspoken opponent of the takeover, said: 'Hopefully, this will now mean stability for all of us.' Others argue that factors ranging from high unemployment to a devalued pound mean that the travel business has changed anyway and that medium-sized and smaller companies will find it difficult to compete. The three leading companies have all made it clear that they will not be loosening their grip on the industry. Mr David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, said yesterday that he was now examining other options. He would not be drawn on what they were, but competitors believe they could include a rapid expansion of Pickfords or the purchase of a medium-sized tour operator. Either option would give Airtours greater control of the market and increase the pressure on smaller competitors. Mr Roger Allard, Owners Abroad managing director, accepted that his group was now under greater pressure than before. He said: 'We'll take on board what the City and institutions have said to us. We have to deliver the right profits for our shareholders.' Mr Brett reaffirmed Thomson's determination to continue to be the biggest tour operator, travel agent and charter airline operator. He said Lunn Poly opened 68 new outlets last year, bringing the total to 578, and would add another 100 this year. Few expect the market to grow significantly this year, despite widespread discounting and television advertising earlier in the year. Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, Lunn Poly's marketing director, said sales of summer 1993 holidays rose 10 per cent in January compared with last year, but then fell 5 per cent in February. 'On the most optimistic view, the summer market is flat,' he said. Although lower interest rates usually result in a rise in bookings, Mr Chris Parker, chairman of Unijet Travel, a medium-sized tour operator, said customers were postponing their holiday decisions because of fear of unemployment. Late booking, a growing trend even before the rise in unemployment, is particularly damaging to small companies with less cash to cushion them. The drop in the value of the pound has also been easier for the large companies to bear because they buy all of their foreign currency forward, something many smaller companies cannot do. Mr Tim Cocking, president of the National Association of Independent Travel Agents, says that while he heaved a sigh of relief at Airtours' failure, the bid confirmed the trend towards vertical integration in the travel business. The Thomas Cook travel agency chain's decisive backing of Owners Abroad has convinced the industry of the genuine nature of the two companies' previously announced intention to establish closer links. Although there are still 5,000 independent travel agents, the large chains are able to command a market share out of all proportion to the number of outlets they control. Although Lunn Poly accounts for only 7 per cent of the total number of UK retail outlets, it has a 22 per cent share of the market for summer package holidays.</p>

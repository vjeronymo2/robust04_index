			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Wei-ming (7115 1792 0682): "Will China Change the </F> Method of Recovering Hong Kong?"]    [Text] Sources in Beijing said that after the Fifth  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress Standing  Committee late last year, a high-ranking Chinese official denied  that China's approach to the Hong Kong issue was "too right"  when he met with the committee members from the military. He  said that the Chinese Government had long prepared against the  possible disruptive and undermining actions by the British Hong  Kong authorities and had adopted corresponding countermeasures.    The official said: Britain unilaterally violated the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and flagrantly denied the  existence of agreements between the two governments. This fully  showed that Britain was not willing to return Hong Kong to China  and was still attempting to continue its colonial rule by  playing the political card, the economic card, and the  international card during the remaining three years. The  British Hong Kong authorities are fostering a batch of  pro-British people who oppose everything China advocates and  does, trying to make them Britain's future proxies in Hong Kong,  through whom Britain may continue to influence the future  special administrative region [SAR] government to resist  implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy and to  create political disputes. This is the crucial point of the  issue.    He added: When doing this, the British Hong Kong Government  made a totally wrong assessment of the situation. China's  determination to recover Hong Kong is firm. China will never  barter away its principles. We will rely on the vast number of  Hong Kong compatriots who love the motherland and love Hong Kong  and unite all forces that can be united, including foreigners  who want to seek development in Hong Kong, to jointly maintain  Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. The Chinese Government  will continue to adopt policies to maintain Hong Kong's  stability.    The sources also said that an authoritative person in  Beijing  law circles recently said that China may consider changing the  time and method of recovering Hong Kong if the following  situations occur:    First, Britain plans to change Hong Kong into an  international political city and a center of international  political disputes.    Second, Britain introduces other foreign forces to meddle in  Hong Kong's affairs, thus turning Hong Kong's affairs into  international affairs.    Third, Britain fosters a pro-Britain and anti-China  political  force to create trouble in Hong Kong and helps it enter the  local power structure.    Fourth, Britain encourages the pro-Britain and anti-China  political forces to disrupt order and create political incidents  in Hong Kong.    Fifth, Britain supports collaboration between the  pro-Britain  and anti-China force in Hong Kong and the international  anticommunist forces in creating political incidents in Hong  Kong.    Sixth, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities stir up  political turmoil in the late transitional period to oppose the  Chinese Government, oppose the Basic Law, and oppose the end of  colonial rule.    Seventh, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities  deliberately create financial and monetary disorder in Hong Kong    Eighth, in the late transitional period, if the Hong Kong  Government is paralyzed, while riots occur and the situation  goes out of control.    Ninth, if Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities  collude with Taiwan in turning Hong Kong into a self-governing  political entity or a semi-independent entity.</p>

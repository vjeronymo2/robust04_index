			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (1): Promises, promises - Nigeria's civilian-led transitional council needs the soldiers' backing if it is to implement the hard choices the Abuja recovery plan requires. As the country prepares for presidential elections, Africa Editor Michael Holman finds that deeds have yet to match words NIGERIA'S attempt to put its faltering economic reform programme back on track is in jeopardy. Without greater commitment on the part of the military government that stands behind the country's transitional civilian administration, the effort will fail, conceivably imperilling the transition to civilian rule due to conclude on August 27. Without such commitment, Nigeria's sceptical creditors will withhold assistance and the burden of a Dollars 29bn external debt will become intolerable. Deepening austerity will exacerbate existing religious and regional tensions, conceivably threatening the thrice-delayed transition to civilian rule. Once again, Nigeria has promised to mend its ways. Last December, an transitional council was mandated by President Ibrahim Babangida to restore economic discipline, plan for the future, and run the country until the winner of June's presidential elections formally takes over in August. This time the promise carried more weight. The council and its officials represent the acceptable, respectable face of Nigeria. The chairman, Chief Ernest Shonekan, is a distinguished and popular businessmen, assisted by some able colleagues with distinguished careers, and enjoying the backing of the private sector. But, as the halfway stage of the council's tenure approaches, it is in danger of being labelled the best goverment Nigeria never had. Nominally it is in charge. In reality, it is subservient to the soldiers who have run Nigeria since December 31, 1983. The council got off to an encouraging start. The 1993 budget, due to be delivered on January 1, was efficiently and imaginatively redrafted. What emerged three weeks later was a ringing reaffirmation of the necessity of reform, the virtues of the market economy, and the overriding need for prudent management. 'We must make some hard choices now to preserve the gains of the structural adustment programme and restore some good measure of stability to the economy,' Mr Shonekan warned the national assembly. It was followed not long after by an unprecedented gathering of business leaders, summoned to the capital, Abuja, for what was billed as Nigeria's first economic summit. In two days of straight talking, with President Ibrahim Babangida attending the opening session, the gravity of Nigeria's economic crisis was made clear. The reform programme launched in 1986 was in deep trouble. Among the most revealing indicators was the outcome of the 1992 budget: the forecast surplus of N2bn turned out as a deficit of N44.2bn. Money supply had increased by 49 per cent during the year, pushing inflation to 46 per cent. Exchange rate policy had in turn been undermined, and the naira was buckling. Foreign exchange reserves had fallen from Dollars 4.1bn in 1991 to around Dollars 1bn by the end of last year - barely two months import cover - partly because of Nigeria's costly involvement in the Liberian conflict. 'What we need now is a strong commitment to implementation, and to keep faith with the reform programme,' General Babangida told the summit. No one reminded the general that he had promised much the same a year earlier. A devaluation of the naira from 10.5 to 18 to the dollar had been accompanied by pledges of fiscal restraint, prudent monetary policies, public sector rationalisation, and curbs on state spending. The 1992 deficit speaks for itself. Despite the gloomy picture, delegates took heart from the prospect of a fresh start under a technocratic administration. Yet a very different mood prevailed at the follow-up session in Lagos last month. In the intervening period the council had fudged one critical hard choice, and blundered in an area in which it should have expertise. Exchange rate policy was in evident disarray, illustrated by a Central Bank decision to nullify the results of one of its foreign exchange auctions on the grounds that bids for the dollar were 'outrageously' high. Equally disturbing was the bank's decision to clamp down on open account and bills for collection trade, freezing more than Dollars 1bn in payments due to foreign suppliers. Payments for letters of credit were to be deferred until 90 days after the shipment of goods to Nigeria. Speaker after speaker criticised the council's performance: 'The Abuja dream has turned into a nightmare,' complained one industrialist. Although Mr Shonekan himself displays an indefatigable optimism, the enormity of the task is starting to weigh down some of his colleagues. 'The politicians are against us, the civil service is against us, the soldiers are against us,' concluded a weary senior official. The politicians do not want to be boxed in by economic reforms which they see as unpopular with the electorate, he explained. More important, he suspected that the members of the House of Representatives and Senate, elected last year, are wary of transparency and accountability which reduce opportunities for patronage. Similar concerns are shared by the poorly paid civil service. Among the military, few officers relish the prospect of civilian overseers. Nor is the electorate especially enthusiastic, seeing them as the lesser of two evils. 'The army has been politicised, and politics commercialised,' as one Nigerian puts it. The toughest choice facing the council, and central to economic reform is the need to raise domestic petrol prices. At N0.7 (three US cents) a litre, smuggling is rife (the pump price in neighbouring Benin is N9.7) and production costs are not covered. Lost revenue would nearly cover the 1992 budget deficit. Whatever the economic imperative behind a price rise, the political risk is enormous. The money would be 'chopped', say Nigerians - meaning it would end up in politicians' pockets - and trade union leaders and students have threatened to take to the streets. The decision to increase petrol charges has been taken in principle; whether it can be implemented remains to be seen. What adds to Mr Shonekan's difficulties is the fact that in the time available he has nothing tangible to offer Nigerians, who have had to endure a gruelling decade. Per capita income has fallen from Dollars 1,000 in 1980 to under Dollars 300. The naira, once worth more than a dollar, is worth less than a nickel, and weakening. External debt has grown by 50 per cent in spite of commercial debt buy-backs and conversion. Not surprisingly, while creditors and donors offer Mr Shonekan moral support, they demand a track record before delivering the carrot - part write-off, part soft-term rescheduling of Paris Club debt. An essential precondition to rescheduling is an IMF agreement. Most observers rule it out in the time available. Even if it were possible, would it last? The incoming government cannot be tied into an agreement it did not negotiate. And judging by their comments at the hustings, neither Mr Bashir Tofa nor Mr Moshood Abiola, the presidential candidates of the National Republican Convention (NRC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) respectively, seems prepared to pledge continuity in economic reform. Time is running out on what seasoned observers believe is Nigeria's last best chance of securing an economic recovery. As one concerned Nigerian put it: 'If not Shonekan, who? If not now, when?' But it is General Babangida who ultimately has to make the hard choices, and to do that he must keep his promises.</p>

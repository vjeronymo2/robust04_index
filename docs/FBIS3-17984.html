The statement  followed his talks with Crimean Vice-President Yevgeniy Saburov  on Tuesday.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Kravchuk said that in all  other spheres, especially in the political one, the sides  "should coordinate their moves and activities, taking into  account the interests of Ukraine and the people of the Crimea  and international principles, especially those concerning  territorial integrity, the sovereignty of states and their  borders."    These are the most acute problems, he added. "We need to  agree on the status quo and refrain from any pressure," the  Ukrainian leader continued, adding that "playing the `Crimean'  card will do no good either to the Crimea, Ukraine or Russia,"  he said.    Lately Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has come up with a  proposal to Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Crimea and  ordered military enlistment offices not to send conscripts  outside the Crimea this spring.    Valeriy Kuznetsov, Meshkov's military adviser, told  ITAR-TASS  on Wednesday that consultations are now underway with a top  military commander from the Odessa military district to iron out  disagreements and work out a compromise.    The most probable solution would be to leave half of 3,400  draftees in the Crimea and send 20 per cent (about 680 people)  to the Ukrainian Army and 1,000 (about 30 per cent) to the Black  Sea Fleet, he said.</p>

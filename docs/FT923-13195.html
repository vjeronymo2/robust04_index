			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Investors seek more European rights UK institutional investors have written to European stock exchanges asking them to move against restrictions which limit shareholders' ability to obtain information about companies and influence management. The UK Institutional Fund Management Association, a trade association, wrote to heads of all European stock exchanges last week urging them to protect voting rights of shareholders to encourage foreign investment. 'The association is concerned at the restrictions that exist in many European countries on voting and shareholder rights,' said Mr Paddy Linaker, IFMA chairman and chief executive of M&amp;G Group, the unit trust managers, in the letter. 'We believe that the effect of restrictions on voting and shareholder rights is to discourage investment interest and reduce companies' access to capital, or at least worsen the terms on which it is available.' European companies - and the exchanges where their shares are traded - have expressed little enthusiasm for UK and US-style shareholder activism. Yesterday, Mr Ronald Weichert, a spokesman for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, said the exchange did not believe its practices were restrictive or that changes were necessary. German rules which allowed companies to limit shareholders' votes to 5 per cent of their stake only affected a small number of companies, he said. UK fund managers, increasingly flexing their muscle with corporate boards at home, have been frustrated by their lack of influence with European corporate boards, in spite of rising investments there. Mr Stephen Dowds, a director at Capital House Investment Management, said: 'The vast amounts of money invested by international investors should not be seen by company managements and controlling shareholders as a cheap source of funds to be rewarded only by an annual report in English, the occasional presentation at the Savoy and a fraction of a voting right.' Ms Margaret Stoker, European fund manager at Capital House, cited Dutch 'certification' rules. These allow companies, such as Philips, to issue shares into a holding company it controls. Voting rights then accrue to the holding company and no hostile bid can succeed.</p>

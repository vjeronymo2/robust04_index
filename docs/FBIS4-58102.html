			<p>BFN     [Text] The following is the six-point agreement concluded  yesterday by Fatah and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).  It was undersigned by "Fatah Hawks" and "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  Battalions." According to the document, the parties agree:    1. To immediately halt all defamation campaigns between  Fatah and Hamas, provided the right to freedom of expression and  opinion is guaranteed to everyone. A fraternal dialogue between  the two organizations will be held to decide measures that will  serve our lofty masses everywhere.    2. To renounce differences and bloody conflicts and stop  using violence to resolve these differences. The two sides  emphasize the need to be committed to constructive dialogue  among our people to put an end to the conspiracies being  concocted to trap our people in chronic crises and differences.    3. As of the date of this statement, the wanted persons and  gunmen of both sides are prohibited from interfering to resolve  organizational or family problems. The Islamic and national  reconciliation committees are asked to play their role in  resolving any problem that may arise. If no solution is  reached, the leaders of the political factions are to intervene  to put an end to the problems. Fatah and Hamas will work out a  suitable mechanism for implementing this resolution.    4. After a long study of our people's economic conditions,  it has been decided to stage a one-day strike for every martyr  in his own neighborhood only and to declare only one day of  mourning in the remaining areas. The intifadah activists are  hereby prohibited from throwing stones at cars moving for urgent  reasons. The two parties appeal to all factions to reduce  overall strikes as much as possible. In cases of emergencies, a  strike shall be announced jointly and through a fraternal and  constructive understanding.    5. Regarding educational matters, we urge our male and  female students to remain in their classes during strikes. All  students are urged to deal with any attempt to force them out of  their classes.    6. After a careful study of the question of collaborators,  Fatah and Hamas have decided to stop killing collaborators  between 22 April 1994 and 22 May 1994. During this period,  efforts will be made to tackle this phenomenon. We advise the  collaborators to cut off their ties with the enemy's  intelligence agencies for God's mercy is better for them than  the enemy's hell. This month will provide a chance to  reconsider and define positions.</p>

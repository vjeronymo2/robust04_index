			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Confidence stable, survey shows CONSUMER confidence stabilised in the first quarter of this year, suggesting that consumer spending will have risen slightly between January and March for the third successive quarter, according to a survey published yesterday. The latest quarterly regional consumer survey, produced by Gallup and Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, found a leveling out of regional differences in consumer sentiment compared with a year ago. Consumer optimism in greater London and the west Midlands, which was well below the national average a year ago, had recovered to approximately the average level. East Anglia and the south-east outside greater London emerged from the latest survey with the strongest consumer sentiment. Wales was significantly less optimistic than the rest of the UK in both the first quarter of this year and the same period of last year. Business Strategies said that consumers in the south were more optimistic about the overall economic situation than those elsewhere in the country. Nevertheless, they were reluctant to take on big purchases, possibly because of an overall decline in household finances in the region after a sharp rise in unemployment last year. Mr Charles Burton, a director of Business Strategies, said the survey suggested that consumer spending in Britain rose by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter compared with the last quarter of last year. Consumer spending last year fell by an estimated 1.7 per cent - the biggest fall since records started in 1948.</p>

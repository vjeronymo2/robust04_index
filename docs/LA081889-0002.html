			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Former Black Panther Party leader Elmer (Geronimo) Pratt was denied parole for  the ninth time since the 1968 murder of a Southern California woman during a  $30 robbery. Board of Prison Terms Commissioner David Brown announced after the  hour-long hearing at San Quentin Prison that Pratt, 41, serving a life  sentence, "is not suitable for parole at this time." Brown, who characterized  the murder as "heinous and despicable," said the prisoner had consistently  refused vocational training and a crucial psychological evaluation. Pratt was  convicted in the murder of Carolyn Olson, 27, a schoolteacher, who was shot to  death during the robbery.  </P></p>

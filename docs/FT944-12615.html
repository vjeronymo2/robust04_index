			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Technology: Healthy records / A look at a computer system that helps doctors offer patients a better service - Software at Work After 30 years as a general practitioner in Britain's National Health Service, Michael Shapland is still developing new skills. He has to respond to medical and pharmaceutical developments, to health service reforms and, not least, to the demands of patients in his Oxford practice. In Shapland's consulting room, a box of patient notes is on the desk next to the computer, ready for afternoon surgery. His computer is a standard PC, but it supports a system called Horizon, which runs the practice. Shapland still uses paper records but patients coming into his room are likely to find their records on screen. These can be updated with any information, such as about a smoking habit, that has changed since their last visit. Referrals or other relevant details are also in the system. Shapland's portable laptop computer is a vital source of information on emergency visits. The data it holds on pharmaceuticals and prescriptions alone forms a vast database, including all the generic and proprietary drugs in the GP's compendium. Unlike most software built for GPs, the 'intelligence' built into Horizon cross-references any drug to the individual patient, alerting the prescribing doctor (who may not be the patient's usual physician) to allergies, side-effects, or reactions to other medication. The combination of warfarin with aspirin, for example, throws up an alarm: both drugs thin the blood, in different ways. The system also deals with administration, including statistical returns to the Family Health Services Authority and repeat prescriptions for the 4,500 patients cared for at the Donnington Health Centre, where Shapland's practice is based. Three practices share the centre, along with its nurses and other clinical resources. Horizon's unusual dynamic facility means the the system can 'learn' from changes in a pattern. For example, it can note the sudden popularity of a newly-prescribed drug, and add it to the list it presents as optional treatments for a particular condition. This artificial intelligence, known as a neural network (because it mimics the way the human brain makes connections), makes the system attractive to researchers and hospital clinicians, who make up the majority of Horizon's 100 or so users worldwide. The system is available in several languages. In Switzerland, Horizon is used for reporting on epidemiological studies and for microbiological research. Kurt Eggenberger, a paediatrician in private practice in Yverdon, outside Lausanne, uses the system in his own clinic, and for research into viral and respiratory infections in children, working with research groups in Geneva. 'Nothing else I have found can carry out such versatile clinical analysis, and report on disease occurrence in this way,' he says. At their Oxford practice, Shapland and his partner David Thurston cover areas including Littlemoor and the Blackbird Leys estate, where there have been big job cuts in the car industry. 'Unemployment has caused some hardship. The computer doesn't improve your gut feel after 30 years here, but it enables you to analyse it and produce real figures to prove your case,' says Shapland. Thurston says Horizon has helped with his special interest in psychology. For example, an analysis of suicide rates showed him that of 65 intentional overdose cases, more than half were aged between 14 and 30. Nearly twice as many of them were female as male, about 15 per cent are unemployed, and a high percentage live on the Blackbird Leys estate. A seasonal pattern emerged: extremes of weather trigger an upturn in suicide attempts. 'Things that may not seem obvious become significant as you play with the data,' says Thurston. 'Once you have spotted a pattern, you can do something about it, like monitoring vulnerable patients more carefully in July and January.' The system also enables the practice to verify its targets under National Health Service reforms. These include preventative measures, such as checks on people over 75 years old, immunisation for infants, and cervical smears. Targets are based on percentages: a 50 per cent reach for cervical smears earns less for the GP than the government's 70 per cent target. Scaled payments to GPs are based on performance. Shapland also runs clinics for asthmatics and diabetics. With a few keystrokes, he shows a list of asthma patients and a graphic breakdown, by age, showing the percentage of the 255 sufferers that are in the toddler to teenage range. It was this complexity and power, coupled with simple access, that impressed Shapland when he saw the Horizon system at a medical computer show in 1989. 'I realised I wouldn't have to lose my staff for endless weeks of training because this system tells them what to do as they are doing it.' Horizon replaced a Meditel system, in use since 1986. It operates on four linked - or networked - 286 PCs. The system sells on a 'turnkey' basis with hardware, software and support in a provided package by the Leicester-based developer Horizon Software. It costs the practice Pounds 3,000 a year on a lease basis, plus a Pounds 1,600 yearly maintenance charge. Linda Gardner, the practice manager, sees time-saving as the greatest advantage. 'It's invaluable for the annual statistics we have to return every June,' she says. 'You could never plough through all the notes by hand, but we can analyse our patients' records from any angle, which is invaluable.' Horizon users can access records by patient name or names, or addresses, useful where a family has several surnames under one roof. There is a record of medication, whether the patient lives alone, and a notes section for any extra information. Drugs and diseases are coded for quick access and analysis, so that users rarely have to type in complex names. For the sector as a whole, Shapland believes the NHS has taken a piecemeal approach to computerisation, slowing the move towards umbrella systems that would enable GPs and hospitals to exchange information via computers and telephone-linked networks. Not one UK hospital, in his opinion, has a really good all-embracing system in place.</p>

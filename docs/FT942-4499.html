			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eldridge Pope trebled to Pounds 0.6m in first half Eldridge Pope, Dorchester-based brewer, retailer and wine shipper, is keeping up the pace of profit expansion in the first half of 1993-94 with a trebled pre-tax figure and Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said that the main benefits of the recent Carlsberg-Tetley trading alliance were yet to come. Profits for the half year to March 31 rose from Pounds 203,000 to Pounds 606,000 pre-tax after a sharp drop in net interest payable to Pounds 570,000 (Pounds 895,000). For the year to September 1993 pre-tax profits doubled to Pounds 1.76m. The USM-traded company, whose beer brands include Thomas Hardy Country and Royal Oak, recently introduced a brew called 3D (Dorchester D-Day Bitter). Turnover declined to Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 20.5m), reflecting the sale of the beer wholesaling business to Carlsberg. Trading profits rose to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.24m) representing an increase from 6.1 per cent to 7.6 per cent in the mar-gin. Mr Jeremy Pope, managing director, said the Pounds 5m net from the Carlsberg deal was a 'war chest' waiting to be used. He said that a number of opportunities were being pursued but the board was 'setting a stringent hurdle race.' Earnings per share rose from 0.86p to 2.3p and the interim dividend is increased to 1.5p (1.4p).</p>

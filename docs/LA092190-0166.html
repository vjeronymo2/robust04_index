			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> FRESHMAN TO START AT SAFETY AGAINST BYU  </P> <P> Safety Chris Johnson, a freshman redshirt from Crawford High, will get a chance  to learn what the phrase "baptism of fire" means Saturday afternoon. Aztec  Coach Al Luginbill announced Thursday that Johnson will start his first  collegiate game against Heisman Trophy candidate Ty Detmer of BYU. After three  games, Detmer is throwing for an average of 413.7 yards and three touchdowns a  game.  </P> <P> Johnson beat out senior David Cooper for the starting spot. "Chris has done  more things correctly than David has," Luginbill said. "We feel that Chris is  much better (in the open field) than Morey (Paul) or David."  </P> <P> Asked if facing the rocket arm of Detmer is too much to ask of a freshman,  Luginbill said: "He's at a spot where he's not asked to do a hell of a lot. If  he stays focused, he'll be OK."  </P> <P> Luginbill said more than anything he likes the athletic ability of Johnson, a  6-foot, 190 pounder. "He was a quarterback in high school ,and he also played  point guard on the basketball team and averaged 20 points a game. He just has  some very good instincts."  </P> <P> Luginbill said he was generally pleased with his team's practice habits this  week. "We spent the week on San Diego State. If this team's mind is on CBS or  playing in Provo, we're in trouble." . . . Running back Tommy Booker, who is  slowed by an ankle injury, will make the trip but is not expected to play  unless the other three Aztec running backs go down. . . . Freshman linebacker  Jamal Duff will also make the trip, but is definitely out with a deep thigh  bruise. . . . Sophomore safety Zac Stokes is healthy after coming back from an  injured shoulder, but Luginbill said he did not get enough work in practice  this week and will not play. DAVE MCKIBBEN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Al-Majali Reaffirms Jordan's </F> `Displeasure' With 'Arafat's `Procrastination'; `Palestinian  Golan' Obstructs Agreement Framework Between Syria and Israel"]    [Text] Amman -- Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali has stated that there is an "agreement of views"  [tawafuq] between the United States and Syria on the "main  lines" of a Syrian-Israeli agreement on the Golan Heights, and  that what is obstructing the achievement of an agreement  framework is a dispute over a strategic piece of land known as  "the Palestinian Golan." Parliamentary sources have revealed to  AL-HAYAH that al-Majali told the deputies in a closed session  held the evening of the day before yesterday that "there is an  agreement of views" between the United States and Syria on the  main lines of a settlement, "but Israel still has reservations  regarding al-Himmah triangle which Syria considers to be its  own." The sources quoted al-Majali as saying that Syria "is  requesting that the triangle be given back to it on the grounds  that it had belonged to Syria since 1938."    Al-Majali said Egypt considers the triangle, known as "the  Palestinian Golan," to belong to the Palestinians, and therefore  negotiations on it should be between Israel and the PLO,  according to parliamentary sources. Al-Himmah triangle is  located at the point where the territories of Syria, Israel, and  Jordan meet (north of the Jordanian kingdom).    Al-Majali also revealed that there is a border dispute  between Jordan and Syria, and another dispute over water quotas,  although he did say that relations are "at their best."    At the secret session of the House of Representatives,  al-Majali also revealed that, during King Husayn's recent talks  with President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus, Syria asked of Jordan  a level "higher than coordination" in their bilateral relations.  The parliamentary sources interpreted the Syrian request as a  call for some form of integration or unity.    The sources told AL-HAYAH that al-Majali told the deputies  that the reply to Syria was briefly that Jordan "believes in  coordination provided relations are not based just on slogans  and emotions but rather on reason and a scientific approach."    He also said a Syrian delegation headed by Prime Minister  Mahmud al-Zu'bi and including Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'  will visit Amman on Saturday [11 June] for the meetings of the  Syrian-Jordanian Higher Committee, which will be meeting for the  first time since the Gulf crisis to discuss development of  economic and political bilateral relations.    He told the deputies that Syrian-Jordanian relations are at  their best, with the exception of "some problems" related to  water quotas and border posts. The parliamentary sources said  Jordan is still urging Syria to stop exceeding its share of  water from al-Yarmuk River.    It is worth noting that Israel is also taking a part of  Jordan's share in the Jordan and al-Yarmuk rivers.    The same sources said the border dispute is over a Syrian  request to replace al-Ramtha border post with a border post in  the area of Jabir on the border between the two countries.  Jordan agrees to the introduction of a border post in Jabir,  provided the border post at al-Ramtha remains.    The prime minister also said King Husayn contacted the  Syrian  president the day before yesterday, and the latter confirmed  that the Syrian delegation will arrive in Amman on Saturday.    The sources quoted al-Majali as saying that the Syrians are  still refusing to participate in the multilateral negotiations  "to avoid discussion of the issue of water rights, particularly  our rights to water controlled by Syria."    Reviewing Jordanian-Palestinian relations, al-Majali  expressed Jordan's displeasure with Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat's procrastination, failure to coordinate with Jordan,  and disregard for Jordanian interests.    The parliamentary sources also quoted al-Majali as saying  that "we talk a lot about Palestinian coordination with Jordan,  which we seek and hope for, but in practical terms it is  nonexistent." He pointed out that the Palestinian coordination  committees "come for a meeting every time his excellency  President 'Arafat comes, and we explain the situation clearly  and underline the seriousness of the matter for us both, and  point out that coordination does not mean that we would lead or  dominate them...."    He added: "We thought that, by virtue of our experience as a  state, we were qualified to help and aid them in their affairs  as they are about to build their own entity...but President  'Arafat always insists on speaking in generalities, and he  ignores details and the work of the (joint) committees."    Al-Majali added that when the PLO sent Ahmad Quray'  (Abu-al-'Ala'), head of the PLO Economic Department, to Jordan  with the aim of arriving at an economic agreement after the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement was signed in Paris; "an agreement  was reached, but they postponed the signing...and that remains  the case to this day."    He said that, in his view, what is going on now "is an  attempt to drag (Jordan) along, in that the Israelis and the  Palestinians reach agreement and then drag us along. We  categorically reject that."    He added: "In the past, we excused them because their  attention was focused on survival, symbols, and sovereignty and  they had no time to discuss details...but at the latest meeting  we told them that there will be no excuse after today and that  we care about our own interests as they do about theirs...and  that if we decided to work alone that would harm them more than  it would harm us."    Commenting on al-Majali's statements, Deputy 'Abd-al-Karim  al-Kabarati, speaking on behalf of some of his colleagues, said  he supports the general policy of the government in its endeavor  to protect Jordan and its interests "proceeding from constant  Jordanian principles and adapting to regional and international  changes and to the realities on the ground so that Jordan may  continue to be a player and not become just a playground as its  enemies want it to be." On Jordanian-Palestinian relations,  al-Kabariti said "inasmuch as we are eager to save as much as we  can of the elements of unity between the two banks (of the  Jordan River), and although I believe that we should lay down  the basis and rules for building future unitary relations  between the two states, God willing, equally, we should not  allow these genuine feelings to prevent us from carefully  examing President Abu-'Ammar's ['Arafat's] policies and his  extreme indulgence in tactics at the expense of strategy to the  point of ignoring the historical and geographical facts which  link our two peoples and countries, and even his clear  insistence on moving in the opposite direction to these  facts...."    Al-Kabariti urged the government "not to be embarrassed to  talk about this matter in detail, and to let all the  informational, political, and popular forces participate in a  balanced and objective way. The public should be reassured that  we resolutely and sincerely turn our attention to Palestine and  its interests without the slightest interst in hegemony or  control but without that undermining our determination, above  all, to protect Jordan's interests, particularly its security,  future, and economy, and without becoming captives of  courtesies, meetings, and minutes which are the prevailing order  these days."    Twenty deputies spoke during the closed session which lasted  about three hours. They covered the various issues raised by  the prime minister.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. A number of commenters raised issues relating to cask handling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability of the cask to withstand drop and tipover accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters wanted the transfer cask containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Dry Storage Canister (DSC) to be analyzed for the maximum possible drop,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of whether that drop can occur inside or outside the spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building. One commenter alleged that a drop of the transfer cask into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent fuel pool would damage fuel assemblies in the pool. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was concerned about jamming the transfer cask in the spent fuel pool. What  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would happen to the cask if jammed fuel could not be extricated? Would the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire 40 ton transfer cask be left in the fuel pool?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Use of the Standardized NUHOMS inside the fuel handling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building would be conducted in accordance with the 10 CFR Part 50 reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating license. These cask handling operations, including loading,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrieval, and training, must be evaluated by the general licensee as required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(4) to ensure that procedures are clear and can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted safely. Load handling activities and possible load drop events with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural and radiological consequences related to transfer cask drops inside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the spent fuel building are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the licensee must determine whether the activities involve any unreviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility safety question or any change in facility technical specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The transfer cask and DSC designs were evaluated by the NRC against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria for controlling heavy loads that are found in NRC's NUREG&hyph;0612, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Control of Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and American National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards Institute (ANSI) N14.6, ``Special Lifting Devices for Shipping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Containers Weighing 10,000 Pounds or More.'' The lifting yoke associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transfer cask is a special purpose device designed to ANSI N14.6 criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that the yoke can safely lift the wet transfer cask containing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DSC out of the spent fuel pool and can safely lift the dry transfer cask and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DSC to the transport trailer. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59, for those reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants with a shipping cask drop analysis, the licensee must verify that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipping cask drop analysis adequately describes the consequences of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postulated transfer cask drop and that no unreviewed safety question exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For those reactor plants that may lack a shipping cask drop analysis, each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee must perform a transfer cask drop analysis pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of NUREG&hyph;0612 and NUREG/CR 1815 may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Mail Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9328. Copies are also available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. A copy is also available for inspection and copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specific requirements for lifting the transfer cask are contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance and SER. However, movement of the transfer cask in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the spent fuel pool building must, as required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(4), be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated by the licensee pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. The possibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jamming a transfer cask while in the spent fuel pool is one of many issues to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be evaluated under 10 CFR 50.59.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked why the transfer cask with the DSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be lifted to 80 inches outside the spent fuel pool building when it has to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be unloaded and inspected for damage if it drops from above 15 inches. Why  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not limit the height to 15 inches?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The transfer cask with the DSC rides on the transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trailer at a height of greater than 15 inches and therefore was analyzed for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drop from that height (80 inches). A drop from a height between 15 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 80 inches does not pose a public health and safety hazard. However, to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety the NRC requires the DSC to be unloaded and inspected for damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked about the tipover analysis or drop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The tipover, end drops, and horizontal drop analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form part of the structural design basis for the Standardized NUHOMS design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The designer, VECTRA, described these drop and tipover analyses in SAR,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8.2.5. The NRC's evaluation of the vendor's analyses is described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SER, Section 3.2.2.3E. The NRC found the results of these analyses to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactory, because the calculated stresses were all within the allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters, citing Section 1.1.1 of the draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance, requested that the postulated cask drop accident in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the plant fuel handling area be included in the list of parameters and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses that will need verification by the system user (for the 10 CFR 50.59  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety evaluation).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in Section 1.1.1 of the draft Certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance, a holder of a 10 CFR Part 50 license before use of the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license under 10 CFR Part 72, must determine whether activities related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage of spent fuel involve any unreviewed facility safety issues or changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in facility technical specifications as provided under 10 CFR 50.59. Fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling including the possible drop of a spent fuel cask is among the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities that are required to be verified. Fuel handling operations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including spent fuels and fresh fuels, are routine within the nuclear power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant and are subject to NRC regulation under 10 CFR Part 50. A holder of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR Part 50 license is required to establish operating procedures for spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel handling and to provide emergency planning to address a potential cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drop accident in the reactor's fuel handling area (Certificate of Compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.1.4). Therefore the NRC considers it clear that the spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the nuclear power plant should be evaluated to verify that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible drop of a spent fuel cask does not raise an unreviewed safety issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or require a facility technical specification change appropriately regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 10 CFR Part 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that there is no place to unload  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the spent fuel in the event of a canister breach. There is no indication that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the canister, the canister lifting mechanism, or the transport mechanism to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> move the canister into the cask, are nuclear grade equipment or have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to prevent a single failure from breaching the canister and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumventing the protection provided by the sole barrier provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> canister wall itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to 10 CFR 72.122(1), storage systems must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to allow ready retrieval of the spent fuel in storage. A general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee using an NRC-approved cask must maintain the capability to unload a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask. Typically, this will be done by maintaining the capability to unload a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask in the reactor fuel pool. Other options are under consideration that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would permit unloading a cask outside the reactor pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

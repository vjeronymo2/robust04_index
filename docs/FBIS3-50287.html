			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 26 (AFP) -- Bosnian Prime Minister  Haris Silajdzic called Wednesday for bomb attacks on groups  which seek to prevent aid convoys from reaching their  destinations. He made the call after civilians shot and wounded  six policemen escorting a UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for  Refugees] aid convoy in central Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Speaking alongside the new commander of UN forces in Bosnia,  British General Michael Rose, with whom he had held a short  session of talks, Silajdzic said:    "People are dying of hunger while some people block roads.  Whether they are Serb, Croat or Bosnian, they should be bombed  because they're killing the population through hunger....  Freeing up aid corridors is the key issue, anything else is of  secondary importance."    He regretted that although UN forces on the ground sought to  help, the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) did "not have the  mandate."    Rose, who took over the troubled UN command on Monday amid  acrimonious debate on how the international community should end  the conflict here, refused to comment on the Bosnian's remarks.    But he said that earlier, during his first meeting with  Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, he had assured Ganic the UN  force "would do all it could to continue to facilitate the  delivery of humanitarian aid and to assist with the peace  process in this country".    "I don't think in the near future we are going to see any  changes in the mandate I have been given," he added.    Earlier Wednesday, six Bosnian policemen were shot and  wounded as the UNHCR aid convoy they were escorting came under  fire from civilians in central Bosnia, a spokesman for UNHCR  said here.    Another policeman was wounded by civilian fire Tuesday in  the  same circumstances and in the same area, UNHCR spokesman Kris  Janowski said, adding that the Zenica-Kakanj road had been  closed after the two attacks.    The attacks took place in the village of Ticici, near  Kakanj,  60 kilometres (35 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, in an area  controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army.    The UNHCR convoy heading toward Tuzla and accompanied by 12  Bosnian policemen was stopped by civilians at Ticici, where  gunfire coming from one of the houses hit and wounded six of the  policemen. The police escort had been strengthened after the  first armed attack on Tuesday, Janowski said.    In the Tuesday incident, the convoy had left Zenica, 70  kilometres (44 miles) northwest of the capital, for Kakanj with  a five-man Bosnian police escort Tuesday morning. It was  stopped near Ticici by a crowd of some 300 Moslem men, women and  children.    Janowski said the UNHCR was "very worried" about the growing  number of incidents aimed at UN convoys over the past few weeks.    Since the beginning of January, several UNHCR aid convoys  have been blocked in central Bosnia. The crowds blocking the  convoys, usually made up of women and children, often managed to  flee with part of the aid. Much of the region's population is  suffering from food shortages.</p>

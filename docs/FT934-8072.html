			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Brownsword in cards merger with Hallmark CONGRATULATIONS to Andrew Brownsword, thought to be one of the highest paid men in the UK, who is moving house. Mr Brownsword, who started designing and publishing greetings cards from his kitchen table more than 20 years ago, has agreed to merge his group of companies with the UK - Ireland operations of Hallmark Cards, the world's largest greetings card publisher with annual sales of more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn). In its last published accounts for the 13 months to January 1991 the Brownsword company, which owns the quintessentially English Gordon Fraser and Forever Friends, reported turnover of nearly Pounds 45m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.7m. Hallmark Cards is one of the biggest privately owned companies in the US. It is based in Kansas City, Missouri, where founder Joyce Hall started selling postcards in 1910. Mr Hall, who was named after a bishop and constantly received mail addressed to Miss Hall, died aged 91 in 1982, handing the business on to his son, Donald J Hall. The company employs 700 artists and offers cards for every occasion - from birth to death, taking in all stages of modern American courtship, including a request for information on a partner's HIV status. In the UK, Hallmark has 140 retail outlets known as Hall of Cards, where it offers its collection of brands including the Snoopy range. Mr Brownsword, 46, will assume overall responsibility for the combined group's operations in the UK and Ireland. Neither Mr Brownsword or Mr Don Read, Hallmark UK/Ireland's group managing director, were available for comment yesterday. But Mr Read said in a press statement that the merger 'brings together two of the leading names in the greetings cards business and offers exciting growth prospects for the industry as a whole.'</p>

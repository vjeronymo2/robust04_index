			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Brussels mounts solid defence of single currency THE European Commission yesterday mounted a solid defence of the single European currency, reflecting its growing belief that a French endorsement of the Maastricht treaty in Sunday's referendum was vital to the future of European union. EC officials argued that the European exchange rate mechanism had proved its efficacy but had also shown its limitations. They argued that this week's events in the currency markets demonstrated the imperative need for a single currency. The pounding that speculators had given the ERM 'shows that if we don't move forwards we are going to go backwards,' said Sir Leon Brittan, a Commission vice-president and former British cabinet minister. Sir Leon argued that this week's foretaste of the possible consequences of a French No vote could strengthen the treaty cause. However, Mr Frans Andriessen, the Dutch external relations commissioner, took the opposite view. 'This is bad news for Sunday', he said. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president and inspirer of the Maastricht plan for economic and monetary union, insisted the EMS was far from being 'a miracle cure'. 'We cannot ask of it what it cannot provide. It will still provide, but it is only through common disciplines and a single currency that we can avoid the sort of events we have just witnessed,' Mr Delors said in Paris. Mr Delors argued that currency union would enable the EC to negotiate as equals with the US and Japan 'to guarantee greater monetary stability'. It would also keep Europe's currencies out of the crossfire between an appreciating D-Mark and sinking dollar. British officials insisted that the suspension of Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism was not regarded by other members as a sign of weakening commitment to the Community, and it would not affect the government's aims for its period in the presidency. They added that Britain might call a special EC summit before the scheduled meeting of heads of state in Edinburgh in December. The logic for such a meeting would increase if the French electorate rejected the Maastricht treaty. Mr Jean-Francois Pons, director of the EMS, said that 'if the EMS were going to give us stability for ever and a day there would have been no point in having Emu.' He addded that Danish voters' rejection of Maastricht in June was 'the turning point' in the markets suggesting that 'maybe (the markets) were banking too much on the effects of the single currency' plan reached at Maastricht. However, Mr Giovanni Ravasio, head of the directorate general for economic and financial affairs, said this week's carnage was sparked by the markets' 'exasperation' with the uncertainty over Maastricht. In yesterday's debate on the crisis at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Glyn Ford, leader of The British Labour party Euro-MPs, said the money markets had 'mugged every man, woman and child (in the UK) each for Pounds 140 pounds in the last 48 hours.' But he warned French voters that a No vote on Sunday would mean 'you ain't seen nothing yet.'</p>

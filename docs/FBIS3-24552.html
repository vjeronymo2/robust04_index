			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article under the rubric ``The Journal Desk'': ``Waiting </F> for THE COMPASS OF SCIENCE''    [Text] In the next few months the international scientific  publishing house Gordon and Breech intends to publish the new  popular journal THE COMPASS OF SCIENCE. Initially it will be  published every two months with a total size of 32 pages. It is  anticipated that each issue will contain four or five main  articles, as well as a collection of information notes on  science news and advertising materials.    Prof. Gerhart Friedlender, a member of the U.S. National  Academy of Sciences, has agreed to become the editor in chief of  the journal. He works at Brookhaven Laboratory and is well known  for his works in the field of nuclear physics and chemistry.    The list of its basic sections: physics and astronomy,  chemistry, biology, the earth sciences, materials science,  technology, applied mathematics and computers, power engineering  and ecology, and medicine, testifies to the versatile nature of  the future journal. Scientists from various countries will be  the editors of these sections. Desiring to ensure the broadest  possible coverage in the journal of the news of Russian science  and striving to enlist our scientists in the description and  analysis of their own achievements and the achievements of their  foreign colleagues, the initiators of the publication of THE  COMPASS OF SCIENCE additionally intend to include among the  editors a representative of Russia--Academician Vitaliy  Goldanskiy will be him. A Japanese scientist, apparently, will  be another editor who represents a specific region.    In regard to the content, style, and format, among the  closest analogs of the future publication it is probably  possible to name the British journal THE NEW SCIENTIST. In the  words of Prof. G. Friedlender, the goal of THE COMPASS OF  SCIENCE will be ``the description of the most important  scientific and technical research, discoveries and ideas in such  a form that their significance and content could be understood  and appreciated by scientists of the most different specialties.  In other words, the news of biology should be described in such  a way that its importance and fascination would be clear to a  specialist in solid-state physics, an anthropologist should read  with interest about a new approach to the problem of stellar  evolution, and so forth.''    Russian scientists will probably find something to tell the  readers of THE COMPASS OF SCIENCE about, and the world  scientific community will find for itself in the new journal  many interesting notices about the achievements of science in  our country and assessments by our scientists of foreign science  news.</p>

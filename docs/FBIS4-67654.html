			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] The China Venereal Disease (VD) and AIDS  Prevention Association, a national organization aiming to  mobilize action by the entire society to prevent and effectively  control the spread of these illnesses, was set up in Beijing on  the Sixth World AIDS Day on December 1.    Organized by the Ministries of Public Health and Public  Security, the association draws in nearly 200 council members  including six vice-ministerial officials and affiliated  departmental- and bureau-level officers from the aforementioned  ministries and the Ministries of Justice and Civil Affairs, the  Army and Police Force, as well as several dozen leading public  health officials from other provinces and cities. It also  consists of numerous well-known experts and scholars from state  research units such as the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,  the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, the Academy of  Traditional Chinese Medicine, and China Foundation for Global  Venereal Disease and AIDS, plus research and prevention  organizations in other provinces and cities.    Following six years of efforts since the First World AIDS  Day  on December 1, 1988, a nationwide network to monitor and prevent  sexually transmitted diseases has been formed. The government  has successively established the China Consulting Committee of  Experts on VD, the State Expert Committee on Control and  Prevention of AIDS, and the China Research Center of VD  Prevention. It has set up 26 monitoring sites and 1,535 VD  prevention organizations across the country, HIV monitoring  centers in 13 provinces and 161 HIV monitoring posts in further  provinces and regions. Some 200 HIV initial detection labs have  been created nationwide, and the number of AIDS identification  labs has risen to 12. In 1993, with support from the Ministries  of Public Health and Finance, Guangdong and Yunnan, the two  provinces where the AIDS problem is the most serious,  established their own AIDS prevention centers. [passage omitted]    The task for the new association is to coordinate and  integrate promotion and education, medical treatment and  prevention, scientific research and legal supervision. It must  form a strong behemoth of opinion and force of opposition across  society to finally curb the continuous spread of AIDS.</p>

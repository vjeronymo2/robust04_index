			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dr. Fatmir Zanaj: "Is U.S. Policy Toward </F> Albania Going To Change Now That Mr. Ryerson Is Leaving Our  Country?"]    [Text] The BBC Albanian Section reports that Mr. William  Ryerson, the U.S. ambassador to Albania, is due to be  transferred from this country to take up another post. The  question arises: Will this change bring any new tone in U.S.  policy toward our small Balkan country? I think there is little  reason to expect any U.S. policy change in this respect. It is  a policy that has been conceived in detail by specialist  personnel, and there is no reason why it should be lightly  changed within two or three years. What is certainly due to  change in the future is Albania itself and the Albanian people,  who already have changed over the past four years, together with  the Albanian realities and political parties.    With the establishment of diplomatic relations between our  two countries, U.S. policy in Albania immediately appeared to be  a consistent anti-communist policy aimed at speeding up the  changes that had already begun in the 1988-89 period. It was  also a policy of establishing a system of pluralist democracy  and a capitalist market economy.    With all the means at the disposal of his profession, Mr.  Ryerson has contributed to the destabilization of the last  communist ruling party in Albania, and did the same thing  against Fatos Nano's socialists in the run-up to the 22 March  1992 elections, thus reflecting the official U.S. policy of  temporary diplomatic mistrust of any democratic transformation  of the reform- minded trend within the PPSH [Party of Labor of  Albania] into a modern party of a social-democratic type, called  afterward the PSSH [Socialist Party of Albania]. Another  expression of this U.S. political stance was Ambassador  Ryerson's appearances in public, side by side with the PDSH  [Democratic Party of Albania], which at that time appeared to be  the greatest and most determined anti-communist force in Albania.    The Albanian public today has a certain assessment of Mr.  Ryerson's activities in Albania, but it is not a uniform one.  Nevertheless, a considerable number of Albanians have long  expressed a tendency to identify the PDSH with U.S. policy in  Albania, and to identify Mr. Ryerson himself with the PDSH  leaders when this party was in opposition, and also now that it  is in power.    There seem to have been certain public factors -- especially  those related to the run-up to the 22 March 1992 elections --  that prompted Albanians to reach such conclusions. The  Albanians remember all too well, and they could not help  mentioning several times afterward, Mr. Ryerson's declaration at  a PDSH election rally in Korca, where he stated: "I wish all  the socialists good health and unemployment." However, the  Albanians are also wise enough to appreciate the criticism  contained in a recent U.S. State Department report on human  rights violations committed in this country by ruling government  officials -- a report in which information provided by the U.S.  Embassy in Tirana played its part.    Nevertheless, the identification of Mr. Ryerson with the  present PDSH leaders -- whose prestige has been badly  compromised because of the difficulties Albania is faced with in  this transition period, and because of signs of wear and tear,  incapability, and corruption in various segments of the PDSH  state organs -- could negatively affect the friendly feelings  that Albanians have toward the great and powerful U.S. democracy  and toward the United States itself. Whereas the former  President Alia masterfully succeeded in appeasing the anti-U.S.  sentiments instilled in the Albanians' minds for decades by the  communist regime, the identification of the present U.S.  ambassador in Albania with the present PDSH and its ruling,  discredited elite has had the reverse impact upon the Albanians'  mixed feelings. Such a thing is in the interest of neither the  great United States nor little Albania. Since Mr. Baker's visit  to Tirana in spring 1991, ordinary Albanians have given ample  proof that they are able to appreciate their friendship with the  United States.    Mr. Ryerson has made a great contribution to the process of  eradicating communism from Albania. He will therefore be  remembered for a long time by the Albanian people. There will  be pleasant memories of him, but also bitter ones, bearing in  mind the tactics used to bring the former communists to their  knees. Such tactics unleashed destructive anti-communist forces  that gave vent to their frustrations by burning down and  destroying factories, schools, cultural centers, farms, and so  on. It is yet another "dark stain" on how the overwhelmingly  majority of Albanians view the Western support for the PDSH to  come to power. To some extent, this also applies to how the  Albanians view the U.S. ambassador of that period.    With Mr. Ryerson's departure from Albania, one chapter in  the  evolution of U.S. policy in Albania is closed, and the new  chapter will require a new ambassador. The foreign policy  analysts will not have forgotten the reaction of the Albanian  population against those who implemented such a policy thus far.  From now on, it will be a matter of the consolidation of U.S.  influence in Albania. The Albanian policymakers have to show  themselves capable of respecting and defending Albania's  interests first and foremost, and then the interests of her  friends, be they small or great.    Naturally, the anti-communist U.S. policy is, in essence,  not  going to change. From this viewpoint, one can assume that it is  the right-wing parties that will be the more privileged ones.  However, Mr. Ryerson's visit to the PPSH headquarters to attend  its press conference on 3 April 1994, among other things of  significance, is symptomatic of the official U.S. policy of also  opening up toward the left-wing parties, and perhaps at the same  time an indication of the end of its "cold war" against the PSSH  as a "former communist" party. The fact that some former  communists today are leading the PDSH and the Albanian State is  encouraging in this respect. Being a pro-European party, the  PSSH has strived from the very beginning, and continues striving  to build all kinds of links with the United States at all  levels. The Albanian socialists have eventually recognized the  fact that a pro-European policy also presumes a permanent U.S.  presence in Europe and U.S. membership in a number of European  political and military structures. The Albanian people are in  need of powerful friends, especially those near them, but  without ever refusing the friendship of those who are far off.  Now that the cards on the Balkan table are being reshuffled,  all Albanians, regardless of their persuasion or where they  live, value their friendship with the United States as a  historic chance of achieving a fair solution to their national  problem.</p>

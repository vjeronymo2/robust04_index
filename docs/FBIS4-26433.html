			<p>BFN     [Text] Over the past eight years and more, the Lhasa  Customs Office has conscientiously carried out the guiding  spirit of the national meeting on cracking down on smuggling  and, in the light of realities in our region, launched an  antismuggling campaign. As a result, it has scored marked  achievements and made contributions in safeguarding the reform,  opening up, and economic development in our region.    In accordance with the statistics, since 1985, the Lhasa  Customs Office has achieved the following results: It has  handled 4,300 smuggling cases, involving 106 kilograms of gold,  4,450 pieces of cultural relics, 2.4 kg of opium, and 900 grams  of heroin. At one of its surveillance zones, 122 kg of  marijuana was once ferreted out, the largest crack down in the  country. A total of 3,660 pelts of rare and endangered animals;  900 cheetah pelts; 205 kg of rare and valuable Chinese  medicines, such as Chinese caterpillar fungus and musk; and  1,770 pieces of leopard and tiger bones, with a value of 29  million yuan, have been ferreted out. In addition, a large  batch of reactionary printing materials, 14,000 pieces of audio-  video products, and 26,000 pieces of pornographic products have  been tracked down. The office has contributed to removing  spiritual pollution.    In their struggles against smuggling, the anticontraband  personnel of the Lhasa Customs Office, under the leadership of  the party organization of the customs office and with help from  public security organs, have made arduous efforts that require  both wisdom and bravery. They have written glorious chapters of  cracking down on smuggling in the borders of this snowy land.  The Lhasa Customs Office Investigation Department has twice  been given glorious titles of National Advanced Customs Office  Collective and National Advanced Anticontraband Collective.</p>

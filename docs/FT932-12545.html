			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / PM plea on terror cover MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday urged cross-party support for the government's aid scheme for insurance against terrorist attacks as the City's security came under growing scrutiny in the wake of Saturday's bombing. Mr Major was speaking ahead of a meeting today with Sir Francis McWilliams, lord mayor of London, to discuss improvements to security measures. The lord mayor is expected to raise the question of whether policing levels in the City should be raised, although he will also point out that, like other local authorities, the Corporation of London is limited by rate-capping legislation. Large banks and other companies in the City are expected to increase pressure for a review of security at a meeting with Sir Francis tomorrow evening. The meeting, due to be attended by the heads of more than 20 of the largest banks in the City, was called before the bomb attack to discuss the financial district's transport problems. The prime minister, responding to pressure for a review of security following the attack, refused to rule out the introduction of an identity card system. But he added: 'I have to say that it is not immediately on our agenda.' Mr Major said legislation on the terrorist insurance scheme would be debated by MPs 'as soon as possible'. Government business managers expect the terrorist insurance legislation to become law well before MPs rise for the summer recess. Labour last night appeared unlikely to oppose the bill. In the Commons, Mr Major said cover under the scheme, announced last year by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had been provided since January 1. He reiterated that the government would honour its commitments under the scheme. Mr Major said: 'The government scheme is one of reinsurance for the industry. Those who suffered damage will need to make their claims to their insurers in the usual way.' Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, told the bank's annual general meeting that NatWest had achieved 'business as usual'.</p>

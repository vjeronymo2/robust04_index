			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Singapore seeks to be more competitive SINGAPORE is introducing a 3 per cent goods and services tax (GST) and promised significant cuts in corporate and personal taxes in a budget at the end of this month. Mr Richard Hu, minister of finance, said it was vital that Singapore reduce its direct taxes in order to maintain its long-term competitiveness. It was also important for Singapore to broaden its tax base. 'The whole idea is to make us more competitive,' said Mr Hu. 'The government does not need the additional revenues. . . our fiscal position is very healthy.' Singapore runs a budget surplus and, at 47 per cent of GDP, has one of the highest savings rates in the world. It has foreign exchange reserves officially put at Dollars 40bn. The government hopes that by introducing its new tax regime, with lower direct taxes, Singaporeans will be encouraged to invest overseas. Government leaders have bemoaned the lack of Singaporean entrepreneurs willing to look at business opportunities abroad, particularly in China. The government said the lower corporate taxes would partially offset Singapore's high labour and land costs. It said the GST would be held at 3 per cent for at least five years after its introduction in April 1994.</p>

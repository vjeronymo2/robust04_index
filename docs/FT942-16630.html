			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Dutch millionaire is cleared The Netherlands' first insider-trading trial ended yesterday with millionaire industrialist Mr Joep van den Nieuwenhuyzen cleared of all charges over the sale of shares in HCS Technology in 1991. The judgment was a blow to the Justice Ministry which made the case a key test of the five-year-old insider-dealing law. Mr Van den Nieuwenhuyzen, majority owner of the Begemann industrial group, was accused with two associates, Mr Leon Melchior and Mr Eric Albada Jelgersma, of selling shares to drive down HCS's share price. The prosecution alleged they would then have been able to participate more cheaply in a share placing they knew HCS planned to make. But the court said that insider trading had not been proved because it was not obvious which way the HCS shares would move.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- A group of 23 private  individuals filed a complaint with public prosecutors against  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa on Friday  [4 February], accusing him of illegally receiving a 5 million  yen political donation in December 1992.    The group also lodged accusations with the Tokyo District  Public Prosecutors Office against four accountants of Ozawa's  fund-raising bodies and a former executive of a major  construction firm who allegedly passed on the 5 million yen.    The group's written complaint accused Ozawa and the other  five of violating the Political Funds Control Law.    Ozawa, former secretary general of the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP), has denied allegations he regularly received  illegal donations from the major general contractor over the  past few years, including the 5 million yen in December 1992.    But Shinji Kiyoyama, 67, a senior vice president of Kajima  Corp., has acknowledged to prosecutors that Kajima gave Ozawa  donations of 5 million yen twice a year -- in midsummer and at  the year-end -- for two or three years, prosecution sources have  said.    Kiyoyama is under arrest on suspicion of giving a 20 million  yen bribe to then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi to get favorable  treatment for Kajima in bids for prefectural public works  projects.    According to the plea of complaint, Ozawa and the four  accountants did not list the scandal-plagued Kajima Corp. in his  reports of spending and revenues on political donations despite  receiving more than 1 million yen in donations from the firm.    The Political Funds Control Law prohibits politicians from  receiving more than 1.5 million yen a year from any single  individual or corporation and also requires politicians to  report the names of donors of 1 million yen or more at any one  time.    Early last November, Ozawa told reporters he accepted the 5  million yen from Kajima as a legal political donation and denied  allegations he regularly received illegal contributions from the  leading contractor over the past few years.    Several of his political organizations received money from  Kajima and formally issued receipts for the money, Ozawa said.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Hilary Term cases ITALIA EXPRESS (FT, January 14) A vessel was sunk outside Piraeus harbour and the underwriters alleged that there had been a plot to blow up the ship. They wished to prove the original conspiracy by means of surreptitious tapes of conversations of those involved, including the divers allegedly responsible. At first instance, it was held that the tapes were not admissible in evidence under the Civil Evidence Act 1968. Allowing the appeal against that decision in part, the Court of Appeal stated that insofar as the tapes related to evidence of facts stated by one of the alleged conspirators, GDV, who knew that the conversations were being taped and who supplied the tapes, GDV was quite deliberately making simultaneous statements both orally and in a document. Subject to production and proof of the tapes or authenticated copies, the statements of the other interlocutors would not be evidence of facts stated but, in so far as they proved the context in which GDV's statements were made, would be evidence of that context. DEUTSCHE BANK AG v IBRAHIM AND OTHERS (FT, January 15) The bank claimed in an action in December 1991 for a declaration that it had valid equitable mortgages of two leases owned by the daughters of the defendant as security for their father's overdraft. The claim was refused on the ground that section 4 of the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied in that there was no memorandum in writing by the daughters to support the loan. Allowing an application to recall that judgment to hear further argument, Mr David Neuberger QC stated that the bank had sent draft memoranda to the daughters for signature. However, that was insufficient to satisfy section 4. The court had found that the memoranda were received by the daughters, but were never acknowledged by them, nor executed by them in any way. It would be quite wrong to infer approval on the daughters' part, whether of the memoranda generally or of inclusion of their names. Moreover, the bank could not bring the facts into the class of cases where section 4 could be said to have been used as 'an engine of fraud'. The daughters' counterclaim for the delivery of the title deeds for want of consideration succeeded. IN RE LONDON UNITED INVESTMENTS PLC (FT, January 17) In October/November 1990, the secretary of state, in exercise of his powers under section 432(2) of the Companies Act 1985, appointed inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company, LUI. Mr Wilson was a director of LUI but had refused to answer the inspectors' questions, invoking the common law privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, he contended that it was improper for the secretary of state to appoint inspectors to investigate matters which were the subject of allegations of fraud because it was more appropriate that suspected crimes should be investigated by the Serious Fraud Office or the police. Dismissing an appeal against a first instance decision that the refusal to answer was unjustified, the Court of Appeal stated that under the provisions of the 1985 Act, as amended by the Companies Act 1989, (i) inspectors would in very many cases have been appointed where the circumstances suggested fraud; (ii) persons questioned were bound to answer their questions; and (iii) the inspectors' report might lead the secretary of state to petition for winding-up or to proceed in the company's name in the public interest. ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND v CASSA DI RISPARMIO DELLE PROVINCIE LOMBARD AND OTHERS (FT, January 21) The Royal Bank of Scotland claimed reimbursement on a letter of credit as confirming bank, subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 1983 Revision, where reimbursement was to take place in New York. However, when the bill was still current, the issuing Italian banks had received information to the effect that the documents might be false because the underlying transaction was said to be fraudulent. Service of proceedings on the issuing banks was set aside at first instance on the ground that the English court had no jurisdiction to hear the claims under the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, article 5 of which stated that, with regard to contracting states, a person may be sued 'in the court of the place of performance of the obligation in question'. Dismissing the Royal Bank of Scotland's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that the 'obligation in question' for the purposes of article 5 was the obligation to effect reimbursement, and that was an obligation which was due for performance outside the jurisdiction of the English court. RE SHOE LACE LTD (FT, January 22) An application was made by the liquidator of Shoe Lace Ltd for return of company funds paid to another company, Sharp Investments Ltd, which held 80 per cent of Shoe Lace's issued share capital. Section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provided that a floating charge created within two years before the onset of insolvency in favour of a person connected with the company was invalid, except to the extent of consideration paid for creation of the charge 'at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge'. The floating charge was created within two months before the onset of insolvency in the instant case where Sharp controlled Shoe Lace and so was a 'connected person' within the section. No businessman, having knowledge of the kind of time limits imposed by the Insolvency and Companies Acts and using ordinary language, Mr Justice Hoffmann stated in granting the application, would say that the payments had been made at the same time as execution of the debenture in the present case. MARC RICH &amp; CO AG v SOCIETA ITALIANA IMPIANTI (FT, January 24) In a dispute over the sale of a cargo of oil by the defendant to the plaintiff, the contract having been negotiated in Italy, the plaintiff sought leave to appoint an arbitrator in London. The defendant issued proceedings in Italy where it was held that there was no arbitration agreement. Article 1(4) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention 1968 provided that the Convention did not apply to arbitration and the Court of Appeal, on the plaintiff's appeal against a dismissal of its application to restrain the defendant from pursuing the action in Genoa, referred to the European Court questions on whether the exception under article 1(4) extended to litigation as to the initial existence of an arbitration agreement. The ECJ held that the exclusion did extend to litigation, which was pending before a national court and which concerned the appointment of an arbitrator, even if existence of an arbitration was a preliminary issue in that litigation. In light of that answer, the Court of Appeal stated, the plaintiff's appeal against a setting aside of leave to serve on the defendants outside the jurisdiction would be dismissed. CHANNEL TUNNEL GROUP LTD &amp; ANOTHER v BALFOUR BEATTY CONSTRUCTION LTD &amp; OTHERS (FT, January 29) The defendant contractors (TML) appealed against a decision in an action in which Eurotunnel had issued a writ against TML, claiming an injunction restraining it from suspending work. No order was made on an undertaking that TML would not suspend work except on 14 days' notice. The judge also dismissed an application by TML that the action be stayed in favour of arbitration. Clause 67 of the contract provided that any dispute should first be referred to a panel of independent experts and that 'the seat of such arbitration shall be Brussels'. Allowing TML's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that some of the parties were not English but French, and they had all agreed to arbitrate in Brussels. The court was therefore not concerned with a domestic arbitration agreement (see section 1(4) Arbitration Act 1975). Whether or not there was jurisdiction, an interim injunction should not be granted when the parties had agreed to arbitration in a place outside England and there was an arbitrable dispute between them.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Smothering the vapours - VOCs are the latest airborne villains and their control means costs but also opportunities Down at the low-technology end of manufacturing, even the humblest products are caught up in the greening of industry. Pressure to clean up the air is forcing a striking change in traditional methods where solvents are used; that includes such mundane activities as the manufacture of bottle tops and shoe soles. This is the result of an international attempt, led by the United Nations, to reduce volatile organic compounds in the air over Europe. VOCs are the vapours given off by a range of chemicals used in industry, such as solvents, and contained in consumer products, such as house paint and petrol. The compounds collect in the atmosphere and react with sunlight to form photochemical smog and low-level ozone. These smogs irritate the breathing system and can be particularly harmful to the health of young children, the elderly, those with breathing complaints and people who exercise outdoors. Some VOCs are implicated in global warming. Western European countries have signed a UN treaty to reduce VOC emissions to two thirds of 1988 levels by 1999. Each government is responsible for devising plans to meet the target. Also, the EC is working on legislation to force certain sectors like the petrochemical and oil industries to make big cuts in VOC emissions before the end of the decade. UK law already controls emissions from industrial printers and other users of ink. Besides these official pressures, there are growing demands from retailers and business buyers for products that do not pollute. But some industries complain that the cost of compliance is too high, while others argue over who should take responsibility for emissions. However, the same pressures are a spur to innovation, creating lucrative opportunities for those who can develop traditional products, such as glues, paints and inks, that do not emit VOCs. 'Probably the whole drive behind all of the research in the market for car paint is geared towards reducing VOCs,' says Bob McGuiness, European marketing director for automotive paints at ICI. The European market for equipment that controls VOCs is set to double to Dollars 652m (Pounds 430m) a year by 1997, according to researchers Frost and Sullivan - and this figure is purely for devices that can be bolted on to existing processes; it does not include alternatives such as solvent-free inks and paints. It is these substitutes that are going to help hard-pressed smaller businesses like the shoe maker and bottle top manufacturer, which do not have the capital to invest in equipment that catches VOCs before they escape to the air. 'There is a big opportunity for makers of water-based inks because they take the trouble out of controlling VOCs,' says Jan Vernon of consultants KPMG. 'They solve many health and environmental problems and remove the need for costly monitoring and control systems. For many companies, these inks will be the only affordable option.' The European oil industry is particularly hard hit by EC demands to reduce vapours that evaporate during the making, storage and distribution of fuels. 'The first stage of controls will require industry to invest Dollars 2bn by early next century,' says Klaus Kohlhase, BP's head of health, safety and environment. If the proposed second stage - now under discussion - is carried out, the industry will have to spend a further Dollars 1bn installing vapour recovery units at service stations. These devices catch emitted vapours when motorists fill their tanks. But because the petrol pump attachments are expensive and not necessarily the most efficient solution, the oil industry wants car makers to fit carbon canisters to petrol tanks. Shell UK estimates that vapour recovery devices on the forecourt would capture about three quarters of the VOCs emitted when motorists fill up, while canisters would collect more than 95 per cent. The carbon is regenerated when captured VOCs are drawn into the engine and burnt. The car industry does not want to fit these canisters because of the cost. And the EC does not favour the solution because it would take too long - about 10 years before all cars were fitted. The oil industry argues that its operations contribute only small amounts to industry's overall VOC emissions. Furthermore, most problems with fuels arise when vehicles are used, through unburnt fuel in exhaust fumes and evaporation from petrol tanks and fuel lines. But the oil industry is looking seriously at ways to prevent vapours from escaping during distribution. BP researchers have produced one of the more innovative solutions by adapting the idea of the wine box. A collapsible plastic bag is placed inside storage tanks and road tankers. The fuel is sealed in the bag and is never exposed to the air at any stage during distribution. Trials have been promising, but the technology is expensive and BP has not decided yet how it will be used. Although technologies designed to prevent evaporation help save a potentially valuable product, the benefits for oil companies are few and the costs high. It is clear that all companies will have to find affordable solutions to the problem of VOCs because the pressures from both regulators and the market look set to increase. 'No one will be able to escape the pressures to control VOC emissions,' says Vernon.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM THE PETROL CHAIN  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source                 Manufacturing   Distribution    Refuelling  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VOC output                    2              3              2 The remainder is from      percent        percent        percent non-automotive sources  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Control                  Control of       Stage 1       a: Stage 2 technology              all fugitive     systems           systems or                          emissions                      b: large carbon                                                            canister  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Reduction                 90 percent     95 percent     a: 75 percent achievable                                              b: 95 percent+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source                            Evaporating      Exhaust  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VOC output                        10 percent       25 percent The remainder is from non-automotive sources  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Control                           small carbon     Three-way technology                          canister       catalyst  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Reduction                          90 percent      90 percent achievable  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Shell (UK)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

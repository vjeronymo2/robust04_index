			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> NBC Merges Production, Distribution Units: National Broadcasting Co. has merged  its in-house production arm, NBC Productions, with its international program  distribution unit, NBC International. The combination more typically reflects  the structure of other production/distribution companies, said Executive Vice  President John Agoglia, and would give each unit better access to the other's  resources. NBC-P produces shows such as "Hardball," "Shannon's Deal" and  "Mancuso, FBI."  </P></p>

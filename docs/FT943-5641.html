			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: MCI ends talks on alliance with Nextel MCI , the US long distance telephone company, has ended talks with Nextel Communications about co-operating in the creation of a new US-wide wireless communications service without reaching agreement, the companies said. Last week, MCI cancelled plans to acquire a 17 per cent stake in Nextel for Dollars 1.3bn in cash, but the companies said they would continue talks aimed at forming a strategic alliance on different terms. MCI said its discussions with Nextel had been positive, but any new transaction would have required Motorola's consent and that MCI and Motorola were unable to reach agreement on terms. Motorola is a Nextel shareholder, with a stake of about 20 per cent in the wireless communications company. MCI's withdrawal is a setback for Nextel, which has announced plans to build a US-wide service offering voice and data communications, two-way paging and radio dispatch services. The telephone company was to been Nextel's marketing partner. Since February, when MCI signed a letter of intent with Nextel, Nextel's share price has fallen sharply. Analysts said that MCI may have been renegotiating the price it agreed to pay for Nextel shares.</p>

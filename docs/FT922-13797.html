			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Beregovoy puts employment first: Opposition clamour over party financing interrupts new premier's speech MR Pierre Beregovoy, France's new prime minister, yesterday undertook to make the fight against unemployment the first priority of his government, but without undermining the existing policy of economic rigour and monetary stability. His opening declaration to the National Assembly, however, was subjected to a systematic barrage of hostile clamour from the conservative opposition benches, indicating that the new government is likely to face a rough ride in the 11 months left before the next general election. Mr Beregovoy lived up to his reputation for straight dealing when he announced that there would be no change in France's electoral system before those elections. Last autumn President Francois Mitterrand urged a shift towards more proportional representation, which set off a ferment of suspicion that he intended to change the voting rules to evade defeat. That way out has now been closed, in a demonstration of the new premier's authority. The crescendo in the uproar came when Mr Beregovoy undertook to wage war against corruption in public life. Scandals concerning illegal party financing have in recent years tarnished the reputation of the French political establishment, especially the Socialist party, and Mr Beregovoy promised his government would give full support to judicial investigations. He said: 'If there are cases which have been delayed, believe me, they will not be delayed any more.' At this point, his speech was effectively drowned out by opposition barracking. Mr Beregovoy then ominously waved a piece of paper which, he said, contained 'a list of persons about whom I might want to speak to you'. After even louder roars of protest, about a quarter of the opposition members walked out. When they had gone, Mr Beregovoy said that none of the names on his list was a member of the National Assembly. To accelerate the recovery, Mr Beregovoy said value added tax applied to cars and luxury goods at a higher rate of 22 per cent would be reduced to the standard rate of 18.6 per cent from next Monday, nine months ahead of the timing set by the European Community's single market. The finance ministry indicated that the VAT cut would cost FFr4.3bn (Pounds 448m) in 1992 and FFr7bn in a full year. But Mr Beregovoy made clear his government intended to maintain a firm grip to control the budget deficit. He promised that by the end of October 900,000 of the long-term unemployed, out of a total figure just short of 3m, would be offered either a job, or training, or a suitable form of community service. In addition, he said the government would promote part-time working, in part by reducing social security charges. He promised that any new spending in the fight against unemployment would be financed either by the sale of state assets or by cost savings. As a gesture of support for nuclear disarmament, meanwhile, finally Mr Beregovoy announced that France would suspend all nuclear weapon tests for the rest of this year.</p>

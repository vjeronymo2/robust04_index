			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher in spite of disappointing GDP Wall Street AFTER trading lower for most of the day on news of weaker economic growth, US share prices moved into positive territory on a surge of late buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 11.62 ahead on balance at 3,425.12. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a net 0.87 up at 438.89 and the Nasdaq composite 0.29 firmer at 658.45. Volume on the New York SE totalled 249.7m shares. Early trading was dominated by a raft of economic data. The good news - a 7,000 decline in weekly jobless claims and a 4.8 per cent rise in March new house sales - was mostly overshadowed by the long-awaited first-quarter gross domestic product report. The Commerce Department announced that GDP grew by an annualised 1.8 per cent in the quarter, compared with 4.7 per cent growth in the previous three months. Although the markets had been bracing themselves for a slowdown in economic growth, the figure was still disappointing, coming in below forecasts of GDP expansion of 2.3 per cent. The markets were also unnerved by news of a 3.3 per cent increase in the implicit price deflator - the measure of inflation published along with the GDP numbers. The news of slowing growth, possibly reviving inflation, and generally depressed equity markets (before yesterday prices had fallen on seven out of the last eight days) all contributed to the early decline. Late in the session a rush of buying helped the leading indices end higher on the day. Improved earnings failed to lift General Motors. The car manufacturer reported first-quarter net income of 42 cents a share, a turnround from the big loss a year earlier. Although the figures were ahead of analysts' expectations, investors took the opportunity to book some profits earned in the stock's recent climb (it started yesterday within Dollars 2 of its 52-week high) and GM shed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40 7/8 in volume of 3.6m shares. UAL fell Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 140 5/8 after the airline group reported a larger than expected quarterly loss of Dollars 5.92 a share, prior to an extraordinary charge. American International Group jumped Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 124 1/2 after the insurer unveiled operating income of Dollars 2.24 a share, up from Dollars 1.91 a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, President Riverboat rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 323 after Missouri legislators passed a bill that will pave the way for riverboat gambling to begin in the state. Canada TORONTO forged ahead in heavy volume, helped by strong showings in transportation, banking and gold issues. The TSE 300 index climbed 44.9 to 3,755.1. Rises led falls by 443 to 262 on 77.5m shares traded. Dealers said a swift fall in interest rates and recovery in the Canadian dollar fuelled gains in banking shares. Twelve of the 14 stock groups rose. Transportation led the way, advancing 3.39 per cent, followed by financial services, up 2.63 per cent. Golds added 1.93 per cent.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / IG Metall leader calls for pay rise above inflation The leader of Germany's powerful IG Metall trade union opened the 1995 pay round yesterday with a demand for a fair share of the benefits from an economic recovery 'built on the backs of the workers'. Mr Klaus Zwickel said the engineering and metalworkers' union would be seeking a settlement above the rate of inflation which also took into account significant increases in productivity. The past three years of real pay cuts were enough, he said in an interview with the mass-circulation daily, Bild. 'We must put an end to this now,' he said. Making his first public contribution to the federal election campaign, Mr Zwickel added that well-off individuals and companies should pay a 'justice levy' to fund social and environmental work projects which would help close the gap between rich and poor. 'We need a government which is ready to squeeze the rich to fight poverty,' he said. Although engineering pay negotiations are not due to start until the end of the year, the interview prodded the political and industrial opposition into instant rejection. Mr Klaus Bregger, a Christian Democrat lobbyist for independent businesses, said the proposal was completely wrong for the current circumstances. Mr Tyll Necker, president of the federation of German industry, said companies already faced extra payroll tax charges, higher health insurance premiums and insurance taxes in 1995. Further charges would endanger jobs, he said. Yesterday's brief skirmish marked the start of an annual position-taking ritual preceding formal negotiations. Mr Zwickel's demands suggest that while last year's campaign foundered in the recession, the union had been emboldened by mounting indications that economic recovery was under way. Earlier this week unexpectedly high manufacturing orders and a sharp fall in July unemployment prompted economists to start revising their economic growth forecasts for this year and next. Despite the moderation of Mr Zwickel's tone, the interview will put government, companies and the Bundesbank on the alert for a potentially testing time over the winter.

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SIGNALS ON ARMS CONTROL'  </P> <P> Your Jan. 29 editorial "Signals on Arms Control" suggests that the Bush  Administration's recent rhetorical "signals of restraint" on the strategic  defense initiative marks a "bold departure from the traditional White House  approach to arms control." In point of fact unilateral arms control has been a  periodic component of U.S. policy. However, its ability to induce Moscow to  respond in kind is mixed.  </P> <P> On the down side the Soviets never reciprocated U.S. decisions not to deploy  ABM, IRBM's in Europe, anti-satellite weapons and a 1969 moratorium on the  production of chemical weapons. On the up side U.S. unilateral actions not to  orbit nuclear weapons in space (1962), not to test nuclear weapons in the  atmosphere (1963), to cut production of high enriched uranium (1964), to  withdraw troops from Europe (1964) and to cease production of biological  weapons (1969) served to spark Soviet reciprocation that in some cases was  consummated in formal conventions. Often the motive behind these initiatives  reflected more a military or other inutility of the phenomenon restrained than  an effort to contain the arms competition generally. Thus Washington cut back  the production of high enriched uranium because it had an overabundance; it  ceased atmospheric nuclear test in response to environmental concerns knowing  that it had an underground testing alternative; it stopped producing biological  weapons because battlefield use was impractical.  </P> <P> Congress has played a greater role in unilaterally restraining American arms  than The Times suggests. During the Reagan years, in addition to slowing  development of anti-satellite systems, Congress withheld funds for the MX and  later limited its numbers, fought for a narrow interpretation of the ABM  treaty, cut allocation requests for SDI and postponed testing of a 12-warhead  Trident II.  </P> <P> Whether, as The Times implies, unilateral initiatives will be materially more  fruitful in controlling arms in the current Soviet-American detente than  heretofore is a matter worth exploring. However, we must concede that along  with apparent advantages -- namely, avoidance of prolonged negotiations --  unilateral restraint is no panacea. Because it is not subject to verification,  cheating is easier than codified arms control. And because it is not embodied  in a treaty, it is more easily reversible.  </P> <P> BENNETT RAMBERG  </P> <P> Senior Research Associate  </P> <P> UCLA Center for International  </P> <P> and Strategic Affairs  </P></p>

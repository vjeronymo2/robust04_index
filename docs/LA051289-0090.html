			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Producer Elliot Kastner is seeking $6 million from Al Pacino, claiming the  actor reneged on an agreement to star in the film "Carlito's Way." The lawsuit,  filed in Los Angeles federal court, claims Pacino worked hand-in-hand with  Kastner and co-plaintiff Cinema Corp. of America for more than a year in  writing the screenplay, selecting co-stars and rehearsing. "Nonetheless, at the  11th hour, Pacino announced he did not intend to fulfill his promises," says  the breach-of-contract and bad faith complaint, which seeks $1 million in  actual costs spent on the aborted project and $5 million in punitive damages.

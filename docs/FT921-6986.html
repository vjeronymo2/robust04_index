			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Court to review Rico ruling THE US Supreme Court agreed yesterday to decide whether accounting firms can be sued under federal racketeering laws if the firms falsify a client's financial statements, Bloomberg reports from Washington. The judges agreed to hear arguments in a case involving a farm co-operative that filed for bankruptcy in 1984. After entering bankruptcy proceedings, the co-op's trustee and investors sued Arthur Young &amp; Co, the co-op's auditor, alleging that the firm misrepresented the financial condition of the co-op to its board of directors. The investors sued under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico), designed to be used against organised crime. The Court of Appeals dismissed the suit ruling that Arthur Young's preparation of financial statements did not mean the firm was involved in the co-op's fraudulent affairs. The Supreme Court is to review the decision.</p>

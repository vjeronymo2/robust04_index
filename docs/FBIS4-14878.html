			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by Dmitriy </F> Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, and Vitaliy Trubetskoy]    [text] Prime Minister of Czechia Vaclav Klaus is at the  start of a two-day visit to Moscow, the first such visit to  Russia by a Czech head of government. The two countries are  expected to sign an agreement on investment protection and  possibly, a protocol on this year's bilateral trade, a senior  Russian diplomat told INTERFAX on Monday.    He said the two papers were almost ready for signing though  some technicalities remained in the second draft but "these will  have been resolved."    The diplomat spoke of no painful issues in relations between  Moscow and Prague. He described them as good though admitting  to some problems as well including the former Soviet Union's  debt to ex-Czechoslovakia. "The trouble is both of them do no  longer exist, but this is not to say the problem is insoluble,"  he said.</p>

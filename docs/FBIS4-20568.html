			<p>Commuter   Helicopter   <F P=102> 94P60164 Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Mar 94 p  1-- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94P60164 </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text]    A new research project has been presented that will focus on  the advanced technology required by the next generation of  helicopters. According to sources, the Japan Key Tech Center  will spearhead establishment of a research corporation at the  end of March with collaboration of five private manufacturers  including Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Shimadzii Corporation.  They plan to jointly invest a total of 9 billion yen during the  7-year period by the end of the year 2000. The project's  objectives are to establish a technology for reduced noise,  safety and scheduled flight in order to develop high operability  commuter helicopters less dependent on good weather or pilot  skill. Based on the research results, the project will be  expanded to include joint development with overseas aircraft and  helicopter manufacturers.    The ability of helicopters to take off and land at urban  heliports has attracted considerable attention as part of a high  speed transportation system in the 21st century. In addition to  the Japan Key Tech Center (investment rate:59.9%), 5  private  companies including Kawasaki Heavy Industries. Ltd.  (19.3%),  Shimadzu Corporation (3. 6%), Tokyo Avionics Instruments  (3.3%). Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd. (2.3%), and Japan  Aircraft Mfg.  Co.. Ltd., (l.6%) have jointly invested to establish a  research  development corporation called. ``The Commuter Helicopter  Advanced Technology Research Corporation,'' (tentative name) on  2l March. The headquarters will be located at KHI's Gifu Plant.  KHI President Hiroshi Oba will also hold the presidency of the  new research company.    The research will include ``outside aircraft noise reduction  technology'' for quieter rotor systems using the latest computer  fluid analysis technology, a control system for easy operation,  and ``flight safety technology'' which combines flight and  management systems. The research will be funded at a level of 9  billion yen during the 7-year period by the end of the year  2000. Helicopter pilots will concentrate only on conducting  flight safety.    Details of the research schedule include concept study,  specifications at the system level, and system initiatives in  FY94, basic level research and testing in FY95-97, testing at  the system and operational levels, and evaluation of research  objectives in FY98-2000.    Environmental safety and expansion of the helicopter market  are expected to be realized through establishment of this key  technology. It eventually will lead to technology exchange and  international joint development. Also a wide range of  applications in other areas such as general purpose helicopters,  ship navigation support systems, and reduced noise blower are  said to be possible</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tony Blair calls for new sense of direction for Labour LABOUR must champion a new relationship between society and the individual which embraces public intervention but safeguards individual freedoms, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said last night, Michael Cassell writes. Mr Blair said the party must grasp the ideological initiative and provide a lead for a country which had lost its sense of purpose and direction. Giving the tenth Arnold Goodman charity lecture, Mr Blair said he wanted to see 'a new concept of citizenship in which rights and responsibilities go together and where we cease to posit an entirely false choice between social and personal responsibility'. The purpose of economic and social policy, he said, should be to extend opportunity, remove the underlying causes of social alienation and also take tough measures to ensure that chances extended to people were taken up.</p>

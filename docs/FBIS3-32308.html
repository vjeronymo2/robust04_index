The objective of this  meeting slated for the second half of 1994 is "to cloud the  broad continental recognition that Cuba has received in Latin  American summits," published GRANMA, the official Communist  Party of Cuba mouthpiece.    If Washington "intends at this stage to use their summit  against Cuba, we believe they are too late. All the world's  unipolarity could not attain such a goal, as anachronistic as it  is shameful," according to the newspaper.    President Fidel Castro had also condemned this summit of  Latin American heads of state organized by Washington when  closing the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting held in  Havana on 28 January. "They want to hold summit meetings without  Cuba, to make us even more isolated, to make their criminal  blockade even more rigorous," Castro said when referring to  Washington's decision announced by Vice President Al Gore during  a visit to Mexico.    The Cuban Government has taken part in three Ibero-American  summits -- Guadalajara, Mexico in 1991; Madrid, Spain in 1992;  and Salvador de Bahia, Brazil in 1993.    GRANMA also charged that Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di  Tella had spoken as if he were the official State Department  spokesman when he said in Washington that the summit had been  postponed until Secretary of State Warren Christopher completes  a tour of the area.    OAS spokesmen praised the summit but warned that it should  not be held without the OAS because there is no need to  duplicate continental mechanisms.    One previous summit of American heads of state was held in  Panama (1955) and summoned by U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower.  The other was held in Punta del Este (Uruguay/1967) at the  request of Lyndon B. Johnson.    The Cuban newspaper recalled statements attributed to  Professor Henry Raymont, an expert in Latin American studies,  who says that the United States should have summoned the summit  within the framework of the OAS, from which the Fidel Castro  government has been suspended since 1962.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Traders sit tight ahead of Budget THE GILT market is showing all the characteristics of a rabbit caught in a car's headlights. Apart from Thursday's exhaustion of the Bank of England's latest tap stock, poor trade figures and a three-point lead for Labour in an opinion poll failed to provoke much activity in the market. Like the rabbit, the market is showing signs of paralysis, not daring to move until the Budget, followed closely by the election, ends the uncertainty hanging over gilts. The market appears to be shrugging off the bad news in the hope that some good news will be generated by the Budget. As Mr Mark Cliffe, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, said: 'Everybody is looking at the Budget to provide the vital spark that will give the Conservatives a convincing lead in the opinion polls.' So, unless next week delivers any shock poll forecasts, it is hard to imagine the market doing anything dramatic on the downside before the Budget on March 10. And with little economic data next week, the market should trade in a fairly narrow range. All this helps explain not just the stagnation in the market, but its general robustness in the face of a run of bad economic data. Take the trade figures. Even with the usual government warning not to read too much into one month's figures, January's trade deficit came as a shock. The current account deficit virtually doubled from Pounds 409m in December to Pounds 794m in January as the value of exports fell by 7.5 per cent over the month. The value of imports also fell, but by less than the fall in exports. But reaction in the gilt market was muted. The generally positive mood was only slightly dampened with the 2003/07 bond gaining a point on the day. The coolness with which the markets have received the bad news suggests a certain amount of complacency over the outcome of the general election. Either this reflects indifference to the outcome or confidence that the Conservatives will win. A Reuters survey of 41 economists showed they were split between a Conservative victory and a hung parliament. Speculation over a base rate cut will continue next week. Gilts specialists said money market rates should fluctuate on continued hopes of a cut, but the authorities were only likely to relax monetary policy once they had gauged sterling's reaction to the Budget. This means that with the Conservatives likely to announce the election by the end of Budget week, the opportunity for cutting base rates has been effectively limited to between March 11 and March 13, since they are unlikely to cut interest rates during the election campaign. The only significant activity over the week was the exhaustion on Thursday of the Bank of England's tap stock - with a 9 per cent coupon maturing in 2012 - when gilts opened marginally higher. The tap has acted as a ceiling at the long end of the market. Now it has shifted, analysts say prices are free to rise higher. With so little activity in the market, analysts were generally unable to pin-point the reason for the tap stock's exhaustion. One suggestion was that the market-makers had left themselves slightly short. There was no new issuance from the Bank of England on Friday but plenty of speculation as to how the Bank would handle issuance over the budget. Some gilts specialists expect to see a tap tranche of around Pounds 1bn issued at the beginning of this week, which the Bank will allow to sit on its books, ready and waiting to be tapped by bubbly post-Budget markets. The consensus was that it would be a short-dated tranche. Prices crept slightly upwards last week. The 9 per cent conversion stock (type-B), due in 2011, rose about half a point on the week, yielding 9.16 per cent at the close on Friday.</p>

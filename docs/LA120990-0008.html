			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREEZE IN TRANSLATION  </P> <P> Me, I like to putz in the kitchen and regard  </P> <P> fat garlic and hum about nothing. Make it up.  </P> <P> Word  </P> <P> for blues.  </P> <P> Like dragging down the street  </P> <P> in a hundred-and-four heat -- you know  </P> <P> when air temp tops body temp, how buzzed  </P> <P> and weird  </P> <P> you get? Word for trance. So this character  </P> <P> taps me: remember me, mon amie? Name's  </P> <P> Breeze. Then she dictates most fabulous. I'm  </P> <P> blessed. She's benign. Word for pixilated.  </P> <P> She's a scholarship girl at the School of  </P> <P> Fine Arts  </P> <P> so she drags me down the line to an out-of-town  </P> <P> show. Rattle express. Word for  </P> <P> kismet. This lady with the face of an old walnut  </P> <P> sits by us making lace with an eye-fine  </P> <P> hook and when the train dives into the tunnels  </P> <P> she keeps working in the dark. Word's  </P> <P> exquisite. Breeze sings  </P> <P> scat all the way to the opening:  </P> <P> sculpture of heating ducts, stovepipes and stones.  </P> <P> Breeze is prole to the bone. The tablecloth's  </P> <P> splattered with blood of the lamb,  </P> <P> wine on the lace. The critic pronounces  </P> <P> optimism  </P> <P> vulgar, and asks: Why have there been so few  </P> <P> great women artists?  </P> <P> We ask ourselves. The word is  </P> <P> jerkoff. Breeze, who is terrifyingly fluent,  </P> <P> challenges him to sew a bride's dress. From  </P> <P> scratch. Femmes aux barricades! The critic  </P> <P> can't weave  </P> <P> a cat's cradle. Breeze spits: By hand. French lace.  </P> <P> From "Refuge" (University of Pittsburgh Press: $16.95 cloth; $8.95 paper; 73  pp.). Belle Waring is a Virginia native who teaches on the Field Faculty of the  Vermont College MFA program and works as a registered nurse. 1990 Belle Waring.  </P> <P> </P></p>

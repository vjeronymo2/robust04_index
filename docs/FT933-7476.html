			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / GE to cut 4,000 more jobs at jet engine division THE jet engine division of GE of the US is making 4,000 more workers redundant, taking the total to 12,000 in the past two years. Declining demand for civilian and military aircraft is behind the latest cuts, which echo those made at rival engine-maker Pratt &amp; Whitney, writes Richard Waters in New York. Most of the jobs will go by the end of this year, reducing employment in the GE Aircraft Engines division to 22,000, from 34,000 two years ago. They will be concentrated among salaried employees rather than hourly-paid workers, with at least half coming from the division's headquarters in Cincinnati. Pratt &amp; Whitney said yesterday that it was reviewing its staffing levels 'on a continuous basis'. Its workforce has fallen from 44,400 at the end of 1991 to 35,000, and will drop to 30,000 by the end of next year. Orders for new engines remain weak, it said.</p>

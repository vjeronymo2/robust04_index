			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE TO TOUR MIDDLE EAST IN QUEST FOR PEACE  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will begin a five-nation tour of  the Middle East this week aimed at achieving a "tangible breakthrough" in  settling the Arab-Israeli conflict, an official said.  </P> <P> Vadim Perfiliev, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Shevardnadze will  visit Syria Feb. 17-19, Jordan on Feb. 19, Egypt, Feb. 20-22; Iraq, Feb. 23-25,  and Iran, Feb. 25-27.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze's visit is evidence of an increasing Soviet role in the Middle  East.  </P> <P> According to Perfiliev, Shevardnadze's trip "will take place in the framework  of the Soviet Union's consistent efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just  settlement in the Middle East, taking into account the interests of all people  involved."  </P> <P> "We seek to attain a tangible breakthrough in settling this old conflict," he  said, without elaborating.  </P> <P> The Kremlin supports the idea of an international Middle East peace conference  to be attended by the parties to the conflict, plus the United States, Soviet  Union and other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.  </P> <P> Israel has made restoration of Soviet-Israeli relations, severed by the Soviet  Union in 1967, a precondition for a Soviet role in Mideast talks.  </P> <P> Jordan's King Hussein said Sunday he was "quite optimistic" an international  conference on Arab-Israeli peace could take place soon.  </P> <P> In response to a reporter's question, Perfiliev said he does not know whether  Shevardnadze will meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens or with Yasser  Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel has refused to  take part in any negotiations involving the PLO.  </P></p>

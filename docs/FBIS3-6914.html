			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "Future Development of the </F> Situation Will Entirely Depend on the United States"]    [Text] The United States again adhered to the policy of  pressuring and crushing our republic.    As already reported, the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman  issued a statement manifesting the position of our republic  regarding the undisguised attempt of the United States to crush  [apsal] our republic with strong measures [kangkwon] and  pressure by reversing the agreement of the 25 February DPRK-U.S.  New York contact.    In the statement, the spokesman revealed the good intentions  [sonui] implemented by our republic and the traitorous act  [paesin haengwi] taken by the United States in the course of  carrying out the four-point simultaneous action steps agreed to  at the 25 February DPRK-U.S. New York contact. The spokesman  said that the United States showed its intention to resume the  1994 Team Spirit joint military exercise at last and to impose  sanctions on us at the UN Security Council on the pretext of the  issue of inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] and of the exchange of North-South special envoys.  Concerning this situation, the spokesman clearly stated that we  cannot unilaterally fulfill obligations put forward in the  four-point simultaneous action steps, nor can we ensure the  continuity of safeguards of the IAEA.    This is just exercising the sovereignty of our republic. As  was known, our republic made sincere efforts to fairly resolve  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula after the agreement  reached at the DPRK-U.S. New York contact last month.    We explicitly ensured all conditions so that the inspection  activities would be carried out to a sufficient extent for the  continuity of safeguards for seven declared facilities.  Moreover, we expressed magnanimity toward accepting all demands  put forward by the inspection team members concerning the issues  that went far beyond the scope of ensuring the continuity of  safeguards.    We put forward concrete measures and a reasonable method for  realizing at an early date the exchange of special envoys of the  North and the South, which the United States raised as a  precondition.    Nevertheless, going counter to this, the United States has  never carried out the portion that it should have fulfilled  [chagi halparul chonhyo ihaeing haji anta], and by continually  presenting unreasonable pretexts, the United States has laid a  barrier to implementing the four-point simultaneous action steps.    Even after suspending the 1994 Team Spirit joint military  exercise and announcing the date of the third round of DPRK-U.S.  talks, the United States persistently put forward the  unreasonable preconditions that only after the IAEA inspection  is carried out satisfactorily and the exchange of special envoys  is realized, can these problems be resolved. Now claiming that  the IAEA inspection is not satisfactory, the United States  insisted that the inspection must be conducted again. The  United States also asserted that if the exchange of North-South  special envoys is not realized, it will not hold a third round  of DPRK-U.S. talks.    What is more grave is that the United States claimed that it  will refer our so-called nuclear issue to the UN Security  Council. This is an act that can be carried out only by the  Americans, who have not freed themselves from the concept of the  cold war.    As for inspection of our nuclear facilities, of which the  United States is making an issue, the fact that nuclear  materials in our nuclear facilities were not diverted for other  purposes could be sufficiently verified by the recent inspection  activities and the continuity of safeguards could be firmly  ensured.    From the outset, the IAEA Secretariat, violating the 15  February Vienna agreement by pursuing other purposes, demanded  the inspection equivalent to regular and nonregular inspections  based on the nuclear safeguards accord, instead of inspection  for ensuring the continuity of safeguards.    This illustrates that the United States and the IAEA, from  the beginning, attempted to internationally isolate and crush us  on the pretext of the nuclear problem.    As for the issue of exchanging North-South special envoys,  the agreement of the 25 February DPRK-U.S. New York contact only  points out the resumption of working-level contact for the  exchange of North-South special envoys. However, the United  States stubbornly put forward the issue of realizing the  exchange of North-South special envoys. This means violation of  the agreement of the DPRK- U.S. New York contact.    As mentioned earlier, the United States is busily going  round  in an attempt to refer our nuclear issue to the UN Security  Council. Timed to coincide with this, the IAEA held a meeting of  its Board of Governors and waged a campaign of adopting a  resolution against us.    To cope with such an unreasonable act [pudanghan haengdong]  by the United States and the IAEA, our republic manifested the  position of not dispatching its delegation to a third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks.    The rupture [kyollyol] of DPRK-U.S. talks is entirely  attributed to the unjust position and attitude of the United  States. Therefore, the situation on the Korean peninsula is  again entering a dangerous phase.    The United States showed the move to resume the Team Spirit  joint military exercise. Foreign reports noted that a U.S.  naval fleet composed of 30 ships is approaching the water zone  of the Korean peninsula. The world expressed deep concern over  such a dangerous act by the United States.    As long as the United States is attempting to crush our  republic by all means using the nuclear issue and DPRK-U.S.  talks, it is just for our republic to take self-defensive steps.  As we have repeatedly declared, we are prepared for dialogue  and for war.    The United States should ponder the grave situation  [omjunghan chongse] prevailing on the Korean peninsula. The  future development of the situation will totally depend on the  United States.    We will watch the United States act.</p>

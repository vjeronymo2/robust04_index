			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / TUC attacks proposal for Acas A PROPOSED change to the duties of Acas, the conciliation service, would breach commitments imposed by international law, the Trades Union Congress said yesterday. The government's Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill, now before parliament, removes from Acas the duty to encourage collective bargaining. The TUC argues that this would breach the International Labour Organisation's Convention 98. This obliges signatories, which include Britain, to encourage full development and use of arrangements for collective negotiations.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Treasury clears way for release of banks from charity control The Italian treasury has cleared the way for publicly owned charitable foundations to give up majority control of many of Italy's banks, in an attempt to encourage further modernisation of the fragmented banking sector, writes Andrew Hill. Mr Lamberto Dini, treasury minister, has approved a directive which obliges the foundations to find new ways of funding their charitable activities over the next five years. It will also provide fiscal incentives for the foundations to 'privatise' their banking subsidiaries by selling off more than 50 per cent of the shares. Following the 1990 reforms, banking subsidiaries could be transformed into joint stock companies but foundations had to retain a controlling stake.</p>

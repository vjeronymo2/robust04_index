			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic Thursday [3 March] rapped the United States for  replacing the role of the United Nations and other international  institutions to arrange a federation agreement between the  Bosnian Muslims and Croats.    Speaking to the press after returning from a visit to  Moscow,  Karadzic said the Serb side would do all it can to maintain  peace on all fronts, so that the new round of peace talks would  be held in a possibly good atmosphere.    He also stressed that the alliance between Muslims and  Croats  should not be allowed to hurt the Serbs.    "It is no good for the United States to replace the role of  the United Nations and other international institutions," he  said.    The Bosnian Muslims and Croats reached an agreement this  week  in Washington to set up a federation. The United States was the  arranger of the talks for the agreement.    Karadzic also said that since Washington has hosted the  talks  on Bosnia, why should Moscow not host other talks?    He said that Russia's participation in peace efforts in  Bosnia has a "decisive meaning" and would establish a balance of  power in the international scene.    In another development, the UN Secretary general Butrus  Butrus-Ghali told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the  four Galeb combat aircrafts shot down by NATO forces on February  28 took off from Serb-controlled area in Croatia.</p>

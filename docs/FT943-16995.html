			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Up to date with EU legislation Tracking the legislation pouring out of the European Union is a time-consuming but increasingly important task for businesses affected by EC directives. Reuters Business Information, a subsidiary of Reuters, has launched an on-line business information service called European Union Briefing, designed to help researchers monitoring EU developments. The service offers subscribers breaking news from Reuters, with access to a five-year archive of 600 publications. The system has a document number search facility to allow specific legislation to be tracked quickly. The information can be retrieved using a personal computer, which connects to Reuters databases using a modem or other external connection. Reuter EU Briefing costs Pounds 400 per month for 20 hours of on-line search time. Reuters: UK, 071 324 5184.</p>

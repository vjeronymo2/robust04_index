			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee  has concluded its second round of talks at the Foreign Ministry.  Details are in the following report by our political affairs  correspondent:    The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee this  evening  concluded its second round of talks at the Foreign Ministry. In  statements to reporters, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of  information and minister of state for cabinet affairs, said:    [Begin recording] [al-'Anani] In fact, our talks were very  serious and candid. The issues were discussed in detail in  order to arrive at tangible, practical, and implementable steps  that people can feel. Therefore, at this stage, we will meet  again tomorrow morning and perhaps tomorrow afternoon and even  on Friday morning so that we can arrive at decisive results,  because this is the purpose of these talks at this level. We  are also taking into consideration that people are awaiting  tangible results, which require very serious and clear talks  that define the frameworks and practical steps. We both agreed  that if we do not arrive at such results, then we will not have  met the people's expectations.    [Reporter] So, Mr. Abu-Ahmad [al-'Anani], are there any  pending issues between the two sides?    [Al-'Anani] We are discussing all issues that are of  importance to both sides, especially at this stage.    [Reporter] Did the discussions focus on specific issues?    [Al-'Anani] Of course, we discussed many basic issues,  including economic and banking issues, issues that deal with the  negotiations on water, evacuees, and refugees, the Jerusalem  issue, as well as the need to coordinate stands on these issues  and others that deal with the transitional phase and what is  currently being negotiated in this regard to serve the two  parties' interests. We, of course, have joint interests and  what harms the Palestinians harms us and what benefits our  brothers and kinfolk in the West Bank and Gaza Strip benefits us  here in Jordan.

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Employers collude in benefits frauds Employers have been colluding with workers to claim unemployment benefits fraudulently, according to government inspectors who last year made net savings of Pounds 53m after stopping benefit frauds. The Employment Service, part of the employment department, has targeted employers as part of a clampdown on 'dole cheats'. Mr James Paice, employment minister, said: 'The majority of benefit claimants are genuine and their needs will be met by the taxpayer. But today's figures clearly demonstrate that there are still people who are working and claiming benefits illegally. 'There are others who help their workforce to commit dole fraud, some even to the extent that they give employees time to sign on.' The fraud teams' investigations led to more than 69,500 withdrawals of or reductions in benefit payments. More than 3,600 claimants were prosecuted, as were 100 employers for colluding in the fraud. Those implicated included more than 400 flower-pickers in Cornwall, saving Pounds 370,000; and more than 500 people working in leisure industries at coastal resorts in Wales, saving Pounds 562,000.</p>

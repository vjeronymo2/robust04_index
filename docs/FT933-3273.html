			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Moscow to finance deficit with gold sales THE Russian government plans to sell Rbs1,000bn (Pounds 600m) worth of gold to Russian commercial banks as part of the Finance Ministry's battle to bring the gaping budget deficit under control, Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, said yesterday. Mr Alexashenko, who is responsible for budget policy, said in an interview that the government was arranging to sell to banks certificates - at prices based on the international gold futures market - guaranteeing to deliver the gold in a year's time. He also said that Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, had threatened to resign unless the government implements emergency tax increases as part of a strategy to save Russia from Ukrainian-style hyper-inflation resulting from the unlimited use of printing presses to finance the budget deficit. The budget is at the centre of the conflict between President Boris Yeltsin and the parliament. The parliament wants to increase the government's deficit by far more than that foreseen by the Yeltsin-backed budget it has rejected. Because of conservative ministers' support for parliament's free-spending instincts, the budget has also become a crucial test of Mr Yeltsin's own commitment to financial stabilisation policies he himself launched and which are a condition for further IMF assistance. Crowning the Finance Ministry's strategy is a plan to introduce a uniform tax system from next January, applicable to all of Russia's 89 republics and regions. The aim is to do away with the present system, which is threatening Russia with disintegration, of individual bargaining for each region and republic on how much tax revenue they can keep for themselves.</p>

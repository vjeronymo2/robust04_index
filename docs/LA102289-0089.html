			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESIGN ARGUMENT AND EINSTEIN  </P> <P> The letter by Dean A. Ohlman (Oct. 11), bringing up the ancient and  long-refuted "design argument" for a creator, as an attempt to refute  evolution, recalls to me a 45-year-old exchange of letters I had with Albert  Einstein.  </P> <P> During a shipboard discussion in the Pacific on June 9, 1945, this "design"  argument (with others) was presented to me with the claim that the argument had  convinced Einstein of the existence of a supernatural creator. Personally  doubting this claim, I wrote a letter to Einstein the next day, addressed to  Princeton University, where he then taught.  </P> <P> In my letter, I pointed out among other things that "I questioned the universe  being a design; in evolution I see an explanation of the complexity of plant  and animal life . . . But even if there was a 'designer' that would give only a  re-arranger, not a creator, and again assuming a designer, you are back where  you started by being forced to admit a designer of the designer, etc., etc. . .  ."  </P> <P> To my surprise, I received a reply from Einstein dated July 2. Said he: ". . .  I am astonished by the audacity to tell such lies about me. . . . Your  counter-arguments seem to me very correct and could hardly be better  formulated. It is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in  dealing with things outside the human sphere -- childish analogies. We have to  admire in humility the beautiful harmony of the structure of the world -- as  far as we can grasp it. And that is all. With best wishes, yours sincerely, A.  Einstein."  </P> <P> I fear that Mr. Ohlman suffers, as probably most people do, from a grievous  lack of education in the history of science, if he believes that traditional  myths of creation found in many religions should be taught in science  departments. The primary place for the teachingof such myths should be in the  temples and churches of the various religions which advocate them.  </P> <P> However, the courts are willing for them to be taught (not advocated) in  literature or other departments if schools and colleges wish; but few would  agree that public schools should teach only one religion's version of creation.  If it is to be included somewhere in the curriculum, it must in fairness teach  what a range of religions believe on the subject: Christian, Hindu, Shinto,  Taoist and others.  </P> <P> GUY RANER  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P></p>

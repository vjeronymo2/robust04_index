			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow, January 19 (TASS) -- The examination of  reasons for the resignation of First Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar  and the situation on Russia's money markets are principal topics  in today's Russian newspapers.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent, who analyses reasons for  Gaydar's resignation, believes that the resignation itself  speaks volumes. It is now a question of "two basically  different tactics of reformers. The first one is to remain in  the government and fulfil their promises: to secure a 5-7  percent inflation rate by the end of the year, financial  stabilisation, a favourable investment climate, a slowdown in  production downturn, and a gradual rise in production on a basis  not connected with an additional emission of money."    "The reformers lack confidence that they will manage to  implement this programme. Naturally, they have no desire to  share responsibility with inflationists for economic failures.  It means that it is essential to quit the government -- hence  the second tactic of reformers."    TRUD is of the opinion that "although the government  composition remains unknown so far, the reform-minded wing is  rapidly dwindling. The newspaper corroborates this thought by  maintaining that "government executives, apparently,  increasingly incline towards cooperation with the Agrarian  Party's parliamentary group who support Aleksandr Zaveryukha,  and with the industrial chiefs.    "At any rate, Oleg Soskovets on Tuesday attended a meeting  with regional industrialists who were summoned by Arkady Volsky,  while Viktor Chernomyrdin gave preference to Aleksandr  Zaveryukha and Viktor Gerashchenko over Yegor Gaydar and Boris  Fyodorov".    IZVESTIYA on Yegor Gaydar's resignation:    "The money market reacted with panic to the chief  monetarist's resignation". "It is obvious that the present panic  on the money market has been caused by a government reshuffle.  The voluntary resignation of Yegor Gaydar, who personifies the  policy of rigid financial stabilisation, has influenced the  money market situation most of all".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the formation of the State Duma  committees.    The newspaper points out that "Andrey Kozyrev states that  Russia's foreign policy is a presidential one. However,  following the formation of the Duma committees, this postulate  is not so unambiguous. At least, four of the committees can,  and are likely to, lay claim to securing that their opinion are  taken into account: on security, international affairs, on CIS  affairs, and on geopolitical issues. The latter committee is  sure to go farther in this respect than others, if only because  it is headed by Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) representatives  Viktor Ustinov and his deputy Mikhail Sidorov. The LDPR did not  manifest even a hint of agreement with the Yeltsin-Kozyrev  foreign policy course"    "Thus, there are all prerequisites for the shaping of a  Duma-president opposition over his minister of foreign affairs  on practically all foreign policy aspects".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Federation Council:    "Battles in the upper house of parliament lie ahead". "The  lack of conflicts at the beginning of the federation councils's  work led parliament analysts to conclude: The federation  council is fully controlled by the president.    "However, Russian senators themselves do not think so. `The  president simply had no occasion to get to know the true colours  of the federation council, because the deputies themselves,  primarily regional leaders, have no clear idea of their role in  the upper house of parliament', a Federation Council member told  the newspaper".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on prospects for Russian-U.S.  cooperation in space research.    The newspaper points out that in the middle of December last  year, the two main space-faring powers determined a program for  10 U.S. space shuttle flights to the orbital complex Mir. At  the same time U.S. astronauts are to work aboard the Mir station  for an aggregate of about two years, "drawing on our experience  in long- duration space expeditions. A date for the blast-off  of a U.S space shuttle, with Russian cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev  on board, has also been decided upon. The weeklong flight is  scheduled for the beginning of February 1994.".    PRAVDA carries a statement by the leaders of some parties  and  public organisations "on the non-legitimate nature of the  constitution brought up for the referendum by President Boris  Yeltsin".    "The text of the constitution brought up for the referendum  of December 12, 1993, revives an authoritarian system in the  Russian Federation. During the holding of the referendum on the  draft constitution, most flagrant breaches of the Russian  Federation's 1978 constitution (with subsequent changes) and the  1990 law on referenda were committed," the statement said.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, analysing the forthcoming transfer by  Ukraine of all of its 2,000 nuclear weapons to Russia for  subsequent dismantling and elimination, observes that "it is  well known what will be the benefits of Ukraine's nuclear  disarmament for the whole world. The 'nuclear club' will not  expand. There will be no precedent that would enable Pakistan,  India or Israel to join it. It is unclear, though, how will  Russia benefit from that".    "For the sake of eliminating Ukrainian nuclear weapons, the  United States assigns 60 million dollars to Russia in the form  of an advance payment for its yet unsold uranium".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA frontpages an interview with Tajikistan  parliament chief Emomali Rakhmanov who said: "Of course, the  country is still far from complete tranquility in the political  life and order in the economy. The main thing that we strove to  do was to unite the people".</p>

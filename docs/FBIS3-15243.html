			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 3 Mar -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher expressed understanding of our concern for the  plight of 25 million Russians who find themselves stranded  outside Russia's borders, and we highly appreciate this  position, Andrey Kozyrev said. Answering a question from an  ITAR-TASS correspondent today, the Russian foreign minister  noted that in his recent statement, Christopher spoke of the  need to use legal ways of encouraging the Latvians to expand  citizenship and grant voting rights to Russians living in  Latvia. In the minister's view, this pronouncement sits well  with President Bill Clinton's intention of speaking up for  minorities in the Baltic countries, a subject which was also  discussed at the Moscow summit.    Andrey Kozyrev stressed that magnanimity on the part of the  Baltic authorities could hardly be counted on in this respect,  any more than threats of force on the part of Russia, something  which was in vogue until recently. "We are dealing with a  humanitarian problem -- protection of human rights and ethnic  minorities, and it needs to be treated as such," Kozyrev said.  In conclusion, the minister noted with satisfaction that "our  friends in the West are gradually getting used to this idea, and  losing their traditional bias towards individual regions".</p>

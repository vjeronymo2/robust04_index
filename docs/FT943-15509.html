			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Dealers prepare for flurry of issues next week Dealers are bracing themselves for a potential slew of issues next week, including global fixed-rate offerings for Finland and Freddie Mac, and Dollars 4bn equivalent of floating-rate notes for Italy, split between yen, dollars and D-Marks. Freddie Mac's Dollars 1.5bn five-year global issue, for which an investor roadshow is being held in London today, is due to be priced early next week. The yield spread is expected to be 15-18 basis points over the five-year US Treasury yield. Finland's 10-year deal, arranged by Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, is also likely to be launched early next week at a spread of about 50 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield. In addition, at least two other sovereign borrowers were looking at the market, dealers said. 'You can still get global deals away, even though it's a difficult market,' said one trader. However, he added that market sentiment remained fragile, and strong employment data on Friday or disappointment with the Group of Seven summit of industrial nations in Naples at the weekend could spark further weakness. Several more offerings emerged yesterday in the yen sector, where activity has been lifted by strong demand for yen assets in Japan. Japanese investors are cash-rich, having liquidated dollar assets due to the weakness of the US currency. Deutsche Bank launched a Y50bn issue of five-year notes, with a spread of 40 basis points over the comparable Japanese government bond yield. However, dealers said that Japanese investors were focusing on the 4 1/8 per cent coupon, rather than the spread. Because of the strong appeal of the Deutsche name, there was also some placement in Europe, lead manager Merrill Lynch said. Two other deals, aimed largely at the Japanese market, were launched for Mitsubishi Corporation and NTT Data, via IBJ.</p>

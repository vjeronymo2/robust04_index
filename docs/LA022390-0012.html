			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOON, RESURGENT VAN NUYS FACE NARBONNE IN GIRLS' SEMIFINAL  </P> <P> Surprising Van Nuys High, which unseated North Hollywood as Mid-Valley League  girls' basketball champion and qualified for postseason play for the first time  in four years, hopes to continue its unexpected success today at the Sports  Arena.  </P> <P> Van Nuys will meet Narbonne in the City Section 3-A Division semifinals at 2:30  p.m. The Wolves are 22-3, 10-0 in league play, and have undergone a resurgence  under second-year Coach Tony Magnante.  </P> <P> Magnante has fashioned a winning season around 6-foot center Stacie Toon, a  three-year starter and a second-team All-City selection last season as a  junior. Toon has been joined by Huong Thai, a 4-11 point guard who directed the  junior varsity to a 21-0 record and a City title in 1989.  </P> <P> Still, much of the success in 1990 is attributable to Toon's maturation. Toon  is averaging 19 points and 12 rebounds a game, and the improvement of her  inside game has made her one of the dominant 3-A players, Magnante said.  </P> <P> "She does well around the boards," he said. "She can get the rebounds and put  the ball back up. . . . That's where she gets most of her points."  </P> <P> Toon, also an All-City volleyball player, has been selected athlete of the week  by both the Los Angeles Unified School District and United Cable, but she said  her top priority remains a City title.  </P> <P> "It would make my whole senior year," she said. "Van Nuys isn't known for  sports, so it would mean a lot to the school."  </P> <P> For Toon, a championship also would mean more exposure to college recruiters.  She has received letters from UCLA, Michigan and Cal State Northridge.  </P></p>

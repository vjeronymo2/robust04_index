			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Repola reduces net loss to FM118m REPOLA, Finland's largest industrial group, yesterday reported a loss (after financial items) of FM118m (Dollars 27.7m) for the first four months of the year, compared with a FM206m loss in the same period of 1991. Operating profit rose to FM478m from FM311, with the group's three industrial groups - pulp and paper, plastic packaging and metal and engineering products - showing improvement. Operating profit for the United Paper Mills forestry arm rose to FM421m from FM230m a year earlier, while the group made a strong recovery in metals and engineering, posting a FM48m profit against a FM55m loss. The improvement was due to a number of factors, including cost-cutting, the elimination of unprofitable operations and the devaluation of the Finnish markka last November. Consolidated sales rose by 22 per cent to FM8.46bn from FM6.92bn a year earlier. The group's equity-to-assets ratio at the end of April was 27.5 per cent, against 28 per cent.</p>

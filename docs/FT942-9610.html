The industrial index added 73 to 6,710, for a gain on the week - shortened by two separate closures for holidays - of 3 per cent. The overall rose 77 to 5,533, while the gold index added 15 to 1,893. Dealers said that most of the buying interest continued to come from local investors with foreign institutions remaining absent.

SA Breweries gained R2.50 to R104.00 after posting a 14 per cent rise in earnings in the year ending March 31. The steady performance of the bullion price at new upper levels underpinned gold shares, but no major buying was seen until gold moved beyond Dollars 383 an ounce. Among gold stocks Kloof rose 25 cents to R44.75 as a delegation of striking mineworkers met management in an effort to bring to an end a strike by the majority of the work force. Elsewhere De Beers rose R3.35 to R110.75 and Anglos R5.50 to R235. The mining house, Johnnies, jumped R5 to R95, Gencor rose 35 cents to R10.10, and Rangold 50 cents to R7.50.

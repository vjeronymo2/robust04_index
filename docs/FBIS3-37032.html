Mayak programs were switched off in the  oblast on 6 February, while today, even the "Utro" television  news program was not broadcast. However, commercial channels are  continuing to operate, broadcasting semilegal Western clips and  local advertisements. The local television program will not be  switched off as its management has reached agreement with the  communications workers to earn millions [as heard] and pay them  off. Even so, local television and the two commercial channels  are working only a few hours a day. Meanwhile, local  inhabitants watch Polish, Swedish and other Western programs,  which can be received well here.    When I asked Kostantin Votpusko, head of the oblast's radio  and television transmission center what he thought of this  situation, he said that state television had long been a burden  to the transmission workers. It is much simpler to sell the air  time to the multitude of private commercial companies, which  agree to pay large amounts of money. This would be in the  interests of the transmission workers, he said. I think that  this is what lies behind the boycott and its logic. But who is  giving thought to the interests of Russian viewers and  listeners?</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Money Markets: UK rates firmer There was little change in rates on the money markets yesterday, where most traders still held firmly to the belief that an interest rate cut was a far-off prospect. Thursday's increased money supply figures in Germany again hung over the markets, with one analyst suggesting that an economic turnaround in Germany was unlikely to come before the end of the third quarter. In the interbank market, 3-month money, a key indicator of future base rate movements, remained un-changed on the previous night's close at 10 9/16 - 7/16 . However, one trader said that it had ended high on the week, considering that it had been trading at around 10 1/2 - 3/8 in recent days. One year money ended a touch firmer on the previous day's close. It finished at 10 3/8 - 1/4 , having closed on Thursday night at 10 5/16 - 3/16 . In the futures market, the June sterling contract again ended at 89.63, indicating an implied interest rate of 10.37%. In the discount market, it was, in the words of one trader, 'another expensive day for money.' The Bank of England started the day by posting a shortage of around Pounds 1.15bn. In early operations, the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 153m. These were made up of Pounds 5m of sterling Band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, Pounds 5m of Band-2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, Pounds 34m of Band-3 bills at 10  5/32 per cent,Pounds 2m of Band-4 Late Assistance bills at 10 1/16 per cent and Pounds 107m of Band-4 bank bills at 10 1/16 per cent. In further operations the bank purchased Pounds 95m of Band-3 bills at 10 5/32 per cent and Pounds 48m of Band-4 bank bills at 10 1/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank revised its estimate of the shortage to around Pounds 1.1bn. The Bank purchased a further Pounds 468m of bank bills at 10 3/8 %, taking Pounds 348m in band one and Pounds 120m in Band-2. It then provided late assistance of Pounds 310m. German call money held steady at about 9.65% despite the sharp jump in German M3 money supply in March. On Thursday, the Bundesbank said that March M3 had risen by a much higher than expected 9.7 per cent annualised rate after an 8.6 per cent rise in February. However, dealers said that the surprise increase did not change the likelihood that call money would stay up near the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate for the foreseeable future.</p>

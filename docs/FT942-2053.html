			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Growth by successful targeting - Andrew Bolger looks at how Castrol has expanded worldwide Can Castrol keep it up? The famous brand is the centre of the lubricants business which is mainly responsible for the buoyant performance of Burmah Castrol in recent years. While the group's chemicals, liquified natural gas, fuels and energy businesses have all suffered during the recent recession, Castrol's profits have maintained a compound annual growth rate of 14 per cent since 1985, except for a flat patch in 1990 caused by the Gulf conflict. Operating profits from the lubricants side increased last year by 22 per cent, and now contribute two thirds of group profits. This steady growth has helped offset disappointment over Burmah's purchase in 1990 of the metallurgical chemicals businesses of Foseco for Pounds 260m. The group has admitted - with hindsight - that it paid too much for a business which had to be shrunk after the foundries it services plunged into recession. In spite of this, Burmah Castrol's shares have outperformed the market by 44 per cent since the beginning of 1992. Castrol has increased sales at a compound annual rate of almost 6 per cent, although the world lubricants market has been relatively flat over the last 10 years. The group has a high marketing spend, sponsoring rallying, Formula 1 racing and the Indy Car Series in the US. Television adverts encourage motorists to cosset their engine by paying a bit more for the 'liquid engineering' of Castrol's high-margin GTX brand, rather than a standard lubricant. One of its greatest marketing successes has been in the US, where over the last 10 years Castrol has raised its share of the DIY lubricants markets from 5 per cent to more than 15 per cent - just behind the market leader, Pennzoil. Castrol has also spent Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) on launching a synthetic motor oil in the US, targeted at the enthusiast and the more technically advanced end of the American market. In spite of selling at nearly four times the price of ordinary lubricants, Syntec has been well received and is expected to move into profit this year. Although such products may never gain a large share of the market, the establishment of 'flagship' products allows Castrol to create gradations in the market of two or three products at intermediate prices. Castrol has operations in 50 countries and sells to 100 more. Some of its greatest successes have been in developing countries, where economic growth has fuelled consumption. Last year Thailand came sixth in Castol's profits league - one step above the UK. In Asia, Castrol is targeting what it calls the 'have somes' - consumers with annual incomes of more than Dollars 18,000 per household. It estimates there are currently 56m to 60m in this category, and the figure could swell to 300m by the end of the century. Castrol says this group has emerged as the real middle class in Asia and has typical middle class aspirations - it wants to buy houses, cars and consumer durables. Right under this level are the 'near haves', which could be as many as 600m by 2000. Mr Ian Pringle, Castrol's Asia director, says: 'The 'have somes' are key to Castrol because they buy vehicles. But so too are the 'near haves' because this group are likely to buy a motorcycle as their first vehicle'. Mr Pringle says one of the most striking features of consumer demand in Asia is what he calls leapfrogging: the rapid assimilation of technology which allows people to go from having no telephone to a mobile cellular phone; or from no radio to owning a compact disc hi-fi system. He also believes that a certain degree of brand loyalty remains with consumers when the 'near haves' graduate to cars. It is because of this that Castrol has made the motorcycle market the nucleus of its entry strategy in Thailand and Vietnam. Castrol started modestly in Thailand in 1972 in a joint venture with a local distributor, but was inhibited through the seventies and much of the eighties by government price controls. It therefore concentrated on establishing a distribution network, and on building its image among the motorcycling population, despite the profit restrictions. When, during the late eighties, the number of motorcycles in Thailand leapt from 1m to 5m, Castrol was well positioned and now holds the leading share of the motorcycle market. The number of cars doubled between 1980 and 1990, and Castrol has the biggest share in the franchised workshop business. Hanging on has also proved a lucrative strategy in India, now Castrol's third most profitable market after the US and Germany. Castrol established a branch office there in 1919 and stayed on even when a wave of nationalisation in the seventies caused all of its main competitors to quit. It kept the Castrol name in front of the Indian public by floating 60 per cent of the subsidiary's equity on the Bombay stock exchange and maintaining management control. When liberalisation came in 1991, Castrol was able to exploit its strong image and distribution network. Volume has grown by 50 per cent in the last two years and Castrol now has nearly 10 per cent of India's lubrication market. Mr Tim Stevenson, chief executive of Castrol, emphasises that Castrol is not just about automotive products, although they do account for 78 per cent of profits. The remainder comes from industrial and marine lubricants, both of which are targeted for further growth. Mr Stevenson told a recent meeting of institutions and analysts he was confident that Castrol would 'prove wrong the sceptics who for years have been arguing that Castrol is a maturing business, liable to get snuffed out by the oil major dinosaurs'.</p>

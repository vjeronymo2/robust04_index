			<p>BFN     [Text] The peace agreement that Georgia and Abkhazia signed  in Moscow on April 4 can be used as the basis for sending U.N.  peacekeepers to the region, Georgian envoy Aleksandr Kavsadze  believes. The agreement provides for the return of Georgian  refugees and displaced persons to their homes in Abkhazia.    Speaking at the Georgian Embassy in Moscow on Tuesday,  Kavsadze said the two sides had agreed on further measures aimed  at bringing a negotiated settlement to the conflict.    The four party commission (Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia and the  U.N.) is to hold its first session to discuss the refugee issue  in Sochi on April 8, Kavsadze said.    The negotiators are expected to decide on whether to send  peacekeepers to the region at the next round in Geneva on April  12.    The future of Abkhazia will be the subject of discussion in  Geneva on April 19. International lawyers will also attend.</p>

As greatly excited as other cadres, staff members, and  workers throughout the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation [MOFTEC], I cherish the memory of Mao Zedong, the  great man with outstanding achievements.    Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist. He was the chief  founder of our party, Army, and state, and the great leader of  the Chinese people of all nationalities. He has held an  everlasting important position in contemporary history as well  as in the history of the development of Marxism and socialism.  He creatively combined the fundamental tenets of Marxism with  concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, pooled the  experience and wisdom of our party, and formed Mao Zedong  Thought. His erudite and profound theoretical thinking is a  spiritual treasure house that is inexhaustible for our study and  application. The great achievements of Comrade Mao Zedong are  comprehensive. Through protracted and extreme hardships and  difficulties, he led the Chinese people in overthrowing the  three big mountains, founding New China, and subsequently  engaging in various facets of construction. As a great  strategist in foreign affairs, he conducted substantial  pioneering work for, and made tremendous contributions to, the  establishment of China's foreign strategy and the formulation of  foreign policies. He also performed immortal deeds in the  establishment of China's foreign economic and trade system and  the formulation of the principles and policies of foreign  economy and trade, which has been part and parcel of the foreign  work.    Comrade Mao Zedong always took the country's undertaking in  foreign trade and economic cooperation very seriously. As early  as the time when the CPC was setting up revolutionary bases and  liberated areas before the founding of the republic, Comrade Mao  Zedong proposed that decisionmaking power in foreign trade  should be in the hands of the people, which should be taken as  an objective of China's new democratic revolution. For this  purpose, practice in pioneering the cause should be carried out.  At a preparatory meeting of the new Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference held on the eve of New China's birth,  Comrade Mao Zedong proclaimed: "The Chinese people are willing  to have friendly cooperation with the people of various  countries in the world, and resume and develop business contacts  with them to facilitate the growth of production and bring about  a prosperous economy." After the PRC was founded, Comrade Mao  Zedong took hold of the overall situation and enthusiastically  showed concern for China's foreign economic and trade  undertaking, regarding the positive development of foreign  economic cooperation and trade relations, to be based on  independence and self-reliance under the principle of equality  and mutual benefit, as a guiding ideology of economic and trade  exchange between China and the world. He presided over relevant  meetings several times to keep abreast of the foreign economic  and trade work and to examine and approve major steps for the  establishment and development of New China's socialist cause in  the area of foreign economy and trade as well as the basic  principles and policies of relevant work. Also, he repeatedly  pointed out the necessity of relying mainly on the domestic  market while making the foreign market subsidiary, but stressing  the importance of developing the latter. Its significance must  not be underestimated, nor must the efforts to develop this  market be slackened. It was his consistent view of doing  business, both with the socialist and people's democratic  countries and the capitalist countries. When he met with  leaders and delegations who came to visit China or when he  personally visited commodity fairs, he would instruct foreign  trade workers to conduct wide-ranging exchanges at home and  abroad, open up the international market, expand exports, and  ensure product quality, with a view to rapidly developing and  expanding China's national economy.    With a view to furthering friendly relations between China  and the world, Comrade Mao Zedong, in the spirit of patriotism  and internationalism, stressed the need to vigorously conduct  economic cooperation and trade with foreign countries to serve  China's foreign work and socialist construction. Guided by his  brilliant thought, foreign economic and trade work has become a  bridge promoting friendly contacts between the Chinese people  and the people of various countries, which has given impetus to  developing China's cooperation with the international community.    Thanks to Comrade Mao Zedong's concern, the foreign economic  and trade system of New China deliberately took shape in a  relatively short period of time, which has played an important  role in socialist modernization, and which has held a certain  position in international economic relations and trade as well.  Such momentous achievements have opened vast vistas for the  development of China's foreign economic and trade undertaking.    Today, the purpose of reviewing Comrade Mao Zedong's  immortal feats for China's revolution and construction, his  tremendous contributions to the liberation of the oppressed  peoples and the cause of human progress, and his concern for  foreign economic and trade undertaking lies in cherishing memory  of Comrade Mao Zedong, in expressing our feeling of respects for  him and, more importantly, in emulating Comrade Mao Zedong's  brilliant thought of developing foreign economic and trade  undertaking under the new historical condition, in a bid to open  up the future of the foreign economic and trade undertaking  under the constant guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has inherited and developed Mao Zedong  Thought by integrating Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought with  practice in contemporary China and the characteristics of the  age. He put forth a complete set of theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is the valuable  wealth of the CPC and the Chinese people. At present, we should  develop the style of study of integrating theory with practice,  conscientiously study Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, systematically master the spirit and essence of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, arm the minds of party members, cadres,  staff, and workers of our ministry with this theory, and more  consciously apply the Marxist stand, views, and methods in  studying and resolving new problems. It is particularly  necessary to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as the theoretical base  and guiding principle for doing our foreign economic and trade  work, and to seriously study and solve the major practical and  theoretical problems urgently awaiting a solution in the course  of the in-depth foreign economic and trade structural reform to  wrest new victory in the cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and in the foreign economic and trade  undertakings.    Today, in recalling Comrade Mao Zedong, we should take the  great achievements and ideological examples of Comrade Mao  Zedong and other proletarian revolutionaries of the older  generation as well as the concern and expectations of Comrade  Mao Zedong for foreign economic and trade work as an enormous  spiritual strength that constantly inspires us in our victorious  advances. Under the leadership of the party's Central Committee  with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, let all party members, cadres, staff, and  workers throughout MOFTEC steadfastly persist in the party's  basic line, unite as one, forge ahead, and work in a solid  manner, to prove ourselves to be worthy of the concern shown by  Comrade Mao Zedong and other proletarian revolutionaries of the  older generation for our foreign economic and trade work, to  achieve the magnificent objective of the in-depth foreign  economic and trade structural reform sketched by the 14th  National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, and to strive to fulfill various  missions set forth by the party and state for foreign economic  and trade work!</p>

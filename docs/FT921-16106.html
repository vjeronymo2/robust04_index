			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Revival in mergers and acquisitions predicted MERGER and acquisition activity should revive this year as financial pressures make companies more willing to dispose of non-core assets, according to a review of corporate finance activity by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank. The bank said disposals slid to Pounds 9.97bn last year from Pounds 16.5bn in 1990 as values were depressed by the recession. As a result companies were forced to rely heavily on rights issues to raise cash. The unwillingness of companies to dispose of assets was also one reason behind the further fall in mergers, with successful acquisitions of private and public companies falling to Pounds 11.27bn from Pounds 16.09bn in 1990. The bank said, however, it believed companies would be pushed more towards disposals this year. Institutional liquidity would be stretched by the higher public-sector borrowing requirement as well as reduced insurance premiums and pension contributions. That would mean less cash available for subscription to rights issues. Competition for equity finance would increase, the bank said. Debt markets were likely to remain tight as banks continued to be reluctant lenders given the recent scale of corporate failures and consequent write-offs. A total of Pounds 940m was spent on management buy-outs during the final quarter of last year, according to a survey published today. The figure was the highest quarterly total since the market peaked in the third quarter of 1989, figures from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, show. The total spent on buy-outs has fallen since the third quarter of 1989, reaching a low of Pounds 300m at the start of last year. However, the total for the fourth quarter of last year was still well below the highest-ever total of Pounds 3.57bn, and the total for the whole of last year was less than was spent in each of the past four years. Mr Chris Beresford, head of KPMG's management buy-out section, said: 'It seems that while most figures from the recession are getting worse, MBOs are to some extent counter-cyclical.' He believed the high level of activity would continue this year and would beat the Pounds 2.6bn spent last year. The uncertainty caused by the general election was forcing the pace in some buy-outs where the management was keen to complete before the election.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINDSAY MOVED TO L.A. HOSPITAL BUT NEW OUSTER EFFORT IS LAUNCHED;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL: TRANSFER THWARTS RULE ON RESIDENCY. LATEST PROPOSAL WOULD ASK  VOTERS TO AMEND CITY CHARTER TO PERMIT REMOVAL FROM OFFICE ON GROUNDS OF  PHYSICAL INCAPACITY.  </P> <P> Ailing Councilman Gilbert Lindsay was moved by ambulance to a Hollywood  hospital Friday afternoon, just hours after his colleagues on the Los Angeles  City Council saluted his 90th birthday and launched a new plan that could  remove him from office.  </P> <P> Lindsay's move to Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center from  Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood, where he has spent the last three months,  thwarted an earlier effort contemplated by the council to remove him from  office.  </P> <P> Under a provision of the City Charter, a council member can be removed if he is  away from the city for 60 days or more without council consent. Because the  council stopped excusing Lindsay's absences on Nov. 1, he was in jeopardy of  losing the seat he has held for 27 years as early as Jan 1.  </P> <P> Council members appeared chagrined Friday that their attempted maneuver may  have played a part in the decision by Lindsay's stepson to transfer the  councilman.  </P> <P> "I hope it's not because of this fear that . . . somehow the council is going  to do something as drastic as removing him from office," Ferraro said. "I  certainly wouldn't want it on my conscience that by moving him we caused him  more serious medical problems."  </P> <P> Councilman Nate Holden said many of Lindsay's constituents viewed the attempt  to remove Lindsay as a "dirty trick," and said, "I'm glad to know that he's  coming back to the city where he can be excused and stop the (60-day) clock."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, both Ferraro and Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores filed motions  Friday seeking a Charter amendment that would permit removal of elected  officials who become incapacitated for 60 days or longer. Such an ouster is not  permitted under the current City Charter and no other means exists to remove  Lindsay from office, Ferraro said.  </P> <P> Ferraro asked that the legislation be drawn up in time to place it on the April  ballot.  </P> <P> Lindsay has been partially paralyzed and unable to speak since he suffered a  stroke Sept. 2 and was rushed to Daniel Freeman Hospital. His condition has  remained relatively unchanged and colleagues and aides who have visited him say  it is unclear whether he understands what is going on around him.  </P> <P> Lindsay stared off into the sunny, cloudless sky shortly after noon Friday as  he was strapped to a stretcher and whisked into an ambulance that stood by to  transport him from Daniel Freeman Hospital.  </P> <P> Someone called the councilman's name, but he did not respond. Hospital  officials kept photographers and cameramen at bay.  </P> <P> When he arrived at Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center about  40 minutes later, a monitor strapped to his chest, he appeared alert, if  somewhat bewildered.  </P> <P> The councilman was taken directly to his room and was "resting well," said Bob  Steward, a hospital spokesman. "We have been happy to be of service to him and  his family for years," Steward said. "Our concern is just to provide the  councilman with the normal level of concern and care."  </P> <P> Hospital officials said Lindsay's physician expects him to have a speedier  recovery at Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian, where he is familiar with  the medical staff. Lindsay's wife Theresa died there of a brain hemorrhage in  1984 and he himself has been treated there several times, including an episode  in 1988 when he suffered a mild stroke.  </P> <P> "The family has a very favorable disposition toward this hospital," said  Steward. "There are numerous staff members who have cared for him and his  family. There are people here who have known him for years. I think that will  be a great help to him."  </P> <P> Because of the commotion of the transfer, Ferraro canceled plans to visit  Lindsay Friday afternoon, when he intended to present him with a 4-foot-tall  birthday card signed by hundreds of city employees as well as a piece of the  whipped cream birthday cake that was served in the council chambers.  </P> <P> Ferraro said he intends to begin officially excusing Lindsay from meetings  again, but the gesture has little effect because the elder councilman is within  city limits and can no longer be expelled from the council.  </P> <P> The Charter amendment motions were sent to the council's Rules and Elections  Committee Friday and quick action is expected.  </P> <P> Ferraro met with community leaders Thursday in Lindsay's largely black 9th  District to discuss the situation, he said. "They said they are very concerned  about Gil Lindsay," he said. "They didn't like what we were doing. They didn't  understand it."  </P> <P> Removing Lindsay was only an option, Ferraro said, adding that the council  might well have decided not to act on the matter.  </P> <P> "There's obviously a shift in sentiment" on the council, said Mark  Ridley-Thomas, director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who  attended the session with Ferraro.  </P> <P> He said that while he and others are unhappy about the district's lack of  representation during Lindsay's illness, they have yet to reach a consensus on  what action should be taken.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Darrell Dawsey also contributed to this story.  </P></p>

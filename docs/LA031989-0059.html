			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT ISRAEL NEEDS NOW  </P> <P> Three months ago Israel's government said it was working on a new "peace plan"  in response to the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories and to  Yasser Arafat's statement that the Palestine Liberation Organization was at  last renouncing terrorism and accepting Israel's existence. Since then, and  most noticeably in the last few weeks, it has become steadily clearer that the  approaches Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has in mind aren't new, won't advance  the peace process and could only by the most charitable of interpretations be  regarded as constituting a "plan."  </P> <P> What the government has been vaguely talking about is reviving the autonomy  provisions of the 1978 Camp David agreement and bringing Jordan's King Hussein  into negotiations about the West Bank's future. These approaches made sense in  their time. Now, Shamir's suggestion that he finds virtues in them is only  ironic. When the Camp David accords were put before the Knesset a decade ago,  Shamir voted to reject them as unacceptable. And Shamir's Likud Party in the  past has been unsparing in its scorn for the Labor Party's notion of invoking a  "Jordanian option" to try to bring about a West Bank settlement.  </P> <P> Too little and too late will not produce the required directional shift in a  dead-end policy. Shamir's second thoughts about a new peace plan seem to  reflect an assessment that, despite earlier concerns, the Bush Administration  isn't about to lean on Israel to begin planning for an eventual withdrawal from  most of the West Bank. Washington's attitude in turn appears to be conditioned  by its own disappointment with the course of the U.S.-PLO talks that have been  going on since January in Tunisia, with some officials complaining that the PLO  has so far shown itself incapable of moving beyond slogans to deal with  substance.  </P> <P> Even Secretary of State James A. Baker's comment -- anathema to Israel -- that  direct PLO-Israel talks might one day be needed doesn't seem to have affected  Shamir's perception that he can coast with the status quo. To conclude that,  though, is of course again to evade facing the basic challenge: Palestinian  nationalism as exemplified by the 16-month-old intifada isn't going to falter  or disappear, and the burdens on Israel of maintaining a repressive occupation  aren't going to become more bearable. Israel needs a change in policy not to  appease Washington or accommodate the PLO, but because it has become painfully  clear that its own political, economic, security and moral interests urgently  demand it.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Atek: "A Personal Dispute that May Have Gone </F> Too Far"]    [Text] An official in the cabinet of the Cambodian  People's Party [CPP] located near the Chamka Mon state palace  revealed that the CPP Standing Committee held its so-called  regular meeting on the afternoon of 19 January. The official,  who requested anonimity, told us that besides issues directly  concerning the CPP, the meeting also tackled the problem  mentioned in the written answer of Mr. Sam Rangsi, minister of  economy and finance, when he responded to the letter of Mr.  Theng Bun Ma, chairman of the Thai Boon Rong Company, the  investor of the new Olympic market.    It should be noted that the meeting was attended by several  important CPP ministers. The official expressed his personal  opinion "that the content of the written answer by Mr. Sam  Rangsi to Olympic market investor Theng Bun Ma appeared to be  going too far beyond an economic perimeter, becoming by itself a  political issue, and seeming to be of a mudslinging nature,"  although that dispute first took place as a personal matter.    It was learned that Mr. Theng Bun Ma wrote a very critical  letter to Mr. Sam Rangsi, the minister of economy and finance of  the Kingdom of Cambodia. But it was also learned that Mr. Theng  Bun Ma is just an ordinary investor. Mr. Sam Rangsi answered  Mr. Theng Bun Ma in a letter that a CPP official described as  being part of a purely private squabble using a private  newspaper as the venue, a squabble which has gone too far and  which unfortunately has become a new problem that never should  have been.    The dispute between Messrs. Sam Rangsi and Theng Bun Ma up  through the afternoon of 19 January has not been reported by  state television, radio, or the government news agency AKP  although the two gentlemen had already exchanged heated words.    Because of the failure of the state media to report it, both  local and foreign observers in Phnom Penh have concluded that  this was "merely a personal dispute" that would have no effect  on the royal government's policy. People are concerned,  however, that this acute personal dispute might degenarate into  a rift between groups and might affect the bonds between the two  ruling parties if no attempt is made to bring about  understanding and compromise and if no clear line is drawn.    When this problem seriously affects the inner bonds between  the two major parties, it will be said that the dispute hurts  his majesty the king's national reconciliation policy and the  royal government as a whole may be shaken.    Most analysts believe that the more serious the internal  rift  of the government or that of the two major parties in the  coalition, the greater the gain made by the outlawed Khmer Rouge.</p>

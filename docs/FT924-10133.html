			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Last clash in a war of weirdness: The US election will be decided in about a dozen states This 'deeply weird' election year, as President George Bush never stops calling it, has come down to this final irony. The selection of the man to lead the most mobile and changing society the industrialised world has yet produced will probably be determined in the oldest and most stolid parts of the nation, that swathe of yesterday's industrial heartland that stretches from the awful refineries of New Jersey to the ethnic beer halls of Milwaukee, with a few excursions to the even more ancient colonial south. This weekend, the voters of about a dozen 'battleground' states will have digested all they have learned this year about Mr Bush, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and Mr Ross Perot, a billionaire from Texas. It is now probably too late for 11th-hour smoking guns, bimbos and October surprises, unless the unpredictable Mr Perot endorses one of the other two. There will be no more economic statistics to muddy the waters. It has all come down to final frantic efforts in non-stop six-state-a-day tours by Messrs Bush and Clinton, the occasional foray in the flesh by Mr Perot, and a barrage of commercial advertising by all three to wind up the most expensive election there ever has been. All that is now left before tomorrow are the final polls and a lot of questions. Here are some of the more important: Can Bush win? The answer is yes, but luck will be needed. Though he has narrowed his deficit in the national polls with Mr Clinton, he has not risen much above 35 per cent in any of them. The lowest winning percentages of the popular vote this century have been Woodrow Wilson's 41.84 in 1912 and Richard Nixon's 43.42 in 1968, which indicates Mr Bush still has a way to go. But both those contests featured strong third-party candidates, a role Mr Perot, vaingloriously, unwittingly and unwillingly, may yet play by spoiling Mr Clinton's exclusive opposition patch. But can Bush win the electoral college? This is where everything must go right on election day, because the president starts with a huge debit. He has already conceded California, New York and Illinois, the first-, second- and sixth-largest states, together worth 109 of the 270 college votes needed to win. He has visited none of them for weeks and his campaign is paying for no prominent media advertising in California and New York and only radio spots in Illinois. In 1988, he took California and Illinois and cannot be unconscious of history which says that no Republican this century has taken the White House without carrying California. In 1988, Mr Michael Dukakis won 11 states, including New York and the District of Columbia. This year they are worth, excluding New York, 71 votes. None looks even remotely fragile for Mr Clinton, though Mr Bush chose Wisconsin for a Saturday train tour. It must be assumed the Democratic candidate will carry Arkansas, his state, and Tennessee, Senator Gore's, worth another 17 votes. By a conservative calculation, therefore, Mr Bush is up against an opponent with 198 electors virtually in the bank, more than double Mr Dukakis's total, nearly five times what President Carter got in 1980, more even than Hubert Humphrey in 1968, who lost by only 500,000 popular votes. This is not, by itself, an insuperable handicap for a man who four years ago swept the south, cleaned up in all the big states except New York and ruled supreme elsewhere except some north-eastern states, the Pacific north-west and Hawaii. The problem this year is that Mr Clinton, a southerner, is very competitive in his own backyard, especially in bigger states such as North Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana, with their 36 electors, not to mention Florida and Texas, the third- and fourth-largest states worth 57 votes. What is the Bush strategy then? His campaign claims, without being specific beyond the questionable inclusion of Texas and Florida, that he leads in 14 or 15 states with about 140 electors and is 'competitive' in a like number. By this, Mr Fred Steeper, his pollster, means states in which he now trails by one to six points but which he would win in the event of a last-minute three- to four-point swing in his favour. He concedes there is no margin for error. If Indiana, Vice-President Dan Quayle's home and the first state to report on Tuesday, looks sick, 'we can roll up the rug', though Connecticut and New Jersey will be the best early tests. In the final days, Mr Bush is spending all his time in the industrial heartland, before going home to Texas, and is deploying former President Reagan in the south. Can Clinton lose? Again the answer is certainly yes, if Mr Bush's hopeful scenario comes true and if Mr Clinton suffers some unexpected setbacks. There is another factor. His whole election strategy was predicated first on breaking the Republican monopoly on the south and its borders. Of the six elections held after the impact of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was fully digested, the only Democratic victory was achieved, in 1976, with a southerner on the ticket. Put another way, the Republicans gained an inherent advantage in the south which meant that any Democrat needed to carry about two-thirds of the remaining states to have a chance of victory. If Mr Clinton does not make his southern breakthrough, the old electoral mathematics prevail. In any event, the industrial heartland battleground is crucial. This is a part of the country which has increasingly split its preferences, voting for Republican presidents and state governors and Democratic senators and congressmen. Even in 1976, Jimmy Carter eked out only narrow victories in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin, losing elsewhere. Mr Bush took them all except Wisconsin four years ago, though he trails in most of them today. How will Perot do and whom will he hurt most? There is no clear answer to either question, except that he will not win the presidency and will not, barring a miracle, force the election into the next House of Representatives. Nobody before has tried to buy an election outright. John Connally's attempt in the Republican primaries of 1976, where he spent the odd million to win one convention delegate, does not compare with Mr Perot's personal outlays of well over Dollars 60m, almost all of it on television advertising, more even than the other two. Independent or third-party candidacies invariably flourish, flatten and wither. Mr Perot's 'second coming' in the last month of the campaign may conform to this pattern but it would require a big shrivelling now for him to fall back to single-digit irrelevance. His support is drawn heavily from those previously outside the political process. If they sense he cannot win, they may stay at home as usual. Most of them seem more conservative. Admiral Stockdale, his nominal running mate, and Orson Swindle, his campaign director, are far more critical of Mr Clinton than Mr Bush, but Mr Perot's particular venom is more directed at the president. The only half-safe rule of thumb, borne out by the latest polls, is that the better Mr Perot does, the more he hurts Mr Clinton; the worse he does, the more he hurts Mr Bush. At any level, he may spell the difference in Texas and Florida, which would hurt Mr Bush, and in Michigan and Ohio, which would more damage Mr Clinton. He will do best in the south-western and mountain states, until now solid Republican territory, but Mr Steeper claims that there is no state which Mr Perot can hand to either candidate. Is there any chance that more Americans will vote this year and, if so, what does that mean? In 1988, barely 50 per cent of registered voters - and barely one-third of those of voting age - cast a ballot, the culmination of a 30-year decline. Partly because of enthusiasm generated by Mr Perot's drives to get on the ballot, partly because of vigorous party registration drives and partly because of the perception that this really may be an important election, turn-out may reach and even exceed 55 per cent this year. Low participation usually helps Republicans, less numerous than Democrats but more likely to vote. This year the Democrats seem to have been signing up more voters, but so has the Christian right. There does appear, mostly from anecdotal evidence, to be much greater engagement by young people. This segment, once fertile ground for Messrs Reagan and Bush but with problematic current prospects for employment, is now more inclined towards Mr Clinton and, to an extent, Mr Perot. What about congressional coat-tails? Republican hopes for big gains in the Senate and House, based on national discontent with incumbents, have dissipated. The Democrats might get up to 60 seats in the Senate (they now control 57) which would be enough to stop filibusters, while losing only 15 to 20 in the House, where they currently hold a large 268-166 edge over the Republicans, with one independent. There will be a huge turnover, however, with 120 to 150 new denizens on Capitol Hill next January. Trailing in the polls, Mr Bush was shunned by many Republican candidates, whereas Mr Clinton had far closer identification with his party aspirants, especially a new crop of women. In general, coat-tails  - from the presidential candidates down to Congress and vice versa - are not expected to be strong. All right then, in the last analysis, what will decide this election? And who will win it? Mr Fred Malek, a Bush campaign director, concedes that if the election were merely a referendum on the economy his man would already have lost. Mr Clinton believes that is still the case and that the nation will pass its own negative verdict on 'trickle-down' economics and a positive one on his detailed plans for change. Mr Malek now argues that the electorate is focusing on just two issues - who has the better future plan for the economy and which man has the integrity appropriate for the presidency. Regardless of whether the Bush attacks on Mr Clinton have been fair or warranted - and many have not been - personalities are critical in a presidential election. If Mr Bush wins, it will be because he has undermined public confidence in Mr Clinton. But elections are also about looking forward with hope to new changes and challenges, and that clearly is the much younger and more articulate Mr Clinton's forte. If Mr Clinton wins, it will be because he has exposed the exhaustion of Republican policies after 12 years in power. There are no safe bets in this game. The spread remains where it has been for some time - between a comfortable Clinton victory and a narrow Bush one. Either is possible and so is something in between, and there are a lot of racetracks to visit from Michigan to Florida.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA-BUTHELEZI MEETING ON S. AFRICA'S 'ZULU WARS' CALLED OFF  </P> <P> Prospects for a speedy end to South Africa's "Zulu wars" dimmed Friday after  nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela called off a peace parley with his Zulu  rival, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi.  </P> <P> The two black leaders had been scheduled to share a platform next week to try  to stop the battles raging in Natal province between allies of Mandela's  African National Congress (ANC) and Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha movement.  </P> <P> The weeklong conflict in Natal's townships forced thousands of people to flee  and seek sanctuary in schools, hospitals and halls.  </P> <P> After a six-hour meeting at Mandela's home in Soweto township outside  Johannesburg, ANC officials said the meeting with Buthelezi had been postponed  on the advice of Natal-based activists.  </P> <P> "The atmosphere is not yet ideal for a joint rally in Natal," an ANC statement  said.  </P> <P> Police put the death toll from fighting in six black townships and surrounding  countryside in the Edendale valley outside Natal's provincial capital of  Pietermaritzburg at 37 since Sunday.  </P> <P> Natal's strife seriously threatens the initiative launched last month by  President Frederik W. de Klerk who wants talks with black leaders on writing a  new constitution.  </P> <P> De Klerk, alarmed that his proposed program of political reforms may be  engulfed by the increasing violence, said the Natal conflict had reached  unacceptable levels and his government might be forced to crack down.  </P> <P> Zulu supporters of the leftist United Democratic Front, which is allied to the  ANC, South Africa's biggest black opposition group, have been battling Inkatha  for three years.  </P> <P> More than 2,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the feud between  the two anti-apartheid factions, who disagree over ways to end Pretoria's white  minority rule.  </P> <P> The simmering unrest has now exploded into a virtual civil war.  </P> <P> Witnesses said large numbers of Zulus, armed with automatic weapons, spears and  slashing knives called pangas, attacked each other Friday in the township of  Imbali between Edendale and the white city of Pietermaritzburg.  </P></p>

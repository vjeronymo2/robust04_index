			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Unit trusts breach Pounds 60bn barrier Funds under management in unit trusts reached an all-time high in May, breaching the Pounds 60bn barrier for the first time. Net sales, at Pounds 235m, were the highest in May since 1987. The Unit Trust Association attributed this to increased confidence in stock markets, while new regulations on unit trust personal equity plans have also helped. Net inflow was greater than the Pounds 179m recorded for building societies during the month.</p>

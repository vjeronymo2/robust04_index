			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / International Company News: Grupo Torras move is bitterly criticised - KIO's departure from Spain may have further repercussions THE DECISION last Friday by the Kuwait Investment Office to place its Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras, into receivership has provoked fierce criticism of the KIO in Spain and threatens to open an unprecedented political inquiry in Kuwait. Influential Spanish newspapers said this weekend Torras receivership was a betrayal of promises made by the new KIO management to the Spanish government. In Kuwait, critics of the ruling al-Sabah family, closely identified with the former management of the KIO and Torras, called for the assets of people involved with Torras to be frozen. An opposition newspaper in the emirate called the affair 'the theft of the century'. The KIO's departure from Spain was colourful. Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, who has run Torras since June, trooped into a press conference with a string of legal advisers in tow. One read out the results of an investigation into the past management of the KIO's six-year investment spree in Spain. These were a Dollars 2bn loss on share trades, a Dollars 700m loss on share support schemes and a Dollars 600m loss on short-term financing. Another, hired to prepare charges against the former Torras management, said he was still not sure who would be charged, what the charges would be and when they would be brought. Mr al-Nouri said Torras was in a much worse state than originally believed, that the KIO had lost Dollars 4bn in Spain (adding Dollars 700m to the lawyer's estimates), and that it had no choice but to call in the receivers. In fact, the KIO has known for months what state Torras was in. But after nearly six months of alleging misappropriation by former managers, particularly Mr Javier de la Rosa, the financier who ran the KIO's investments in Spain until last June, the KIO was facing a sticky problem. At some stage the KIO would have to take some responsibility for the Torras businesses not already driven into receivership or cut off from funding since June. By getting out now, it could still explain the receivership away as a consequence of past betrayals. But the Spanish press, which has taken the new Torras management seriously until now, did not see it that way. Expansion, a business daily, called on Madrid to protest to the Kuwaiti government. 'The sorry witch hunt and the allegations of the new management . . . have ceased to interest the public and cannot be used to justify the clumsiness and lack of management of the new leadership (of Torras),' it said. Among daily newspapers, El Mundo called the receivership a 'state fraud' and said the move threatened 100,000 Spanish jobs, directly and indirectly. El Pais blamed Mr de la Rosa for the Torras collapse, but said the KIO and Kuwait had 'betrayed' Spain for failing to fulfil a promise made two months ago to invest a fresh Dollars 1bn in the Torras group. Although the receivership affects only Torras and not its surviving industrial affiliates, these companies are now vulnerable - particularly Spain's biggest paper-maker, Torraspapel. In September the KIO promised to inject Dollars 400m into the company but has so far transferred only Dollars 180m. Torraspapel will have to find the rest itself, but many unhappy banks are already owed money by now-deserted Torras affiliates. 'The public campaign against de la Rosa has hurt all the companies, even the good ones,' commented one independent corporate analyst in Madrid. 'There is no goodwill left.' What Friday's departure does leave behind are questions. Last December one KIO auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, valued Torras' assets at Dollars 2.9bn, saying they had cost Dollars 4.4bn. For the KIO to say it has lost all Dollars 4.4bn is to imply, improbably, that Dollars 2.9bn has vanished in the past year alone, the last half of it under new management. And Peat Marwick warned then that a 'forced sale (of assets) in the current European recessionary climate could result in a significant loss of the investment made by the KIO to date.' The Kuwaitis appear to have decided to take the loss anyway, as the price, at least, of a quick retribution against de la Rosa and former KIO managers whom they believe have enriched themselves at Kuwait's expense. It is important for the reputations of the KIO and its advisers that they make a legal case in Spain that sticks. But even an unsuccessful prosecution is likely to open a political Pandora's box inside Kuwait. Former Spanish and KIO managers could implicate members of the al-Sabah family in the Torras debacle. Already forced to devolve more political power, the Emir now faces constant pressure for greater transparency in the management of Kuwait's finances. 'The secrecy which has surrounded (the Spanish) investments was a big mistake. The people must know,' Mr Jassem al-Saadoun, an adviser to the new Kuwaiti parliament, said at the weekend. 'The time has come to punish those who abused public money and to freeze their money while the judicial authorities have investigated this tragedy,' said Mr Abdul-Jalil al-Gharabali, a former consultant to the Kuwaiti central bank. The political prize in Kuwait is control of its oil revenues. So far this has been the reserve of some of the al-Sabahs, but Kuwait is changing fast. Mixing the KIO's Spanish adventure into Kuwait's freer post-war politics could cause further problems.</p>

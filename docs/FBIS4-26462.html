			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (AFP)--China welcomed Thursday the  resumption of talks between Washington and Pyongyang over the  North Korean nuclear crisis, hailing the move as a "turning  point."    "We are happy to see these positive developments... and  appreciate the wise attitude and cooperative efforts by the  various parties concerned for the peaceful settlement of this  issue," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a weekly  press conference.    President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that North Korea  had agreed to freeze its nuclear programme, opening the door to  high-level talks with the United States in Geneva next month.    During negotiations, Washington will suspend efforts to  pursue UN sanctions against North Korea for refusing to allow  inspection of its nuclear facilities.    "We sincerely hope all the parties concerned will treasure  and grasp this hard-won turning point," Wu said, adding that  dialogue, rather than sanctions "is the most fundamental way for  a peaceful and proper settlement of the Korean nuclear issue."    China has repeatedly opposed the idea of UN sanctions and Wu  clearly indicated that Beijing felt the latest developments were  a vindication of that stance.    "Ever since this North Korean nuclear question cropped up,  China has resolutely insisted that it be resolved through  dialogue instead of through exerting pressure," Wu said.    "I believe this is an important act China has done."    He also welcomed Pyongyang's agreement to preparatory talks  with Seoul for a summit between North Korean President Kim  Il-Song and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-Sam.    Asked whether China was satisfied that North Korea is not  following a nuclear weapons programme, Wu would only reiterate  China's commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean  peninsula.    "China does not wish to see the emergence of nuclear weapons  on the Korean peninsula, whether from the North of from the  South or any other countries," Wu said.</p>

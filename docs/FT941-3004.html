			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Creditors fight BCCI pact move Two creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International plan to use the Luxembourg courts to delay the liquidators finalising an agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi, majority shareholder in the bank, Andrew Jack reports. Faisal Islamic Bank and Dr Adil Elias, a member of the BCCI creditors' committee, have lodged an application with the court of referees in Luxembourg to prevent the liquidators signing an agreement until after April 1. The aim is to ensure Abu Dhabi hands over all records it holds relating to BCCI. Under a separate agreement between Abu Dhabi and the US, these must be provided to the liquidators if an agreement has not been finalised by the start of next month. A hearing is scheduled for Monday.</p>

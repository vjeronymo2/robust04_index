			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: First Pacific places Dutch investment First Pacific, the Hong Kong investment group, yesterday sold its entire 43.2 per cent stake in Internatio-Muller, the Dutch trading and technical installation company, through a private placement. The 2.4m shares, placed by a syndicate led by ING Bank of the Netherlands, were sold to institutions in the UK, continental Europe and eastern Asia at a price of Fl 86.50 each, a discount of Fl 2.20 to Monday's closing price. The Fl 208m (Dollars 108.3m) transaction comes nearly three years after First Pacific stunned the Dutch business community by revealing it had built up the stake. The investment was the first step in what ultimately proved to be an unsuccessful attempt to merge Internatio-Muller with Hagemeyer, a Dutch-based trading company majority-owned by First Pacific. After First Pacific unveiled its large minority holding in Internatio-Muller in May 1991, the Dutch company responded with an emergency issue of preference shares to a friendly company-related foundation, thereby diluting its Hong Kong suitor's voting rights. Internatio-Muller said yesterday it may now ask shareholders to authorise the withdrawal of these preference shares when they meet in May. The timing of the divestment allows First Pacific to benefit from the recent strength of the Amsterdam stock exchange, where Internatio-Muller's shares have been trading near 12-month highs. The Dutch company's shares were trading at well below Fl 80 when First Pacific was building up its stake in early 1991.</p>

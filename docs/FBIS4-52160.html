			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  appointed a lower house member Hiroshi Nakai of the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP] as justice minister early Sunday morning,  replacing Shigeto Nagano for his controversial remarks over the  1937 Nanjing massacre and Japan's role during World War II.    Emperor Akihito is scheduled to attest Nakai's appointment  at  10 A.M. Sunday at the Imperial House.    Prime Minister Hata explained his views on World War II to  the new justice minister, saying that Japan's act of aggression  as well as its colonial rule inflicted great pains on a number  of people, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai.  Hata asked Nakai to conform to the prime minister's position,  Kumagai added.    At a press conference early Sunday morning, Nakai said, "it  is an undeniable fact that (the former Japanese Imperial Army)  conducted cruel acts," when he was asked about the Nanjing  massacre.    Political observers said that Prime Minister Hata apparently  picked the new justice minister from the DSP in a bid to appease  mounting criticisms against the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-  controlled cabinet in the wake of Nagano's controversial  remarks. Nagano is a member of Shinseito, a key political party  of the coalition.    The observers added Shinseito intends to show its remorse  and  responsibility over party member Nagano's remarks by handing  over the ministerial post to the DSP.    Nagano, 71-year-old former chief of staff of Ground  Self-Defense Force who served for only 10 days as justice  minister, submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Hata  shortly after he returned from a six-day tour of four European  countries.    Hata accepted Nagano's resignation and named a successor  from  the DSP, a party in the ruling coalition, after about three  hours of consultations with Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai and  other members of the cabinet.    The 51-year-old Nakai, deputy secretary general of the DSP,  is the youngest justice minister in postwar Japan.    Nagano apologized to Hata for the trouble caused by his  remarks and vowed personal action to show that Japan will not  start a war again, Nagano said after meeting Hata. At a press  conference following his resignation, Nagano reiterated his  apology, saying "(My remarks) caused great shocks and angers  among peoples in neighboring countries."    Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the largest opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), called Nagano's resignation a  "matter of course," saying the remarks spoiled the diplomatic  efforts the LDP made to improve ties with neighboring nations as  the ruling party for 38 years until last August.    Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic  Party  [of Japan -- SDPJ], former largest force in the coalition, said  Nagano's resignation is only natural as it damaged the Japanese  Government's international integrity.    Both the LDP and the SDP are ready to question the Hata  cabinet over Nagano's war remarks in Diet deliberations slated  to begin on Monday. Nagano said in an interview published  Wednesday in the major daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN, "The Nanjing  incident was a fabrication." He also said, "I think it is wrong  to define the war as a war of aggression (by Japan)... Still, I  doubt the Greater East Asia War, as it was called in Japan, was  aimed at aggression."    The remarks immediately drew harsh criticisms from China,  North and South Korea and other Asian countries, making Nagano  to retract his remarks and apologize at a news conference Friday.    The Nanjing incident refers to the massacre of a great  number  of Chinese by the defunct Imperial Japanese Army troops  following the invasion of the then Chinese capital in December  1937.</p>

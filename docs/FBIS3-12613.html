He  hates formalities, cocktail parties, and tuxedos. He is witty,  quick, and possesses a keen mind and excellent memory. He is  the man who carries out the overt, and mainly covert missions,  on behalf of President Mubarak, with whom he has been working  since 1975, from the day Mubarak took off his Air Force uniform  and became the vice president of Egypt.    Al-Baz, an international relations expert, graduated from  Harvard. He returned to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry as its  director general with a fluent command of English, ready to work  around the clock. Of all things, he relaxes to the sounds of  pop music. Behind his back he is called "the mercury," because  he does not suffer fools gladly and quickly dispenses with  "nudnicks," nuisances, and anybody who does not stimulate his  intellectual curiosity.    He is the architect of the rapprochement between the PLO and  Egypt, and is credited with the reconciliation between  Presidents al-Asad and Mubarak. He has accumulated dozens,  perhaps thousands of "al-Asad hours." And, he is very familiar  with Israel. Israeli politics interest him, the names of our  decisionmakers and our senior and junior advisers are familiar  to him.    [Peri] Mr. al-Baz, President 'Ezer Weizman and Prime  Minister Rabin hesitated about the appropriateness of sending  their condolences to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad over the  death of his son Basil. They hesitated, but finally sent them.    [Al-Baz] And I am telling you: there was no room for  hesitation. Their decision was right, important, and very wise.  The Syrians appreciated the gesture.    [Peri] How do you know?    [Al-Baz] I know, and I will not elaborate. How should I put  it? I met some Syrians, and they told me that they greatly  appreciated President Weizman's condolences. They were  pleasantly surprised. See, they look at you as one human being  looks at another. The moment a bereaved father, whose son was  killed in an horrendous car accident -- which is the tragic case  of President Weizman -- shares in the grief of another bereaved  father -- that is, the Syrian president, who also lost his son  in similar circumstances -- the message is heard.    [Peri] You knew Basil al-Asad and you know President al-Asad  very well. How did his son's death affect him?    [Al-Baz] There is no room for political conclusions. This  is a human tragedy; a tragedy for the president, for the Syrian  people, and for all of us. Basil al-Asad was not just the son of  the president, but was a special personality. He was a likable  and talented man whose future lay ahead of him. However, as I  said before, there is no room to derive political conclusions.    [Peri] If so, let us talk about the political issue. What  al- Asad demands from Israel is clear: a withdrawal from the  entire Golan Heights. But what exactly will he give in return?    [Al-Baz] I do not like the question so much, and I will tell  you why. In my opinion, this is the wrong formula. You are  making a mistake by listing your conditions in advance. I  believe that if Israel is prepared to give Syria the entire  Golan, Syria will make full peace with Israel.    [[Peri] What is full peace?    [Al-Baz] Something that resembles the peace between Israel  and Egypt.    [Peri] If so, we are in for a cold peace.    [Al-Baz] I object to the term cold peace. However, if you  insist, I am prepared to promise you that the peace between  Israel and Syria will be a "cold-plus peace" because it will be  based on the Egyptian model, but will not be a separate peace.  If you conclude a peace agreement with Syria this year, as we  expect, and peace is also attained with Jordan and Lebanon, the  entire Arab perception will change. That is why the peace with  Syria is "doomed" to be much warmer.    [Peri] To tell you the truth, you are not convincing me. To  this day, President al-Asad has even refused to promise that he  will open an embassy in Israel.    [Al-Baz] Your tactics are wrong. I would like to remind you  that also in the case of the peace with Egypt nobody asked us to  promise in advance what the nature of the relations would be.  Not even in Camp David. This happened on its own, at the last  minute. After all, many of our countrymen objected to President  al-Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem.    Therefore, there was no room to make any promises then about  diplomatic relations in exchange for a withdrawal from the  Sinai. Had pressure been exerted on us at an early stage,  opposition would have been greater and this might have hurt the  process. I propose that you think about what I am saying now.  I suggest you not to pressure the Syrians.    [Peri] How can you, who are a sort of "liaison" between  Israel and Syria, suggest to us to withdraw from the Golan  without offering us anything in return?    [Al-Baz] I believe that when all is said and done people in  your country realize that Israel will announce its willingness  to withdraw from the entire Golan Heights....    [Peri] The entire Golan Heights? And what about the Israeli  settlements?    [Al-Baz] They will have to be removed at some stage, as was  the case with the withdrawal from the Sinai.    I do not want to speak for the Syrians. You may reach an  arrangement with them whereby certain Israelis can remain there  as individuals. However, they would have to live under Syrian  sovereignty, obey Syrian law and the local police. I am not  sure many Israelis will accede to it.    If you really want to know the meaning of the full peace  al-Asad is talking about, you must enter serious negotiations  with the Syrian delegation in Washington and demand clear  answers.    [Peri] But the head of our delegation, Ambassador Itamar  Rabinovich, complains that his colleague, Muwaffaq al-'Allaf,  has been evading the issue.    [Al-Baz] I should like to point out that Rabinovich is an  excellent choice. He is one of your best diplomats. He is an  academic whose heart is in the right place. He is smart and  moderate. He has no hang-ups or prejudices that inhibit him  from making contacts. He is the man best suited to prompt the  other side to change its attitude toward Israel.    [Peri] Have the Syrians changed their attitude toward us?  Who are we in their eyes?    [Al-Baz] I have been following the public debate in your  country as to whether the Arabs can and should be trusted. I  believe there is no room for such an argument, because dealing  with such theories always leads to confusion and to conclusions  that are inconsistent with the constantly changing situation.    [Peri] Let me rephrase my question: When you discuss  Prime Minister Rabin with President al-Asad, do you get the  impression that al-Asad believes him?    [Al-Baz] I suppose President al-Asad has not yet asked  himself whether he does or does not believe Rabin. My feeling  is that al-Asad believes he can "do business" with Rabin and  conduct give-and-take negotiations with him. My impression is  that al-Asad has no inhibitions or hang-ups with regard to  Rabin. The entire Arab world knows that the Labor government  came to power with a peace program.    [Peri] Nevertheless, he refuses to meet Rabin.    [Al-Baz] At this point, there is no sense in such a meeting.  On the contrary, think what would happen if they met and nothing  came out of it. This would do a lot of damage to the process.    We have experience with summit meetings. President al-Sadat  went to Jerusalem, Haifa, and Beersheba. Your prime minister  came to Ismailia and the process almost came to a halt. Then he  visited Cairo, Aswan, and Alexandria. They also met in Sharm  al-Shaykh, and this meeting too was unnecessary and almost led  to an explosion.    Peace was ultimately brought about by our delegations, which  sat together with the Americans and conducted negotiations.    [Peri] Rabin is pressuring for such a meeting based on the  assumption that a tete-a-tete session with al-Asad will create a  common language and will affect public opinion, both in Syria  and in Israel.    [Al-Baz] Based on my acquaintance with both of them, I  believe they are the best candidates for a summit meeting. They  are both brave leaders who are prepared to take responsibility  and make tough decisions. I believe the right chemistry will be  created between them when they meet, but I do not think such a  meeting will result in a peace agreement.    [Peri] Who do you find it easier to negotiate with: Rabin,  who is famous for his security awareness, or Peres, with his  vision about peace and a green Middle East?    [Al-Baz] To tell you the truth, despite the differences in  their personalities, I find it easy to deal with both of them.  It is good that they are totally different from their  predecessors, the Likud people. Your previous government was  made up of introverts. They never bothered to tell us what they  thought should be done, what was troubling them, or what their  plans were.    [Peri] What is the difference between Peres and Rabin?    [Al-Baz] Rabin does not talk as much as Shim'on. Peres  enjoys lecturing about the future, about his vision. He has a  treasure trove of ideas. Rabin is much more cautious about what  he says. I suppose he is conscious of the responsibility he  shoulders, not just in his capacity as prime minister, but also  as the highest-ranking man in charge of the security of the  State of Israel. My impression is that Rabin is more of an  introvert than Peres, but when we talk he does not keep quiet.  He definitely responds, although he does not initiate  conversation. When one succeeds in stimulating him to talk, he  definitely talks.    It was interesting to find out that both have similar  perceptions about the future, although Peres, much more than  Rabin, is willing to go into details. Peres has dreams and he  is willing to share them with you. Rabin focuses on the  question of what can be achieved within reason. They are both  thinking men, the difference being that Rabin is a cerebral man,  whereas Peres goes after his imagination and heart. It should  be pointed out that both of them are open to ideas and are not  stuck on old conceptions.    The problem is that Rabin does not give you an answer on the  spot. He prefers to take his time, perhaps to consult with his  men. Peres responds immediately.    [Peri] Is that also the way you "sell" them to the leaders  of the Arab world?    [Al-Baz] I most definitely do not sell them. We usually  present the picture, the political mood in your country. We  present Rabin and Peres differently than we presented the Likud  government. We tell them that their responses are direct and  that they say what is on their mind without hiding anything,  whereas their predecessors did not even bother to tell us either  yes or no.    There is yet another important difference between Rabin and  Peres and the Likud people: It seems to me that they respect  the Arabs and that, contrary to their predecessors, they do not  deride them, their culture and mentality. They do not feel  superior to the Arabs. Shamir, Sharon, Eytan, and Ge'ula Kohen  did not even mean peace. Even Arens was careless with his  pronouncements and managed to arouse anger.    [Peri] Probably, you also get reports about the rivalry  between Rabin and Peres.    [Al-Baz] Even if theirs is a charged relationship, which I  find natural, this is not reflected in the negotiations. Quite  the contrary, I can attest to the collaboration between them.  We talk to one, and the other picks up from the exact same  point where the first one left off.    [Peri] What exactly is the role you play? Are you the man  in charge of secret missions, a go-between?    [Al-Baz] I do not relay messages. We, the Egyptians, have a  larger role. We are partners, we are involved. First of all,  Syria is an Arab country with which we have an historic and  strong relationship. We appreciate its importance in the Arab  world, its security needs, and internal stability. Our security  is linked to that of Syria.    It should be pointed out that Egypt and Syria have a mutual  defense pact, and that when we talk about Syria we are talking  about an ally. We have an obligation toward them, and vice  versa, and we defend their position.    [Peri] Is there a red telephone line between President  Mubarak and President al-Asad?    [Al-Baz] There is not. They speak on a regular phone.    [Peri] Perhaps you could share the secret with us: Why does  every meeting with President al-Asad last so many hours?    [Al-Baz] President al-Asad is very meticulous about  expressing his positions and opinions in clear terms. He is not  just a politician, but also a statesman, and he has a lot of  patience. In addition to that, he is particularly fond of  history. He is well-versed in it, and he likes to cite examples  from history to illustrate his position. I should like to point  out that al-Asad is a good listener. I know very few statesmen  endowed with the patience to listen to their fellow men. He  poses you with a challenge and stimulates you to react, and he  has plenty of patience to listen to your response.    [Peri] What is he interested in? What does he ask you about  Israel?    [Al-Baz] He is interested in all the details: How the  Israelis conducted the negotiations with Egypt, what can be  expected of them, what motivates them, what are the differences  in the political concepts of the Likud and Labor, and what is  their attitude toward the Arab world.    [Peri] And what does he say when you tell him that the  Israelis distrust his intentions and want proof of Syria's peace  intentions?    [Al-Baz] I do not do that. It is not our position to speak  in the name of Israel and say that "the Israelis want so and so  from you...."    Also, I cannot possibly come to al-Asad and say that the  Israelis want proof of the seriousness of his intentions. If I  did that, it would mean that we shared Israeli suspicions that  al-Asad does not want to live in peace with Israel. And, after  all, that is not what we think. We think that he definitely  wants peace.    [Peri] Does al-Asad really know us?    [Al-Baz] He knows you quite well, but I do not think there  are any Arabs who know you better than we do. We know you  first-hand, as do the Palestinians in the territories who  understand you and your motives and require no explanations. We  do not have to guess.    The Syrians know you better now than in the past because of  the direct negotiations. And, you are right in reiterating the  need for direct contacts between your leadership and the Syrian  top leaders, but you should not insist or pressure. It will  come. I am sure.    [Peri] If al-Asad is reluctant to personally meet Rabin, why  should he not authorize his foreign minister, Faruq al-Shar', to  meet secretly with Shim'on Peres?    [Al-Baz] It is a matter of principle for the Syrians not to  have secret meetings. They distrust their purpose. What can be  achieved in a secret meeting that cannot be attained in direct  negotiations? Also, there is no sense in such a meeting because  the talks between the delegations in Washington have not yet  reached a stage that would justify upgrading the level of the  meetings.    [Peri] You probably remember the secret meetings between the  late Moshe Dayan and Hasan al-Tuhami in Morocco to prepare  President al-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem.    [Al-Baz] To this day I am not sure that those meetings paved  al-Sadat's way. It is hard to tell what really happened there.  I spoke with each of them separately, and each gave me his own  version. That is exactly why secret meetings are unnecessary.    [Peri] We distrust al-Asad. He has been procuring weapons,  calling for a "vague" peace, and operating Hizballah against us.    [Al-Baz] That distrust is exaggerated. I can very well  understand your suspiciousness of the Syrians when they were  your main enemy and procured weapons and missiles. The Syrians  also distrust you. I suggest that you both stop distrusting  each other. Syria has always meticulously honored its  obligations to you. Your border with Syria is quiet. They do  not threaten your security.    Even if they procure weapons, that is not the key issue.  After all, you are doing the same thing, and you have not given  up your nuclear option. Countries occasionally tend to improve  their military balance in order to improve their bargaining  position in negotiations, so as not to negotiate from a position  of weakness.    [Peri] And what about Hizballah? The Syrians are not  exactly stopping them from operating against us.    [Al-Baz] I would not say they "welcome" Hizballah's  activities. At most, they "put up" with them. Neither Syria  nor the Lebanese Government control them. I seriously doubt  your argument that Syria supplies arms to Hizballah. Iran does,  but Syria does not. Hizballah has its own methods.    [Peri] Many people in our country believe that al-Asad is  not interested in Israel. He wants financial aid, U.S. backing,  and to get Syria removed from the list of countries supporting  international terror.    [Al-Baz] That is incorrect. Al-Asad is interested in  Syria's security and internal stability, and as long as he has  an Israeli enemy on the other side of the border he does not  have full security and cannot afford to divert resources to  development, industries, and agricultural projects. And, you  must not forget, you are occupying some of his land.    And now I will say what I think is most important: Most  Arabs already accept the existence of the State of Israel, both  with their minds and hearts. My impression is that al-Asad  recognizes Israel and wants to live with it in respectable peace.    [Peri] Based on your experience, could you please tell us  what is the Syrian weakest point? What is it that we should not  do?    [Al-Baz] Honor, you should not offend their honor. They are  as vulnerable as you are. Do not pose to al-Asad conditions for  a withdrawal, as if he did not have a public opinion to think  about. Let them take the initiative and display flexibility.  You should not believe for a minute that only Syria's top  echelon calls the shots. Syria is much more open today. The  government takes popular sentiment into account and there is an  opposition. It is not a totalitarian regime which ignores  popular sentiment. Countries such as Syria are today educating  a generation of youngsters about political awareness, and it is  not easy to change the mentality overnight.    Anybody walking down the streets of Syria today can hear  talk  against the government. Al-Asad needs time to explain. Also,  he cannot and does not want to throw all the opponents of the  process in jail. He would rather persuade them and obtain their  assistance. Here, I have given you food for thought.    [Peri] Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said what he did  about a future Palestinian state and an uproar ensued in Israel.    [Al-Baz] I read about it. It is healthy and good for people  to express themselves, even if their opinions are outside the  consensus. You will see, in three years Zvili's words will  become the consensus.    [Peri] In other words, there is no room for illusions. What  is happening now is leading to a Palestinian state.    [Al-Baz] I suppose so. A Palestinian entity which will  initially be linked to Jordan must be created. If you insist on  giving them only self-rule, the Palestinian problem will turn  into a time bomb. I know that you are anguishing over the  question of whether 'Arafat will be able to run affairs in the  territories and whether they will have economic independence.  These are the right questions.    [Peri] You want us to help the Palestinians raise funds.  What about abolishing the Arab boycott against Israel?    [Al-Baz] It is plain to me that the Arab boycott will  disappear as soon as peace agreements are signed with Syria,  Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palestinians. I estimate that by this  coming fall, or within a year at most, we will have agreements.  In my opinion, this is the last year of the Arab boycott.  There will no longer be a reason for its existence.    [Peri] What do you think Saddam Husayn wants? Some swear  he wants to join the peace process, while others claim he will  yet give us a bad surprise.    [Al-Baz] To tell you the truth, I do not know. I have no  idea what he wants.    [Peri] With your experienced and sober eyes, how do you see  the Middle East in another five years?    [Al-Baz] More stable and safer, with more traffic across the  borders. Even if old fears and suspicions do not disappear,  Israel will no longer be an anomaly, but a recognized neighbor.  I am not sure it will be the green Middle East of Peres'  scenario, but there will be contacts, economic relations, and  tourism. Israelis will be free to move in the Arab world.    [Peri] Will there be economic cooperation between Syria and  Israel?    [Al-Baz] I am sure about it, just as I am sure that I am  speaking to you now.    [Peri] I must end with two personal questions. You have  been involved in the peace process for 17 years and you have  made a significant contribution. At the beginning, however, I  believe you were very reluctant. In his book, Isma'il Fahmi  wrote that when al-Sadat informed a small group of people in  Cairo about his intention to visit Jerusalem you shouted: "The  president has gone mad, he should be tied up."    [Al-Baz] That is not true. I thought al-Sadat was serious,  but that we should not act on the spur of the moment and that  the matter should be given a second thought. I do not want to  brag about what I did in the process. I did my share. I had a  job. I contributed to the process.    It is true that I was initially skeptical. I wondered  whether Israel would respond. I knew we would have to deal with  the Likud government. Today I am definitely pleased. There is  no room for an analogy between the past and the situation today.  Many of our suspicions and the image we had about you turned  out to be totally unfounded. Had it not been for the peace with  Egypt, we would not be where we are today.    [Peri] When the time comes and you make a personal visit to  Israel, what would you like to do?    [Al-Baz] As in Egypt, I prefer informal and casual meetings.  I know your politicians, and I would go on such a trip to talk  to your intellectuals -- writers, painters, academics -- and to  the young generation of politicians. I have no desire to go  touring the country. I do no longer have the curiosity to see  new places. I prefer the company of people.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL DRAFT;  </P> <P> NFL TAKES PASS ON PEETE, WHOSE LONGEST DAY TURNS INTO OVERNIGHT WAIT  </P> <P> Rodney Peete walked into a Century City hotel suite early Sunday evening with  disappointment etched on his face.  </P> <P> "A day that was supposed to be one of the most exciting days of my life turned  out to be the most disappointing," the USC quarterback said.  </P> <P> Peete, runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, anticipated that he would be chosen no  later than the second round of the National Football League draft.  </P> <P> However, as the day droned by, through five rounds, Peete was still on the  outside looking in.  </P> <P> The charismatic quarterback, who holds virtually every USC passing record, was  passed up through 139 choices.  </P> <P> It was already known before the draft that Peete's crosstown rival, UCLA  quarterback Troy Aikman, would be chosen by the Dallas Cowboys leading off the  draft in the first round.  </P> <P> However, it was believed that Peete would be a high draft choice with the  speculation that he would might go to Green Bay, where his father, Willie, is  the running backs coach.  </P> <P> Green Bay had other plans, and Peete was ignored.  </P> <P> In fact, six quarterbacks were selected ahead of Peete through five rounds,  even though the USC quarterback was one of the most prominent players in  college football last season.  </P> <P> Peete spent the day with his mother, Edna, in a hotel room, while some members  of the media watched the televised draft proceedings on ESPN in another part of  the hotel.  </P> <P> And, when the first day of the draft ended, Peete's name still hadn't been  called.  </P> <P> Always available for interviews whether USC won or lost, Peete didn't want to  be interviewed, sending word to the few remaining reporters that he was just  too disappointed to talk.  </P> <P> However, Channel 7 sportscaster Jim Hill asked Peete to reconsider his position  without pressuring him.  </P> <P> So Peete left the room he shared with his mother and made a short statement.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I'm very disappointed," Peete said. "I expected going into today to  be gone by the first two rounds. As the rounds kept going, I was more and more  disappointed.  </P> <P> "I don't know why I haven't gone (been drafted) right now. All I can do is look  forward to tomorrow and see what is going to happen. All I want is an  opportunity to play and, hopefully, I'll get that opportunity with a good ball  club tomorrow.  </P> <P> "By then, once I know what team I'm going to I could better answer your  questions. But at this time it's really difficult for me to answer any  questions because I really don't know anything.  </P> <P> "I wish one of you guys would pinch me and wake me up from this nightmare."  </P> <P> Then, Peete left the improvised media room without answering any questions.  </P> <P> In 1980, another highly regarded USC quarterback, Paul McDonald, waited for his  name to be called in the draft in, at least, the second round.  </P> <P> But McDonald, like Peete, had to to wait and wait until he was finally drafted  by Cleveland in the fourth round.  </P> <P> Draft analysts gave Peete high grades for his leadership ability, mobility and  making things happen on the field.  </P> <P> He was downgraded only for his arm strength and, perhaps, the notion he wasn't  a stereotype NFL pocket passer.  </P> <P> However, it hadn't been predicted that he would go through five rounds without  being drafted. The draft will conclude today with seven more rounds.  </P> <P> It was anticipated that the San Diego Chargers might draft Peete, if Green Bay  didn't. Ted Tollner, the former USC coach who recruited Peete, is now the  Chargers' quarterback coach and he is exceptionally high on Peete's ability.  </P> <P> San Diego chose quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver of Texas Tech in the second  round, causing ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper to exclaim: "That makes no sense at  at all. He's no better than a fourth, fifth or sixth-round pick."  </P> <P> Kiper and other announcers kept reminding viewers that Peete was still  available.  </P> <P> However, it became apparent that it wasn't going to be Peete's day when  quarterback Jeff Carlson of Weber State was chosen on the fourth round by the  Rams, the 102nd pick overall.  </P> <P> And it must have been painful for Peete to realize that his UCLA adversary,  Aikman, was the most celebrated player in the draft even though Peete's Trojans  beat Aikman's Bruins the past two years, sending USC, not UCLA, to the Rose  Bowl.  </P> <P> Leonard Armato, an attorney who represents Peete through Management Plus  Enterprises, said he was surprised by the proceedings.  </P> <P> "Almost every scout said he was one of the top quarterbacks in the country,"  Armato said. "It's probably happening for the best, but the teams that passed  him up made a big mistake.  </P> <P> "He has always been a winner and I'm sure he will be again. His true talent  will show out in the end.  </P> <P> "Warren Moon (of the Houston Oilers) was passed by in the draft by almost  everybody. He went to Canada and now he's one of the highest paid players in  the game."  </P> <P> Peete, an outstanding college baseball player for USC, made his intentions  known months ago that he intends to pursue a pro football career. He might have  second thoughts now that he's in the low draft-choice category.  </P> <P> Five UCLA players were chosen before USC wide receiver Erik Affholter, Peete's  primary target, was chosen on the fourth round, the 110th pick overall. He was  selected by Washington, who then sent him to Green Bay in a pre-arranged deal.  </P></p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo For once the news from Lasmo is not entirely bad. It has managed to sell a chunk of its Liverpool Bay assets to PowerGen for what appears to be a full price in today's depressed oil market. Since it will also have to spend Pounds 56m less developing the field, the deal will cut its gearing by a useful 15 percentage points or so. That will reduce the constraints on its balance sheet as development spending rises to its peak in 1995. Lasmo can live more easily with low oil prices between now and then. And while its Markham field interest remains for sale, the company will be under less pressure to accept a fire-sale price. Yet the market's indifference to the announcement - its shares rose just 1p to 114p - is a reflection of the fact that selling off such valuable assets is a mixed blessing. PowerGen is matching the 25 per cent premium for the dollar value of the reserves which it paid to Monument Resources for a smaller stake last month. It evidently recognises the worth of Liverpool Bay. Lasmo's future share of this lucrative project will be smaller and it is also sacrificing existing cash flow from the Ravenspurn field amounting to some Pounds 18m. Nothing in yesterday's announcement changes the basic fact that Lasmo's large debts make it more highly geared to the oil price than most of its peers. The more a weak oil price prompts divestments now, the less it will earn later.</p>

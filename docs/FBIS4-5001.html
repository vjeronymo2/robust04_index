			<p>BFN     [Text] Ishikawa -- At a news conference on the morning of  6 April, Ishikawa City Mayor Takashi Hirakawa issued a statement  protesting the crash of a U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter. He  stated: "A jet belonging to the U.S. Kadena Air Base crashed  during exercises into the Miyamori Elementary School in Ishikawa  City 35 years ago. The accident killed 17 people, including 11  school children, and injured 121. Having experienced a tragic  accident in the past, we cannot look on the latest crash  nonchalantly. We will file a strong protest against the U.S.  forces and the Japanese Government, and will strongly demand  they take carefully thought-out measures to prevent similar  accidents." The Ishikawa City Government intends to send  letters of protest about the accident to ten officials,  including the prime minister, the ambassador to the United  States, the airbase commander, and the prefectural governor.</p>

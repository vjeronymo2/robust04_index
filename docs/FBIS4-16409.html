The sides have reached an accord and signed a  quadrilateral agreement on the voluntary return of refugees and  displaced persons that is appended to this statement. The  agreement guarantees the return of refugees and displaced  persons in accordance with current international practice, in  particular, that of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.    A special commission for refugees and displaced persons  composed of representatives of the sides, the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees, the Russian Federation, and the CSCE  in its capacity as an observer, will begin work in Sochi in the  middle of April 1994. Implementation of the agreement will begin  after the deployment of peacekeeping forces.    5. The sides reaffirm their request that the peacekeeping  operation begin as soon as possible and a Russian military  contingent form part of the UN peacekeeping troops, as stated in  the Memorandum on Understanding of 1 December 1993 and the  Communique of 13 January. The plan for implementing the  operation to safeguard peace will be coordinated with the sides  participating in the conflict.    The implementation of the operation to safeguard peace  should  also facilitate the safe return of refugees and displaced  persons.    The sides again call upon the UN Security Council to extend  the mandate of the UN Monitoring Mission in Georgia.    6. Abkhazia has its own constitution and legislation and its  corresponding state attributes: hymn, coat of arms, and flag.    7. The sides have held consultations on the division of  powers on the understanding that any agreement on this question  forms part of the general settlement and will be reached only  when a final resolution to the conflict has been found.    At this stage, the sides have reached a general  understanding  on powers relating to joint action in the following spheres:    a) foreign policy and foreign economic relations;    b) border service;    c) customs service;    d) power engineering, transport, and communications;    e) ecology and the elimination of the consequences of  natural disasters;    f) protection of human and civil rights and freedoms and  the rights of national minorities.    8. The sides have agreed to continue energetic efforts in  order to achieve a full-scale settlement.    The sides will form a corresponding commission that will  work  on a permanent basis, taking into account the decisions of the  UN Security Council and under the chairmanship of the United  Nations, with the participation of representatives of the CSCE  and Russian Federation and also international experts. The  committee will hold regular meetings in Moscow and Geneva. The  first meeting will take place in Geneva on 19 April 1994. A  stage-by-stage action program will be elaborated along with  proposals for the restoration of state-legal relations.    9. The sides have adopted a decision to implement additional  measures on the search for persons missing without trace and  reburial of the dead.    10. The sides, proceeding from the principle of the  inevitability of punishment for persons who have committed war  crimes and crimes against humanity, and also serious criminal  offenses, as determined according to international and national  law, have agreed to intensify their work concerning the  investigation of such crimes with the aim of bringing those  guilty to justice.    Persons who, with weapons in hand, are trying or will try to  wreck the peace process in Abkhazia will also not escape  punishment.    [Signed] On behalf of the Georgian side -- A.

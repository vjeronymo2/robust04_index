			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Average US worker's output beats Japan, research shows THE AVERAGE Japanese industrial worker is only 83 per cent as productive as the average American and only slightly ahead of the average German, research shows. Manufacturing productivity in Japan, according to a study from McKinsey, the international management consultants, is world-beating only in certain industries. Japan maintains a clear lead in internationally traded goods such as cars, steel and consumer electronics. But in brewing, US workers produce half again as many pints per head as the Japanese, and twice as many as the Germans. In food manufacturing, Japan's output per hour worked is only a third of America's. Japan's poor record in food, the study says, is largely due to protectionism and the weakness of Japanese retailers. Japan has more than three times as many food processing establishments as the US. Whereas the top five food retailers in Germany account for 43 per cent of the market, and in the US for 21 per cent, the figure in Japan is only 5 per cent. The key to improving productivity, McKinsey says, is global competition. In a truly global industry such as computers, there is little difference between the US and Japan, although the US retains a slight edge. In car manufacturing, the US has been goaded into catching up with Japan by the challenge of Japanese car plants set up in the US in the 1980s. The study concludes that the best way to improve productivity is through foreign direct investment, rather than exports. Transplants introduce higher productivity standards into a country. This also represents a big opportunity for global manufacturers, McKinsey says. Because there are such large variations in productivity between countries within the same industry, manufacturers can increase their profits by transferring their methods abroad.

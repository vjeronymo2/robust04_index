			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT IN B OF A HOLDERS' SUIT OKD  </P> <P> A federal appeals court Tuesday approved the settlement of a shareholder  lawsuit against BankAmerica, clearing the way for the distribution of $21.1  million to about 35,000 stockholders and former stockholders.  </P> <P> A three-judge panel from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in San  Francisco, unanimously affirmed a settlement approved by a federal judge in Los  Angeles in January, 1988. A former bank employee had filed an objection to the  settlement, but the court rejected his arguments.  </P> <P> The settlement resolved a series of lawsuits brought by shareholders who had  accused the parent of Bank of America of concealing its financial problems in  1985.  </P> <P> "People are likely to begin receiving their money later this year," said  Richard Greenfield, one of the attorneys who sued the San Francisco-based  banking company.  </P> <P> The money will go to people who have filed claims showing that they purchased  BankAmerica stock between March 8, 1984, and Aug. 1, 1986. Legal fees of about  $3 million will be subtracted from the $21.1 million.  </P> <P> The settlement also provides that BankAmerica receive $39.25 million from its  former insurer, Employers Insurance of Wausau, Wis. The insurer will also pay  the bank an additional $8.2 million to cover a portion of the losses suffered  by Bank of America in an unrelated mortgage-backed securities scheme in 1985.  </P></p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): A record year, but will it change our habits? - Unit trusts / A period of low interest rates might attract savers away from the safety of building societies towards the greater returns of collective funds Unit trusts had their best year ever in 1993. Net sales (gross sales minus repurchases) were Pounds 8.2bn in the 11 months to the end of December, well ahead of the previous record established in 1987. Funds under management edged close to Pounds 90bn, writes Philip Coggan. Low interest rates were undoubtedly the prime reason for the surge. With base rates at 6 per cent for much of the year, the income return from equities (especially when held in the form of a personal equity plan) was not behind that from deposits. Indeed, many trusts were able to offer returns well ahead of the building society alternative. Institutional, as well as private, investors were switching funds from cash to bonds and equities. The result was an excellent year for share prices - a fact which reinforced the desire of private investors to buy unit trusts. Fund managers can hardly believe their luck. Until November 1992, five-year performance figures were battered by the effects of the stock market crash of October 1987. At the end of November 1993, the average unit trust had produced growth of 72 per cent over five years, impressive enough figures to tempt most private investors. There is a 'promised land' within sight of the unit trust industry. A long period of low interest rates might cause a historic shift in British savings habits; away from the safety (but low returns) available from the building society and towards the greater returns (but greater risks) of collective funds. This shift has long since taken place in the US, where the savings &amp; loans industry (the equivalent of the building society movement) has a tarnished image. What investors should demand is an industry which tailors its products to their needs. One of the most popular types of collective fund in the US is the low-charging bond fund, which gives investors a safe but steady income. In the UK, bond funds have never been popular, partly because their high charges make them look like a poor deal, partly because inflation has eroded the value of fixed-rate investments. The only way this circle can be squared is for a major financial name, such as a high street bank, to launch a low-charging bond fund. For the fund manager, the only way such funds can work is to attract large volumes of money - a 0.5 per cent annual charge on a Pounds 1bn fund represents Pounds 50m a year. It will be interesting to see if a manager takes up the challenge in 1994. M&amp;G offers a 'pay as you leave' Pep One encouraging industry trend is a change in the charging structure. M&amp;G became the latest group to replace the initial charge on its personal equity plan with exit charges. This switch, which applies only to the Managed Income Pep, is designed to reward long-term investors; the exit fee, 4.5 per cent in the first year, falls to nothing after five years. Since Peps are supposed to be a long-term investment, this has to be a good deal for shrewd investors; although M&amp;G's annual fee, at 1.5 per cent, remains rather high. Over the long run, a higher-than-average annual fee will drag down the return to the investor. Fidelity was the first group to introduce Pep exit fees, in 1992. Its initial charge is 2 per cent; the industry norm is 5-6 per cent. High-risk funds fare best in a slowly rising market Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Higher Income Plan must be one of the most successful unit trust launches ever recorded. The fund, which offered a 10 per cent income (tax-free if held in a personal equity plan) uses a complex strategy involving the sale of call options to generate the income it offers. Investors evidently did not worry too much about the detail - with the return on their building society deposits falling rapidly, they were only too eager to grasp any product which offered a double-digit return. Morgan Grenfell eventually followed Hypo F&amp;C's lead and launched a similar product in October. But in December, Save &amp; Prosper raised doubts about the safety of such funds when it cancelled the launch of a trust that would have been run on similar lines. S&amp;P said that its models showed a significant risk of capital decline. Investors schooled in the principle of 'greater reward involves greater risk' should not be too surprised by this. Any fund which yields several percentage points above both base rates and gilts must either involve some risk (of capital loss), or be exploiting some anomaly (which will quickly disappear in an efficient financial market). In a statement made after S&amp;P had shelved its launch, Hypo F&amp;C and Morgan Grenfell said: 'These funds should not be confused with guaranteed funds; the two funds are actively managed according to market conditions. Neither the income, nor the level of capital, is guaranteed.' Broadly speaking, these funds will do best in a static, or slowly rising, stock market. In a fast-rising market, the funds will underperform their rivals, since, by selling options on their shares, the funds are giving up capital gain. And in a falling stock market, the funds will lose money (although they do have protection against a dramatic drop) and the income they receive from their call options might also dip. GT European balanced fund aims for 4.25% yield The quirks of the personal equity plan rules are giving a boost to the balanced-fund sector. Balanced funds offer a mix of bonds and equities, enabling them to provide a higher yield, and (in theory at least) a more stable performance than a pure-equity fund. Most balanced funds are UK-based. But GT launched a European Equity and Bond Fund in November, offering a 4.25 per cent gross yield. Nick Train, GT's investment director, argues that real interest rates (ie rates adjusted for inflation) still have plenty of scope to fall in Europe. When they do, money will move out of cash and into equities and bonds, giving a further boost to the prices of both asset classes. Furthermore, Train believes that European shares look cheap, relative to other major markets, on a price-to-assets and a price-to-cashflow basis. Since more than 50 per cent of the trust's portfolio will be in European Union shares, the fund will easily qualify for Pep status. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. The initial charge is 5 per cent (4 per cent on the Pep) and the annual charge is 1 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen said U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's China visit has not produced as many results as  formerly expected.    Qian made the assessment at a press conference here today.    In response to U.S. President Bill Clinton's reported  disappointment over Christopher's China visit, Qian said: "I am  also somewhat disappointed. My talks with Christopher have not  produced as many results as previously expected."    On U.S. granting China most-favored-nation trade status  (MFN), Qian said, its renewal will bring benefit to both China  and the United States. Otherwise, it will be bad news for both  countries, he said.</p>

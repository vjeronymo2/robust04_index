			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Power to the people: Charles Leadbeater and Andrew Adonis examine the need for a reform of democracy Democracy is leading a double life. Two and a half thousand years after its emergence, the virtues of contested elections and open debate are only just reaching parts of eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. Yet in democracy's heartlands, the developed liberal democracies of the west, there is malaise. Dissatisfaction with governments' performance is widespread. Parliaments often look like antiquated, self-serving talking shops. Leaders struggle to acquire credibility. Political parties are losing members. The media are often more effective in mobilising public opinion, for instance over Bosnia, than are political parties. Independent think-tanks and research groups often formulate more creative policies than parties or the civil service. In the era of Internet, telephone phone-ins and spreading experiments with electronic democracy, the 19th-century procedures of parliament and the council chamber have become anachronistic. Liberal democracies are increasingly run by oligarchies of professional politicians, only loosely constrained by occasional elections. The result is that the relationship between politicians and the people they represent has become tenuous. Most people can imagine forming a lasting relationship with the place they live in, the company they work for, friends and partners, and even products they regularly consume. But few people can imagine forming an engaged, active and trusting relationship with politicians. This public disillusion could generate growing apathy. To restore public confidence that politicians are fit to lead society, politics will have to reform itself, by becoming more transparent and responsive. Democracy changed in the past, most notably in the 19th century, with the extension of the franchise, the development of local government and the creation of political parties. It needs to change again, to give clearer control over the holders of political power to more people. A period of reform is needed to develop the role of direct democracy as a counterpoint to established channels of decision-making. Three moderate and specific measures to give citizens more direct say in politics would start to rejuvenate the established democracies: Voter Vetoes. Apart from Switzerland and a few US states, referendums are not used regularly to inform government decision making. The referendum was widely discredited in Europe by its use in Nazi Germany. Politicians dislike referendums because they take decisions out of established hands. A Voter Veto would overcome these objections. It would amount to an advisory referendum on legislation passed at a national or local level. Once laws were passed by parliament, for instance ratification of the Maastricht treaty, a referendum could be held if more than 2 per cent of the electorate signed a petition calling for a vote. The outcome would be purely advisory, but the prospect of such a vote would act as a check on hasty or unpopular decisions. In the UK the debacle over the poll tax may have been avoided had the country employed such a simple democratic check on the power of the executive. Voter Juries. The jury commands public respect as the centrepiece of a fair justice system, which works because hundreds of thousands of citizens a year give their time to make it work. The jury principle could be applied to politics. At a national level two juries of 20 randomly selected adults could be convened each year to deliberate upon issues such as whether universal childcare should be available for the under-fives and how it should be paid for; or whether there should be a law of privacy against press intrusion. Their decisions would be advisory, but under the law establishing the political jury system the government would have to take into account the findings. At a local level Voter Juries could advise councils on issues from planning to policing and housing. Voter Feedback. Governments should start experiments with local electronic democracy, so-called electronic town halls. Telecommunications and entertainment companies have launched a number of experiments with multimedia technology, to test the commercial prospects of using telecommunications to provide interactive links between televisions and computers. Advanced communications will play an increasing role in politics everywhere. But at the moment the most likely beneficiaries are the rising band of rich commercial-populist politicians, such as Ross Perot in the US and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy. To avoid multimedia being corralled by political leaders keen to promote themselves, there should be a matching public policy to test multimedia's potential for open democratic decision-making. A public policy to promote electronic democracy could usefully learn from the 'televote projects' in Oregon and Hawaii, in which voters were sent packages of information and argument before a televised town meeting, at which viewers could register votes electronically. From California to New Zealand, democratic experiments with the new communications technologies are under way. Europe should join the pack. A fuller version of these arguments is in articles by Andrew Adonis, Geoff Mulgan and Charles Leadbeater in the current Demos Quarterly, from 9 Bridewell Place, London EC4V 6AP</p>

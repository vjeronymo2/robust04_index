			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due TOMKINS, the conglomerate which has just bought Ranks Hovis McDougall, the bakery, milling and baking company, is expected to report today interim profits of Pounds 47m, up from Pounds 43.7m. Earnings per share are expected to be up 8 per cent. Tomkins is expected to be enjoying the beginnings of recovery in the US where it has extensive manufacturing operations. Wednesday sees interim results from Dixons Group. They will depend on how the electrical retailing group chooses to treat the Pounds 10m property development profits. Assuming they are not taken at the pre-tax line, taxable profits of about Pounds 10m are expected, against last time's Pounds 17.5m. Good growth in the UK retail side will lift profits to Pounds 20m (Pounds 16m), while in the US, losses will also grow to Pounds 14m (Pounds 11m). Its comments on Christmas trading which falls in its second half, will also be of close interest. The Rank Organisation, announcing preliminary results on Thursday for the year ended October, is expected to reveal unchanged trading profits for its managed businesses. But lower profits are expected at Rank Xerox, its photocopier joint venture, while profits from its 50 per cent stake in the Universal Studios theme park in Florida should be significantly higher. This adds up to group pre-tax profits slightly lower at Pounds 245m (Pounds 250.5m). The total dividend should be unchanged at 31p. First Leisure is reporting preliminary results on Wednesday for its financial year ended October. Pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from Pounds 30.4m to between Pounds 30.6m and Pounds 32m. Assuming Pounds 30.6m, earnings will fall to 15.5p (15.67p) after a higher tax charge, and a 10 per cent rise in the total dividend to 6.25p is expected. Securicor, the security and parcels delivery group, is forecast to unveil a sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 33m to Pounds 54m for the year on Thursday.

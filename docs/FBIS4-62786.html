			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Oleg Deyneko] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Industrial production slump in  Russia in the past month amounted to 50 percent of the 1991  level. The Russian economy has hit the bottom line, and must now  stabilise and improve, according to the Russian president's  analytical centre chief Yevgeniy Yasin.    Yasin told journalists at a press conference here that he  expected a u-turn from the end of 1994 when the slump will have  reached 20-25 percent of the 1993 level. "The situation will  stabilise then," Yasin predicted.    "This is much better than a lesser slump for a longer  period,  including 1995 and 1996," Yasin assured the journalists. He  also said the government has scored several successes in  combatting inflation. As of May 10, the inflation rate was  registered at 2- 2.5 percent and it is unlikely to exceed the  level by the end of the month.    More, the presidential analyst said the first signs of  stabilisation are already evident, almost a year ahead of the  deadline provided for in the program adopted by the Russian  Government on August 6,1993.</p>

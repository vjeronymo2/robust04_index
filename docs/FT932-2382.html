			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (5): The industry takes notice - Women travellers AS INCREASING numbers of women occupy executive suites in companies around the world, more are travelling for the job. But until recently, their special needs and preferences had largely been ignored by the travel industry. Once upon a time in hotels, it was hard to find a skirt-hanger. After-shave was more likely to be provided than body moisturiser. And dining alone meant being shunted to a table no one else would take. That has begun to change. Sheer numbers have obliged the travel industry to take notice of women. Over the last two decades, women have become the fastest growing segment of the travelling public. In 1970, they accounted for just 1 per cent of domestic US business travel. Since then the figure has shot up to 39 per cent. By the end of the 1990s, the American Hotel &amp; Motel Association (AHMA) expects women to account for half of all US business travel. Although surveys show that women pay attention to such amenities in hotels as the quality of toiletry products, soaps, shampoos, their principal concern is safety. The National Organisation for Women warns that a rape is reported every three minutes in the US and that, while they should not feel inhibited about travel to America, foreign women need to be aware of such violence. Security comes in many forms. Foremost is feeling safe in the hotel itself. Many high-quality establishments, such as the Ritz-Carlton, have private floors, which are accessible only with a pass-key. Barring that option, many women prefer to be in rooms on upper floors, to minimise unwanted encounters with passers-by, which are more frequent on lower floors. They also tend to have a preference for rooms near lifts, to avoid long walks down empty hallways. Hotels staffs are now also being trained to be security conscious, particularly regarding women. Holiday Inn Worldwide, for instance, instructs its front-desk staff never to announce a room number, so that anyone nearby shall not overhear it. Nor will they give room numbers over the telephone. Many hotels no longer put room numbers on their keys. In addition, the AHMA suggests that its members put peepholes on room doors, so that guests can see who is knocking. But it is considered wiser to check with the front desk before allowing anyone to enter the room. Women also like to avoid lonely garages and car parks. It is helpful for a hotel to have valet parking. One important piece of advice from travel professionals to women on the road is that they dress appropriately, but as inconspicuously as possible. Handbags should always be carried close to the body. And when in doubt about potentially dangerous areas in a strange city, they should consult the hotel concierge. Eating out in an unfamiliar place is always a problem for business travellers, who are usually pressed for time and unable to make a leisurely hunt for an interesting restaurant. The solution preferred by most women is room service. This saves them from the awkwardness of arriving unescorted at a restaurant and being treated ungraciously, which is too often still the case. Women also tend to stay away from hotel bars, to avoid unwanted advances. Those who must drive for their business trips face special safety problems. Carjacking and other attacks on women travellers in rental cars have become common in the US. It is crucial to keep car doors locked at all times and be certain of directions. If you are lost or having mechanical trouble, go to a well-lit public place to ask for help. Despite their special concerns about security, women 'basically don't want to be treated differently,' said a spokesperson for Holiday Inn Worldwide. According to the company's surveys of travellers, women enjoy their business travel and do not want hotel staffs to be over attentive. Their top choices for amenities are in fact the same as those of their male colleagues: a coffee-pot in the room, a comfortable lounge chair and a daily complimentary newspaper at the door.</p>

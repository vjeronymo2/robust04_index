			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Caird falls Pounds 26.5m into red Caird, the lossmaking waste management company crippled by a series of acquisitions in the 1980s, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 26.5m, after slightly higher than expected provisions and write-downs of Pounds 24m. This compared with Pounds 3.4m profits previously. The group sought to reassure investors that the worst was past, however, with news that it had broken even in the second half at the operating level. Sales fell 15 per cent to Pounds 18.1m, with revenue from continuing business down 11 per cent. The shares rose by  3/4 p to 8p. Mr David Weir, the chief executive appointed last year to restructure the group, said that while Caird was not yet out of the woods, 'we are confident the group will be able to trade profitably this year'. Caird was encouraged by what appeared to be a sustained increase in landfill prices from 'the uneconomic levels which the industry has been seeing for the last few years. Mr Weir said prices had risen by between 8 and 9 per cent over the last 12 months, although this had varied substantially between regions. Prospects for the special waste side were less encouraging. Mr Weir said Caird's main task this year would be to 'trade in line with expectations and build confidence so we can do something else'. The state of the group's balance sheet, with net debt of Pounds 21.9m and shareholders' funds which have fallen from Pounds 47.1m to Pounds 17.2m, would need to be addressed. In the medium term, Caird is expected to make a capital reconstruction. The losses were largely the result of a Pounds 24m provision, of which Pounds 23m had been announced at the interim stage. This covered the rationalisation, including a 26 per cent reduction in the workforce and closure of unprofitable sites. Some Pounds 17.6m was due to asset writedowns. There is no dividend, against last year's interim of 1.33p. Losses per share rose from 0.36p to 49.66p. COMMENT Caird has hopefully swept out all the skeletons with these provisions and looks better than for some time. It has made good progress on cutting costs and is generating cash to help reduce debt. A number of property disposals this year may do much to help ease the burden. Nevertheless, 1994 is not likely to be exciting. Forecasts are for anything from a marginal loss to a tiny net profit, with little prospect of a dividend before 1996. The shares are also likely to be shadowed by the prospects of a capital restructuring.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta and Jiri Bigas report: "Iran Suspected </F> Skodaexport Employee of Spying"]    [Text] The Iranian intelligence service suspected Ladislav  Tyl, a Skodaexport representative detained in Iran last year  under so far unexplained circumstances, of espionage. This was  reported by a diplomatic source that does not wish to be  identified in order to avoid difficulties in office.    Skodaexport Director General Jan Ricica, however, rejects  the  espionage charge. "Espionage activity is completely  unrealistic," he said. He emphasized that following the  intervention of the Czech ambassador to Tehran, Tyl was released  with the explanation that the suspicions had not been confirmed.    Tyl was arrested shortly after the departure of the Skoda  Plzen delegation that had visited Tehran to establish business  contacts and also discussed the possibility of supplying Iran  with modernized T-72 tanks. While some sources place Tyl's  arrest precisely in the context of Skoda Plzen Director General  Lubomir Soudek's business negotiations, Ricica said that such a  connection seem unlikely to him. Nevertheless, Tyl participated  in all Soudek's meetings in Tehran.    The Skodaexport director general also said that he could not  think of any reason for detaining Tyl. "Since there was no  indication of any links with the Skodaexport business activities  in the course of the incident, we are certain it must have been  a misunderstanding or a case of mistaken identity," he declared.    The Skoda Plzen business mission to Iran created suspicion  among some intelligence services that Skoda is trying to acquire  a share not only in supplies of conventional arms, but also of  technology for the Iranian nuclear program.    Tyl was detained by Iranian security on 7 December last  year,  and released five days later. He had worked in Iran for almost  four years. Following the incident, however, he returned home.  The arrest cut his planned stay in Iran by approximately 14  days.    In response to our question, the Iranian Foreign Ministry,  through its Prague embassy, refused to comment on the  circumstances of Tyl's arrest.    According to experts on this area, it cannot be ruled out  that the Iranian security service was attempting to find out  whether Tyl had any information about the Iranian nuclear  program.    Ricica considers Tyl's arrest a thing of the past. He says  he does not expect it to have an impact on future business  cooperation.</p>

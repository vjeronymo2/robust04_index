			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Germany to send troops to help UN in Somalia GERMANY will send 1,600 troops to Somalia to provide technical and humanitarian assistance despite continuing political disagreements over the role of German military personnel outside Nato. The soldiers will help rebuild roads, bridges and will secure water supplies. The decision follows a request by UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali last week, in which he said the German soldiers would be deployed in a 'secure environment' only. The coalition parties decided yesterday that Somalia was safe enough for soldiers to go there. It was also decided to send a small contingent of lightly armed infantry as protection. The decision is expected to be formally ratified by the cabinet today. The move has been attacked by the opposition Social Democrats who claim that there is a thin line between safe and unsafe areas. But party leaders indicated yesterday that they will not fight the decision in the federal constitutional court.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There was another day of man-hunts and looting in  Kigali on Sunday [10 April]. The corpses lying around on the  ground are being picked up in vans and buried in common graves.  Alongside these ghastly events, there has been fierce fighting  on the outskirts of Kigali between the army and the Patriotic  Front. Jean Helene is there:    [Begin Helene recording] Firing started close to the  Meridien  Hotel, 200 meters from the frontline -- or at least the one in  Kigali. Government sources speak of three other combat zones in  the north. In the capital, the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] are still fighting around the former parliament  building against the Presidential Guard, which is probably  supported by units of the Rwandan Armed Forces.    After a calm morning, heavy artillery could be heard  throughout the afternoon, and violent shelling shook the town  for 20 minutes this evening.    The RPF reinforcements that have been announced are still  awaited. Evidently they have been slowed down in their advance  toward Kigali.    UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] soldiers are making forays  every day from the Meridien, where stray bullets burst from time  to time: They are going to fetch expatriate families scattered  around the districts affected by the fighting. There are nearly  500 expatriates in the Meridien today, waiting for evacuation,  which can only be done when there is calm. [end recording]</p>

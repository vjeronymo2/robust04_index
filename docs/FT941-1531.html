			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome cloud Selling ahead of half-year figures today sent shares in Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company down 22 to 601p after announcement of an EU inquiry. The stock was already weak following a sharp sector sell-off in the US on Tuesday prompted by news that Sandoz, the US group, was planning to slash the price of a cholesterol treatment in order to gain market share. However, the full hit came when dealers reacted to news of an EU inquiry into its joint venture with Warner Lambert. Analysts said the inquiry was routine and believed that the stock market had overreacted and had also ignored news that Wellcome had obtained an option to develop and market Glaxo's experimental compound 3TC for treating of AIDS. Elsewhere in the sector, SmithKline Beecham lost 11 at 390p and Zeneca 13 at 740p.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: Artists - made in America / A look at the later period of the two current US exhibitions and finds it wanting American Art in the 20th Century, installed at the Royal Academy and the Saatchi Gallery for the autumn, manages to be at once highly questionable in its partiality and deeply conventional in its general view, an unusual polarity. As to the former aspect, here we have what purports to be a true and definitive survey, the American chapter in the Academy's on-running study of our century's art, country by country. Yet it blithely asserts that America's engagement with the modern movement began only in 1913, with the Armory show in New York, as though American artists until then knew nothing and cared less of the European art of the previous 50 years, of Degas and Manet, Monet and Cezanne, Gauguin, Picasso and Van Gogh. So it goes on, for if you can ignore Whistler or Sargent at the beginning, there is hardly a problem with forgetting American realism between the wars, with its inconvenient reminder, uncomfortable thought, that all art is modern art in its time, and the avant-garde not set on rails. It is just so again later on, through the post-war period and on to our own time - no Milton Avery, Diebenkorn, Morris Louis, no Nevelson, Poons, Kienholz, Segal, Close. But none of this would matter a jot if the selectors, Norman Rosenthal of the Academy and Christos Joachimides of the Zeitgeist-Gesellschaft of Berlin, had only had the nerve to parade their partiality, and to argue its case. But no: theirs must be the disinterested survey of the true course of American modernism, and final judgment on what is significant and, by simple omission, what is not. It is a large claim and, in relation to particular artists and their achievement, not one to be lightly dismissed. The case is especially strong with the early and central phases of abstract expressionism, at times magnificently displayed, with Arshile Gorky and Jackson Pollock in the 1940s, and Willem de Kooning and David Smith in the 1950s and 1960s, all of them clearly major figures. Further on the case is as well made, if more succinctly, with the minimalism of Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Agnes Martin and Richard Serra. But even this is only well-established, conventional stuff, the reading of American art taken at its own critical valuation as passed on by an insistent cultural machine these four decades past. If it does not fit the pattern, leave it out. Early Rothko? Still too problematical. Richard Diebenkorn? A one-off. But for the rest, of course, the American example led the way. At times it has even seemed that if it was not made in America and, more to the point, sold in New York, it was hardly modern art, and Jasper Johns the greatest artist in the history of the Universe. What is the story, as it is told here? An early engagement with Duchampian Dada jumps the decades to affect the conceptualism and anti-art of the past 25 years or so. Meanwhile, an interest in collage and graphic ephemera is picked up from Picasso only to lie dormant for a generation, to re-emerge, writ large, as post-war American Pop. Before that comes the big one, abstract expressionism, that great climacteric after which painting will never be the same again. And what really was its great and original contribution? Looking to the painterly surrealism of such as Picasso, Ernst and Miro, the influences upon American painters were clear. What could they do to distinguish themselves? Paint it big: better still, paint it vast. Vive la difference. Taken as an opportunity and choice rather than an imperative, this new and more than ample scale in painting represented a genuine development. The canvas was transformed from support into arena, the mark at the brush's end amplified into grand theatrical gesture, and colour itself made palpable and all-enveloping. Painting became an event, a process, a drama, an experience. The sad misuses of so positive an opportunity are all too apparent at the Saatchi Gallery, which covers the period since 1970. Here, displayed with an ironic elegance, is the betrayal of painting in the name of market fashion and facile reputation. By now anything goes. One mark is as good as another, and the merest indication of an image is taken for its realisation. Here, as painting, we find only the witless crudity of Julian Schnabel, the cynical graffiti of Basquiat, Keith Haring's mechanical illustration and the pathetic manikins of Jonathan Borofsky. No wonder poor Philip Guston, the only true painter among them, ducks his head in desperation behind the parapet. To get to the review of Agnes Martin's recent work, at the Serpentine, is a relief. Here again, at its most refined and minimal, is true painting, though austere and even forbidding to one unfamiliar with its convention. Given such simplicity - cool, light colour grounds gently inflected, tone to tone, coloured stripe to stripe, and articulated by nothing more than a ruled pencil line - the work is unashamedly formulaic and this show might seem rather small. Yet it is a paradox of such work, with each canvas requiring time and close attention to reveal its peculiar qualities, that much more would too soon become a surfeit. These are objects for quiet and private contemplation rather than the distraction of the public gallery. A close visual harmony is established, teasing the eye at the very threshold of actual perception. A linear structural interval is set up in counter-point, to get going a gentle rhythm in the eye's mind. It is barely there, ultimately seductive, very beautiful.

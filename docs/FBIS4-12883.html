			<p>BFN     [Text] Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im  Qasim has stated that the Cabinet's decision banning radio and  television networks from broadcasting news is unfair, reckless,  and irrational. This decision does not respect the citizen's  rights, Shaykh Qasim added.    Shaykh Qasim urged the officials to reverse their decision  and to find the right path to overcome this crisis. He noted  that the government must work out the proper legislation.    In a statement to AKHBAR AL-YAWM news agency, Shaykh Qasim  said that Lebanon is a country of rights and it cannot live  without them. We have cooperated with all parties so that peace  will prevail and so the logic of one's word and truth will  replace the language of arms, Shaykh Qasim said.    In his statement, the Hizballah official maintained that the  pretexts used are absolutely invalid, because the country's  security cannot be jeopardized by a word or a statement.  Rather, security is threatened by the tools of destruction. He  added: The officials must curb those who disturb the internal  situation and do things harmful to the citizens' interests. But  to stifle all voices under various pretexts is unacceptable and  runs counter to the freedom of expression, which must be enjoyed  by all Lebanese citizens. He pointed out that the unanimous  denunciation by almost all factions is unequivocal evidence that  the cabinet's step is wrong.    Shaykh Qasim continued that if this step is a prelude to  more stringent steps, the government's monopolization of the  radio and television media, or a prelude to restricting the  freedom of the press it will have no positive results nor  promote freedom and peace in this country. Therefore, no side  can impose its opinions on others, not even the authorities  backed by the law. This is because the laws and authority in  Lebanon are committed to safeguarding the people's freedoms.    Shaykh Qasim said that the three-year delay in issuing the  law on organizing the media is irrational. He noted that there  are various whimsical attitudes to limiting the freedom of  expression.    Asked whether the officials support freedom of expression in  the country, Shaykh Qasim said that many people seek to impose  the law of the jungle in which some people would dominate  politically, economically, and militarily. These people also  want to manipulate the freedoms to enable them gain control.    Asked whether the Hizballah deputies would heed his opinion  and defend it in the Chamber of Deputies, Shaykh Qasim said:  Certainly; because they are committed to defend the party and  the people. He expressed readiness to coordinate with all the  media.</p>

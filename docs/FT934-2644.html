			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Management: How to stay in touch with the real world - Liam Strong, chief executive of Sears, describes his methods for sifting and exploiting information / Tips from the Top Information is the life-blood of any business, the oxygen that feeds all major decisions. As technology has increased the speed with which news is made available throughout the world, senior executives need to keep abreast of an ever wider range of subjects. The information demands of any job can be daunting, but it is a salutary fact that any information you require, no matter how elusive, is undoubtedly available if you know how to find it. I spend about 10 minutes skimming the daily papers but tend to read all the Sunday papers. The UK press generally has very good coverage of international events and I do not usually take international papers. The exception to this is the Sunday edition of The New York Times which I get occasionally because it has probably the best book review section of any newspaper. New York is still a city where reading the latest books before your friends is almost a competitive sport. I flick through fashion magazines to keep up to date with trends and advertising. I make a special point of looking at magazines for younger readers because trends move much faster in this sector. So far as business reading is concerned, I am now faithful to a small number of publications. Fortune, because it has good, well written articles and is beautifully designed. The McKinsey Quarterly, because it is a good indicator of current trends. And the Harvard Business Review, whose abstracts I flick through with a view to sending copies of articles around the organisation. I try to maintain an international network of people who see my markets from a particular vantage point: international store designers, fashion journalists, retail experts from leading business schools, analysts in major market research and brokerage houses and a few venture capitalists on the West Coast and in East Asia. It is wise to assume that all your competitors have access to the same data as you, so any competitive edge will be determined by how fast you can get the available facts and how effectively you use them. There is a danger of assimilating too much undifferentiated information on too many different subjects. I try to ensure that our company has a working hypothesis on developments that are likely to have an impact on our markets. So our information gathering is therefore focused on revising and evolving our current view of the future. An operation as large as Sears is itself a huge repository of information and I talk to people at all levels as often as possible. Also, the Sears management works hard to ensure everyone is exposed to raw data. Reports and figures that have been diluted by cool corporate language provide little of the flavour of what is really going on. We all sit in on research sessions, listen to interview tapes regularly and ensure that our buying teams are getting directly involved with the customer groups they are serving. Another extremely effective way of discovering how well your company is operating is to spend time with suppliers. They are in a unique position to say how well the middle management level in your organisation is living up to the promises made in the corporate mission statement. Finally, I try to get out of the office as often as possible. There is no substitute for direct experience. Few of us get out of the office into the real world often enough. For relaxation, I am a steady reader of fiction and usually get through a book a week. The range is fairly eclectic. I am not a radio fan, but I do listen to the Archers occasionally to upstage my wife who is a fanatical follower. I rarely watch television. I travel a great deal and aeroplanes, at least in Europe, are still a haven from the telephone and a great place to work and catch up on reading. At airports I usually buy a wide range of magazines including, I have to confess, Hello]. Next Monday: George Prince of the Synectics Corporation on running better meetings.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port au Prince, 30 May (EFE) -- Today, Haitian  Information Minister Jacques Saint-Louis said the de facto  government of Emile Jonassaint will not accept the return of the  paramilitary group known as Tonton Macoutes, which was created  during the years of the Duvalier dynasty.    In an interview on Radio Metropole, Saint-Louis said the  Jonassaint government will not permit the return of the group  which was dissolved in 1986. He recalled that the Haitian  Constitution authorizes only the Army and the police as armed  corps. Saint-Louis urged the people to remain alert in case of  a foreign invasion, however.    Franck Pierre, of the Capois La Mort organization (on Army  salary), asked General Raoul Cedras, commander of the Haitian  Armed Forces, to decree a general mobilization to face the  foreign threat. Pierre also asked Cedras to reintegrate retired  officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces to form a "Grand  Military Council" and put the country on a war footing.    The leader of the extreme right organization urged Cedras to  request Parliament and the president de facto to declare a state  of siege in the country.    Meanwhile, the announcement about the resurging of the  Tonton  Macoutes continues sparking reactions from political leaders.  Reynold Georges, of the (center-right) Alliance for the  Liberation of Haiti, said the announcement is "a violation of  and an injury to" the Constitution.    Eddy Volel, of the (center-left) Reunion of Christian  Democrats, said that with this maneuver, the military will  provoke a civil war in the country.</p>

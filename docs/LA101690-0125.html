			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOLLY-SEACLIFF OKD BY COUNCIL OVER PROTESTS  </P> <P> Despite pleas from residents to delay action, the City Council on Monday night  voted 6 to 1 to approve a controversial development agreement for  Holly-Seacliff, the biggest development project in the city's 86-year history.  </P> <P> The agreement with Pacific Coast Homes, a sister firm of the Huntington Beach  Co., came after rancorous debate and testimony from several citizens who  accused the City Council of needlessly rushing the big project and bowing to  the political dictates of the powerful Huntington Beach Co.  </P> <P> "One thing I've learned in my 25 years in Huntington Beach is that I don't  trust the Huntington Beach Co.," said resident Dave Sullivan, in urging the  council to scuttle the proposed agreement.  </P> <P> But the council majority, including Councilman Peter M. Green, who usually  sides with slow-growth elements, said they were convinced that the agreement  overall would be good for the city.  </P> <P> The sole opposing vote came from Councilwoman Grace Winchell, an environmental  activist who said the city could get the same benefits that are in the  development agreement simply by proceeding on a project-by-project basis.  </P> <P> Winchell said she opposed the agreement because "it locks future councils in as  to what may be needed for citizens of this city."  </P> <P> The $1-billion, 15-year pact with Pacific Coast Homes calls for transforming  545 acres once dotted by dozens of oil wells in northwest Huntington Beach into  an upscale area of 3,780 residential units, four new parks and landscaped  pockets of commercial and light-industrial areas.  </P> <P> City planners say at least 10,000 new residents will move into the city as  Holly-Seacliff evolves over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> The council's approval of the long-range pact came despite fears expressed by  some residents of the city tightening its bond with the controversial and  influential Huntington Beach Co.  </P> <P> The company and the city have had a symbiotic relationship since 1904, when the  company took over the village of Pacific City, changed its name to Huntington  Beach and began marketing residential lots.  </P> <P> Both the Huntington Beach Co. and Pacific Coast Homes are now wholly owned by  Chevron, and together the three entities are the largest land owners in the  city. All three companies are heavily involved in the city's political  campaigns.  </P> <P> "I worry about this agreement being fulfilled because sometimes the Huntington  Beach Co. acts as if it's above the law," Planning Commission Chairwoman Geri  Ortega said last week.  </P> <P> But the council majority said Monday night that Huntington Beach will gain  substantial benefits from the development pact and that many safeguards are  built into the agreement.  </P> <P> "I think it's good planning for the city and good planning for the future,"  said Mayor Thomas J. Mays.  </P> <P> The agreement will allow the company to build 1,200 single-family homes and  2,580 town houses and condominiums. The residences will range from townhouses  expected to sell for about $250,000 to single-family estates with ocean views  that will sell for $1 million or more.  </P> <P> Bill Holman, project manager for the Huntington Beach Co., said the city has  much to gain from the development.  </P> <P> "The company is taking a financial risk in this because we have pledged to  build all the infrastructure -- the roads and improvements -- before we do  anything else," Holman said in an interview before Monday night's City Council  meeting.  </P> <P> Holman said the city, represented by new Huntington Beach Administrator Michael  T. Uberuaga, proved to be a tough negotiator . . . "very tenacious."  </P> <P> Uberuaga has said he is a hard-liner on development agreements because they  generally prove to be more beneficial to developers than to city government. He  told the council last week that he would not give his blessing to the  Holly-Seacliff pact unless it contained "many things the city otherwise would  not be able to obtain." He withheld his approval last week because the  development company balked at agreeing to pay new fees on Holly-Seacliff --  fees that future city councils may enact during the next 15 years.  </P> <P> Pacific Coast Homes ultimately yielded to Uberuaga's insistence on accepting  new fees.  </P> <P> Following that concession, Uberuaga said he could now recommend approval of the  pact because it contained several major items beneficial to the city. The  agreement, he noted, also requires the developer to make the following:  </P> <P> Give 41 acres of land to the county's new Bolsa Chica Linear Regional Park.  </P> <P> Donate an additional 12 acres of land for neighborhood parks in Holly-Seacliff.  </P> <P> Build a new police substation and a new fire station, both in the  Holly-Seacliff area.  </P> <P> Construct a new water reservoir in the area.  </P> <P> Widen and improve existing roads in the area and build several new ones.  </P> <P> Pay double the city's existing traffic-impact fees.  </P></p>

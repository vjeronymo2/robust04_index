			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Nikonov, deputy of the Russian </F> Federation State Duma, under the "Carte Blanche" rubric: "A  Hereditary Party. Why Are We Increasingly Hearing About  Delaying Presidential and Parliamentary Elections?"]    [Text] Efforts are afoot to gradually condition us to the  fact that the next presidential and parliamentary elections will  not take place at the time established by the Constitution.  Rumors, inspired "leaks" followed by direct statements on this  count, and many other things point to a decreasing possibility  of the voters electing a new Duma at the end of 1995 and voting  for a new, or old, president in June 1996.    Hints are coming from circles close to the head of state's  entourage about the possibility of prolonging the Federal  Assembly's brief, two-year, existence for another couple of  years in exchange for an analogous extension of the incumbent  president's powers. In the Duma such a deal, relieving the  deputies of the headache caused by the need to face fresh  elections, finds increasing understanding. An appeal recently  circulated by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]  faction contains the following number one point: "Given the  absence of normal conditions for lawmaking activity by the Duma  and the deputies in working with their constituents, the term of  its present composition should be extended by two years."    Thank God, so far the LDPR does not set the procedures for  forming state power bodies, but it is clear that a drive toward  destroying the corresponding constitutional provisions has begun.    Even now it is clear which arguments are being made and will  yet be made in support of this idea. Many words will be spoken  about the vital need for stability and continuity of power,  which were secured at such pains in the Social Accord Pact.  About the impermissibility of jeopardizing democratic  transformations embodied by President Boris Yeltsin. About the  need for more time for the main power branches to adapt and  begin real work to adopt the legislative enactments that are so  important to Russia. And finally, historical arguments will be  cited to confirm that the prolonged existence of state  leadership in unchanged form fully corresponds to the domestic  political tradition.    I cannot say that the above-mentioned arguments have no  political or logical rationale. Nonetheless I am sure: To  follow this path is not in the country's interests. And not  because the intention is primarily to keep in power those who  already have it.    Continuity and efficiency of state institutions and the need  for their adaptation should have been considered earlier, when  the current Constitution was being written and adopted. Now,  for all its imperfections, it -- and not individual  personalities -- is the guarantor of social and political  stability. What undermines the state's buttresses and hinders  consolidation of the democratic tradition is violations of the  Constitution, increasingly committed by top officials.    I shall venture to state my confidence that Russia will  emerge as a democratic and civilized state only when a  constitutional change of supreme ruling authority takes place in  the country for the first time in its more than millennium-old  history.    I stress: constitutional, not merely apparently legitimate,  as has been the case in the previous decades and centuries.    Before 1917, there was no constitution to speak of, and  therefore there could be no question of the handover of power.  Continuity was ensured through heredity, and this was called  monarchy. After the Revolution there were many fundamental laws  but none of them stipulated a mechanism for such a handover,  while the supreme ruling authority itself was for the most part  unconstitutional. The removal of Mikhail Gorbachev from the  helm also, as is known, had nothing to do with the Constitution  -- the Union or the Russian one -- and brought about the  destruction of the USSR.    The democratically elected legislative bodies have also been  unlucky. Out of four pre-Revolutionary Dumas, three were  disbanded. Neither the Congress of People's Deputies and the  Supreme Soviet of the USSR, nor the Congress and Supreme Soviet  of the Russian Federation of the previous convocation died a  natural, that is to say constitutional, death. And the birth of  the present Federal Assembly was never based on the Law.    One conclusion follows from all this: Presidential and  Federal Assembly elections should take place when they are  supposed to. Only in this event shall we be citizens of a  democratic country, not an eastern despotic regime with some  democratic embellishments. If there are no elections, it will  be a short way to hereditary presidency and deputyship.    Some may dislike this. But not myself or my colleagues in  the Duma PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction.</p>

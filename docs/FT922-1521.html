			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Balancing profit and principle: A look at the fixed social objectives of the Co-operative movement IN THE windswept town of Lerwick in the Shetland Isles there is a fine Co-op supermarket that sells basic provisions to the locals, occasionally supplemented by a big demand for fancy chocolates from passing Russian sailors. The supermarket charges exactly the same prices as its sister stores on the Scottish mainland - in spite of the high additional costs of transporting goods to the island by sea and the lack of any serious competition. That seemingly perverse commercial approach sums up the trading philosophy of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, Europe's biggest Co-operative organisation. Mr David Skinner, 60, who today takes over as chief executive of the CWS, explains it by saying that, for the Co-operative movement, social responsibility comes before revenue. Profit is not all. The CWS, owned by the 65 retail societies and 200,000 individual members and boasting sales of Pounds 3bn a year, believes it has a duty to serve such remote communities rather than to exploit them. Such principles have changed little since 1844, when a group of 28 working men, known as the 'Rochdale pioneers', formed the first co-operative society to supply members with unadulterated food. The assets were held in trust and the most of the venture's profit - or surplus - was returned to members in the form of 'divis'. The Co-operative movement's influence grew enormously in the late 1800s as it became embedded in working-class culture. By the turn of the century there were 1,400 societies in Britain with imitators around the globe. In more recent years, the history of the movement has been one of seemingly inexorable decline, however. The end of rationing after the Second World War, the abolition of resale price maintenance in the mid 1960s and the emergence of strong national retailing chains with easy access to capital markets combined with the changing economy and class composition of the UK to hasten the erosion of the movement's appeal. Its share of the retail market is down to less than half what it was in the 1920s. Nevertheless, with annual sales of more than Pounds 7bn and with 83,000 staff and 8m members, the 65 Co-operative societies still account for 5 per cent of all retail sales. Sir Dennis Landau, who has just retired after 12 years at the helm of the CWS, says: 'The Co-operative movement is the third sector in the economy, quite unlike either the private or the public sectors.' The pioneers would 'be hellish surprised' by the present shape of the movement, he says. The CWS alone is now the UK's biggest commercial farmer, a non-profit wholesaler to the rest of the Co-operative movement, a big food manufacturer and retailer as well as a substantial operator of funeral, travel, banking and insurance services, opticians and milk deliveries. During his tenure Sir Dennis instilled a far greater commercial instinct in the CWS by re-investing more in the infrastructure of the business, introducing more efficient central warehousing, upgrading the quality of its stores portfolio and leading the way in appealing to environmental and ethical shoppers. 'At the end of the 1960s the writing was clearly on the wall for the Co-operative movement,' he says. 'It took us a long time to realise that to do anything in the world we had to be economically successful. We had to have a bottom line.' Mr Skinner notes that the Co-operative movement can attempt to build on a very strong presence in certain parts of the country. In Scotland, north and south-west England, he says it has more than 15 per cent of the regional packaged grocery markets. He believes there is more scope for the Co-operative movement to exploit its collective strength while maintaining its deep-rooted independent traditions. 'If we get the trading formula right, we can get the best of both worlds,' he says. 'We can be a strong regional business which people can identify with but also have the benefits of being a national operator.' In spite of the improvements, however, the Co-operative movement's progress will continue to be hampered by its inability to raise money from the stock market and the performance of some of the weaker societies, which tend to damage the Co-op's image and cause difficulty when they are eventually absorbed into larger societies. No Co-operatives are ever allowed to go bust. Mr Richard Hyman, director of Verdict, the retail research group, says: 'The Co-operative movement is in vastly better shape than for a long, long time and may be able to arrest the rate of decline in market share. But in the longer term it must continue to fall.' Mr Skinner has a tough job trying to balance principle and profit. Many consumers will hope he succeeds. Not least the shoppers of Lerwick.</p>

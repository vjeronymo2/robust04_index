			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Japanese makers defend HDTV Japan's main electronics manufacturers yesterday strongly criticised the telecommunications ministry's surprise decision to review the country's high definition television programme, saying they would continue to promote the analogue HDTV system at present in use. Mr Tadashi Sekimoto, chairman of the Electronics Industry Association of Japan and president of NEC, said yesterday it was his firm belief that the Japanese HDTV system, developed by the public broadcaster NHK and known as Hi-Vision, would continue. Hi-Vision was one of the few technologies Japan had developed on its own and one which it could be proud of. 'If there is a better system, maybe we should use that system, but there is no such system at present. Hi-Vision is the only existing high definition TV system anywhere in the world,' he declared. Mr Sekimoto's remarks came in the wake of statements by a ministry official supporting digital TV over Japan's currently-used analogue Hi-Vision. Mr Akimasa Egawa, director general of the ministry's broadcasting administration bureau, proposed that Japan promote a digital HDTV system in order not to step out of line with the international trend towards digital television. His remarks shocked the industry which has been selling Hi-Vision sets, and has poured as much as Y1,000bn (Pounds 6.32bn) into developing Hi-Vision, according to industry estimates. It was in Japan's interests to continue developing Hi-Vision, Mr Sekimoto added. The government, NHK and consumer electronics makers have together put efforts into Hi-Vision broadcasting. Efforts will be made to extend broadcasting time, increase software, and reduce the price. Mr Sekimoto was joined in his defence of Hi-Vision by Mr Norio Ohga, president of Sony, Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita, and other representatives of Japan's leading electronics companies.</p>

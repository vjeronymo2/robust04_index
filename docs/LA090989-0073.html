			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN HAS SURGERY FOR FLUID ON BRAIN  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan underwent "successful" surgery Friday in  Rochester, Minn., to drain a "collection of old blood" on his brain, apparently  the result of his horseback riding accident two months ago, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> "President Reagan is conscious and recovering in his room, where he is  comfortable and in good spirits," Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said shortly  after the operation. He added that the surgery, which lasted slightly more than  an hour, was "without complications."  </P> <P> The buildup of blood and other fluids between the membranes that separate the  brain and the skull is known as a chronic subdural hematoma. It was found  during a "routine physical examination" at the Mayo Clinic, where the  78-year-old Reagan and his wife, Nancy, frequently receive medical care,  Weinberg said in a written statement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Routine Procedure  </P> <P> Although Reagan had not experienced any symptoms, his physicians recommended  that the fluid, on the top of the right side of his brain, be removed in a  routine procedure at St. Marys Hospital, a Mayo Foundation Hospital, Weinberg  said.  </P> <P> "President Reagan's care is being managed by a team of physicians and nurses  from the Mayo Clinic who are completely satisfied with the result of today's  procedure and with President Reagan's recuperation thus far," Weinberg added.  He said that although "no further treatment is anticipated," Reagan will be  "carefully monitored."  </P> <P> President Bush, returning to Washington aboard Air Force One from New Orleans,  told reporters "I hope it's all right -- pray it's all right."  </P> <P> The relatively common neurosurgical procedure is performed under general  anesthesia. It consists of drilling small holes about the size of a dime, known  as "burr holes," through the skull and drawing out the fluid by putting a tube  through the burr hole and sucking it out with a syringe.  </P> <P> Typically, one to three burr holes may be required and between four and 12  ounces of fluid may be removed. In Reagan's case, one burr hole was apparently  required.  </P> <P> Neurosurgeons not connected with the case said the operation was usually  successful for patients with the former President's condition.  </P> <P> Dr. Lawrence H. Pitts, chairman of neurosurgery at San Francisco General  Hospital, said the technique was "a fairly straightforward procedure."  </P> <P> "In the vast majority of cases, all of the fluid can be extracted just through  the burr holes," said Dr. Neil A. Martin of the UCLA Medical Center. Making a  burr hole "does not involve any great risks to the brain or its blood supply."  </P> <P> Martin said that patients typically remained in the hospital for about a week  and then continued to recuperate for at least several weeks outside the  hospital. The "great majority" of patients recover fully, he said.  </P> <P> The holes in the the skull are not patched, but fill with scar tissue. A small  indentation of the scalp may result, but significant cosmetic problems are  unusual.  </P> <P> Potential complications include heart or lung problems related to the surgery  and anesthesia and, rarely, infections. In addition, in about 10% of cases, the  fluid reaccumulates, Martin said.  </P> <P> Chronic subdural hematomas contain blood and decayed blood cells. They are the  long-term result of bleeding on the surface of the brain from veins that are  damaged by head trauma. The hematomas may occur at any age, but are most likely  to develop in infants and the elderly, whose blood vessels may be more fragile.  </P> <P> The initial bump on the head may be relatively minor but fluid can continue to  accumulate after the actual bleeding stops. This is because the concentration  of blood and its breakdown products can attract fluids from surrounding  tissues.  </P> <P> If a sufficient amount of fluid accumulates, symptoms such as headaches,  difficulty in walking, seizures or weakness of an arm or leg can develop. More  severe head trauma may cause symptoms to develop within days or weeks of the  injury.  </P> <P> Reagan, a riding enthusiast, suffered bruises and scrapes July 4 when he was  thrown from a bucking horse on a rocky downhill slope at a friend's ranch in  the Mexican state of Sonora. At the time, news reports made no specific mention  of head injuries.  </P> <P> After the accident, Reagan was flown by helicopter to an Army hospital in  Arizona, where physicians examined him, took X-rays, and pronounced him in  excellent condition. After the examination, Reagan returned to the ranch to  continue his vacation, against the advice of physicians who suggested that he  remain at the hospital overnight.  </P> <P> The Reagans, who live in Los Angeles, arrived in Rochester Wednesday evening  and both underwent routine medical check-ups Thursday. Weinberg said that aside  from the former President's hematoma, the Mayo Clinic physicians found the  Reagans are "in excellent health."  </P> <P> Weinberg's statements about Reagan's illness did not indicate what tests were  performed to diagnose the subdural hematoma. Usually this abnormality is  diagnosed with a CT scan or an MRI scan, special radiological techniques to  examine internal structures of the body.  </P> <P> The statements also did not indicate why Reagan had undergone tests that might  diagnose a brain problem if he was not experiencing symptoms. In addition, the  spokesman did not indicate if worrisome abnormalities had been detected during  his check-up. For example, when physicians examined the blood vessels in the  back of the eye, they might have detected a swelling known as "papilledema"  that may indicate high pressure within the skull.  </P> <P> Many physicians do not recommend tests such as a CT scan of the brain for  asymptomatic patients. "If somebody is having headaches, that is one thing,"  Martin said. "But a CT scan is not part of a routine physical examination."  </P> <P> Reagan had a series of health problems during the eight years he served as the  nation's chief executive, including surgery for colon cancer in July, 1985, and  surgery for an enlarged prostate in January, 1987. In March, 1981, he was shot  in the chest in an attempt on his life. He underwent three hours of emergency  surgery at George Washington University Hospital in Washington,  </P> <P> REAGAN'S BRAIN SURGERY: Former President Ronald Reagan underwent what a  spokesman described as successful surgery Friday to drain a chronic subdural  hematoma. The condition apparently resulted from the 78-year-old Reagan's  horseback riding accident in July.  </P> <P> The subdural hematoma is a build-up of blood and fluid beneath the dura mater,  the fiber-like outermost layer of the membranes that surround the brain and  spinal cord. The corrective surgery consists of drilling small holes about the  size of a dime through the skull and draining the fluid.  </P></p>

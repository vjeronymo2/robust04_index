Gazprom warned Ukraine again that the supplies might be  stopped on February 9 unless the debt, 1.2 trillion rubles as of  February 1, is paid.    According to Belei, Yefio Bvyagilsky, acting prime minister,  had informed experts on an agreement reached with the Russian  Government to the effect that Ukrainian supplies to Russia would  be regarded as payment of the debt.    On the other hand, Stepan Yalovega, the spokesman for the  Ukrainian State Oil and Gas Committee, told Interfax-Ukraine  that the size of the debt mentioned in the Gazprom message came  as a surprise.    Vasily Razgonyuk, chief engineer of the Ukrgazprom concern,  said that it was up to the government to comment on the  situation. In his words, the concern provided what amounted to  an interest-free credit to all Ukrainian industries by supplying  gas without demanding prepayment. "The industries have not paid  us for last year's supplies," he said and added that the  consumers owed Ukrgazprom over 10 trillion karbovantsi as of  February 1.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ahold ahead despite US decline Higher results in the Netherlands and Portugal helped Ahold, the Dutch-based food retailer, overcome lower earnings in the US to report a 9.3 per cent increase in third-quarter net profit. Net profit rose to Fl 72.9m (Dollars 38.4m) in the quarter from Fl 66.7m a year earlier, on sales up nearly 35 per cent at Fl 6.2bn. The strong sales increase was due mainly to new consolidations and the translation effects of the higher dollar. Ahold, whose annual sales are roughly evenly split between the US and Europe, said operating profit in the US slipped to Dollars 31.9m from Dollars 37.6m, reflecting both the one-off costs of changing the format of Edwards, one of its five US supermarket chains, as well as the fierce competition facing its Finast Ohio operations. In the Netherlands, where Ahold's Albert Heijn chain is the national leader, operating profit rose to Fl 69.7m from Fl 51.4m, an increase of 35.6 per cent. When corrected for the consolidation of Schuitema, a majority-owned wholesaler, and Jamin, a Dutch confectionery chain, the rise in the Netherlands is 16.5 per cent. In other European countries, operating results swung into a profit of Fl 15m from a loss of Fl 2.5m, due almost entirely to improvements in Portugal, where Ahold has expanded rapidly in recent years. Overall, operating profit in the quarter rose by 30.5 per cent to Fl 144.3m. Net profit increased at a lower rate because of higher financial expenses and taxes linked to the new consolidations and acquisitions. The third-quarter result takes net profit for the first nine months to Fl 245.3m, an 11.4 per cent increase.</p>

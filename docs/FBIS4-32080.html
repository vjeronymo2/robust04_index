			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Murder in Tetovo"] </F>   [Excerpts] Yesterday, Vase Trpcevski from Tetovo was  killed in a street fight after an argument between two groups of  Albanians and Macedonians [[The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM]. The Interior Ministry issued a public  announcement, explaining a street fight broke out at about 2100  [1900 GMT], near the Colourful Mosque in Tetovo, involving a  group of about 12 older underage Macedonians and about 15  Albanian citizens, which ended in murdering the 18 year-old Vase  Trpcevski, who was stabbed near his heart. The group of  Macedonians was coming back from a party and was attacked by a  bigger group of Albanians. Two of the attackers Suleiman  Skondori and Adnan Sodiu were arrested at the border crossing of  Deve Bair during an attempt to leave for Turkey. The police  also imprisoned Rusit Rusiti and Menduh Zendeli, possible  murderers.    Eight Macedonians were treated at the Tetovo medical centre.  Two of them are kept for hospital treatment and the others were  released. [passage omitted]    Tetovo citizens, especially the Macedonians, are unanimous  in  their condemn of the crime. They also reacted against the city  police preventing doctors to provide first aid for the injured  Macedonians on the spot. The situation in Tetovo is presently  calm, but tense.    On the occasion of young Vase Trpcevski's death, his family  received telegrams of deep condolences by President Gligorov,  parliament president Andov, and Prime Minister Crvenkovski.</p>

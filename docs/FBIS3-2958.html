Nearly 4 million people and more than 14 million heads of  livestock are suffering from the dry spell.    "The shortage of water was so serious that many locals in  arid areas in Northwest Gansu Province had to get water from far  away," the Beijing based State Anti-Drought Office (Sado) said  yesterday.    The drought, which began last fall, has hit the most  important winter wheat and cotton-producing areas.    More than 5.3 million hectares of winter crops in 12 north,  northwest and northeast provinces have been affected, while  another 8.7 million hectares are running out of moisture, the  latest statistics show.    Even though snow fell in some drought-ridden areas in mid-  February, the moisture level was far from enough to meet the  demands of winter wheat.    This summer's harvest is now being threatened.    The precipitation, ranging from 1-10 millimetres in most of  the drought-stricken areas, was too little to fully ease the  persistent drought, while more rainfall is badly needed for the  winter-crop growing, "drought officials told China Daily.    As a result, more than 35 per cent of winter wheat seedlings  in northwest Gansu Province are not growing well and many are  dying.    And the latest weather forecasts provide little hope of  escaping the drought soon. The dry spell is expected to  continue through the end of the month as rainfall will be less  than in previous years throughout northern regions and even in  some parts of the south.</p>

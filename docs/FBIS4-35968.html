			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanon has affirmed it will not withdraw from the  peace negotiations regardless of Israeli pressures. Foreign  Minister Faris Buwayz has told the newspaper AL-SAFIR that the  Madrid Conference formula is second to none, in the absence of  any alternative formula. But the problems do not rest with the  formula; rather they rest with Israel's dealing with this  formula, the foreign minister added.    Fariz Buwayz said: Despite its acceptance in theory or  principle of this formula since it was initiated in Madrid,  Israel has been ceaselessly trying to torpedo this formula. The  foreign minister maintained that since the start Israel has been  trying to isolate and separate out parties. It continues this  policy even now and is trying to torpedo the Madrid Conference  mechanism.    In his statement to AL-SAFIR, the foreign minister said that  a withdrawal from the negotiations would trigger various  repercussions. Therefore, it would not be in Lebanon's interest  to withdraw from the negotiations. This would make Lebanon  appear before the world public as a rejector of peace,  particularly since Israel can exploit this issue in the media,  Buwayz added.    The foreign minister said: We must continue the negotiations  because there is no other mechanism that is supported and  sponsored internationally. We also must not throw in our cards  before the end of the negotiations.    Minister Buwayz pointed out that he had informed the  Americans of Lebanon's commitment to continuing its resistance  as long as there are insufficient assurances of the liberation  of its land. Buwayz affirmed that the aggression against  Ba'labakk was a new Israeli attempt to strike at Lebanese-Syrian  cohesion.    The foreign minister criticized the Gaza-Jericho agreement,  adding that Lebanon's ties with the Palestinian issue are clear.  But as for Lebanon's relations with the Palestinian leadership,  I believe that this leadership must propose a final concept and  strategy so that we can finally define our relations with them.  But defining a relationship to a structure based on transient  principles is absolutely impossible, the foreign minister  concluded.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: US brokers reap record Dollars 5.1bn in underwriting fees WALL Street securities firms earned Dollars 5.1bn in underwriting fees during the first three quarters of the year as corporations rushed to take advantage of low US interest rates by issuing record amounts of new debt and equity. The explosion in underwriting business means that Wall Street has earned more in the first nine months of this year than the record Dollars 5bn it made in the entire 12 months of 1991. According to preliminary data released yesterday by Securities Data in New York, US securities houses underwrote a total of Dollars 658bn in domestic debt and equity from January to the end of September, Dollars 70bn more than in all of the previous year. A total of Dollars 236bn of straight corporate debt was sold to the market in the first three quarters, of which the most striking aspect was the extraordinary growth in junk bond issues. More than Dollars 30bn of high-yield debt was sold during the period, and at some time over the next few weeks the record set during the height of the junk bond boom, the Dollars 31.9bn issued in 1986, should be shattered. Companies continued to raise large amounts through stock issues. More than Dollars 56.5bn has been issued to date, the bulk of it via initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock. The IPO market, however, may have peaked. Of the 432 companies that have gone public this year, only 18 came to the market in September, the lowest total since March 1991. Moreover, almost half of the 90 IPOs launched in the past three months were eventually priced below their initial filing ranges, an indication that investor-demand is waning. Issues of mortgage-backed securities, the fastest growing segment of the debt market, reached Dollars 303bn by the end of September, easily beating the annual record of Dollars 251bn set last year. The issuance of asset-backed securities, however, slowed to Dollars 32.6bn.</p>

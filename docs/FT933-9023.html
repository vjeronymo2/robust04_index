			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television The quality of the National Geographic 'films' bought in for ITV's Voyager series has varied. The account of the trip to the Faroes in an open long boat, for instance, scarcely seemed worth showing since it merely proved that the voyage was feasible provided you had radio transmitters and the help of helicopters and modern lifeboats. In today's offering Imran Khan introduces 'the highest polo match in the world': polo as played in the Hindu Kush (7.30 ITV). For the last in an impressive series of Business Matters (8.00 BBC2) the cameras follow Carey Lewis on the road to Poland and the Baltic states as he pursues the business of truck brokerage. When Pandora's Box was first screened its programme about attempts to build a 'scientific' society in Soviet Russia it seemed to me pretty silly, and I said so on this page. However, the repeat last week of the episode about DDT and blind faith in science followed now by anti-science and blind faith in Mother Nature seemed outstandingly good. Today's target (9.30 BBC2) is government faith in the mumbo jumbo of economics.</p>

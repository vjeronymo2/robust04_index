			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Japan and US to resume motor talks: Way now opened for conclusion of framework negotiations on bilateral trade Japan and the US are expected to resume negotiations on trade in vehicles and motor parts early in the new year, after a two-month hiatus in bilateral discussions on one of the most contentious areas of trade. The breakthrough came after a meeting on Tuesday between Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international trade and industry until yesterday, and Mr Jeffrey Garten, US commerce undersecretary. A resumption of the vehicle talks paves the way for conclusion of the so-called framework negotiations on bilateral trade which began in the summer of 1993. Most of the main issues - from greater access to Japan's government procurement market for telecommunications and construction projects to opening up of the country's insurance market - have been agreed. The two sides are aiming by the year-end to conclude negotiations covering financial services, which are being held this week in Seattle. The talks on vehicles and motor parts trade, however, had been stalled after the US launched sanctions procedures under its trade legislation against Japan's motor parts after-market. The Japanese side has been unwilling to resume negotiations under threat of sanctions. Japan has also resisted US calls to discuss possible targets in the number of dealerships which sell foreign cars and to encourage Japanese vehicle makers to come up with 'voluntary' plans for foreign parts procurement. Nevertheless, both sides agree that early resumption of the talks is preferable since the US trade deficit with Japan in these goods comprises two-thirds of the overall US trade deficit with Japan. The Japanese government has agreed to come back to the negotiating table in the belief that the US has accepted that discussions will not be held under threat of sanctions, will not cover targets and will not extend beyond the reach of the government, a trade ministry official said.</p>

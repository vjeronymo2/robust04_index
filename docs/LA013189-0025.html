			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GROUP CALLS FOR LIMITS ON HILLSIDE TRACTS  </P> <P> A Sunland-Tujunga group said Monday it will ask residents to sign petitions  calling for Los Angeles to limit the amount of housing allowed on hillsides.  </P> <P> Sylvia Gross, a director of the Sunland-Tujunga Assn. of Residents, said the  group hopes to collect at least 4,000 signatures by March 1 from people who  want to preserve undeveloped hillsides in and around Sunland-Tujunga, Lake View  Terrace and Shadow Hills.  </P> <P> Increased density on the steep hillsides could result in flooding, rockslides  and mudslides, Gross said.  </P> <P> The organization hopes to get enough signatures to demonstrate that the largely  rural area's district plan, a guide for development, should be amended to  include controls on hillside residential development.  </P> <P> Los Angeles zoning laws allow two to nine homes per acre of hillside, Gross  said. The residents want the density limited to one home per hillside acre.  </P> <P> "This is the last open land in the whole city," Gross said. "We're trying to  stop here what's happened in Woodland Hills and Glendale. You look at the  hillsides there and you see nothing but bad. We can't let that happen here."  </P> <P> Gross added that the controls would stop pollution of water and air and prevent  extensive grading of the hillsides.  </P> <P> The group is sponsoring a kickoff meeting for the drive at 7 tonight at the  Sunland-Tujunga Municipal Building at 7747 Foothill Blvd. If the group obtains  at least 2,000 signatures, petitions would eventually be presented to Los  Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the area.  </P> <P> Arline De Sanctis, Wachs' chief deputy, said the councilman would welcome such  petitions. But she said Wachs already has initiated studies on how to limit  hillside development on slopes of 15% or more. Those studies, being done by the  community plans division of the city Planning Department, are almost completed,  De Sanctis said. She said they probably will be presented to the City Council  in a few months.  </P> <P> The petition drive was partially inspired by a planned 44-acre, 125-home  development in the hills of northeast Tujunga. Some of the single-family homes  are planned for grades of more than 50%, De Sanctis said.  </P> <P> Officials of Dale Poe Development, which is preparing an environmental impact  report on the proposed development, could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

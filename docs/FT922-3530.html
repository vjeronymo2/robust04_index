			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Bar urged to clarify complaint procedure THE BAR'S procedures for handling complaints against barristers were criticised yesterday by the Legal Services Ombudsman for lack of transparency. In his first annual report, Mr Michael Barnes said the Bar's procedures were primarily disciplinary and often left complainants feeling they had become minor players in the profession's internal disciplinary proceedings rather than protagonists of their own complaints. The Bar's professional conduct committee, which dealt with most complaints against barristers, offered no possibility of compensation. A recurrent cause of complaint was the Bar's failure to notify the complainant of the barrister's response to the complaint, or why a complaint had been dismissed or, in those cases where action had been taken against the barrister, what the outcome was. That had prompted him to recommend last October that the Bar should inform complainants of the response of the barrister. The Bar has indicated that it accepts the recommendation in principle. Mr Barnes said that following a number of complaints from beneficiaries of wills about solicitors' charges for administration of estates, he had called on the Law Society to give beneficiaries the power to challenge solicitors' costs. In one case, a firm of solicitors took nearly 10 years to administer an estate worth almost Pounds 1m. After solicitors' fees of Pounds 192,494, auditors' fees of Pounds 180,345 and a Pounds 105,000 penalty for late payment of capital transfer tax, just Pounds 450,000 was left.

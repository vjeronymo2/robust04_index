			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Thames TV and BBC to launch satellite channel THAMES TELEVISION has linked with BBC Enterprises in a move to launch a satellite television channel as early as September. The channel, which will be broadcast by the Astra satellite system, will be devoted to general entertainment based on thousands of hours of programmes in the Thames and BBC libraries. 'This could be the first of many investments in other niche channels that might appear on Astra,' Mr James Arnold-Baker, chief executive of BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the BBC, said yesterday. It is the first new project to be announced by Thames since October when it lost its franchise. The company will cease to be a broadcaster at the end of this year. Thames and the BBC will each hold no more than 20 per cent of the new joint venture, and other minority investors are being sought. Mr Richard Dunn, Thames chief executive, said yesterday that the new venture did not preclude a minority investment in a bid for Channel 5, the new television network which will be able to reach three quarters of homes in the UK. The decision on Channel 5, which will be taken within the next few weeks after the Independent Television Commission publishes the terms of the licence. The new Thames strategy is to be an independent programme producer and supplier. BBC involvement in the new channel, which will be available to more than 3m cable and satellite homes in the UK, is part of the corporation's strategy to become involved in satellite television while exploiting 25,000 to 30,000 hours of programmes in its library. The new channel will need a total investment of Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m. 'We are confident that the time is right for the introduction of this high-quality, popular programming service for satellite and cable viewers, and we are delighted to create it in partnership with the BBC,' Mr Dunn said yesterday. He believes satellite television will follow the pattern of cable with bands of different charges. In addition to the premium fee for such programmes as recent films and exclusive sports events there will also be a basic tier of channels with a more modest charge for the entire package.</p>

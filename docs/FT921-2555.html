			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Trade News: From German curbs to ECGD coyness - FT writers look at each country GERMANY: The exposure of the country's Hermes export credit insurance agency on contracts with the former Soviet Union amounts to around DM30bn (Pounds 10.4bn). The government has imposed a ceiling of DM5bn on any further credit guarantees in the current year. This will be reviewed at the end of March. Apart from the DM30bn in Hermes exposure, a further DM11bn is outstanding in untied, government guaranteed credits to the former Soviet republics. In addition, some DM23bn of export contracts have 'agreement in principle' for Hermes insurance, if they are realised. A further DM70bn worth of applications for insurance is in the pipeline. The immediate cost to the German exchequer of the Soviet payments' crisis is only DM1bn in the current year - the cost of the debt deferral scheme negotiated by the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised states. That burden is likely to increase quite rapidly if the payments crisis continues. UNITED STATES: The Department of Agriculture has been rather more forthcoming than the Exim bank, where exposure to the risk of non-payment for contracts with the CIS is thought to be less than Dollars 100m. The department, committed to aiding US farm exporters, has since 1990 provided credit guarantees amounting to Dollars 3.1bn through the Commodity Credit Corporation. It insists that no more will be forthcoming until after repayments start coming in. Another Dollars 650m may soon be allocated. ITALY: The government, in line with the Paris Club, now regards its exposure to the CIS as split between that to Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union. This is because Mr Yeltsin has given guarantees assuming Russian obligations, while the situation in the other republics, both legally and financially, is much more obscure. Total exposure on this basis at the beginning of January is as follows: L1,115bn (Pounds 516m) is at risk in Russia; L4,850bn in medium-term and L713bn in short-term credits is at risk in the rest of the former Soviet Union. Payments will technically be in arrears by the end of March. Essentially, all the above is covered by Sace, the export credit guarantee body. Arrears at the beginning of January totalled Dollars 500m, none of which was covered by export credit guarantees. In addition, the Italian government has agreed L5,000bn of credit lines to cover trade between 1990-94. This would be backed by Sace, but none has been drawn down. Separate from these credit lines is a L2,200bn facility agreed directly by the Italian Treasury in 1990. Of this, L1,200bn is to cover balance of payments needs and L1,000bn for arrears. The bulk is going to Russia. FRANCE: The country's banks were among the fastest growing lenders to the Soviet Union from the middle-to-late 1980s but have scaled back new loans in the recent years. Their exposure fell from FFr54bn (Pounds 5.5bn) at the end of 1989 to FFr23bn by the middle of 1991, with FFr7.6bn of this guaranteed by Coface, France's main export credit agency. The guaranteed portion is political risk, backed by the state. Of the total, FFr20.8bn is long-term, for seven years or more. The biggest lenders are BNP, Credit Lyonnais, and Societe Generale. French banks are pressing the French treasury to declare the former Soviet Union a 'risk country' - or countries  - so that they can make tax deductions for their provisions on loans there. France agreed a FFr2bn credit line last November for the purchase of French grain. In 1990, it agreed a FFr2.5bn line, again for food purchases. There was also a FFr5bn official credit line in October 1990 for food, equipment and loan refinancing. BRITAIN: The Export Credits Guarantee Department remains coy about the level of its exposure to the former Soviet Union. Contracts at risk are thought to amount to just under Pounds 1bn. Prime Minister John Major agreed in January a new Pounds 280m credit line, but this will be blocked until the CIS agrees a programme with the IMF, and sovereign guarantors have been identified.</p>

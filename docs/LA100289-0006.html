			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Two hundred anti-nuclear protesters were arrested at a remote U.S.-Australian  military base, bringing the total detained in three days of demonstrations to  nearly 500. The intelligence-gathering facility at Nurrungar, 360 miles  northwest of Adelaide, the capital of South Australia state, is considered by  demonstrators to be a likely target in a superpower nuclear exchange. The  federal government called in 50 soldiers over the weekend after nine protesters  entered the complex and one climbed inside a radar dome. It was the first time  Australian troops had been called on to face a civil disturbance. Those  arrested have been charged with trespass and damage to property.  </P></p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / FT Guide to the Week 4 TUESDAY Funding for the tunnel The deadline for Eurotunnel, which is to operate the channel tunnel, to complete negotiations with its bankers for additional funding to cover start-up costs. The company has raised about Pounds 8.95bn, but has said it needs at least another Pounds 1bn, mainly to cover debt servicing before the tunnel begins to break even on a cash basis. This is expected to happen in 1998. Italian politics: Informal soundings are due to begin between Italy's political parties and the government of Carlo Ciampi to prepare for a planned vote of no-confidence in the government on January 12. The European Commission meets ahead of its consultations in Athens on Wednesday with the Greek government, which has assumed the presidency of the European Union. UK economy: The Bank of England's provisional estimate of the growth of the monetary base (M0) last month is likely to back up anecdotal evidence of strong retail sales before and after Christmas. Bank notes in circulation rose by 7.1 per cent in the week to December 29, compared with the same week in 1992. 5 WEDNESDAY Greek agenda for the EU The European Commission meets the Greek government in Athens to devise a working programme for the Greek presidency of the European Union. Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou and European Commission president Jacques Delors will try to present an image of workmanlike solidity. However, Athens is at odds with some member states over EU policy towards the former Yugoslav republics. Bank of France: The names of six members of the nine-strong Monetary Policy Council, which will be responsible for interest rate policy at the newly independent Bank of France, are due to be announced today. The other three members will be Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, and his two deputies. UK education: Sir Ron Dearing is expected to publish the final recommendations of his review of the national curriculum in England and Wales today. The report will influence industrial relations in schools and should also establish an educational blueprint for the next two decades. Noise: New regulations on noise nuisance come into effect in the UK. Local authorities will be able to take action to stop noise, including entering a car to silence a wayward alarm. 6 THURSDAY Bundesbank council meets The policy-making council of the German central bank holds its first session of 1994. With interest rates on German government bonds finishing 1993 near their lowest levels since the second world war, there are strong expectations of a cut in the coming weeks in the 'official' Lombard and discount rates from the current levels of 6.75 and 5.75 per cent respectively. The Bundesbank may act today. George Soros, the international financier, concludes a three day visit to Israel during which he is expected to announce a series of investments in the country. UK new vehicle registrations: The figures for November are due to be released by the Department of Transport. They are expected to confirm that the British market remains a healthy exception in a depressed Europe. Anchors away: The 40th London International Boat Show opens at Earls Court exhibition centre (to Jan 16). Holidays: Markets are closed for the Epiphany holiday in Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany (Munich and Stuttgart only), Greece, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Russia celebrates Orthodox Christmas (to Friday). 7 FRIDAY Franco-Saudi co-operation French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur (left) arrives for a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia. The talks are expected to cover political, economic and military co-operation. Mr Balladur will be hoping to promote the sale of French arms and military equipment. In particular, he will try to finalise a contract for the supply of frigates, worth an estimated FFr20bn (Dollars 3.4bn). US employment figures for December will be keenly watched to see if they provide further evidence of robust fourth-quarter economic growth. A recent poll of economists points to expectations of a 225,000 increase in non-farm payrolls last month. Paramount bid: The deadline for rival bidders Viacom and QVC Network to increase their offers for the US film and publishing group. Holidays: Christmas for Coptic Christians of Egypt and Ethiopia. 8 SARURDAY Clinton goes to Europe US President Bill Clinton sets off for his first European trip since taking office. It takes him to Brussels for the Nato summit (Jan 10-11). He then travels to Prague to meet Polish, Czech and Hungarian leaders. Next stop is Russia for talks with President Yeltsin, but not with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist. Clinton also visits Minsk, in recognition of the Belarus decision to dismantle its nuclear weapons. Finally, he goes to Geneva, for a session with President Assad of Syria. They are expected to discuss the Middle East peace process. Japanese-Chinese relations: Japan's foreign minister Tsutomu Hata (left) begins a two-day visit to China. He will discuss with his opposite number, Qian Qichen, economic assistance, human rights issues, and North Korea's nuclear programme. 9 SUNDAY Central bankers converge Central bankers from the big industrialised countries travel to Basle for their first regular monthly meeting of the year at the Bank for International Settlements early next week. Cinema buffs will be flocking to the Belgian capital for the start of The Brussels International Film Festival. Sumo fortnight: The 15-day New Year Grand Sumo Tournament begins in Tokyo. NEXT WEEK A two-day summit of Nato leaders begins in Brussels on Monday January 10. The organisation has been seeking a role since the end of the cold war. The trend of events in the former Soviet Union may give it a new sense of purpose. The council of the European Monetary Institute holds a formal inaugural meeting in Frankfurt on January 11. As the institute still lacks premises in the city, the council will assemble in the town hall. Compiled by Patrick Stiles. Fax: (+44) (0)71 873 3194.</p>

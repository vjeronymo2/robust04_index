			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOUISVILLE PREVAILS IN VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Don't think the Notre Dame High girls' volleyball team is mourning after losing  to San Fernando Valley League rival Louisville, the second-ranked Southern  Section 4-A team, 10-15, 15-9, 11-15, 15-11, 15-9, Thursday at Louisville.  </P> <P> Not even after the unranked Knights took a 2-1 lead in games and held a 10-7  advantage in the fourth game before blowing the lead and the match. Not even  after they had raised their hopes by defeating third-ranked Chaminade two days  earlier.  </P> <P> Notre Dame was done in by 26 kills from Louisville's Torie Sumner and 25 each  from Marybeth Giordano and Mary Hudson, but the Knights were mostly smiles  after what would seem a gloomy time.  </P> <P> Notre Dame (4-4, 1-1) played point for point against Louisville (7-1, 2-0) with  strong net play by Mary Strong (15 kills), Stephanie Burns and Shannon Tuttle.  </P> <P> The Royals erased an 11-10 deficit in the fourth game with five consecutive  points, three on kills.  </P> <P> In the fifth game, Louisville jumped to an 8-2 lead but Notre Dame fought back  and trailed, 12-8. From there, however, Sumner, Hudson and Giordano had  consecutive kills to end the match.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: GETTING THEIR TRAFFIC SIGNALS CROSSED  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> I cannot understand why traffic lights in Orange County and southern Los  Angeles County are not better synchronized. There are places where traffic  lights are only a few hundred feet apart, and still no one in the  transportation departments seem capable of getting these signals set to keep  traffic flowing.  </P> <P> This is especially true of freeway underpasses, where the conditions are  deplorable. Whoever installed the electric "loops" that detect cars on the  roadway has done a great disservice to the motorist. They do nothing but impede  the flow of traffic, rather than keep it moving. The left-turn arrow and  pedestrian buttons also slow things down. Why don't they just harmonize the  signals and forget these useless gimmicks?  </P> <P> Alvin J. Butcher  </P> <P> Tustin  </P> <P> Yes, figuring out traffic signals seems akin to predicting weather patterns.  One day your favorite thoroughfare issues an endless stream of green lights.  The next, it'll be nothing but red.  </P> <P> But there is a method to this occasional motoring madness.  </P> <P> As you note, most Orange County signal lights are connected to wire loops in  the pavement that electronically detect when cars are waiting at a stop light.  This setup is known as a "traffic actuated" signal-light system, said Steven M.  Hogan, transportation division manager for the county Environmental Management  Agency.  </P> <P> Traffic-actuated signals operate much like the old "fixed-time" systems, which  have a clock that switches lights every 30 or 45 seconds. Fixed-time systems  were fine, except in situations when one had to stop at a red light and wait  seemingly forever even though no cars were on a cross street.  </P> <P> The difference between the two systems lies primarily with the wire loop  detectors, which feed extra information about an intersection and trigger  lights only when traffic dictates. With the additional data, the  traffic-actuated setup is supposed to work all the better -- or so it goes in  theory.  </P> <P> In the real world, it is hard to ensure that signal lights stay in a harmonized  pattern, Hogan said.  </P> <P> Mechanical glitches can wreak havoc (motorists should call local traffic  authorities if they run across a signal they are sure is malfunctioning, Hogan  said). Pedestrians triggering the crossing lights can also cause a signal to  stray from the synchronized pattern for up to five minutes.  </P> <P> Moreover, the synchronization of signal lights begins to deteriorate as  congestion increases. Even under the most free-flowing conditions, many  motorists don't travel at the speed limit, going either too slow or too fast  and thus missing a green light or hitting the red.  </P> <P> In addition, Orange County's varied topography, particularly in the southern  half of the county, has resulted in winding streets on which signals are very  difficult to coordinate, Hogan said.  </P> <P> On top of all that, there are troubles where streets and freeways meet. Traffic  signals on streets next to a freeway are controlled by the state Transportation  Department, which carries the prime responsibility of ensuring that traffic is  able to safely move onto and off of the highway. Unfortunately, those lights  often don't mesh with signals on thoroughfares sweeping toward the freeways.  </P> <P> But some hope is in sight on the freeway front. Hogan said transportation  officials with the county, various cities and Caltrans have started to work  together to better coordinate these often discordant systems.  </P> <P> Left-turn signal lights are another matter. Ideally, these lights are timed to  interact with traffic so oncoming cars do not sit at a red light, Hogan said.  But that is not always the case, especially when signal lights are knocked out  of sequence by pedestrians crossing or mechanical malfunctions.  </P> <P> Some cities, most notably Los Angeles, have installed "permissive-protective  signals" in the left-turn lanes, Hogan said. These signals feature two  different green lights. A green arrow goes on when left-turing cars begin to  back up in the turn pocket. When traffic is lighter, a round green light  permits cars to turn left when the intersection clears of oncoming cars. This  lengthens the time a signal stays green on each street.  </P> <P> Hogan said Orange County officials have steered away from permissive-protective  signals because of safety worries. Accident investigators report that some  drivers become confused by the signals, turning across traffic when they should  be yielding, he said.  </P> <P> Although signal lights will always cause grumbles, there should be some  improvements in Orange County in the years to come. This year, the county will  launch its "Super Streets" program with work on Beach Boulevard. Hogan said  signals along the street will be fine-tuned to offer better synchronization,  giving motorists headed both north and south an improved chance of catching a  green light instead of running into red after red.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> Your Jan. 29 reply to an anti-helmet advocate makes a good case for the value  of wearing a motorcycle helmet, and I agree with everything you said. I'd just  like to add a few points.  </P> <P> Even more sobering than the fact that 70% of California's motorcycle fatalities  last year involved un-helmeted riders is the fact that fully 92% of all  motorcycle accidents involve riders who are either inexperienced or untrained.  </P> <P> What should also be factored in is the element of irresponsibility that a high  percentage of younger riders exhibit, like going too fast for the conditions,  being under the influence of alcohol, violating a right of way or simply not  understanding how to control the machine.  </P> <P> The bottom line is that these accidents will happen regardless of whether the  rider is wearing a helmet. And while helmets can protect against fatalities  that result from head trauma, they won't make the motorcyclist a better rider.  Training, and training alone, is the most effective way to prevent the  accidents that take lives.  </P> <P> Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I have over 20 years' professional  experience with motorcycles -- as a road racer, race trainer, author of two  books on racing technique and founder of the California Superbike School.  </P> <P> Not until this state requires mandatory training for all riders under age 27  will we in California see a significant decline in fatalities.  </P> <P> Keith Code  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P> <P> Some very valid points. A little tutoring can go a long way to make a person a  better driver, whether that's in a car or on a motorcycle.  </P> <P> Under current California law, persons under 18 have to take a course from the  California Motorcyclist Safety Program, which has centers scattered around the  state. For information, call (800) CC-RIDER.  </P> <P> But turning 18 doesn't necessarily infuse a person with instant maturity. As  you suggest, the state might want to take a look at extending its instructional  requirements to include neophyte motorcyclists with even more birthdays under  their belts. Then they can head out on the highway in safety.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS ACTS TO PROTECT EQUESTRIAN CENTER  </P> <P> In an effort to preserve one of the last equestrian centers remaining in the  Thousand Oaks area, the City Council on Tuesday told a developer to find a new  way to widen the access road to his project.  </P> <P> David H. Murdock, developer of the 1,900-acre Sherwood Country Club luxury  housing community, needs to rebuild and widen Potrero Road, an access route to  the project.  </P> <P> He had asked the city to let him put a drainage ditch through a corner of the  Foxfield Riding School.  </P> <P> But more than 200 people, lamenting the gradual disappearance of places to ride  around Thousand Oaks, appeared in support of the equestrian center.  </P> <P> "Every place that was a riding academy is now a shopping center," said Mike  Higgins, a 25-year Newbury Park resident, before the meeting. "Everything is  getting squeezed out and stuccoed over."  </P> <P> Dennis Cohen told the council that the equestrian center "is not a club for the  few idle rich. This is a place for people. Keep it for them. Let them have it."  </P> <P> In exchange for county approval of the Sherwood development -- where homes  reportedly will cost from $1 million to $2 million -- Murdock agreed a few  years ago to widen Potrero from two to four lanes, said John Clement, public  works director in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> But to do the widening, engineers must deal with two drainage channels that run  beneath the road, he said.  </P> <P> Murdock planned to build a bridge over one of the channels and wanted to divert  the other channel through Foxfield property, Clement said.  </P> <P> If the plan had been approved, the city would have had to acquire the property  through eminent domain, Clement said, with the developer footing the bill.  </P> <P> Foxfield manager Bill Postel wanted Murdock to build a bridge over both  channels -- a more expensive proposition but one that would not disrupt as much  Foxfield land, he said.  </P> <P> After the council's unanimous vote in support of the center, the president of  Murdock Residential Development, Donald Trotter, said the company would work  toward an agreement with Postel.  </P> <P> The Murdock plan would have cut off the corner of one of two 2,000-square-foot  lighted arenas, disrupted a half-mile exercise track and encroached on other  training areas, Postel said.  </P> <P> The 35-acre riding school has little room for expansion, Postel said.  </P> <P> The rural area sits in a canyon bordered by land owned by the Conejo Open Space  Conservation Agency.  </P> <P> The center, which is open every day but Christmas from 8 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., is  used by about 1,000 people a week, said Jo Ann Postel, who started the school  with her husband in 1966.  </P> <P> About 90 horses are boarded there.  </P> <P> The Postels keep another 90 horses for English-style riding lessons and  instruction in hunter and jumper riding, Bill Postel said.  </P> <P> The school, which offers a summer camp for 210 children between 12 and 15, is  well-known nationwide, the couple said.  </P> <P> Olympic competitors Hilda Gurney and Mark Watring took lessons as children at  Foxfield.  </P> <P> Watring now works as a trainer there, Jo Ann Postel said.  </P> <P> The West Coast screening trials for the Olympic equestrian jumping team were  held at Foxfield for five years. And the 16-member Foxfield Equestrian Drill  Team, which rides without bridles or saddles, has performed twice at Madison  Square Garden, she said.  </P> <P> The wooded area also was the setting of the movie "The Adventures of Robin  Hood," with Errol Flynn, and several John Wayne Westerns, Jo Ann Postel said.  </P></p>

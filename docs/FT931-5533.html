			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: UK manufacturing would look better if compared with rivals (2) Sir, Roger Lyons gives us a timely reminder that there are people who work in manufacturing, as well those who own and manage it. It is especially timely given Tuesday's revealing article on the bankruptcy law ('The beauty of a vote', March 2). Three clever economists presented an ingenious scheme for sorting out conflicts of interest among creditors, faced with the choice between liquidation and reconstruction. Their unquestioned assumption was that the matter was solely for those who had money at stake to decide: never, ever, the people who had livelihoods at stake, except to the extent that they happened to be owed a bit of back pay. Such an assumption would never be made in our more successful competitors. In Germany, a public company is seen as a public institution, in the way a hospital is. In Japan it is seen as a community of all who work in it, not just a bit of property owned by shareholders. Even in America, the only other country our three economists seem to have heard of, elaborate Esop provisions exist to favour the taking-over of ailing companies by their employees. Can we really make it in 21st-century world markets if we stick to our peculiarly British obsession with the rights of property? Are we supposed to rely on the Hoovers of this world to come and take advantage of our un-socially chartered, uninvolved - but cheap - labour? Ronald Dore, Kensington, London SW3</p>

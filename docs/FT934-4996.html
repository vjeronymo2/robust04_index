			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Net expenditure rises to Pounds 30.7bn for 1994-95 - National Health Service The government's net expenditure on the National Health Service will rise from an original plan of Pounds 29bn for 1993-94 to Pounds 30.7bn in 1994-95, the government said in a statement. In addition, the health service will have the benefit of new efficiency gains worth at least Pounds 450m. Total spending, including receipts from patient charges and land sales (gross spending) is expected to increase to nearly Pounds 32.0bn in 1994-95. The details of the increase in expenditure on individual programmes are as follows: Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS): in 1994-95 the government will provide Pounds 21.2bn compared with Pounds 20.1bn in 1993-94, a cash increase of 5.4 per cent, or 1.4 per cent after allowing for general inflation. The HCHS are also expected to increase efficiency by at least 2 1/4 per cent, releasing at least Pounds 450m to be ploughed back into patient care. Gross expenditure (including receipts from patient charges and income generation) is estimated to be Pounds 21.5bn in 1994-95 compared with a forecast of Pounds 20.5bn in 1993-94. HCHS Capital Total: capital expenditure, including that financed by receipts from land sales, will be over Pounds 2bn next year. Health authorities' and MHS trusts' capital programmes include more than 150 building schemes, each costing more than Pounds 1m. Government spending on capital will have increased by 47 per cent in real terms between 1988-89 and 1994-95. Family Health Services (FHS): government spending on the non-cash-limited FHS will be more than Pounds 6.6bn in 1994-95, an increase of Pounds 561m compared with original plans for 1993-94. This is a cash increase of 9.2 per cent, or 5.0 per cent in real terms. Total spending in 1994-95, including that financed from expected income from prescription and dental charges, will be nearly Pounds 7.4bn. Centrally Financed Services (CFS): expenditure on the CFS is expected to be Pounds 751m in 1994-95. These services include the special hospitals (Ashworth, Broadmoor and Rampton Hospitals); the Public Health Laboratory Service; the Prescription Pricing Authority and Dental Practice Board; information services; the Health Education Authority; grants to voluntary bodies; secure accommodation; research, and social services training. Departmental Administration Costs: total expenditure on departmental administration is expected to be Pounds 291m in 1994-95, a saving of 6.7 per cent in real terms over this year's original plans. Personal Social Services: on October 29, ministers announced an additional Pounds 20m in 1994-95, Pounds 30m in 1995-96, and Pounds 448m in 1996-97 for local authorities' new responsibilities for care in the community. The additional funds in the first two years were made available in order to help local social services authorities arrange for more home and respite care. This increase is quite separate from the NHS figures announced in this statement. The Standard Spending figure for Personal Social Services (PSS) revenue and all other local authority services will be announced later by the environment secretary. Other decisions on PSS grants and capital will be announced shortly.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Plea to Lang on Western Isles MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, has been recommended to surcharge two former officials of Western Isles council who have been held responsible for the council losing Pounds 24m in the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International a year ago. The Commission for Local Authority Accounts, the equivalent in Scotland of the Audit Commission in England and Wales, has told the Scottish secretary that the two officials should be required to pay Western Isles council 'an amount considered to be appropriate recognising that any sum to be paid can represent only a nominal proportion of the loss'. The two officials are Mr Donald MacLeod, who was director of finance for the council, and his deputy Mr Brian Lawrie. Mr MacLeod has been dismissed by the council while Mr Lawrie left the council shortly before the BCCI crash and is now director of finance at North East Fife district council. The commission says that the council lost Pounds 23m of principal and Pounds 1m of accrued interest when the Bank of England closed BCCI. Western Isles was easily the biggest loser among British local authorities from the BCCI closure. The commission says that the council borrowed Pounds 5m from Scottish Widows, the life assurance company, in 1985 to lend on to BCCI, in contravention of the law. The council also borrowed Pounds 11.5m in advance of need and on-lent it to the bank, again illegally. Further borrowings of Pounds 2m from Scottish Widows and of Pounds 4m from Edinburgh district council were on-lent to BCCI 'without regard to any requirements concerning the limitation to be placed on sums lent to a single institution, or the need to ensure that the institution met any predetermined ranking criteria'. The commission blames Mr MacLeod for failing to provide proper guidance to the finance department and for not setting up a proper monitoring system. Mr Lawrie is blamed for failing to give the finance department proper guidance in the absence of Mr MacLeod. The commission criticises Mr George MacLeod, the council's chief executive, and the councillors themselves, for failing to ensure that the council complied with a 1988 report by the Controller of Audit on an earlier case of borrowing and on-lending. Mr George MacLeod was reinstated in February after being dismissed in December but is seeking early retirement. The commission asks the Scottish secretary to take into account the financial circumstances of the officials involved, particularly that of Mr Donald MacLeod who is out of work. The surcharging of councillors and officials is relatively rare in Scotland. In a recent case the commission recommended that Stirling district councillors pay back Pounds 31,000 that they had borrowed in excess of their borrowing limit, but this was reduced by the Scottish secretary to one-tenth of that amount.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> d. Inmates without funds. Several commenters stated that the proposed rule was unfair to indigent inmates, that these telephone regulations discriminate against inmates who do not have much money, and that they preferred the use of collect calls. However, neither the amended regulations, nor the ITS, prevent inmates' friends and family members who would accept collect calls from sending money to defray the expense of the direct-dial calls. Thus, under both the former collect call system and the new ITS debit billing system, an inmate claiming indigency is dependent upon someone else to pay for the inmate's telephone calls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau believes that even inmates with limited financial resources need to develop budgeting skills and to accept personal responsibility for their actions. It is therefore appropriate to require these inmates to pay for some of their telephone calls. However, to ensure that such inmates are able to make telephone calls, the Bureau has amended the proposed rule to permit inmates without funds to make collect calls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The phrase ``inmate without funds'' is defined as an inmate who has not had a trust fund account balance of $6.00 for the past 30 days. See 28 CFR &sect;540.105(b). The $6.00 ceiling was selected because it is above the maintenance pay level. Maintenance pay, which is currently $5.25 per month, is the lowest pay grade for inmates at Bureau institutions. By defining ``inmates without funds'' as an inmate who has not had a trust fund account balance for the past 30 days of $6.00, the regulations ensure that inmates who are in the lowest pay grade and who lack outside sources of income will be able to make some collect telephone calls. The Bureau believes this standard is fairer and easier to apply uniformly than an unspecified ``indigency'' standard, which would be subject to discretionary interpretation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Bureau has modified its telephone regulations to more clearly address the issue of telephone access for inmates without funds. As stated in the proposed rule, the Warden may direct the government to bear the expenses of inmate telephone use under compelling circumstances. In addition, the Bureau has added a new section to the final rule to allow inmates without funds to make some collect telephone calls. See 28 CFR &sect;540.105(b). As revised, the final rule provides a collect call every month and allows the Warden discretion to provide greater access based upon local conditions, e.g., size of population, staff resources, usage demand. Implementing instructions to this provision recommend that an inmate without funds be provided approximately 30 minutes of collect calling capability each month. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is noteworthy that a commenter, in discussing international calls, indicates that where she was unable to place collect calls because such calls were not processed by the telephone companies, the Bureau placed, and paid for, the call. This acknowledgement clearly demonstrates the Bureau's commitment to provide telephone access for needy inmates. In those instances, the compelling circumstance was created by the difficulties in placing such calls (e.g., some non-citizen inmate commenters reported their countries would not accept collect calls). In implementing the ITS, which provides for direct-dialed international calls, the Bureau is thus in a better position to commit its financial resources to those instances where the inmate is truly lacking in funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One inmate noted that the Bureau refused to pay for a telephone call to a foreign country that did not accept collect calls. As noted above, the Bureau is committed to making reasonable accommodations by assuming payment for a limited number of telephone calls in cases of compelling circumstances, such as when the inmate has lost contact with his family. That was not the case in the commenter's situation, as this commenter did acknowledge the existence of telephone contact with family members in this country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In closing the Bureau's response to comments relating to costs, we note the Bureau has also decided to further amend 28 CFR &sect;540.100 to provide for an inmate who has not been restricted from telephone use as the result of an institution disciplinary action to make at least one telephone call each month. The existing rule provides for at least one call every three months. The Bureau believes this change helps to further ensure an inmate has an opportunity for telephone communications consistent with correctional management objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Privacy Act Concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments expressed concern that in operating the ITS the Bureau's collection, maintenance, and use of information about potential recipients of inmate telephone calls violates the recipients' statutory rights to privacy under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a. Some commenters objected to what they perceive as the Bureau's alleged use of information on inmate visiting lists to create or compile telephone lists. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

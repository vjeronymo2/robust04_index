The envoy is Cameroon's culture  minister, who brought a personal message from President Biya to  President Henri Konan Bedie. Noufe Nabi brings you this report:    [Nabi] Foreign affairs Minister Essy Amara and the  Cameroonian ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire were present at the  audience, which lasted about 30 minutes. Talks during the  audience centered mainly on the Bakassi Peninsula border  conflict between Cameroon and Nigeria. Professor Joseph-Marie  Bipoun Woum, President Biya's envoy, reaffirmed Cameroon's claim  to ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula, and hoped that the  current problem would be resolved peacefully.    [Begin Woum recording] Yes, Cameroon is confident of its  rightful claim to this peninsula, and is engaged in the search  for a solution to this problem by peaceful means. We advocate a  peaceful solution to the conflict through regional and  international intermediaries, as our claim over this peninsula  is backed by a series of documents and legal instruments which  date as far back as 1885 [words indistinct]. In all we have a  total of 23 legal documents, including [word indistinct],  protocols, agreements, declarations, and other documents  established by our joint border commissions. So, these legal  instruments cannot be disputed today and we are ready to defend  them wherever necessary to back our legal claims. Naturally, in  view of the broad outlook and global experience of President  Henri Bedie, as well as the friendly and fraternal relations  that have always existed between our two countries since their  respective independence, Cameroon hopes that Cote d'Ivoire will  contribute to efforts to find a peaceful solution to this  conflict.

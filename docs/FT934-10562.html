			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The wool market has continued to show strength. Offerings at auction have been fully cleared, prices have tended to move gradually higher in Australia, and in other wool producing markets more sporadic sales have seen sharper increases. The industry is now firmly convinced that the lowest point of this wool market has been passed. Sales from the Australian wool stockpile, at premium prices, have also increased. Buyers further down the line in the industry have been more active. The AWC market indicator touched 500 cents on November 2, from an April low point of 381c/kg.</p>

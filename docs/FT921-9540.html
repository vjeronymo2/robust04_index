			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Imro authorised BIM despite shortcomings FINANCIAL services regulators were uneasy about authorising Mr Robert Maxwell's fund management companies, but did so nonetheless and made no special efforts at oversight afterwards, a Parliamentary select committee was told yesterday. Mr John Morgan, chief executive of the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), told the Select Committee on Social Security that there had been unease about authorising Bishopsgate Investment Management in February 1988. 'But there were no sustainable grounds for denying membership in Imro.' Although Imro - the industry's self regulatory body - was aware of a 1971 Department of Trade and Industry report which said Mr Maxwell was not fit to run a public company, the report was 17 or 18 years old and no action was taken,' he said - and the fact that bankers and investors had backed Mr Maxwell since then aided his credibility. It was only after Mr Maxwell's death last November that Imro became concerned about the fund management companies. Terms of the Financial Services Act of 1987 required firms such as BIM and another Maxwell company, London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management, to be authorised by Imro to conduct investment business. BIM, a company ultimately controlled by Maxwell-run charitable trusts in Liechtenstein, had the Maxwell company pension funds as its sole clients. And despite the apparent disappearance of about Pounds 300m of Maxwell pension fund assets managed by BIM, Mr Morgan said he still believes current regulatory arrangements are satisfactory. Mr George Nissan, Imro chairman, added 'the only way to prevent this is to have a regulator in the office of all of our members all the time'. Shortcomings had been found at BIM in assessment visits, but these were not considered serious, said Mr Robin Clark, director of Imro's member assessment unit. These shortcomings included the failure to keep dealing slips showing records of transactions and the failure to require staff to disclose all personal share dealings. Mr Clark said Imro had received written assurances from BIM that procedures had been corrected and saw no need for verification. Similarly, after accountants qualified the reports for LBII, Mr Morgan said Imro relied on assurances from accountants that shortcomings had been corrected. Mr Clark also said that Imro was well aware that BIM invested assets connected with Robert Maxwell but felt satisfied that these were disclosed to pension fund trustees. Failure to disclose such self-dealing could be grounds for disciplinary action.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (1): Open, competitive, lively - and Swiss / A look at how the country's financial centre is adapting to greater foreign competition and a future outside the European Union The Swiss financial community is having a difficult but productive year. Profits are hard to come by, especially when compared with 1993, but a surprising amount of progress is being made towards consolidating and improving the financial centre's openness and competitiveness. Two years after the Swiss people rejected in a referendum the path towards integration with the European Union, there is no moaning in the financial community about any negative effects of isolation. On the contrary, the talk is all of a continuing strong inflow of investment funds from neighbouring EU countries and of how the new national electronic stock exchange will bring back share trading volume from London's Seaq International. Meanwhile, the unprecedented proxy battle last month between Mr Martin Ebner, the maverick Zurich broker-fund manager, and the board of Union Bank of Switzerland has raised expectations that Swiss shareholders will take more interest in the governance of their companies than they have in the past. It all points to a more lively future for Finanzplatz Schweiz than many bankers would have hoped for a few years ago. If only business would improve, Swiss bankers might even admit to being moderately content. After the boom last year in virtually every banking sector, it was to be expected that things would be tougher this year. The end of the declining trend in interest rates and a 16 per cent slide in stock market prices since the peak at the end of January have been particularly painful for the many banks that specialise in fund management. Sharp falls in income from own trading have become the norm. The accelerating pace of consolidation among smaller regional banks has intensified the struggle for market share in domestic commercial business, at the expense of margins. All three big universal banks, Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corporation and UBS, reported lower net interest income in the first nine months of the year. Following the December 1992 referendum vote against joining the European Economic Area, the Swiss government launched a programme unilaterally to harmonise laws with EU practice, wherever possible. In the financial area, the fruits of that effort are about to appear, much more quickly than many Swiss expected. A new banking law comes into force on January 1 that legalises assistance between Swiss and foreign banks on administrative matters and permits foreign-owned banks to provide information on large risks to their parents. It also simplifies the process by which domestic banks prove they are Swiss-owned and thereby entitled to use the word Swiss in their names. Henceforth, large shareholders of banks must disclose their holdings, and the Federal Banking Commission has the right to disenfranchise those it considers undesirable. It was this reform that emboldened UBS in September to propose removing all ownership restrictions on its registered shares. An investment trust law also comes into force at the beginning of the year, supplanting an antique law that does not permit the formation of many popular types of funds. As a result, much fund business left Switzerland, mainly for Luxembourg. Until a few months ago, Swiss bankers cautiously predicted that the main impact of the new law would be to encourage fund managers to set up their new investment funds in Switzerland. Now they think there could be some repatriation of funds from Luxembourg as well. Next June, the Swiss stock exchanges will go electronic, uniting in one market the volume that was hitherto dissipated over three regional exchanges. Most members are confident that there will be an increase in liquidity and a lowering of transaction costs, which will encourage traders to bring volume back from London. Barring unforeseen problems in parliament, a new national stock exchange law will come into force at about the same time, bringing with it important protections for investors and companies. The inclusion of a takeover code will remove the justification for severe restrictions on voting that still exist over many Swiss shares. The directors of Nestle, where no shareholder may exercise more than 3 per cent of the votes, have already signalled that they would propose removing the curbs once the code is in place. Meanwhile, the government has implemented three new measures to facilitate its fight against money launderers. Bankers now have the right to denounce suspicious clients. Previously, such a move conflicted with bank secrecy requirements. For its part, the government now has the right to confiscate funds found to be held in Swiss banks by criminals. And membership of a criminal organisation has become a criminal offence. That means that Swiss courts can co-operate with foreign prosecutors in cases involving the Mafia and other criminal organisations, without further specific charges being involved. All these measures appear to be having positive effects. After a period in which foreign banks were tending to close or downgrade their Swiss bases, new ones are now being opened. The most significant recent expansion is probably that by Goldman Sachs, the leading US investment bank. Its Zurich operation, a small brokerage-based private banking branch in 1991, has moved into fund management, institutional sales and derivatives issuing, and has become a member of the Zurich Stock Exchange. The staff now numbers more than 100. Some German savings banks are planning to open Swiss offices because their clients fear that Luxembourg, now their favourite haven, will be forced to harmonise its tax policies with those of other EU members. Unfortunately, these arrivals are unlikely to be enough to offset the massive personnel reductions that are expected on the Swiss financial scene in the next few years. Mr Bruno Gehrig, a professor at the Swiss Institute for Banking and Finance in St Gallen and a member of the Federal Banking Commission, said in a speech last week in Zurich that the retail banking sector, which now employs about 90,000, would have to fall by as much as 20 per cent if it was to return to health. That process could happen quite quickly by Swiss standards in the wake of the landmark proxy battle last month between the UBS board and Mr Martin Ebner over the governance of the bank. The UBS board won the battle, which was ostensibly over its proposal to convert all registered shares into bearer shares, at a dramatic extraordinary shareholders' meeting. But Mr Ebner received wide support for his case that the bank should improve its returns to shareholders by focusing more on its successful activities and scaling down its unprofitable domestic retail business. It is still too early to foresee all the consequences of the UBS-Ebner confrontation, not least because of potential legal appeals. But improving shareholder value is clearly a theme whose time has come to Switzerland. Even Mr Gehrig used it to support his call for rationalising the troubled retail sector. 'The average domestic banking operation does not make enough money to yield what shareholders require,' he said.</p>

During a Latin American seminar on military spending being  held in Santiago, Arancibia made an overall analysis of the  decisionmaking process and changes within this context. He  emphasized that this type of meeting permitted one to see "the  progress achieved in technical and academic relations between  civilians and the military."    During the conference's first day, which was designed by the  National Academy of Political and Strategic Studies [Academia  Nacional de Estudios Politicos y Estrategicos] (ANEPE), and by  the Latin American School of Social Sciences (Flacso), the  agenda included defense policies, new security concepts, the  economic balance, and military spending in developed countries.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (8): Business visitors guide 'Zambian secretaries move as if they are walking under water,' complained an impatient business visitor. Part of the explanation for the apparent lassitude may lie in an exhausting journey into work on a poor public transport system, or poverty, or debilitating diseases such as bilharzia. But it is only part of the explanation. Few nations are as easy-going, good-humoured and courteous as Zambians who live life at a pace that might be described as relaxed. Visitors would be well-advised to move into a different gear themselves. Impatient drumming of fingers, clicks of irritation, or harsh words in an attempt to chivvy a slow-motion secretary may release the visitor's tensions but seldom bring results. Far better, instead, to tolerate an erratic phone service, rickety taxi, a less-than-reliable internal air service, and live life at a different pace. For a start, consider staying out of town, rather than at Lusaka's city-centre hotels. Direct international dialling from the rooms is not possible, and operator-connected calls to London, for example, are charged at a hefty Dollars 9 a minute. (But beware the Savoy Hotel in Ndola, which levies a minimum Dollars 45 for three minutes to the UK) An alternative to staying in the heart of the city is to book one of the 12 thatched rondavels (round huts) at Lilayi Lodge, (tel: 230326/228682-3 fax: 222906) a private game park 20 minutes' drive from Lusaka. The rondavels have no phones, but considering the erratic nature of Lusaka's telephone system, and the huge surcharges, that may well be an advantage. Essential reading is the Chamber of Commerce and Industry house magazine, Profit. It is an excellent source of information, and pulls no punches. Published monthly, it is worth ordering back copies - at about Dollars 2 an issue. Half an hour's reading will leave you well briefed (tel: 252369, fax: 252483), The business visitor with time to spare should not miss the opportunity to visit the Victoria Falls. Take your passport and cross over to the Zimbabwe side, where amenities - and the view - are better. Or stay on the Zambian side but retreat to Tongabezi (tel: 3-323235, fax: 323224), a small privately-owned lodge 25km upstream from the Falls. The five tented cottages and three houses on the curve of the Zambesi are only a few feet away from the river bank. Zambian handicrafts can be bought at Zintu, at the Ridgeway Hotel. Visitors should take precautions against malaria, and remember that Aids is widespread.</p>

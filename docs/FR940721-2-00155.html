Alaska-Specific Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> A. Purpose and Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for Alaska Native social and economic development projects. Approximately $1.5 million of financial assistance is anticipated to be available under this competitive area for Alaska Native governance, social and economic development projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANA plans to award approximately 15&hyph;18 grants under this competitive area. For individual village projects, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $100,000; for regional nonprofit and village consortia, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $150,000, commensurate with approved multi-village objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the three ANA goals described in Part I, ANA implemented a special Alaska social and economic development initiative in fiscal year 1984. This special effort was designed to provide financial assistance at the village level or for village-specific projects aimed at improving a village's governance capabilities and for social and economic development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This competitive area continues to implement this special initiative. ANA believes both the nonprofit and for-profit corporations in Alaska can play an important supportive role in assisting individual villages to develop and implement their own locally determined strategies which capitalize on opportunities afforded to Alaska Natives under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), Public Law 92&hyph;203.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administration for Native Americans does not fund objectives or activities for the core administration of an organization. However, ANA will consider funding core administrative capacity building projects at the village government level if the village does not have governing systems in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C.

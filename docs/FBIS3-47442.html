			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  receives the annual New Year's reports by ministries and  agencies from Tuesday for the first time since his government  was inaugurated in February 1993.    Chongwadae [presidential office] wants, however, to  drastically reform the annual reports to better suit a civilian  government and move away from past practice, which was almost  ritualized and devoid of substance under the militaristic and  authoritarian administrations of former Army generals.    Instead, the Kim administration wants to introduce "an  efficient and effective" practice of reporting on annual plans  by each ministry to the chief executive, Chongwadae officials  said Monday.    The decision is in line with Kim's style, which has  quickened  the pace of operating government affairs, including the New  Year's presidential press conference, the officials explained.  Unlike previous presidents, Kim gave his press conference in  the first week of the new year.    As a result, the administration plans to cut the period of  the so-called national policy reports by half, winding them up  before Jan. 31. In the past, reports to presidents had been  dragged into February or even March sometimes.    The administration hopes to wrap up reports by mayors of big  cities and provincial governors within February.    In order to save time and unnecessary complication, Kim will  receive reports from two ministries a day, all in the morning,  at Chongwadae, if possible. In the old days, presidents went  out to the offices concerned.    Of the 28 ministries and agencies, Kim will probably go only  to the Agriculture and Fisheries, Defense, Home Affairs and  Education Ministries. The number of officials he will meet will  also be reduced with heads of offices of planning, and bureau  chiefs, in addition to, of course, ministers.    This year's reports will also rid of "militaristic" charts  and slides and let ministries be brief and to the point with  their new year plans, the officials said.    One Chongwadae official said that since Kim has already  elaborated on the administration's goal for this year, which is  internationalization of the country, the ministries are expected  to place emphasis on ways to boost competitive strength.    Unlike past governments, the Kim administration will check  the progress of each plan reported by the ministries on a  quarterly basis, the official said.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Widow to carry on poll fight Sri Lanka's United National party, the main opposition grouping, last night chose the widow of Mr Gamini Dissanayake to be his successor as its candidate for next month's presidential election. On Monday, along with 50 others, he was killed by a suicide bomber. The UNP, which held power for 17 years until its August election defeat, had been widely expected to pick Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, 45, the former premier. He led the UNP until the election, but was ousted as its leader by Mr Dissanayake. Despite her lack of political experience, Mrs Shrima Dissanayake, a lawyer, will be a popular choice to run against Mrs Kumaratunga, the ruling People Alliance's candidate for the presidency. A curfew imposed in Colombo on Monday was lifted yesterday. The streets were calm. Police fear that the funerals of the bomb victims could prompt demonstrations.</p>

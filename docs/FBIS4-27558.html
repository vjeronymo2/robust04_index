			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Japan Association of  Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) on Wednesday [1 Jun]  requested anew that the Japanese Government make further efforts  to smoothly implement political, economic and administrative  reforms.    Chairman Masaru Hayami made the request during a breakfast  meeting with International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro  Hata and other trade ministry officials.    Electorate seat redistribution, as part of political  reforms,  should be completed during the current parliamentary session  while a tax reform package containing tax cuts and an offsetting  consumption tax increase two or three years later should be  formulated soon, Hayami said, echoing the voice of about 35  other corporate executives present at the breakfast meeting.    Hayami also urged the government to take concrete measures  to  narrow a price gap between home and abroad, reduce Japan's huge  current account surplus, upgrade the labor market and revise a  spending plan for public works projects for an efficient fund  allocation.    Trade Minister Hata replied that the government will do its  utmost to address the requests but refrained from making clear  commitments on specific requests.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Deutsche Telekom wins in Hungary A consortium led by Deutsche Telekom, the German state-owned telecommunications company, has pulled off eastern Europe's biggest single privatisation deal after agreeing to pay Dollars 875m (Pounds 590m) for a 30 per cent stake in Matav, Hungary's state telecoms concern. MagyarCom, the partnership in which Telekom owns 50 per cent plus one share and Ameritech, the US regional Bell operator, the remainder, also agreed to support Dollars 4.3bn capital spending at Matav by 2002. The Telekom group defeated a Dollars 910m bid by Stet International, the Italian state concern, and its US partner Bell Atlantic. France Telecom and US West bid Dollars 830m. The Hungarian authorities said price was not the only factor. The evaluators had given credit to Telekom's experience in modernising eastern Germany's telephones. Sources close to Stet, however, claimed its bid was technically as well as financially superior. The MagyarCom consortium will hold half the seats and a tie-breaking vote on the operating committee of Matav. Hungary's state holding company AV RT, which retains a majority shareholding, reserves the right to nominate the chief executive, but MagyarCom names the chief financial and technical officers. The Telekom group has promised to turn Hungary into a regional telecommunications hub funnelling traffic from Romania, Ukraine and other east European countries. The consortium has given commitments to increase the number of lines by more than 15 per cent a year so that Hungary can reach line density of 35 per 100 inhabitants by 1999. A tax holiday of 100 per cent for five years and 60 per cent for the following five years also contributed about Dollars 200m to Matav's value.</p>

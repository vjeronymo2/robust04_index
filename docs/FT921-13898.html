			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The hard slog of sharing the rural good life - Nick Garnett looks at the inns and outs of life in North Yorkshire ROSEDALE Abbey, a village on the edge of the North Yorkshire moors, nestles in the kind of secluded valley that makes much of the British countryside so beautiful. For Terry and Joan Bentley, who bought the Milburn Arms hotel 15 months ago, living there in the seclusion of Rosedale is a joy. But it carries a penalty. Rosedale's relative isolation means there are no large population centres nearby and winters can be tough. 'People have to make a conscious decision to come to Rosedale. There is no passing trade,' says Terry. 'One thing that has surprised me is the tremendous difference between peak and low seasons. The winter is a struggle.' Yet, despite the Gulf war and recession - which combined to lower turnover 20 per cent below target in the Bentleys' first year at the Milburn Arms - they are delighted to own the 11-bedroom, 18th-century inn. 'It has been more difficult than we expected but we are glad we purchased it. It has a lot of potential. The product is 80 per cent right and all we need is a better general trading environment,' says Terry. Until 1988, he had been international sales manager for Portakabin in York and then overseas manager for Dexion, a materials-handling company. 'We'd spent so much of our married life apart. We sat down one Christmas and decided we'd do something else.' The couple bought a small hotel outside York in 1988 and, after a speculative offer, sold it at a profit the following year. Having been gazumped by Pounds 30,000 on another hotel, they purchased the Milburn Arms in October 1990, having known the previous owner. They paid several hundred thousand pounds ('though quite a bit below half a million') for the handsome, stone- built hotel and six acres of farming land. Of the purchase price, just 27 per cent was borrowed - from the Skipton building society. 'Banks really are not too helpful,' says Terry. 'We took a commercial loan from the building society. They were much more competitive and interested.' The Bentleys also had Pounds 35,000 in cash earmarked as a trading float to get the new business up and running. Terry stresses the importance of preparation: 'People should not go in blind.' The accountant he used knows the hotel and entertainment industry very well. 'He picked the previous owner's balance sheet apart. He was in tune with the issue of margins in different areas of the business - the bar, the restaurant, and so on. Having an accomplished accountant is very important.' Terry had three months' training in hotel management in the 1970s. When he bought his first hotel four years ago, he took a three-month residential course supported by the recently-disbanded Hotel and Catering Training Board. You cannot be prepared for everything, though. The recession, Gulf war and a blizzard at the end of 1990 - which took out electric power for a week - dented trade seriously. In their first year to October 1991, the Bentleys were Pounds 80,000 adrift on the previous year and 20 per cent below their original target of a turnover of just under Pounds 400,000. The bed occupancy rate has been running at below 60 per cent against the 85 per cent the Bentleys hope to achieve. 'The recession has bit a lot harder than we thought and we are not out of it by a long chalk,' says Terry. The hotel purchase did come with certain benefits, however. High among them were two trained chefs, who were retained by the Bentleys. Using a mixture of permanent and casual staff, the hotel's annual wage bill is between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 80,000. Staff accommodation absorbs six rooms aside from the 11 for letting. The Milburn Arms makes a big play of its food. The bar menu includes hazelnut and brown rice bake, smoked mackerel and brandy pate, and shellfish and halibut hotpot. The five-course evening meal in the restaurant (tiger prawn tails, fillet of beef with Stilton sauce) arrives with a fixed price of Pounds 16.50. Vegetables are bought fresh from a local wholesaler, game is acquired from farms, and fresh fish is delivered by van twice a week from Whitby. One other benefit was that the previous owner had converted and extended the place, including turning some stock barns into bedrooms. All letting rooms are doubles with full en-suite bathrooms; they are finished in such woods as teak and pine. The dining room is on two levels and looks out on open country. Although there is central heating, the Milburn has three open fires fuelled by coal and logs. There is one structural problem. The inn is also the village pub and the large, smoky bar with its heavily-occupied pool table does not offer the kind of venue for eating that all overnight stayers appreciate. Then, too, there is competition from the bar of the White Horse Farm hotel, the village's other inn. So, the Bentleys are planning to add a residents' bar as well as a conference centre. The Milburn's real-ale bar is crucial, providing more than 40 per cent of total turnover. Bed and breakfast costs Pounds 28.50 a person with a single occupancy supplement of Pounds 7.50. The hotel uses an advertising agency and also pays around Pounds 1,000 a year to be part of the Consort Hotel and Wayfarer Inn group. Membership of this chain of independent hotels and inns provides some advertising at competitive rates. Terry is hoping to tighten the management belt and generate a small profit this year. This is being done partly through better cost controls and reducing food wastage by, for example, buying cuts of meat that can be used in a variety of dishes. Such attempts at cost control make the new uniform business rate even more galling. The present rate of Pounds 3,000 has risen to Pounds 10,000 and will increase steadily over the next few years, something against which the Bentleys are appealing. 'The uniform business rate is disgusting,' says Terry. 'It has ruined a lot of small businesses.' Despite the drawbacks, the Milburn Arms does provide a reasonable living and staffing levels have allowed the Bentleys to take holidays. It has been included in such publications as the Consumers Association's Good Hotel Guide but the couple are looking for something that will get the business moving a bit quicker. 'Unless you get a Michelin star or an AA rosette, it can be a long climb,' Terry says. The Milburn Arms Hotel. Rosedale Abbey, Pickering, North Yorkshire YO18 8RA. Tel. 07515-312.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Italy squeezes credit to defend currency ITALY was forced into an even tighter credit squeeze last night after the Bank of Italy reacted immediately to the German discount rate rise. The bank signalled its determination to defend the lira by raising the official discount rate from 13 per cent to 13.75 per cent in swift reaction to the Bundesbank's move. At the same time the bank's short-term interest rates on funds advanced to commercial banks were also increased by 0.75 percentage points, to 15.25 per cent. The rates will add to the already high cost of servicing Italy's debt and put further pressure on the delicate financial state of many industrial companies. The bank's signal to the markets relieved pressure on the lira, which ended the day at L758.35 against the D-Mark, marginally below Wednesday's close. But at one stage, before the Bundesbank decision was known, the lira was being traded at the record floor level of L761.25 against the German currency. This compares with the L765 permitted against the D-Mark within the European exchange rate mechanism. This has been the third time in 45 days that the Bank of Italy has raised the official discount rate, as the lira has come under pressure from speculators concerned about the country's deteriorating public finances. The bank has also been obliged to intervene by buying D-Marks. Interest rates in Italy are now at their highest levels since 1986. It is also the second time in almost seven months that the Italian central bank has been obliged to react to German interest rate increases. However, last December the bank waited three working days before countering the German central bank's move. Although reluctant to heighten the credit squeeze in an economy showing timid signs of emerging from recession, the Bank of Italy has consistently stuck by its policy of exchange rate stability. In the 12 months to May Italy's foreign currency reserves have dropped from L58,692bn to L34,057bn, a sizeable part drained by defence of the currency. In addition, in the run up to the April general elections about L2,000bn worth of gold was sold. Unofficial estimates suggest that every percentage point increase in the discount rate raises the cost of servicing Italy's debt stock by L13,000bn in a year. If current rates are sustained, this is likely to have an impact on the budgetary needs which were redefined only last Friday in an emergency budget generating an extra L30,000bn in fresh revenues and expenditure cuts. A spokesman for Confcommercio, the traders' association, warned last night of the dangers to business. 'This means money will cost us between 17 and 21 per cent, which in turn means the country is moving down a slope to recession which will be difficult to resolve.' He added that the credit squeeze threatened to kill many small enterprises.</p>

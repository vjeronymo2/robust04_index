			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation Federal Assembly State Duma, by Vil Dorofeyev  (POSTFACTUM -- specially for TRUD): "The `Point Of No Return'  Has Been Reached"]    [Text] [Dorofeyev] It is said, Ivan Petrovich, that when  you were in the old lower chamber building you ordered portraits  of four chairmen of the Russian Empire State Duma to be hung in  your office. What was it, a tribute to those who founded  Russian parliamentarism at the beginning of the century? Or a  reminder to yourself that the country now has the chance to  storm the heights of parliamentary democracy "at the fifth  attempt"?...    [Rybkin] There is much argument today about parliamentarism  -- what form it should take. Yet the foundations of  parliamentarism existed in Russia much earlier than in many  Western countries. There was Novgorod the Great, with its veche  [general meeting of the townspeople]. There was the Assembly of  the Land, where representatives of all estates of trouble-torn  Rus elected the 16-year-old Mikhail Romanov czar. (Why the  original organs of representative authority in Russia were  subsequently transformed is another matter.) Finally, at the  beginning of our era, a rather unwilling emperor was forced to  build the institution of the Duma into the state mechanism.    The empire's first State Duma lasted for two months and 10  days. The second lasted three months and 10 days. Ours -- the  Russian Federation State Duma -- started work 11 January. So we  have outlived the two first Russian parliaments. Although you  know yourself what a wide spectrum of views is represented in  the first State Duma in the history of the Russian Federation:  eight factions with variously opposing views. The election of  the Duma chairman was a typical example. I was elected to the  post by a majority of only one vote. In the days of the Russian  Federation Supreme Soviet this fact would no doubt have sparked  off a long debate. But the majority of deputies in the present  State Duma decided not to focus attention on this, but to seek  consensus.    [Dorofeyev] I remember as soon as the election results were  known political scientists were predicting a prolonged  argy-bargy among the factions in the State Duma. But this  apparently did not occur....    [Rybkin] Of course, there was a reluctance to repeat the  fate of the Khasbulatov Supreme Soviet. But the main reason why  the State Duma rapidly established itself lies elsewhere, in my  view. In the first place, most of the people elected to it,  despite all the flaws in the embryonic multiparty system, are  sincere and passionate about the country's future. Second, the  professional standard of most of the deputies is high. Many  have experience of practical work in senior posts in the regions  and in central departments in postcommunist Russia. Finally, a  part was played by the recognition by the majority of deputies  of an apparently simple truth: The country is tired of  confrontation between the authorities, of the constant talk.    Look what an interesting situation has developed.  International affairs committees were the most "popular" among  deputies in all supreme soviets. But the most authoritative  committee in the present State Duma is the Committee on the  Budget, Finance, Banking, and Taxes, headed by M. Zadornov, from  the "Yabloko" bloc. Well, in all civilized countries it is the  budget that is the focus of parliamentarians' attention, the  foundation of their activities.    The second example is the Committee on the Economy, headed  by Sergey Glazyev. It, in conjunction with government experts,  has the job of devising a program to extricate the country from  the crisis....    [Dorofeyev] But society is up to here with anticrisis  programs, just as it is with advertisements for Snickers.  Academician Abalkin's program, the "500 Days" program, Gaydar's  monetarist program. They were all adopted as a "basis" for  work, but for political reasons they resembled a very powerful  truck with an empty tank. No legislative base was created for  any of the programs.    [Rybkin] That is why the State Duma's priority program today  is the urgent elaboration of a large package of laws. I would  divide them into two groups. The first is based on the Civil  and Land Codes. It is essentially with their help that the law  will consolidate the radical changes currently taking place in  our country with regard to property.    The second group of laws bears directly on the economy. But  here the task is more complex. Because, in my view, this group  of laws should not merely reinforce the current progress of  economic reform, albeit slow -- but work to accelerate it. This  will take more time and closer collaboration with the  presidential and government structures. Not confrontation, as  in the recent past, but very close collaboration.    I foresee a question concerning the events of last October  in  Moscow and my attitude toward them, since I was a member of the  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and was in the "White House"  during what were tragic days for Russia. Seven months on, now  that emotions have abated, giving way to a ruthless analysis of  the situation and of oneself, I believe that what happened in  Moscow on 3-4 October was a general defeat for the authorities,  both executive and representative. So I take a dim view of  those who have not calmed down, who are trying to exploit human  tragedies, crisis phenomena in the economy, the inability of the  authorities....    I want to stress once again that the president and  government  are pretty happy at the moment with the State Duma's work on the  blocks of laws. And the first part of Petr Stolypin's  celebrated utterance, addressed, incidentally, to the deputies  of the second State Duma: "You need great upheavals..." I  believe is now part of the past, God willing, as far as Russian  reality is concerned.    [Dorofeyev] And the second part: "...We need a Great  Russia"? How realistic is it in the foreseeable future?    [Rybkin] Stolypin's words about Great Russia came back to me  on several occasions during the State Duma delegation's visit to  the United States. Particularly after a frank discussion with  Vice President A. Gore. He told me: "I am surprised when I  hear people in your country say that America is preventing  Russia from advancing along the path to a democratic society, to  economic reform. On the contrary, we want Russia to become a  rich and, most of all, stable country. To be frank, most of  your people are better educated than Americans. There is no  need to mention the raw material potential. It is just that you  need to understand yourselves first and foremost. Your people  have talent"....    [Dorofeyev] But what Mr. Gore says is an outsider's view.  What about the people living in Russia and trying to overcome  the problems of the transitional period. For example, those  "nonpayments"?    [Rybkin] In my view, this is one of the most disgraceful  phenomena of the economic reform. Recently I put it to Yegor  Timurovich Gaydar: If he had gone to the market in Moscow with  a sack and filled it with goods from the stalls, without paying,  what would people have thought of his behavior? Not paying the  farmers for delivering the harvest from July through the  December snows is a comparable phenomenon. I agree there should  be market arrangements, but all those involved in the market,  whoever they are, must be paid in accordance with their labor.  This is the foundation of all the reforms. Therefore one of  the State Duma's first steps was a decree on ensuring the  functioning of the agro-industrial complex in 1994. We will  seek to ensure its implementation at all costs, including a  separate entry in the budget.    [Dorofeyev] But doesn't this decree smack of outright  lobbying, since the chairman himself was a prominent member of  the agrarian faction before being elected to this high office?  Indeed, your entire life has been connected with the  countryside: Volgograd Institute of Agricultural Mechanization,  mechanical engineer on a major kolkhoz in the oblast, then  postgraduate work at the institute and teaching work....    [Rybkin] I have also reflected on the fact that an  institution of authority like the State Duma is headed by an  agrarian. Perhaps in what is a crucial period for the country,  it should finally address the farmer in a real, statesmanlike  way. After all, it is my firm belief that Russia is a  self-sufficient country. You say "lobbying." But before the  Duma adopted this decree I visited Yaroslavl, Tambov, and  Voronezh Oblasts. The land is different in these regions, but  the situation in the countryside is similar. Only recently many  politicians were pinning great hopes on private farming. Let us  give peasants land, they would say, and we will solve the  country's most nagging problem -- the food problem -- at a  stroke. Some 280,000 private farms were set up in Russia. Some  10 million hectares of land were distributed. But the return  from private farming in terms of the aggregate social product is  1 percent so far. I would not want to blame anyone. There was  no systematic, deliberate support for this on the part of the  state. Why did it happen? I have repeatedly tried to give an  answer to people in the government, citing the experience of the  developed countries. There, whatever they were developing,  whether it be "socialism with a human face" or "people's  capitalism," state support for the agrarian sector was assured.  Look at the experience of the 26 most developed countries of  Europe. There the cost component of state support for  agricultural production is up to 40 percent. In Japan it is up  to 80 percent,. Why do the capitalist countries, where they  know how to husband resources, do this? Well because they  realize there is nothing worse than strategic food dependence.  I profoundly believe this is something we must learn from them,  and learn well.    [Dorofeyev] But the state simply does not have the  substantial funds to provide specific support for the  countryside in order to avoid strategic food dependence in the  immediate future, as the "budget furor" in the State Duma  demonstrated. The treasury is in debt....    [Rybkin] First, the Duma "budget furor." Essentially the  country has been living without a budget for three years. No  budget has been presented to parliament, foreign economic  activity has not been dealt with at all, and hard currency has  not featured. For the first time, on 23 March, the Duma  insisted that it be informed of all the budget items for this  year. The budget was adopted on first reading on the old  legislative basis, on the basis of the old tax normatives. But  what concerns me more is the 1995 budget. By law it has to be  submitted to the lower chamber eight months before the start of  the fiscal year. Since the Russian economy is going through a  transitional period, we are insisting that the government submit  the draft budget for next year to us in September. This is  essential: Through the budget we will get a sense of the  government's economic program, if there is one. It is my  profound belief that we will not get anywhere without making the  economy controllable again.    Now we come to debts and loans. We owe $90 billion. We are  owed $160 billion. A number of countries is prepared to repay  debts to us, large ones at that. One $1-2 billion, another $3  billion, a third $1.5 billion. They must be grabbed as quickly  as possible. And the debts that will not be repaid, sell them  on. At 0.6 to 0.8 of the face value. Let people collect them  if they can. I can foresee your objections -- but what about  political aims.... But politics is politics and economics is  economics. If it is "inconvenient" for the state to press  debtors, then let our private entrepreneurs deal with the  problem. In two words -- no charity. This applies also to  technical credits to CIS countries. It is time they and we  started to live within our means. I totally agree here with the  Germans: "Good accounting does not spoil friendships."    [Dorofeyev] At the meetings in Volgograd you were repeatedly  asked, and in a rather peremptory manner: "What are we  building, then?" and "Where are we going?" You are a member of  the Russian Federation Communist Party, elected to the State  Duma to represent the Agrarian Party, ideologically the closest,  some of my colleagues believe, to the Russian Federation  Communist Party. At the same time, your career and your  position in the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, and  indeed your present position, indicate certain beliefs that are  different from those derived from [Stalin's] "Short Course of  the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)."    [Rybkin] Well, you were probably in the CPSU, like many  current radical democrats, but you did not live in accordance  with the "Short Course." All of us who are nearly 50 or more  are children of the same era. A contradictory era, stained with  blood, it is true, unfortunately. But I would not renounce what  I have lived through as easily as many tried to do in the  romantic fervor of perestroyka. Incidentally, neither would I  blame Mikhail Gorbachev alone for all our ills. He did a great  deal for Russia. He essentially gave impetus to the reforms.  And I do not intend to renounce the military endeavors of my  father and the old men of my village. The paths they trod, the  enthusiasm with which they led their lives -- a difficult life,  without rights, but an honest life -- are part of my life as  well.    I regard the decade from 1975 through 1985 as a lost decade  for the country. But that is the past. And we must think about  the future. What kind of national consciousness will eventually  emerge from the remnants of the current morbid, wounded imperial  arrogance? No state can exist without this consciousness. It  is arguable what is harder: To reform the economy or to form a  national consciousness.    As for the answer to the question: "What are we building?"  -- in this case I would prefer the Swedish model of socialism.  But the "infantile disorder of leftism" will continue to be  part and parcel of our mass consciousness for a very long time  to come, no matter what political movement a Russian citizen  relates to.    Airmen have a very precise term: "the point of no return."  When an aircraft has already expended a large part of its fuel  it cannot return to the airfield where it took off, so all it  can do is continue on its way. In my view, Russia has now  passed the "point of no return" with regard to its 70-year  totalitarian past. At a cost and with losses, but it is now  past. There is only one way to go now -- into a civilized  future worthy of its people.</p>

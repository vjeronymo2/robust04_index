			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Endre Aczel: "The Czechs' Separate Way"] </F>   [Text] If the "Visegrad Group" has no common position for  President Clinton in Prague -- and it will not have one because  of a lack of coordination -- this will in effect mean that the  Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia have different  ideas about the framework of their cooperation with NATO and  about occupying this framework.    It is justifiable to say that this is not a decisive  viewpoint because, after all, it makes no difference what the  applying parties want from the club if its statutes and rules  have been laid down without them and will not be changed for  their sake.    However, it is an essential viewpoint that the "Visegrad"  countries do not wish to take a common stand or act as a "group  exercising pressure" on behalf of their own future and, let us  admit, this does not strengthen their position. Even if the  assertion of the will originating from this side would be  extremely limited anyway.    The lack of such a will is basically to be found in the  attitude of the Czech Republic, or more exactly in the attitude  of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. I would like to remind readers  that the independent Czech Republic was exactly five days old  when, in an interview given to LE FIGARO, Klaus expressed his  lack of interest in the "Visegrad" cooperation, and made it  clear that, by becoming independent, the Czech Republic did not  only "get rid" of the Slovaks, but also of Poland and Hungary.  Consequently, the Czech Republic does not want to share the  common label that might characterize the "Visegrad" Group in one  way or another either at the NATO level or the EC level. In  Klaus's view, such a label would harm the Czech Republic.    It would harm them, because Klaus regards his own republic  as  being in a much better condition than Poland or Hungary; as for  Slovakia, he does not even consider it worth mentioning. I would  not comment on this view but, from the viewpoint of NATO  membership, I would point out the advantageous situation  obviously enjoyed by the Czech Republic. A glance at the map is  sufficient to show that, of the "Visegrad" countries, only the  Czech Republic has no direct borders with the former Soviet  Union; consequently, Moscow, which continues to think in  "empire" terms, can have much less of a quarantine feeling in  connection with the affiliation of the Czech Republic than with  the possible NATO membership of Hungary, Poland, or Slovakia.    In other words, if Moscow's sensitivity is the basic reason  for NATO's reluctance to accept the "Visegrad" Group, then the  Czech Republic, which is in a geopolitically favorable position,  is the least to blame for causing this sensitivity.    However, one can easily predict that, after the NATO summit  and for the time being, the "Visegrad" countries will fall under  the "uniform label" so much criticized by Klaus; it is  unimaginable that the NATO would offer more to the Czechs than  to us, for example. However, this will definitely not hinder  Vaclav Klaus in continuing his tough struggle for the priority  of the Czech Republic, and it is to be feared that, just like  the Poles, Hungarian diplomacy will seek "sponsors" for the same  thing. For quite some time, Brzezinski called Poland "candidate  number one" and we should also consider the strong Polish lobby  in the United States.    To unsuspicious eyes, the "summit" in Prague could give the  impression that "Visegrad" -- an existing formation -- is  actually not something alive and its members are not bound by a  solidarity of the type of "either together or not at all." And  the selfish and arrogant Klaus is to be blamed for all this.</p>

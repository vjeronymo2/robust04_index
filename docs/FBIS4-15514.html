			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 8 Apr -- Moldovan Prime  Minister Andrei Sangheli has stated that his country intends to  participate only in economic cooperation within the context of  the CIS, and therefore has not signed any agreements relating to  military-political cooperation.    At a news conference in Kishinev today, the head of the  Cabinet of Ministers rejected the view that following the  Moldavan Parliament's ratification today of the agreements  signed by President Mircea Snegur on joining the CIS and the  economic union, rivers of gas will flow into the Republic from  Russia. We advocate equal cooperation with all countries. No  one is giving us anything for nothing today, either from Russia  or from Romania, the prime minister stressed.    Cooperation within the CIS and the economic union, in his  view, make it possible to put on a civilized level the close  ties between the former union republics, and to avoid the hard  knocks caused when they were unjustifiably broken.</p>

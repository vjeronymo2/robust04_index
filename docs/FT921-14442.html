			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Today's big topic is the first anniversary of the Gulf War. BBC2 shows the first of three programmes entitled The Washington Version (9.30), made by the people who produced the outstanding series 'The Second Russian Revolution'. Six members of the US war cabinet, including Secretary of State James Baker, Secretary of Defence Dick Cheney, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, tell the inside story of how they managed the war. Channel 4 provides a vivid contrast. After The Gulf (10.00) consists of five short films, lasting almost two hours, offering different Arab points of view on the war including a woman who was present at the bombing of Baghdad. This Week (8.30 ITV) shows Part 2 of 'The Rise And Fall Of A Godfather', the story of the reputed Mafia boss John Gotti who is due for trial next week on charges of racketeering and multiple murder. The BBC2 series on long lasting vehicles, Perpetual Motion (8.30), marks the passing of the Avro Shackleton: 'Rolls Royce engines and leather seats, what more could you want?' asks one of the navigators. The Goldring Audit (9.00 C4) reports on the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible.</p>

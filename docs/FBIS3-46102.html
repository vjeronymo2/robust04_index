By deepening reform of the enterprise  personnel system and breaking down the barriers in regard to the  status of cadres and workers, some 120,000 exemplary workers in  Beijing have assumed leadership and management positions in  enterprises.    For years, Chinese enterprises practiced a "life tenure"  system in regard to the status of cadres and workers. Once you  became a cadre, it meant you were sitting on an "iron armchair"  -- your rank was guaranteed for life regardless of your ability  and performance. Restricted by his status, a worker, no matter  of how talented he is, will find it almost impossible to assume  leadership or management responsibility in an enterprises. Such  a personnel system is not conducive to optimizing managerial  talent and promoting talent.    In 1984, Beijing started introducing competition mechanisms  in a bid to reform the enterprise personnel system. On one  hand, the city introduced an appointments system for the  existing cadres. Those who were not appointed were reassigned as  workers and paid as such. Their status as a cadre was retained  only in their personal files. At the same time, outstanding  workers were appointed administrators and managers and started  to draw the benefits due cadres. A new mechanism of mobility  whereby both cadres and workers can be assigned as a worker or  manager and receive the benefits due their posts began to take  shape. Figures of the Beijing City Personnel Bureau show that  workers hired as cadres account for nearly one-third of the  cadres in the city's state-owned enterprises. In some  enterprises, such cadres account for nearly half of the ranks of  cadres.    Promoting cadres from among workers has put an end to the  situation in which demobilized Army cadres and graduates of  colleges and secondary vocational schools made up the primary  source of cadres, thereby expanding the source of potential  cadres available for the entire work force of enterprises and  creating opportunities for outstanding workers to show their  talents. In hiring cadres, enterprises in Beijing earnestly  solicit the views of workers and set strict standards. Most of  the workers selected are under 35 and have finished senior high  school. They have rich work experience, are content with their  work, and can identify with the workers. Most of them have  become backbone management personnel. [passage omitted]    Cadres who are promoted from among cadres do not have an  "iron armchair" on which to sit. Enterprises appraise the  performance of every appointed cadre. Competent ones will be  reappointed and the incompetent ones will be demoted or  reassigned as a worker. This has injected competition, energy,  and mobility into the ranks of cadres. Every year, about 20,000  outstanding workers in the city's state-owned enterprises are  promoted to the ranks of management. At the same time, a number  of incompetent cadres are reassigned as workers. This has not  only enhanced the sense of competition and self-restraint among  appointed cadres but has also aroused the initiative of the  demoted cadres. [passage omitted]    Party committees at all levels in Beijing have stepped up  efforts to elevate workers to cadre level by, among other  things, having them take courses at party schools or spare-time  universities to improve their knowledge of policies and to  sharpen their vocational skills. To institutionalize and  standardize this practice of enterprises appointing cadres from  among the workers, the city personnel bureau has formulated a  series of regulations governing the promotion, evaluation,  approval, management, and material benefits of  workers-turned-cadres.</p>

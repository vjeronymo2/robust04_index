			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Volvo to quit Finnish SE VOLVO, the Swedish vehicle group, announced yesterday that it intended to stop trading on the Finnish Stock Exchange because of the sharp risein the costs of listing in Helsinki, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The company pointed out that Finland's bourse required an annual fee of SKr225,000 (Dollars 37,000). This makes it by far the most expensive foreign exchange among the 15 exchanges throughout the 10 countries where the Volvo share is listed. Volvo added that by contrast the London Stock Exchange required an annual fee of SKr46,000. The company added that in London more than 11m Volvo shares were traded last year, compared with 200,000 shares in Helsinki. 'The cost is not in sensible proportion to the volume of trading,' pointed out Mr Hans Renstrom, company spokesman.</p>

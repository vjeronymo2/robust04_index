			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei retreats as Shanghai surges 13.7% Arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking by corporate investors depressed share prices, while trading volume declined as many institutional investors remained inactive ahead of the listing of Japan Telecom shares, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average ended 244.65, or 1.2 per cent, off at 20,409.18 after a high of 20,645.23 and low of 20,395.98. Traders said investors were worried about the expensive public offering price of JT at Y4.7m, while some analysts feared that investors might sell other shareholdings to buy JT stock. Selling to realise profits ahead of the interim book closing by most corporations had already finished. However, many banks, which need to offset write-offs for bad loans, were expected to continue to do so until the end of the month. Volume fell to 272m shares from 355m. Some investors chose not to trade, citing the Labor Day holiday in New York. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 22.68 to 1,618.46 and the Nikkei 300 shed 4.30 to 295.07. Losers led gainers by 824 to 205, with 147 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.84 to 1,317.82. Bearishness over JT prompted declines in the telecommunication sector. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the leading telecom operator, dropped Y24,000, or 2.6 per cent, to Y906,000, while DDI, a second section company, receded Y27,000 to Y971,000. Earnings-linked trading was also evident. Think tanks affiliated with the leading brokers release corporate earnings outlooks later this week, and investors are expected to boost trading in individual companies with earnings revisions. Fears of lower earnings at Capcom, a video game maker, hurt the whole sector. The stock weakened Y500 to Y2,750, while Sega Enterprises retreated Y480 to Y6,420 on selling by overseas investors. Machine tool producers, on the other hand, were higher on hopes of increased capital spending. Okuma climbed Y42 to Y958 and Ikegai Y9 to Y428. Steelmakers were actively traded but lost ground on profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, slipped Y8 to Y377 and Sumitomo Metal Industries Y5 to Y340. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 181.06 to 22,718.31 in volume of 85.3m shares. Roundup Fortunes were mixed in the Pacific Rim. SHANGHAI's A share index surged 13.7 per cent in extremely active trading as institutions, major individual shareholders and small investors launched a buying spree, their confidence boosted by news that Beijing was pressing ahead with a plan to invite foreign funds into the domestic A share market. The index gained 116.98 at 973.48 in record turnover of Yn15.5bn, topping the previous record of Yn12.80bn on August 11. In Shenzhen, the A share index soared 35.07, or 19.8 per cent, to 212.62. Shanghai's B index closed 3.30, or 4.2 per cent, up at 82.17 in heavy volume of 10.6m shares and the Shenzhen B index rose 0.78 points to 115.59. SEOUL put on 2.3 per cent in active trading on expectations of a market rally by the end of the year. The composite index ended 21.73 higher at 969.61. Volume totalled 40.6m shares, against a previous 36.02m. HONG KONG was firmer but below the psychologically important 10,000 level after a sharp, but unexpected, rally that drove the Hang Seng index up to a peak of 10,064.86 ran out of steam. The index was finally 60.48 ahead at 9,962.04, while the H share index climbed a more modest 5.91 to 1,381.62. Brokers said foreign investors, particularly US and Japanese funds, spearheaded the buying spree, while many local investors sought to sell into strength and take profits. TAIPEI lost 1.2 per cent in late selling on news that the August consumer price index rose to a higher than expected 7.1 per cent, prompting concern that the central bank may move further to tighten monetary policy. The weighted index finished 84.93 off at 6,866.32, after a day's high of 6,966.21, in turnover of TDollars 63.4bn. SYDNEY was lower in thin volume following Wall Street's modest fall on Friday and with investors hesitant to trade ahead of the Labor Day holiday in the US. The All Ordinaries index closed 11.5 down at 2,095.5. WELLINGTON finished flat, the NZSE-40 capital index losing 2.24 at 2,176.51, after recovering from an intraday low of 2,162.53, in NZDollars 38.4m turnover. SINGAPORE was consolidating after last week's gains and the Straits Times Industrial index eased 2.55 to 2,328.06. Keppel closed 20 cents up at SDollars 11.50 after news that it was joining a consortium to bid for a mobile phone licence. KUALA LUMPUR was mixed to slightly lower following a final push by traders which forced the market up from the day's lows during the last hour. The KLSE composite index ended a mere 1.37 softer at 1,159.51. JAKARTA found unexpectedly strong support from local and foreign investors and the official index moved forward 3.86 to 519.42.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Benson financing for acquisitions BENSON GROUP, the engineering company, plans to strengthen its components and heating businesses with two acquisitions worth a total of Pounds 6.68m. The group will finance the purchases by raising Pounds 6.65m after expenses through a placing of 53.8m new shares and an open offer. Noble Grossart, the merchant bank, will place the new shares at 13p. Existing shareholders will be offered three new shares for every four held. Mr Richard Phillips, who took over as executive chairman in 1990 and has since returned the company to profitability through disposals and reduced borrowings, said the purchases fitted with the group's existing businesses and its plans for Europe. Benson will pay Pounds 4.26m for three West Midlands-based engineering businesses owned by Thama Holdings. It will also pay Pounds 2.42m for Pakaway Perrymatics, a manufacturer of heaters and boilers based near Brighton. The group also announced sharply increased pre-tax profits of Pounds 225,000 for the six months to end-November, compared to Pounds 35,000 in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per share emerged at 0.39p (0.07p). The company intends to pay a final dividend of not less than 0.1p for the current year to end-May, the first distribution since January 1990. The improved results reflected better margins and a lower interest charge. Following a Pounds 2.2m rights issue last July, it has paid off all bank borrowings.</p>

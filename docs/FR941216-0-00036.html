			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dam construction was responsible for the loss of approximately 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the estimated original range of the arroyo toad. Twenty-six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large impoundments are currently located within the range of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species, inundating over 190 km (120 miles) of suitable habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional areas have been identified as potential dam sites and, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constructed, would destroy 25 percent of the current range (6 to 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the original range) of the arroyo toad (Sweet 1991a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to habitat loss through direct inundation, dams can have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant effects on habitat quality downstream. Artificial flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation disrupts the natural processes that produce the terrace and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pool habitats required by arroyo toads. Unseasonal water releases may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent arroyo toads from breeding due to habitat changes (Sweet 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another consequence of sustained unnatural perennial flows below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dams is an adverse effect on the habitat of this species by encouraging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vegetative growth in a riparian corridor, which increases ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stability and hence confines and deepens the creek channel. Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures are reduced below the temperatures needed for larval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development (Sweet 1991a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The arroyo toad is also sensitive to stream diversions as they cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the riparian areas to dry. Water diversions that alter normal flows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have degraded habitats and adversely affected arroyo toads by leading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to: (1) The early drying of breeding pools, causing breeding failures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or loss of the larval population; (2) restriction of the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential for rapid growth when newly-metamorphosed toads can forage on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damp gravel bars; and (3) loss of damp subsurface soil, which may result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in high adult mortality during late summer and early fall (Sweet 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development projects in riparian wetlands have caused permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses of riparian habitats and are the most conspicuous factor in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline of the arroyo toad (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1991). Agriculture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and urbanization have already destroyed much of the suitable arroyo toad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat south of the Santa Clara River in Ventura County (S. Sweet,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pers. comm., 1991). Stream terraces have been converted to farming,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> road corridors, and residential and commercial uses, while the streams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> themselves have been channelized for flood control. Large stretches of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> riparian corridor habitat have also been degraded or destroyed by cattle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and feral pigs (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recreational activities in riparian wetlands have had substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative effects to arroyo toad habitat and individuals, as discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Factor E. Off-highway vehicles cause extensive damage to the shallow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pools in which arroyo toads breed (Sweet 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Streamside campgrounds in southern California national forests have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently been located adjacent to arroyo toad habitat (Sweet 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Los Padres National Forest, each of the three campgrounds on Piru  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Sespe Creeks were developed on terraces used by arroyo toads within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 to 100 meters (150 to 300 feet) of their breeding pools. On the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upper Santa Ynez River, also in Los Padres National Forest, three of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four campgrounds are also located in arroyo toad habitat (Sweet 1991a,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991b). The placement of campgrounds is similar in the Cleveland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Forest in San Diego County; upper San Juan Creek, upper San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Luis Rey River, and Cottonwood Creek all have campgrounds situated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjacent to arroyo toad breeding habitats (M. Jennings,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of heavy equipment in yearly reconstruction of roads and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream crossings in the national forests has had significant and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeated impacts to arroyo toads and toad habitat. Maintenance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> road to Ogilvy Ranch, a private inholding in the Los Padres National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forest, is likely responsible for a depressed population of arroyo toads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Mono Creek. The Ogilvy Ranch road makes 18 crossings of Mono Creek,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many directly through or near arroyo toad breeding pools. In summer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992, the Los Padres National Forest declined to open the Ogilvy Ranch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> road in order to protect populations of arroyo toads and other candidate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amphibians and reptiles. However, the road was opened with a bulldozer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the fall. As juvenile arroyo toads were likely burrowed in the soft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sand adjacent to the creek, grading the road up the creek destroyed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat and probably killed individual toads. Regular maintenance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roads in the Los Padres National Forest negatively affects arroyo toad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and toad habitat on the Santa Ynez River, Piru and Sespe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creeks, as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mining activities are an additional threat to this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recreational suction dredging for gold adversely affects toad habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and individuals. Dredging destroys breeding pools used by arroyo toads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and causes excessive siltation downstream, which asphyxiates eggs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small larvae. For example, during the Memorial Day weekend of 1991,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four small dredges operating on Piru Creek (Los Padres National Forest)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced sedimentation visible more than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downstream and adversely affected 40,000 to 60,000 arroyo toad larvae.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent surveys revealed nearly total destruction of the species in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this stream section; fewer than 100 larvae survived, and only 4 juvenile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toads were located (Sweet 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several rivers in the Los Padres National Forest were recently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporarily closed to gold mining, and it is uncertain whether the ban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be made permanent. In December 1992, a group of miners challenged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Forest Service's authority to close Piru Creek to mining. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals practiced various methods of gold extraction until cited by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Forest Service. It is probable that future challenges will occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, if successful, will threaten the population of arroyo toads on Piru  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creek.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Educational Purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Populations of the arroyo toad are becoming so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small and confined that even limited taking by campers, recreationists,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and scientific researchers could adversely affect this species'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viability. These toads are threatened from collecting by children near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the campgrounds. No data exists on the extent of such collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, but it is probable that it continues to occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

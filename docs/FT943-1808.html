			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Pay and jobs in a global economy If problems could be cured by conferences, unemployment in the older industrialised countries would be well on the way to solution. At one recent gathering, organised by the Kansas Federal Reserve at Jackson Hole, Paul Krugman of Harvard university set out to extract a core consensus on the subject. He starts from the well-known phenomenon that, while US unemployment has been rising and falling with the business cycle, there has been no change of trend since the mid-1970s. European unemployment has, on the other hand, soared and remained at 8 per cent even in buoyant periods when the economic brakes had to be put on to prevent inflation accelerating. The US has, alas, had its own problem: a widening of pay differentials associated not with any kind of 'trickle down' but with an absolute drop in remuneration at the bottom of the pay scale. The Krugman diagnosis is that the same process which has expressed itself in high unemployment in Europe has emerged in poverty at work in the US. The demand for unskilled or less favoured workers has fallen everywhere in relation to better trained or more fortunate workers. In the US the strain has been taken by pay rates. In Europe the welfare state has prevented a similar widening of differentials and, instead, the strain is taken by unemployment. The resulting non-idyllic nature of the US labour market was vividly described by the noted US specialist Richard Freeman, at another symposium in Salzburg organised by the Egon Sohmen Foundation. He would link it with the fact that the proportion of young US males in jail, on parole or on probation, rose from 4 per cent to 11 per cent in only 13 years (1980-93); among young blacks the rise was from 11 per cent to 25 per cent. In Europe there are two ways in which prevailing institutions can worsen unemployment. There is the effect on incentives. High social security taxes add to the cost of employing workers or subtract from their take-home pay; while 'social' benefits provide a floor or reservation wage below which actual wages cannot be dragged without people being better off not working. The other way concerns not so much the welfare state itself as collectivist institutions which price workers out of jobs. There are, for instance, minimum pay provisions and restrictions on the extent to which employers can differentiate between workers of different age and experience according to the value of their skill. Then there are collective agreements between employers and unions which price the unlucky out of jobs. Indeed it is difficult in Germany for employers and workers to opt out of such agreements even if both are willing to do so in high unemployment regions. There are also restrictions on the hours and flexibility of work which have a similar effect in raising the effective costs of hiring labour. These two kinds of influences shade into each other. But it does make a difference where one puts the emphasis. If the main part of the problem is the lack of work incentives, then unemployment is to some extent voluntary and the need to reduce the jobless percentage is a matter of easing the tax and transfer burden on those at work, or of reducing the adverse social effects of idleness. If, on the other hand, pricing-out-of-work laws and practices are the main culprits, then the unemployed are themselves the principal 'outside' victims of the 'insiders' who have made the agreements and the rules. In continental Europe the emphasis should be at least as much on collectivism as on incentives. I would also put more emphasis than is fashionable among economists on the role played by moralistic or traditional objections to undercutting. I am sometimes asked what would happen if another journalist offered to join the staff to write Economic Viewpoint for much less pay. It would be an interesting experiment. The central theme, however, is that neither the welfare state nor collective procedures for setting pay would on their own have been enough to generate the European unemployment explosion. The welfare state is probably not on average more generous than 20 years ago. Nor are pricing-out-of-work arrangements more strict. The important point has been the interaction of European practices with a sharp widening of the pay relativities which would prevail if the labour market were left to itself. Is it possible to square the circle and combine the benefits of a European welfare state with an American-style flexible labour market? The upbeat answer is to call for more education and training, so that workers near the bottom of the income scale acquire more of the capacities of the ones at the top. It is to Krugman's credit that he steers clear of this industrial correctness. He rightly queries how much of the wider spread in equilibrium pay rates is due to formal education. Differentials among people of similar educational qualifications have increased at least as much as differentials between people of different qualifications. He also adds that Americans who hold up the superior performance of France and Germany in teaching basic literacy and numeracy fail to notice that the results have not translated into lower unemployment. Shrinking the welfare state is at the other extreme - the hard-nosed approach. This would have many very harsh effects. Not only would benefits be less for those still unemployed; but there would be a shakedown in pay rates for those who have always had jobs near the bottom of the scale. One approach, which has been powerfully argued by Edmund Phelps of Columbia is that of an employer subsidy to take on unskilled workers. This would be expensive and would have to be very tightly policed to prevent abuse; there would, for instance, have to be a sliding scale for borderline workers. Moreover, because of differing family circumstances the net redistribution of income implicit in such a scheme would be badly targeted. The still distant ideal would be of a basic income paid to everyone to provide a floor, on top of which market earnings would be added. To say that this would be prohibitively expensive is partly a matter of tax illusion. The real drawbacks are that there could be a large incentive to voluntary unemployment or underemployment for those prepared to make do with the basic income; and much of the benefits would spill over to those higher up the income scale needing it least. The best present compromise would be a negative income tax which would differ from a basic income in being conditional on work search attempts and in being withdrawn at a much higher rate than the basic rate of income tax. Indeed an embryonic British system of this kind exists in the form of family credits for households with breadwinners on low incomes. This could be built on, for instance by extending it to workers without children and making some of the conditions less irksome. But on neither side of the Atlantic is it easy to interest people in British experiments; and there is a preference for a priori proposals. Just for once, however, I want to move off remedies and discuss the diagnosis further. For the main problem of the Krugman consensus is that the reason labour market relativities should have changed so much is left hanging in mid-air. The conventional explanation - of technology driving out unskilled workers - is unconvincing. For pay differentials within every skill and educational category have risen quite as much as differentials between them. And as Krugman remarks: 'The time could well come when most tax lawyers are replaced with expert systems, but human beings are still needed for such truly difficult occupations as gardening and house cleaning.' The most controversial explanation centres on competition from low-wage workers in the developing - and more recently the former communist - countries in a liberalised global economy. This was suggested by Douglas McWilliams of the London Centre for Economics and Business Research in a couple of lectures last year. It has since been most fully developed in a book by Adrian Wood, North South Trade, Employment and Inequality (Clarendon Press, Oxford). The respectable form of this thesis must be sharply distinguished from that of populist opponents of the Gatt accord, who do not understand that countries of very different income levels can profitably trade with each other. If trade is freed between two groups, North and South, the presumption is that both sides benefit, although not necessarily everyone in both groups. The suggestion, rather, is that in the North unskilled or semi-skilled workers, whose tasks can be equally well carried out by workers elsewhere at much lower wages, will lose out. The problem then becomes one not of 'unfair' trade, as the Clinton administration seems to think, but of income distribution within the North. Many orthodox trade experts reject this diagnosis, although a new analysis by Jeffrey Sachs and H J Shatzin in the latest Brookings Papers gives it partial support. But the real point is that the globalisation of the world economy (a term to which Krugman strongly objects) could easily throw up such problems in the future even if it has not done so already. Indeed, it is possible to bypass the complexities of international trade theory by looking at the world as a single economy. In such an economy not only goods but capital is mobile - physical as well as financial capital. It only takes a few years to put up a new plant anywhere where the local political environment is favourable. In such a world, as Patrick Minford eloquently maintained at Salzburg, pay differences among workers of comparable skill will tend to be reduced, if not eliminated, by owners of capital seeking the best return, and able to introduce best-practice technology wherever they go. This will be so even if labour itself remains relatively immobile between countries or areas. If this were to happen, the conditions of the workers of the world would indeed tend to be equalised - at least among those of comparable skills - but by means very different from those that the early socialists envisaged. What are the main snags in this equalisation scenario? Why did nothing like this happen before 1914 when there was, indeed, a single world economy and many such fears were expressed by European and American protectionists? The big difference is that literacy has become very widespread in the third world in the last 40 years - which it was not in Queen Victoria's time. Looking ahead, the most under-discussed problem is: what will happen to wage rates in the emerging countries? On productivity grounds they should rise towards those of the west, thus tackling the problem in the best possible way. This is a reasonable hope for a country like the Czech Republic, where the skills, capital and entrepreneurship for near full employment already exist and where people have agreed to a sharp, but they hope temporary, sacrifice to repair the ravages of totalitarian rule. Matters are very different in China, where there are said to be 200m workers surplus to farm needs who could presumably be enticed into the cities at wage rates only marginally above subsistence. But the final ray of hope which I would like to point to takes us back to the more prosperous north. If the liberalisation of the world economy is going to make northern countries richer, but make many industrial or clerical workers within them worse off, then who will gain the difference? For a time it may be the owners of capital - a foretaste is visible in the worldwide rise in long-term real interest rates. But capital will be eventually affected by the tendency of funds available for investment to increase to meet new opportunities. One is then left with the conclusion that much of the gain will go to owners of land, who outside the rural shires are hard to distinguish from owners of capital. Classical economists, right down to supposedly extreme free marketeers like Friedrich Hayek, have always accepted that land in the shape of pure space is a suitable object for redistributive taxation. But they despaired about being able to separate in practice the return from owning land, on the one hand, from the yield to the capital and ingenuity spent on improving it, on the other. The effort to distinguish it may still have to be made.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Patten urges progress on airport Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new governor, yesterday called for an end to the disagreements over the colony's new airport and underlined the need to move ahead with the project 'as soon as possible', agencies report. 'It is not in the interests of the UK government in particular to build the airport, though we want to do what is best for Hong Kong, ' he said. 'It is above all in the interests of the future of Hong Kong and in the interests of the whole of China, particularly southern China.' During an interview with the BBC, Mr Patten also pledged to study ways to 'broaden and deepen' democracy in the colony.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Trade News: IBM to push Sony standard IBM, the US computer manufacturer, and Sony, the leading Japanese consumer electronics group, are co-operating to promote Sony's standard for CD-based multi-media technology. IBM has announced that it will sell Sony's hand-held multi-media CD-ROM players in the US for which it has developed its own software. The two will be sold by IBM as a package. The Sony CD-ROM player was launched in the US in mid-September. The decision by IBM to market Sony's CD-ROM player is an endorsement by IBM of Sony's standard, which is slightly different from an internationally agreed CD-ROM standard. The link between two of the largest electronics companies has stirred excitement among industry circles over the possible formation of an agreement extending to the development of new software for Sony's consumer electronics products. Such an agreement could create the basis for a powerful electronics industry alliance. The talks mark a further step in IBM's strategy to develop a network of international alliances with partners in Europe and Asia as part of its restructuring programme. CD-ROM players are the hardware heart of multi-media machines which combine video, photography, data, animation and sound, by applying computing power to consumer electronic products. The computer software to bring together a variety of previously separate consumer products is vital to multi-media machines. The emergence of multi-media has prompted software producers, many of them US companies, to forge new relationships with Japanese consumer electronics hardware manufacturers. Last month, Sony agreed with Nintendo, the video-game manufacturers, to manufacture and market a new game system that combine Nintendo video games with a CD-ROM drive. Slower growth in consumer electronics and computer sales combined with high research costs and development, is forcing companies to forge international alliances. Apple, the US personal computer maker, is also allied with Sony while IBM has teamed up with Sharp, to market a pocket sized communications device. AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group and Matsushita, the world's largest electronics group last month unveiled an alliance to produce a pocket communicator.</p>

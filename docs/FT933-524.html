			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bongrain static at FFr169.6m for six months BONGRAIN, one of France's leading cheese makers, mustered static net profits of FFr169.59m (Dollars 29.1m) in the first six months of this year against FFr167.17m for the same period of 1992. This was in spite of the sluggish state of the French food market. The group, which has expanded rapidly in recent years and last year took managerial control of ULN, a financially troubled dairy co-operative in Normandy, suffered a slight fall in interim sales of 3.5 per cent to FFr4.67bn from FFr4.84bn.</p>

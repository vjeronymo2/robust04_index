			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Northrop Corp.: The Los Angeles-based defense contractor said its third-quarter  profit fell 23% to $21.5 million, blaming the decline in part on less research  and development work on such projects as the B-2 stealth bomber. The company,  which lost $78.1 million in the second quarter, also noted that it had made  fewer deliveries of its F-A-18 fighters. Revenue for the quarter ended Sept 30  dipped 8% to 1.25 billion from $1.36 billion a year earlier.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> KKR Partners Sued: A founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. sued his  former partners, claiming that they enriched themselves at his expense. In a  23-page complaint filed in New York Supreme Court, the state's trial-level  court, Jerome Kohlberg Jr. alleges that Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts  sharply cut his stake in several companies they had acquired jointly through  the New York firm. "We believe he is wrong both as to the facts and his  interpretation of the agreement between us, and we fully expect to prevail in  court," a spokesman for Kravis and Roberts said. Kohlberg, 64, resigned in 1987  from the firm he helped found in 1976, citing philosophical differences. He  remained a limited partner, enabling him to continue as an investor in KKR  deals.  </P></p>

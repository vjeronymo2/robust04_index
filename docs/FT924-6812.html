			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Tomkins' offer boost after RHM profit fall RANKS HOVIS McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery products group, yesterday confirmed the slide in profits that has led to its board recommending a Pounds 935m offer from Tomkins, the UK conglomerate. In what seems likely to be its last results statement, RHM said pre-tax profits in the year to September 5 had fallen from Pounds 150.2m to Pounds 92.6m on sales of Pounds 1.56bn. The figures were broadly in line with expectations, although the decline in the Manor Bakeries business was worse than expected while grocery products produced a marginally larger increase in profits than forecast. RHM brought forward its results as Tomkins' share price continued a recent drift, ending yesterday down 2p at 206p. The price is now only 6p above the 200p price at which Tomkins is planning to fund part of the acquisition through a Pounds 653m rights issue. With 11 days to go before the November 30 deadline for acceptance of the first instalment of the rights issue, City observers expect the size of this premium to be carefully monitored. The rights issue has been fully underwritten. But a widespread decision by shareholders to ignore the rights would leave the share registry with the wrong composition of shareholders. This could lead to a price-depressing hangover of Tomkins shares in the market. In meetings with fund managers and City analysts, Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins chief executive, has stressed new management can enhance earnings and limit downside risk. The message institutions are hearing is that the milling and bread baking side, where RHM yesterday said profits had fallen from Pounds 59.8m to Pounds 20.3m in the last year, is only one area where a turnround can be achieved. There is potential to reverse the decline in profits in the US - where RHM said yesterday profits fell from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 3.1m as a result 'of the recession and abnormal crop conditions for peanuts and tomatoes'. RHM said a capital investment programme was nearing completion and 'profitable progress should be resumed shortly.' There was also more potential from the grocery division, where profits rose from Pounds 35.4m to Pounds 39.9m. Manor Bakeries also had potential after last year's fall in profits from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 10.9m. Hauling the UK baking division out of loss remains a priority. According to one City observer, Mr Hutchings made headway in convincing the City of the deal's logic after the frosty earlier reception. The City was uncertain whether the downward rating of Tomkins shares reflected a new view of the company. Since the bid, Tomkins shares have fallen 21 per cent, or from a 35 per cent premium to the market's prospective p/e ratio to a 6 per cent premium.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mine tender limited to Russian bidders RUSSIAN authorities are to put the country's biggest gold mine out to tender to Russian enterprises, overriding claims to it by an Australian consortium allied with a local Siberian mining company. Mr Boris Yatskevich, deputy chairman of Russia's State Geology Committee, showed the Financial Times an order from Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting Russian prime minister, for a tender for Russian bidders to be held by March 1. The decision is likely to be challenged by Australia's Star Technology Systems, which has claimed an inalienable right to the deposit thanks to its 31 per cent stake in Lenzoloto, the joint-stock company which owns land on which the deposit has been found. Mr Yatskevich said the decision over Sukhoi Log did not mean Russia was turning its back on foreign investors. But he said that Russian enterprises had to be given a crack at projects accessible to them. The Udokan copper mine project, in contrast, was highly complex and would require foreign participants. 'I'm only a bureaucrat who wants everything to be done according to the law and in the national interest,' he said. Mr Yatskevich said permission given in April by Mr Gaidar for Lenzoloto to be turned into a closed joint stock company with rights to the mine did not mean that these rights could be shared with Star. It is precisely on this authorisation that Star is basing its case. Mr Yatskevich said Lenzoloto also failed to confirm its licence to exploit the mine in accordance with registration procedures issued this summer. However, embarrasingly for the government, its own Committee for State Property registered an open joint stock company in August with Star as a shareholder.</p>

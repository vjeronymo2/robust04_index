			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CYPRESS' HOWARD STOPS KATELLA ON ONE HIT, STRIKES OUT EIGHT  </P> <P> Beth Howard pitched a one-hitter and struck out eight to lead Cypress to a 5-0  victory over Katella Thursday in an Empire League game.  </P> <P> "That was about normal for Beth," Centurion Coach Jim Pittinger said. "Her  location was great. She was hitting spots we needed on key batters."  </P> <P> Howard faced a challenge in the seventh inning. With two outs, she walked Lisa  Helg and Dena Hartman, but then struck out the last batter for Katella (13-7,  7-3).  </P> <P> But the victory meant more to Cypress (22-6 overall, 8-2 in league play) than  just a league co-championship. Centurion Coach Tom Farr died in November, and  the team had a special motivation.  </P> <P> "From the very first, the girls dedicated this season to him," Pittinger said.  "As a matter of fact, the girls wear black armbands as a tribute to him."  </P> <P> Cypress, which left men on in every inning but the sixth, scored in the bottom  of the third. With one out and the bases loaded, Sarah Powers hit a fly ball to  right that landed between Katella first baseman Helg and right fielder Kelsi  Armbruster, scoring Holly Pittinger, who had reached base on an error by  shortstop Tammy Lohman.  </P> <P> In the fourth, Liz Moore doubled to left field, scoring both Pittinger and  Azuer Calderella. One inning later, Jodi Miller scored when a throw from third  bounced in front of Helg, and Kelly Snethen scored on a wild pitch from Leslie  Gerbin.  </P> <P> Katella's only hit came in the top of the third, when Tonya Armbruster hit a  line drive to left, but Howard struck out the next batter, and caught a pop-up  bunt.  </P> <P> "They got the hits when they needed to," Katella Coach Rhonda Weyer said. "We  just didn't make as much contact as they did, and when we did, it was right at  them."  </P> <P> In another league game:  </P> <P> Los Alamitos 4, Esperanza 1 -- Christy Bowles had three hits and scored twice  and Kandi Rehard had two hits, including a solo home run in the second inning,  to lead visiting Los Alamitos (18-7, 8-2).  </P></p>

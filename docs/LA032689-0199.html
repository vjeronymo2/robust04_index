			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: CRIME PLAYS, BUT NOT ACCORDION OWNER  </P> <P> Perhaps it was a crime of need. Or of desperation. Maybe even a crime of  passion.  </P> <P> But whatever incited the burglary of my car last weekend, it was, in the  parlance of all those pithy TV detectives, "a senseless crime."  </P> <P> When I returned to the car from a concert I had attended, I didn't detect any  damage right away. Such was the level of the thieves' expertise. Only later --  when I was on my way into the house and popped the trunk to collect my  belongings -- was I struck by the enormity of this vile act.  </P> <P> At least the miscreant bypassed the passenger compartment and all its  valuables: my car stereo (must have been 'cause it's an in-dash, or he didn't  like the Chieftains tape in it), my trusty Swiss army knife, automobile  registration, Thomas Bros. map book and the sheet music to "Black Denim  Trousers and Motorcycle Boots."  </P> <P> The criminal mind. Go figure.  </P> <P> This desperado even left behind a tool box with some excellent, pre-storewide  discount Sears wrenches and screwdrivers. (He's evidently not one of those  crafty vandals who sneaks into your house when you're gone and makes the  faucets leak.)  </P> <P> No, it seemed this villain knew just what he wanted.  </P> <P> Yep. My accordion.  </P> <P> "Why??!" wondered I, gazing in stunned disbelief at the space where only a few  hours earlier my metallic-red, marble-finish instrument had rested. It had been  on its way to join in the revelry at a St. Patrick's Day party; still echoing  in my ears was the sound of a rendition I'd just worked up of Elvis' "Are You  Lonesome Tonight?" which I had re-dubbed "Are You Gaelic Tonight?"  </P> <P> On top of that, they had nabbed a bag with some laundry and a hair brush, but  that's not what made me bristle: It's time to step up the war on poverty when  street criminals stoop to accordion theft.  </P> <P> I filed a police report immediately, though the desk sergeant sounded less than  morally incensed when I reported the burglary at 2 a.m. He had that tone in his  voice. You know the one: "What do you expect us to do? Arrest the guy or give  him a reward?"  </P> <P> Obviously a man insensitive to the savage-breast-soothing charm of a good  polka.  </P> <P> He asked whether I wanted to bring the car down to check for fingerprints or  simply file the report over the phone. I scoffed. Certainly anyone clever  enough to zero in on the one car in all of Southern California with a vintage  12-bass keyboard accordion in the trunk would be astute enough to wear gloves.  Blockhead.  </P> <P> My insurance agent wasn't much better: "And you don't know who did it?" she  blithely asked.  </P> <P> "Well, yes," I said, "but then if I told you it wouldn't be a surprise anymore,  would it?"  </P> <P> Nevertheless, I want the scoundrel caught. Not to exact revenge (though I did  have moments when I fantasized about what delicious sentence the Ayatollah  would mete out for this offense. Always a believer that the punishment should  fit the crime, I would stand the guy up against a wall, offer him a blindfold,  then catch his chest hairs in the accordion's bellows).  </P> <P> No, I wanted to understand the unfathomable. Who could have done this thing?  Was it a disadvantaged youth from a broken home, the victim of a family driven  apart by an incompetent accordion teacher? The owner of a Mexican restaurant  finally pushed over the edge of sanity by bad nortenos music? Perhaps even a  fellow musician contracted to play one too many Italian weddings?  </P> <P> I felt eternally grateful that I left my clarinet at home, lest I might  single-handedly have provided the tools of a roving polka mob.  </P> <P> Even worse to consider: perhaps the thief had a partner in crime who now would  insist they go for a tuba.  </P> <P> The worst part, of course, wasn't the monetary loss I suffered but a sense that  my person had been violated. I felt disoriented, slightly queasy. I'm told it's  the same feeling most people experience after a theft. Or an accordion recital.  </P> <P> And then there's the ripple effect that these brigands never consider: Not only  did this crime deprive me of a creative outlet, it also will be felt by the  intermittent rock band I play in (we specialize in the little-known sub-genre  of intermittent rock). Not to mention our fans, which number into the dozens.  </P> <P> I realize I'll probably never see the accordion again. But be on the lookout --  if you see some guy on a street corner who's wearing steel-gray pants, a  green-striped shirt, freshly brushed hair and playing a red accordion, call the  cops.  </P> <P> Society will thank you.  </P></p>

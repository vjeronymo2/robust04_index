			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Abbey's hard road After all the upset about its abortive forays into estate agency and French commercial lending, it is about time that Abbey National finally sorted out its strategic direction. Yesterday's joint venture announcement with Commercial Union suggests that at last this may be happening. The deal enhances its product range without forcing it into unacceptable underwriting risk. It thus marks out the group more clearly as a broad provider of retail financial services. Abbey is also now stressing the contribution which its treasury operation, originally seen as simply as a diversification, could make in structuring attractive retail savings products. The snag is that this, more coherent Abbey is emerging just when the squeeze on its business shows signs of becoming intense. Pressure on its UK retail lending margin was expected. Abbey deserves compliments for standing back from fixed-rate mortgage business when it became unremunerative, but the first-half slippage to just 9.8 per cent in its share of the new mortgage market is disconcerting when the figure includes the assets acquired from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in February. Equally worrying is the revelation that a Pounds 10bn jump in the assets of Abbey's treasury operation has produced an increase in profits of only Pounds 4m. In marking Abbey's shares down 3 per cent the market betrays pessimism about its ability to respond. The question is one of degree. Abbey could presumably scale back its treasury business quite quickly if the returns failed to recover. That would be preferable to chasing higher-risk business. Mortgage lending is recovering as customers switch to floating rate loans. But after such a sharp fall in its market share, investors will want firm evidence that it can now hold its own.</p>

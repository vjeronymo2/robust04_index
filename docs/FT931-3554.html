			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Study of City trials procedure published THE scope for transferring fraud cases out of the criminal justice system to be dealt with by regulatory agencies is limited, according to research published yesterday by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. The study is the first large-scale review of serious fraud since the 1986 Roskill report. It finds that, although there are cases or parts of prosecutions which could have been dealt with outside the criminal justice system, there is much doubt in the City about whether self-regulatory organisations would have taken disciplinary action unless put under political pressure. The report says a problem remains over what to do about people such as Mr Roger Levitt, head of the collapsed Levitt Group, and Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck, both of whom are due to stand trial in September and who are not required to be members of any authorised body. Professor Michael Levi of Cardiff University, author of the report, says the changes to pre-trial procedures in serious fraud cases introduced after the Roskill report have not yet bedded down. That is partly because of the absence of sanctions in cases where the defence does not co-operate in pre-trial stages, but also because there is no process by which 'the system' or individual judges can learn from the experiences of others. Most judges do not want to conduct many fraud trials, and once they begin to learn how to handle them, they stop. Then others who admit to having little knowledge of fraud are selected because it is 'their turn'. Professor Levi also casts doubt on the benefits to be gained from the introduction of a formal system of US-style plea-bargaining in England and Wales. He says UK sentencing practice after guilty pleas leaves less scope for significant bargaining. Serious Fraud, Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, Research Study 14. HMSO, Pounds 25.</p>

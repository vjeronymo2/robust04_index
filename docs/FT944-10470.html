			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Yates Wine Lodges up 51% and sees sales expansion Yates Brothers Wine Lodges, the independent drinks group which gained a full listing in July, yesterday announced interim profits ahead by more than 50 per cent. Pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to September 25 increased from Pounds 1.41m to Pounds 2.13m. Total sales rose to Pounds 24.5m from Pounds 22m last time, when discontinued operations contributed Pounds 425,000. Mr Peter Dickson, managing director and great-grandson of Mr Peter Yates, the founder, said that since the end of the first half, like-for-like sales were almost 9 per cent ahead compared with a flat trend in the industry generally. 'We believe we are pulling away,' he added. The shares, placed at 140p, rose 6p yesterday to 181p. Operating profits at the core Yates's Wine Lodges, which now comprise 36 outlets, rose 30 per cent to Pounds 2.91m on sales up 24 per cent at Pounds 16.5m. The group, which also has 15 other outlets, is opening three further Wine Lodges next month. Sales in the wholesale side declined by 5 per cent to Pounds 5.88m as the group carried out its strategy of switching from secondary to direct wholesale. Operating profits were ahead from Pounds 82,000 to Pounds 98,000. The group has set itself a target of a 5 per cent return on the wholesale business and Universal Wines and Spirits, which supplies drinks in lightweight packaging to the airline industry. In August, Yates issued 16,760 shares to acquire the 25 per cent of Universal that it did not already own. The division made profits of just Pounds 2,000 on sales of Pounds 2.16m. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 7.68m to Pounds 499,000 following the Pounds 10m placing. The group expects its continuing expansion to lift borrowings to Pounds 3m by the year end. Earnings were 4.2p (3p). The interim dividend is 1p - in line with the flotation forecast.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINORITY JOBS AND CLEAN AIR  </P> <P> Garcia gets great coverage in The Times. His views are reported on a regular  basis and they almost invariably bear one implication: that the interests of  environmentally concerned and affluent Westsiders are in direct conflict with  the poor of the city's South and East sides, and that the fight for clean air,  pure water and sensitive land use must invariably lead to class conflict.  </P> <P> Why such conflict should be inevitable is not clear to me. Are residents of  East and South-Central L.A. any less concerned about noxious air, poisoned  water and rapacious developers? I doubt it. Witness the vote on Propositions P  and O last November, when despite efforts to portray opposition to Palisades  oil drilling as the peculiar enterprise of the privileged Westside, voters all  over the city turned down Occidental Petroleum.  </P> <P> The point usually made by Garcia and others is that development fuels the local  economy and creates jobs for the disadvantaged. Granted, if all development  stopped in L.A. tomorrow there would be grievous economic consequences. But how  do the poor benefit from taking the reins off development on the Westside?  Making it harder to build in Westwood might just make building in Watts more  attractive.  </P> <P> There is, of course, divergence in the interests and concerns of the city's  rich and poor halves. But I do not see the recent concern with quality of life  as the root cause of the parting of the ways. A decade of unrestricted  development has done nothing to even out prospects for the city's wealthy and  disadvantaged neighborhoods. If anything, the opposite has occurred. Quality of  life issues need not divide the city along economic lines unless prominent  people like Garcia insist publicly and repeatedly that they will.  </P> <P> BARTON J.

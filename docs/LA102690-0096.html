			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOSQUE EDITORIAL AN EYE-OPENER  </P> <P> Your editorial on "The mosque no one wanted" should open the eyes and minds of  the City Council members who misused their authority to interfere in the  constitutional rights of religious freedom. If the design of a religious  building is subject to the council's whims and fancies, then very soon  Christian churches would be required not to install a cross on the building in  order to blend with the surroundings.  </P> <P> Your thought-provoking editorial and Mayor Tom Bradley's justified action to  reconsider the City Council policy in regard to the design of religious  buildings are landmark expressions of faith in the religious freedom granted by  our Constitution.  </P> <P> I congratulate The Times for this timely editorial, and we Muslims are very  proud to have a newspaper in the area that stood with us in exposing the  infringement of the constitutional freedom of religion by the City Council  members.  </P> <P> SYED M. HUSAINI  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Music on the move at a barnstorming festival - Richard Fairman roves across the Schleswig Holstein landscape IN A LARGE barn the near-capacity family audience sits in silence. Adults occupy rows of temporary plastic seats. Children nestle in the beams. Young and old, more than 1000 people have come to hear the concert. Their attentiveness is all the more remarkable given the music they are hearing - Benjamin Britten's late and concentrated Third String Quartet. That was the scene last weekend at one of the 'musical parties' that are such an attractive feature of the Schleswig Holstein Music Festival. For those whose knowledge of Germany is not all that it might be it may be helpful to place Schleswig Holstein on the map. This is the northernmost part of Germany, bordering on Denmark. The North Sea bounds it to the West, the Baltic to the East. The main cities are Kiel and Lubeck, the nearest cosmopolitan centre is Hamburg. Now fully finding its feet, the festival itself is seven years old. In a period when so many music festivals were given birth, this one has survived and prospered because it is different. Among its early supporters was Leonard Bernstein, who wanted to promote a European equivalent of Tanglewood. (Keen followers of the Proms may remember him bringing the student Schleswig Holstein Festival Orchestra to London a few years ago.) With its fine student orchestra, its master-classes and so many young faces in the audience, youth is one of the features that has given the festival a distinctive personality. The other is the way it spreads itself generously across this whole northern reach of the country. As an area for holidays it is favoured by Germans from the South, while foreign tourists are most often Dutch or Scandinavian. To visitors from England the scenery is much like home. Bernstein remarked on the 'green countryside, farmland and . . . lordly houses', which could easily be a description of East Anglia, the area it most closely resembles. All this is worth mentioning, as the music is constantly on the move, from city cathedral to manor-house, town hall to country barn, and the audience will find that one of the pleasures of the festival is in moving with it. A visitor is likely to discover as much about the countryside while in pursuit of the music, as vice versa. The all-weekend 'musical party' was at Emkendorf, north of Hamburg. In the grounds of the local Schloss, a substantial country-house, with yellow walls and shuttered windows, lies a group of carefully-restored 18th-century barns. The largest is where the concert takes place. There is music for an hour, then an hour's rest, in which parents can take restless children to burn off their energy in the grounds. The refreshments, supplied by sponsoring companies, included ice-cream, beer and (an unlikely choice) champagne. Do not be fooled: Glyndebourne is many miles from what Emkendorf is about. One could dismiss the exercise as an up-market fun-fair, if the response to the music had not been so wholehearted. Apart from one or two screams from roving two-year-olds, the Arditti Quartet were given an intent hearing. Their performance of Britten's Third Quartet, subtly coloured, poetic, gave an eloquent apologia for the piece. Among the other performing groups were a folksy mouth-organ ensemble and the Chamber Pop Quintett Soundmachine. Musical snobs, like critics, can opt out and take a walk round the lake. The night before, the Arditti had been the guests in a thoroughly adult programme. This was at Wotersen, across country to the south east, but a venue almost identical in charm and layout. Another Schloss, another big barn, where 20th-century music was played Aldeburgh-style, in a fine, open acoustic. The programme paired two Bartok quartets with a new quartet by Peter Eotvos, a festival commission. It takes as its theme a selection of letters by Mozart, though the connection seemed tenuous. It was the quartet's sound-world of murmuring glissandos, as though the words of the letters were being hummed or whispered, that constituted its real interest. Delightful though these countryside venues are, a festival itinerary needs to take in towns or cities as well, if it is to catch the large-scale events with international artists. This has historically been a musical part of Germany. Hamburg was the birthplace of Brahms and Mendelssohn. Lubeck was the home of Buxtehude's renowned organ, no longer surviving unfortunately, although the city, a World Heritage site, is celebrating its 850th anniversary this year amid much fine late medieval architecture. In Hamburg I caught the Schleswig Holstein Festival Orchestra giving its most prestigious concert of the festival, under Georg Solti. Brahms was on the programme in his home concert-hall; the Fourth Symphony, robust, confident, no-nonsense music in Solti's hands, which may not be all the symphony had to say when the composer conducted it, although the performance worked well enough as far as it went. The student musicians certainly gave a strong account of themselves, as they had earlier in a trenchant performance of Stravinsky's Petrushka. As an encore Solti and his young orchestra threw in a spectacularly fiery Die Fledermaus Overture. It was a stifling evening, during which musicians and audience had been melting in the heat, but as Solti remarked, 'they played it so well this afternoon, I felt you had to hear it]' The energy did not fail them. Among the new-born festivals of the 1980s, Schleswig Holstein looks to be a healthy survivor, a music festival with youth on its side. Schleswig Holstein Festival continues until August 22. Jointly sponsored by Zentis, Die Gottinger Gruppe and Bahlsen.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Battle fought from behind enemy lines: A look at the union campaign against privatising the Post Office Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union, and his senior colleagues are keen to avoid celebrating over the government's disarray on privatising the Post Office. But sitting round the table at the union's London headquarters yesterday, with their advisers from consultants Lowe Bell, they were looking back with satisfaction on the most effective and professional campaign by a British union for a long time. 'We could have followed the traditional way of opposition - handing out leaflets, holding protest meetings, going on marches, threatening strikes and setting up a sub-committee of the committed. It would have been amateur hour,' Mr Johnson said. The union dispatched stickers, leaflets, balloons and cards as well as handing in a petition to Downing Street with 1.75m signatures but recognised this would not be enough. 'We were determined to win, not organise a glorious defeat,' Mr Johnson said. This meant running a focused, professional campaign not simply to mobilise public opinion but to win over the Conservative heartland and so deprive the government of its slender parliamentary majority. 'We had to cross political frontiers and get behind the enemy lines.' Over the past four months this meant hiring Lowe Bell Political, an arm of the consultants linked closely in the past with the Conservative party machine. Mr Johnson said: 'Working with Lowe Bell has enabled us to get to people we would otherwise would not have been able to do.' It even enabled the union to penetrate Conservative Central Office to take part in a meeting of the Conservative Political Centre. But Lowe Bell's role should not be exaggerated. The union started its anti-privatisation campaign in July 1992 when Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, first decided to review the ownership of the Post Office. Mr Daniel Harris, communications officer, said: 'Public opinion has been against Post Office privatisation from the start. We harnessed an existing sympathetic mood.' Ms Julia Simpson, head of communications, said: 'We have a positive message: to see the highly profitable and popular Post Office stay in the public sector but with new commercial freedom.' The union campaign also set the pace with the help of discontented Post Office managers who have fed the union with a series of embarrassing internal documents to put Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, on the defensive. The union was kept informed by its contacts over the progress of the privatisation plans inside the cabinet committee. In May it was able to exploit knowledge of government hesitations to press the case for a consultative rather than a white paper on the issue. The first taste of success came when union leaders learnt that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had insisted that the union's policy option for the Post Office should be included in Mr Heseltine's green paper. The union has also widened its campaign by forming alliances with Women's Institutes and campaigners for the preservation of rural England. And the union's members, with their unique access to the public, were vital to the campaign. The champagne may still be on ice at union headquarters but it believes the government's problems are due to its own efforts.</p>

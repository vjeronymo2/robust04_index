			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Ruhe gives lift to Polish hope of joining Nato Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, has said Poland could join Nato by the end of the decade, while he sees no prospect of Russia or Ukraine ever doing so. Mr Ruhe's remarks were quoted in the Polish media as he began talks with his French and Polish counterparts on Warsaw's role in the Nato-inspired Partnership For Peace programme. The German minister also said that his country and the US were the only existing Nato members that were enthusiastic about the idea of extending the alliance eastwards, and some members were cool towards the idea. 'Not all countries are in favour of expanding Nato,' he was quoted as saying. Mr Ruhe's comments were in line with the strident declarations of unanimity that were heard in Berlin last week from President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl over east European questions. His remarks were an unusually blunt acknowledgement that, although all candidates are supposed to join PFP on equal terms, not all of them can look forward to full acceptance as a Nato member. Russia, after considerable hesitation, last month became the 20th country to sign up to PFP, a programme that promotes joint military exercises and defence planning. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said at the signing ceremony that the alliance should not alienate Moscow by rushing to incorporate countries to its east. Nato officials hailed the fact that Mr Kozyrev did not unequivocally denounce the notion of expansion. However, Russian sensitivity over the strategic orientation of Poland remains extremely high. Moscow has made it clear that it feels unhappy about its former east European 'satellites' being admitted to any arrangement from which Russia itself is barred. Mr Ruhe's comments follow a vote in the US Senate to facilitate the transfer of surplus western defence equipment to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The resolution, approved by 76-22, was intended by its sponsors to accelerate the process of making the arsenals of those three countries compatible with Nato equipment. It has already drawn a complaint from Slovakia that distinctions are being drawn between central European countries in a way that could undermine stability. Senator Hank Brown, one of the amendment's sponsors, said it was intended to ensure that 'reasserting control over Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will no longer be considered viable by anyone in Russia'. Opponents of the measure argued that, by singling out three countries, it would create jealousies within eastern Europe and foster nationalist forces in other countries. In Warsaw, Mr Ruhe said Russia would have no influence on Poland's eligibility for Nato membership. Poland has been the keenest of the east European countries to take advantage of the PFP, and it will host the PFP's first full-blown military exercise in September. Poland has also held a series of bilateral war games with west European countries and, in October, it will send troops to France for a training exercise with the French and German armies. Warsaw has also asked to join the Franco-German Eurocorps, the Strasbourg-based unit seen by its supporters as the core of a mobile European land army. This proposal has so far been treated with caution in western capitals and it is likely to be viewed with deep alarm in Moscow. Senator Brown said his resolution had been supported by such veterans of the US foreign establishment, and advocates of a tough line with Russia, as Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski and Mr Henry Kissinger. Mr Brzezinski has called for the formation of a 'common security area' grouping France, Germany and Poland.</p>

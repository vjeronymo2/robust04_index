They were handling so much sterling daily that one gang  leader employed four people full-time simply to count it, said  Mr Neil Dickens, who recently returned from a trip to Holland.    Specialising in amphetamines, LSD, cannabis and cocaine,  Dutch gangs act as wholesalers to British dealers.    "If drug distributors in the UK paid 1 billion pounds for  their source of supply, one can begin to estimate the value of  crime committed to finance the purchase of those drugs on the  streets," he said.    Mr Dickens said the threat from foreign gangs expanding into  markets in this country was one the police service, with its  locally-directed constabulary system, was illequipped to meet.    He told chief constables at Bramshill police staff college  in  Hampshire a national detective force should be created.    "A national structure would provide experienced senior  managers to ensure the international work is undertaken in an  appropriate manner," he said.    Mr Dickens said the seven regional squads and the Scottish  Crime Squad should be amalgamated into a National Crime Squad  with central funding.    "Each region designs its own objectives, business plan,  quality of service, or strategy, which in my view now needs to  be more centrally directed to address the major criminal who  knows no boundaries," he said.    "It is perhaps understandable that individual squads, whilst  to a certain extent recognising themselves in a national  structure, remain parochial and self-interested concerning their  activities.    "Teams of officers are often travelling the length and  breadth of the country to undertake surveillance when RCS  (regional crime squad) colleagues from that target area could  more costeffectively undertake the work."    A national structure would provided a single reference point  for strategic planning the update of information technology,  technical surveillance and training.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: GM to restrict price increases GENERAL Motors plans to hold back US price increases in the 1994 model year in an attempt to win back market share. The company, in the throes of a restructuring to return loss-making North American operations to profit, said that in the model year starting in October, it would expand the 'value pricing' marketing idea it initiated in 1993. This involves dropping the price of certain models of vehicles equipped with popular levels of optional equipment. The idea is to lift sales and run GM's factories closer to capacity, to raise profits. Mr Michael Losh, a GM vice-president, said value pricing had been a factor behind the resurgence of GM's North American sales this year. The company's share of the US passenger car market fell sharply late last calendar year, to less than 31 per cent, when it cut back sharply on unprofitable sales to fleet buyers. It has recovered this year and for June totalled 37.1 per cent, compared with 36.7 per cent a year earlier, but for the first half of 1993 it was down a point on 1992, at 35.3 per cent. The recovery has been due to value pricing and because Japanese competitors, hurt by a strong yen, have been increasing their prices further. Mr Losh said that in the 1994 model year, GM's prices would rise by 1.5 per cent, even though they were fitted with additional equipment. Truck prices would rise by 2.2 per cent and the average price for GM vehicles would go up about 1.8 per cent.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Virgin steps up challenge to BA MR RICHARD BRANSON'S Virgin Atlantic Airways is stepping up its challenge to British Airways and launching a new service from London's Heathrow Airport to New York's Newark Airport. The service is expected to start at the end of next month. Mr Branson, who is still seeking compensation from BA for the commercial damage he claims his airline suffered from BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign, is expected to announce the start of the new service when he opens Virgin's new Pounds 1m passenger lounge at Heathrow next week. Virgin will switch its present Newark service from London's Gatwick airport to Heathrow because the airline has secured necessary take-off and landing slots at the bigger airport. Mr Branson said the service would enable Virgin to compete directly against BA on the Newark route out of Heathrow. The Virgin chairman said yesterday the airline planned to resume a separate service from Gatwick to Newark next year, when it expects to receive new aircraft to increase the size of its fleet. Virgin is in advanced talks with the European Airbus consortium to acquire four A340 long-range jets with an option for an extra one. It is also negotiating with Boeing to acquire a 747-400 jumbo with options for the Boeing 777 twin engine widebodied airliner. The Newark service will bring to four the long haul destinations served by Virgin from Heathrow. The airline already operates to Los Angeles, New York's JFK airport and Tokyo. It plans to start additional services to San Francisco and Johannesburg from Heathrow later this year if it can secure the necessary slots. Lex, Page 18, Profits fall, Page 19</p>

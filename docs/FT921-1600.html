			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (23): Not just executive toys LEADERSHIP AND THE COMPUTER by Mary E Boone Prima Publishing Dollars 24.95, 397 pages AUTHOR Mary E Boone was about to speak at an executive breakfast meeting in Albuquerque. As the clatter of knives and plates died down the person introducing her said: 'Ms Boone will talk to us today about executive computing, a term many of us have long considered to be an oxymoron - sort of like airline cuisine.' Almost all surveys of senior managers show that they feel intimidated by personal computers. Some PCs gracing executive desktops are only there for show. Those that are switched on are often used as little more than glorified typewriters. Boone, a specialist on executive use of information systems and a partner in a Connecticut management consultancy, sets out to expose the myths and realities about executive computing and to argue that a desktop PC can give a chief executive a competitive edge. Her book is built around interviews with 16 senior US executives who use PCs, exploring what they use them for and how computers help them. Among those profiled are Burnell Roberts of Mead Corporation, who consults a worldwide corporate contact database before leaving town; Thomas Plaskett, who used a word processor to try and improve morale at Pan Am, the (now defunct) airline; and Debbi Fields, who devised an expert system to help employees make key decisions at her 600-plus Mrs Field's Cookies shops. 'Without (my computer), I don't know how I'd function . . . I'd feel totally disconnected,' Field says. The book suggests that computers can help executives in six basic areas: leveraging time, communicating, coaching, staying well informed, enhancing personal thinking, and shaping corporate culture. If these executives consider computers so critical, why do more not use them? 'Myths abound as to why executives are reluctant to personally use computers,' says the author. Common misconceptions are that executives will not type, or that adequate support staff makes computers unnecessary. 'But the real reason executives don't use computers,' says Boone, 'is that 99 per cent of top executives simply do not know what computers can do for them personally. They have no idea of the power of the computer as a leadership tool.' In spite of their enthusiasm, most of her interviewees seem to be using their desktops for fairly basic tasks: electronic mail, letter and speech writing, building internal databases and contact lists, tapping into and monitoring corporate financial data, pondering What If? scenarios on a spreadsheet and checking spelling. The book is readable and the interviews which make up the first half are mostly interesting. The second half is analytical. This is a book about management rather than computers - physical hardware is hardly mentioned. Above all it is a book with a mission to persuade, and the author is refreshingly honest about that.</p>

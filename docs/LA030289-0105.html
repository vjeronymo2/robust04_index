			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  4 RESERVOIRS PICKED FOR HISTORIC STATUS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission has declared the Silver Lake,  Ivanhoe and Upper and Lower Hollywood reservoirs cultural historic monuments.  The designation, which must be ratified by the City Council, was requested by  Councilman Michael Woo in an attempt to protect the reservoirs from city  Department of Water and Power plans to cover Ivanhoe and Upper Hollywood, while  constructing filtration plants for Silver Lake and Lower Hollywood. Nearby  residents object to the plans.  </P> <P> "Much of the history of Los Angeles is tied in with water and these reservoirs  were among the originals," Woo said. Duane Georgeson, the utility's assistant  general manager, said the reservoirs could still be covered if necessary to  meet federal water standards. But Woo said monument status could delay  construction for up to a year while more aesthetic alternatives were  considered. The Silver Lake and Ivanhoe reservoirs were built in 1906. Lower  Hollywood was built in 1924 and Upper Hollywood in 1933.  </P></p>

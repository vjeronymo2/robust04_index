			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Government advert spending probed The government's spending watchdog is to be asked to investigate allegations that the Department for Education has 'misused' public funds in advertising its policies. Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour chairman of the Commons' public accounts committee, said he would ask the National Audit Office to investigate spending on publicity at the department following a complaint from Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary. Mrs Taylor says the department's annual expenditure on advertising has risen from Pounds 103,800 in 1979-80 to Pounds 8.9m in 1991-92.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> 19 SEIZED IN CLINIC PROTEST  </P> <P> Singing "Jesus Loves the Little Children," 19 demonstrators were arrested after  blocking access to a private abortion clinic in Ventura. Organizers of the  demonstration -- the first such protest in Ventura County -- said its timing  was incidental to the U.S. Supreme Court decision this week allowing states to  bar publicly funded abortions. "Our purpose is to lay our bodies down to rescue  the babies scheduled to be murdered today," said Jill Craft, a spokeswoman for  Operation Rescue. The demonstrators sat in the doorway and along the corridor  outside Family Planning Associates Medical Group as employees of the private  clinic were arriving for work. With the clinic effectively shut, patients and  staff members milled around in the parking lot. Also held back were 10 clinic  security guards, who were warned by police not to attempt to open the doors or  escort patients inside for fear they might inflame the crowd. "This is  Ventura," said Lt. Pat Rooney, "and we're going to keep the peace."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the Swiss referendum on a transit ban for  trucks, the majority of the Swiss and the required majority of  cantons came out in favor of such a ban. Thirteen full and six  half cantons accepted the referendum, which corresponds to 16  "canton votes" and, thus, a clear "yes" to the ban. A total of  52 percent of the Swiss voted for the referendum.    Up until now, Switzerland has had a 28-tonne limit for  trucks  and a ban on night driving. The transit traffic ban says that  as of 2004, goods may be transported through Switzerland only by  train and that no new roads through the Alps may be built.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / The activist and the tycoon in tussle for South Korea presidency: Two very different sons of the nation want to be the first opposition candidate to win office WHILE Mr Kim Dae-jung was being imprisoned by South Korea's former military dictatorship, Mr Chung Ju-yung was building the country's largest corporate empire with the help of subsidised government loans. Now both want to become the first opposition candidate to win the presidency. In spite of their contrasting backgrounds, their platforms for the December 18 elections are strikingly similar, especially on opening up the flagging economy. Mr Kim, the 67-year-old democracy campaigner, has his best chance of gaining the prize he sought in 1971 and 1987. He was repeatedly jailed and exiled during three decades of struggle against the military regime. He survived assassination attempts, was kidnapped from Japan by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency in 1973 and had a death sentence commuted at the last minute in 1981. His fate in the elections depends largely on the number of votes captured from the government by the populist, Ross Perot-style campaign of Mr Chung, founder of the Hyundai industrial group. The gruff 77-year-old, who rises at 3am each day and walks to work surrounded by a gaggle of his sons, is a former construction worker and truck driver who built Hyundai over some 45 years into Korea's biggest chaebol, or family-owned conglomerate. He entered politics last year in frustration at attempts by the government to restrict the activities of groups such as his. Mr Chung's gain in popularity has raised the possibility that he could win enough votes from Mr Kim Young-sam, the ruling party candidate, to give victory to Mr Kim Dae-jung. There is even speculation that Mr Chung could win. Mr Kim Dae-jung is taking two views of the official investigation launched this week of alleged secret funding by Hyundai of the United People's Party  -charges which Hyundai and the UPP deny. On the one hand, he is dismissive of Mr Chung's candidacy. In an interview on his campaign bus, he said Mr Chung's career had not contributed to the development of democracy and that his candidacy had corrupted politics. Mr Chung, he said, 'has not been able to distinguish between the corporation and politics'. 'He is using all his employees and even his subcontractors as party members . . . . He is promoting money politics in the election.' But Mr Kim is also calling for fairness in the supervision of the elections. He says the ruling Democratic Liberal party is also guilty of violations and that the government probe is a biased attempt to prevent him from winning. The government insists it is neutral. Though there are similarities between the platforms of the three main candidates - they all promise deregulation of the economy to boost flagging growth - Mr Kim Dae-jung is emphasising improvements in social welfare and a reduction of regional divisions within South Korea, as well as improving the popular image of bickering, ineffective politicians. He says he would offer 10 out of 26 ministerial positions to the other main parties. He wants a phased, peaceful re-unification with North Korea and sees foreign policy continuing to be based on a close relationship with the US, with Washington remaining as the stabilising influence in east Asia. Mr Kim suffers from a perception among voters that he is too old a face and, because of his struggles with the military, that he has radical anti-establishment views. This is despite attempts to re-model his image and his clear espousal of free-market economic policies. He argues that his close association with the trade union movement would help him reduce the industrial strife which has convulsed Korean industry since democratic reforms five years ago. By contrast, Mr Chung's non-political career and his success in business appear to be winning him votes. To many Koreans, he personifies the country's rags-to-riches story. Because of his huge fortune - he says it is Dollars 4bn - they feel that he is unlikely to become enmeshed in the corruption which pervades Korea's political system. Calling himself the 'economic president', Mr Chung strikes a chord with his promises of very rapid economic growth, low inflation, projects to improve infrastructure, low housing rents and rapid deregulation. 'I would like to reduce government control and leave everything in the hands of the marketplace,' he said in an interview. Perhaps what is most surprising, he plans to eliminate the economic system on the back of which he and Hyundai prospered. He would stop cheap loans to the chaebol and break them into more autonomous units to achieve greater efficiency. 'When the country was small, we needed to combine together to compete against larger companies. Now we need to break them up in order to achieve international competitiveness.' Mr Kim Dae-jung, like many politicians, dismisses Mr Chung's rough-and-ready prescriptions and bold promises as 'baseless'. But there is no doubt that they are exciting voters who profess disillusionment with the political process and yearn for strong leadership. If one of the opposition candidates wins, his challenge will be not only to spearhead economic development, but also to build greater faith in democracy.</p>

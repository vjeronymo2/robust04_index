			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Arts: 'Assassins' on song FIRST, the very good news. The Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden has re-opened and looks immaculate. This is the second theatre in London's West End to emerge from refurbishment in the last few weeks. The other is the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus, which will concentrate on bringing the best of the London fringe to the centre of the capital. Donmar, which seats only around 250 people, will spread its net wider. Under the artistic direction of Sam Mendes, it will maintain informal links with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, and will also bring in other comapnies, domestic and foreign. To have two theatres resurfacing in central London at a time of prolonged economic depression is a gratifying sign of evolution: the West End is adapting to the need for smaller places with better shows. The only slightly less good news is that Assassins, the musical by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman, is not at all the disaster that that some New York critics suggested. One can see why it flopped off-Broadway last year. Since the subject is the tendency of Americans to try to assassinate their President in the name of liberty, it was perhaps tactless to put it on during the first week of the Gulf War when patriotism was at its height. Assassins remains a macabre piece even in peacetime, but it does have merits. For a start, it is a considerably better musical than (say) Kiss of the Spider Woman. The music is distinctive and disciplined; the words are meant to be heard and make sense. This is a cerebral show, not an expensive B-movie. The theme beneath the subject is clever. It is that over time there have been a lot of assassination attempts on American Presidents, some successful, some not. Is there something in the American idea of freedom that includes, even invites, the freedom to shoot the President? And what is it that binds this band of would-be assassins? Certainly there is not much in the conspiracy theory. John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated President Lincoln, was an actor. Initially he was part of a small conspiratorial group, but in the end he acted alone. And so it went on; subsequent assassins had scarcely the suspicion of a group behind them. Even Lee Harvey Oswald, who shot President Kennedy, seems after manifold investigations to have been a loner. John Hinckley, who tried to kill President Reagan, had previously thought of having a go at President Carter and Senator Edward Kennedy. He was trying to impress the actress Jodie Foster, whose movie Taxi Driver he had seen 15 times. Assassins goes through the lot of them. The unifying idea is that trying to shoot the President is a way of drawing attention to yourself. 'Murder is small', says one of them: assassination puts you in the history books. Among the best episodes is Charles Guiteau who wanted to be ambassador to France under President Garfield. When the President ignored him, Guiteau shot him. In the musical, Guiteau (Henry Goodman), who had an evangelical bent, climbs to the gallows singing a wonderfully cheerful song about looking on the bright side and 'I'm going to the Lordy'. There is also Samuel Byck (Ciaran Hinds) who planned to incinerate President Nixon by crashing a jumbo jet on the White House. 'It's going to make the news,' he tells Leonard Bernstein in a marvellous telephone call. One could go on. It is all very American, down to the inevitable where were you on the day that Kennedy died, and full of musical in-jokes. But what's wrong with that? Sam Mendes directs; the musical director is Jeremy Sams. Who could ask for more - or at least much more? Donmar Warehouse until January 9. (071) 867 1150</p>

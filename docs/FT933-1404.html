			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Complex case sparks conflicts of interest THE INVESTIGATION by DTI inspec-tors is just one of many inquiries spurred by one of the most complex corporate collapses to affect the world of insolvency, Andrew Jack writes. Accountants, lawyers and police have been working for up to three years on transactions linking London United Investments, its insurance subsidiaries and other connected businesses. Potential liabilities from the five LUI insurance subsidiaries alone could ultimately exceed Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn), and are already estimated at about Dollars 5bn. LUI entered administration in 1990 owing creditors Pounds 40m. HS Weavers, an underwriting subsidiary of LUI, has since been wound up and CR Driver, another underwriter founded by a director of LUI, is in liquidation. Five LUI subsidiaries, Kingscroft, Walbrook, El Paso, Lime Street and Mutual Reinsurance, known collectively as Kwelm, are now in provisional liquidation under the control of accountants at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. A proposed scheme of arrangement with creditors was announced earlier this month. Pay-outs to creditors will largely depend on the final size of claims against insurance policies issued by the companies before they collapsed. Claims are likely to be received for many years to come. Some money may be generated by litigation. Proceedings have begun against the Graham Smith network of companies in Germany and Liechtenstein alleged to have received money from Driver and Weavers, as well as against the auditors and directors of LUI, and the auditors of Weavers. Related freezing orders for up to SFr111m (Pounds 50.6m) have been brought in connection with the money removed, and these are currently on appeal in the Liechtenstein courts. There are enormous potential conflicts of interest in the LUI insolvency, because all the larger accountancy firms to which the insolvency practitioners belong are also creditors as a result of claims on professional indemnity policies they bought in the past from companies in the group. In its conclusions, the DTI report called for the inclusion in reinsurance treaties of clauses dealing with commissions and detailing brokerage fees. The report is not the first to consider the affairs of the group. Mr John Dingell, a US congressman, published a report in 1990 which covered aspects of the LUI affair as part of an investigation into the collapse of several failed insurance companies in the US.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index breaks through the 3,400 mark - Market Report The squeeze on marketmakers in a London stock market now convinced that the new year will feature low interest rates and inflation sent share prices racing to new peaks yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index broke through 3,400 briefly before closing a net 40.8 points ahead on the session at 3,396.5. The action started early, with the stock market moving up on its own initiative, without waiting for the stock index futures market to open. But the March contract on the Footsie added fuel to the fire, showing a substantial premium to cash in early deals, and the initial gain of 18 points on the Footsie was quickly extended to more than 30 points. Equities were responding to signs that the buying programme operated by a Swiss investment house on Wednesday night was taking effect. Another Swiss house followed suit yesterday afternoon in the cash market. Marketmaking firms are now gripped in a vice. They cannot refuse to sell stock to the big institutions, but they soon find that hardly anyone will sell stock to them when they need it for delivery. Yesterday, with the extended Christmas holiday ahead, some dealers were willing to pay substantial premiums for stock, thereby pouring oil on the flames of their own bonfire. The squeeze among the second line issues was even stronger than on those in the FT-SE 100 list. At 3,762.8, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 35.8 points higher on the day. Overall Seaq volume rose to 885.2m shares. But 16 per cent of this total came from very low priced dealings in nil-paid stocks. On Wednesday, 779.2m shares traded through Seaq for a retail worth of Pounds 1.56bn. Among the best-favoured sectors were the media stocks, where Reuters rose strongly on hints that an important deal was pending in the US. Hotel shares, which suffered badly during the downturn in global tourist and consumer markets, moved sharply higher as investors struggled to get hold of stock. Oil shares, having been held back over the past month by weakness in crude oil prices, were helped by the better performance of the sector on Wall Street. The New York market was up by a further 8 Dow points in UK hours yesterday, and US interest added to the day's gains in oil issues in London. Financial shares had a more mixed session as some profits were taken in sectors showing substantial gains over the past month and also over the year as a whole. But dealers stressed that across the range of the market, investors were more inclined to let profits run into what is expected to be a successful new year than to take quick profits at this stage. Among the more bullish of the market strategists, Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura predicted yesterday that the Footsie will reach 3,700 by the end of January. He identifies further increases in cash at the US mutual funds which, he says, are increasingly attracted to the UK as a useful and lucrative 'dumping ground' for cash. The equity market was also helped by firmness in UK government bonds, reflecting general confidence that inflation and interest rates will be kept low next year. Short-dated bonds remained steady, while at the longer end, prices gained just over half a point, bringing yields down to around 6.45 per cent on these issues.</p>

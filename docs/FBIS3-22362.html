As a result, an area half the size of the Saarland has  been left devastated. Radioactivity from the former pits in the  ore mining area in Saxony and Thuringia is posing a massive  threat to drinking water supplies in eastern Germany.    Let us take Koenigstein, for example. Wismut GmbH mining  specialists and engineers believe that the uranium, which is  readily soluble, would have to be "flushed out" of the rock  before the Koenigstein mine, which is situated in the Elbe  sandstone range, is closed down and flooded. This, they say,  would be the only way to prevent radioactive substances from  finding their way into the environment in the distant future.  However, Saxony's Environment Ministry in Dresden, which has to  license reclamation methods, fears that this in itself could  contaminate a major groundwater stratum from which a million  people in the Dresden and Pirna area draw their drinking water.    What is going on in the pit whose closure could have a  serious impact on the population's living standards?  Koenigstein is one of the four mines from which the Wismut  Soviet-German Joint-Stock Corporation (SDAG) extracted uranium  for decades without regard to the damage inflicted on the  environment and the health hazards to which it exposed the  population. Processing plants then turned it into "yellow  cake," the raw material for the fuel elements used in east  German and Soviet nuclear power stations and Moscow's atom bomb  industry after the war.    The Federal Trade and Federal Environment ministries  discontinued uranium mining after the unification of Germany on  grounds of unprofitability. The SDAG was converted from a  mining and production corporation into a reclamation firm,  Wismut GmbH, and is now responsible for freeing the uranium  mining area of "pollutants, soil, waterway, and air  contamination, and other environmental hazards present on the  operating site and in the real estate pertaining thereto."    "Actually, Koenigstein is just a small part of this  comprehensive eco-repair operation, albeit a particularly  delicate one," says Stephanie Hurst of Saxony's Environment  Ministry in Dresden. Indeed, in order to dissolve the uranium  out of the rock, the SDAG, in its day, had forced hundreds of  thousands of cubic meters of dilute sulfuric acid 300 meters  down into the uranium-bearing seam, which is about 20 meters  thick. In order to increase the working surface for the acid  solution, the rock was divided and blasted into blocks measuring  about 80 by 80 meters by a height of -- depending on the uranium  content and the characteristics of the rock -- 5 to 20 meters  prior to "leaching," as mining specialists call this method of  mining. "Pillars" were inserted between the blocks to support  the "pits." The liquor containing the uranium was collected by  a drainage system and pumped to the surface, where the uranium  was extracted.    There were 750,000 cubic meters of dilute sulfuric acid  circulating between the leaching zone and the processing plant.  There are currently about 1 million cubic meters of leaching  fluid in the pores and crevices of the whole mined area of the  Koenigstein pit, where it is still producing its effect.    The people in charge at Wismut intend to flood Koenigstein  as  well, like most closed mines. This means switching off the  high-power pumps that keep the underground shafts and tunnels  free of water seeping in from the neighboring rock. The mine  then "drowns," as the mining specialists put it.    Flooding the Koenigstein pit will entail hazards that cannot  yet be assessed, as the groundwater bearing stratum that  provides Dresden and Pirna with their drinking water is only  just above the stratum from which the miners have extracted  uranium. It is true that the water bearing stratum is separated  from the mined cavities by a 20-meter thick, water-retaining,  argilliferous sandstone stratum. However, the flood water from  the mine, which would be contaminated with radionuclides and  other pollutants, could find its way into the drinking water and  contaminate it either via the mine shafts and bores or via  naturally occurring crevices and faults in the rock.    "An increase in the quantity of radioactive substances in  the  drinking and household water means a rise in the cancer and  leukemia risk to the population," warns Munich radiobiologist  Edmund Lengfelder, who is studying the impact of uranium mining  in Saxony and Thuringia on health. This hazard would be reduced  by keeping the mine "open." "But that would cost us 15 to 20  million German marks a year," explains Rudolf Daenecke, who is  in charge of the reclamation work at Wismut GmbH. This is what  the electricity to power the pumps and technical measures, such  as ventilating the underground cavities, would cost.    First of all, Wismut GmbH did something that provoked  accusations of fraud: After the cessation of mining work as of  1 January 1991, it blasted a number of blocks of stone in the  mine, which it intends to leach using the previous mining method  to flush out the pollutants. The uranium will even be processed  into yellow cake and sold through EURATOM [European Atomic  Energy Community]. Wismut claims that the profit will be spent  on the reclamation project.</p>

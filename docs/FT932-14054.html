			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Brazilian voters expected to opt for presidents and reject kings BRAZILIAN voters are expected to reaffirm the country's presidential system of government in a binding plebiscite today. The result should signal the unofficial start of the 1994 presidential campaign, making President Itamar Franco 'a premature lame duck', in the words of one political analyst. Opinion polls have shown that 55-60 per cent of voters favour keeping a presidential system, while less than 30 per cent appear to prefer parliamentary rule. Voters will also be asked to choose between a republic and a monarchy. Polls show the republican option likely to take more than 60 per cent of the vote. Voters are showing little enthusiasm for the plebiscite. The Ibope polling firm reported 52 per cent not understanding why they are being asked to vote, and that 65 per cent would prefer not to. A study by the electoral court predicted up to 15 per cent abstentions (10 per cent being usual), although voting is mandatory for Brazil's 90m electors. The plebiscite is required by the 1988 constitution. Pro-parliamentary and pro-monarchy legislators sought it after the assembly re-writing the constitution voted for a presidential republic. The plebiscite was moved forward from September because pro-parliamentary legislators successfully argued that a later vote would be coloured by the 1994 presidential race. Brazilians are more concerned with the country's dismal economic outlook and its social problems. Inflation is at 27 per cent a month and unemployment in March grew to 15.8 per cent in greater Sao Paulo, the country's industrial hub, according to Dieese, a labour-supported think-tank. Attacks on the Franco administration by potential presidential candidates are expected to increase after the plebiscite. Polls show front-runners for the presidency, to be contested in late-1994, to be Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the left-winger who was runner-up to Mr Fernando Collor, Mr Franco's disgraced predecessor, in 1989, and Mr Paulo Maluf, the conservative mayor of Sao Paulo city. A strong centrist candidate, perhaps from the pro-parliamentary coalition, is likely to emerge. 'The campaign has already begun,' said Mr Eduardo Graeff, a political scientist at the Institute of Social Research in Sao Paulo. The presidential campaign will influence the overall revision of the constitution, due to begin in October as mandated by the charter itself. The revision will determine important issues of foreign investment rules and privatisation of the telecommunications and petroleum sectors, and tackle such inhibitors of fiscal stability as public employee job stability and federal revenue-sharing with states and cities. Some politicians hope to postpone the revision until after the new president has taken office in 1995, but most analysts expect Congress to begin the revision on schedule.</p>

Laar, answering a question by opposition Centrist Party MP  Andra Veidemann before the parliament today said that the  shortcomings discovered had been "not essential" and that they  by no means negatively affected the combat effectiveness of the  weapons. Laar said the faults in some cases, for instance, were  just that a gun was having no bayonet or clip, or that plastic  bottles and oilcan corks were partly missing.    "Those who claim that Estonia bought 60 million dollars  worth  of weapons that cannot be used are lying. None of the  shortcomings discovered make it impossible to take the weapons  into use," the premier said.    Laar said the supplier, the Israeli company TAAS, was to  deliver the missing parts in the near future.    Coalition Party deputy leader and deputy head of the  parliament's defense commission Peeter Lorents in his comments  said he had seldom heard "such a brassy lie." He said the  shortcomings discovered had been of much more serious character.  For instance, none of the Israeli light mines tested in Estonia  had properly worked, and a grenade shot from a antitank gun had  fallen 1.5 meters lower than what was shown in product  specifications.    The prime minister after Lorents' remarks said the MP should  politely bring his apologies and choose his words in the future,  and warned that in the opposite case legal action could be taken  against him.    Centrist MP Olav Anton in his comments on Laar's explanation  of the issue said "such kind of foggy talk the prime minister  should use with his defense minister, who has not served in the  army."    Opposition has also alleged that the old 23-millimeter  anti-aircraft guns, found to be substandard by Estonian experts,  were part of the arms deal and not simply a gift as was claimed  later.    Israel's national company TAAS at the end of January brought  as a gift to Estonia more than 20 million kroons worth of trophy  weapons seized in its wars with the Soviet-backed Arab  countries. The shipment included 23-millimeter Soviet-made  guns, as well as RPD and PKT machine guns.    The prime minister today reasserted his claim that the  shipment was a gift and stood apart from the arms deal. "The  Israeli party feels the responsibility to bring into order the  consignment delivered by it to Estonia," Laar said.    MP Juri Toomepuu claims he has seen the text of the  agreement  signed between Estonia and the Israeli company and that the  document defines 23-millimeter guns as part of the deal.    Kuno Raude, chairman of the Rural Union party, in his  remarks  said that "each country has its honor and dignity, and in this  case Estonia has been cheated."</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. JOINS EMPLOYEES' SUIT ON NORTHROP MX CHARGES  </P> <P> The Justice Department has intervened in a civil fraud suit against Northrop  Corp. that alleges overcharges on MX missile equipment, according to federal  sources and private attorneys.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon issued an order late Thursday unsealing the  Justice Department's amended complaint in the lawsuit, originally filed two  years ago.  </P> <P> Due to a variety of bureaucratic snafus, the Justice Department complaint was  not available Friday, but reliable sources said the department had intervened  in the case on three issues: The department is alleging that there was some  overcharges on MX contracts, improper use of unauthorized testing equipment and  unapproved use of subcontractors.  </P> <P> The Justice Department complaint against the Los Angeles aerospace company is  less extensive than the original suit brought under the federal False Claims  Act by two former Northrop employees, David Peterson and Jeff Kroll.  </P> <P> In June, 1987, Peterson testified before Congress that Northrop instituted  several shell companies to circumvent its normally labyrinthine procurement  system and speed the MX project. Northrop has acknowledged setting up a  separate company to buy parts but has contended its actions fell within  Pentagon guidelines.  </P> <P> Herbert Hafif, a Claremont attorney representing Peterson and Kroll, said the  Justice Department's decision to intervene means that Northrop has "a very  serious problem."  </P> <P> Northrop spokesman Greg Waskul declined to comment on the Justice Department  complaint, saying that the company had not been served yet. However, he said  that the suit doesn't "deal with an issue of quality" of the company's work on  the MX.  </P> <P> "The reliability and accuracy of the parts made for the MX by Northrop continue  to be better than planned, as has been the case throughout the program," he  said.  </P> <P> The Times reported on Sept. 9 that congressional sources said Northrop is under  federal investigation for building a $1.2-million machine to test a key  component of the MX missile guidance system and for billing the government for  the expense even though the Air Force had not given prior authorization for the  equipment. The charges reportedly are the focus of criminal and civil  investigations being conducted by Justice Department officials in connection  with a broader probe of Northrop's activities in the MX missile guidance  program.  </P> <P> The machine in question, called a dry integration test station, is intended to  assess all parts of the guidance system component before it is fully assembled.  The guidance device, called an inertial measurement unit, is the size of a  basketball and is designed to float in a special fluid.  </P> <P> Justice Department lawyers tried to persuade Judge Kenyon to keep the civil  suit under seal until the criminal probe has been completed, but they were  unsuccessful, according to sources close to the case. However, Kenyon's order  unsealing the case prohibits any discovery proceedings by lawyers on the dry  integration station for 60 days.  </P> <P> Under the False Claims Act, the Justice Department has 60 days to tell a  federal district court whether it wants to join in litigation brought by  whistle-blowers, such as Peterson and Kroll. In some instances, the department  can gain an extension, and it got a lengthy one in this case. The  whistle-blower can garner between 15% and 25% of any damages recovered in a  suit of this kind if the Justice Department intervenes.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Romania, together with eight other Central and  Eastern European countries, yesterday became an associate member  of the Western European Union [WEU]. In accordance with the new  statute, which is included in the political document adopted at  the meeting of the Ministerial Council of the Union that took  place in Luxembourg, these nine associate members will regularly  participate in the meetings of the Council, will be able to  attend meetings of certain working groups of the organization,  and will have a permanent connection with the central planning  body of the WEU in Brussels.    Similarly, according to reports by our correspondent Andrei  Barsan, the countries in Central Europe will be able to  participate in peacekeeping operations or military activities  initiated by the WEU.    Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who attended the  meeting together with Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca,  stressed the importance of yesterday's decision, noting that it  is the first time that an established security structure in  Western Europe is opening up to other countries as well.    Similarly, Melescanu said that for Romania the act of  becoming an associate member of the WEU -- that is, the armed  wing of the European Union and at the same time the European  pillar of NATO -- reflects the steady efforts of the Romanian  Government to achieve integration into all European structures  and recognition of the path traveled by our country, as our  country has recuperated certain arrears in a spectacular way  compared with other countries in the region as far as  integration is concerned.</p>

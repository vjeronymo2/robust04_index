			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP FACES: CASHING IN ON HER NEW-FOUND CAREER  </P> <P> Remember Butterfly McQueen, the black actress who played the baby-voiced slave  in "Gone With the Wind" -- the one who told Miss Scarlett that she knew nothing  about "birthing" babies? That squeaky little voice wasn't one-of-a-kind after  all.  </P> <P> It's alive and well in Michel'le, the 19-year-old soul singer who has the rare  distinction of having her first single, the danceable "No More Lies," ascend to  the Billboard magazine pop Top 10. The single is pulling her debut album,  "Michel'le" -- on Ruthless/Atco Records -- up the pop chart.  </P> <P> On first meeting, it's difficult not to be startled by that voice. "I'm used to  people being surprised at how I talk," said Michel'le (pronounced Mi-shel-AY)  matter-of-factly the other day during a late afternoon snack in Beverly Hills.  "People laugh sometimes. When I'm on stage people laugh when they first hear me  talk. If I'm on the phone, ordering something, people often tell me to have my  mother come to the phone. They don't believe I'm a grown-up."  </P> <P> Isn't this disconcerting -- even painful?  </P> <P> "Not anymore," she admitted. "It's probably helped make me shy. I was always  shy when I was growing up. I didn't have a lot of friends. But when I was about  15, I decided I wasn't going to let the reactions to my voice bother me. Now  I'm not as shy as I used to be. Getting into singing has helped."  </P> <P> Remarkably, her singing voice is totally different -- wide-ranging and  full-bodied. "I can't explain it," she said, flashing a big grin. "A freak of  nature I guess."  </P> <P> About two years ago, Michel'le was working as a department-store cashier with  zero career prospects. Reared in South-Central Los Angeles, she'd been  interested in singing since she was a youngster but only worked at it casually.  </P> <P> "I never thought I could make it big," she admitted. "I was just a cashier. I  didn't want to be just another average person, but all I had was some dreams."  </P> <P> She might still be mired in that mundane existence if, about two years ago, she  hadn't met rap producer Dr. Dre, who produces N.W.A, Eazy-E and J.J. Fad. He  got Michel'le a record deal and produced her album. "I didn't really know I  could sing until I met him," said Michel'le, who also coyly admitted there's  truth to the rumor that she's romantically linked with Dre.  </P> <P> "He's responsible for all this. He convinced me I was a good singer. He urged  me to write songs. He's pushed me. He's guided me. I don't know where I'd be  without him -- probably still a cashier, I guess." DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

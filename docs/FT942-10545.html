			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Prowting land price warning Sharply rising land prices are threatening to undermine returning profitability of housebuilders, Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive of Prowting, warned yesterday. The south of England housebuilder has only just returned to the black making pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.12m during the 12 months to the end of February. This compared with losses of Pounds 4.87m during the previous 12 months. Mr Roydon said that land prices in southern England had risen by an average of 20 per cent in the past year. Much of this increase had occurred since January 1 as builders had begun to spend proceeds from rights issue. Increased land costs could only be justified if house prices were to rise more rapidly. Prowting owned 6,000 housing plots with planning permission equivalent to six years' supply at current rates of building. The company, which last year sold 664 homes at an average price of Pounds 88,000, plans to increase sales to about 1,100 in the current year. Recovery, Mr Roydon stated, had been aided by the acquisition last September, for Pounds 22.6m, of Galliford Homes, which contributed gross profits of Pounds 5.51m from the sale of 284 homes during the second half. Overall gross profits rose from Pounds 6.8m - before exceptional debits of Pounds 4.9m - to Pounds 10.4m as the group's existing housebuilding operations benefited from the housing market recovery. Profits from holiday homes in Portugal rose from Pounds 205,000 to Pounds 278,000 in a difficult market. The absence of provisions, following write-downs of Pounds 4.93m in 1992-93, and lower interest charges of Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 4m) also helped the group's return to pre-tax profits. As promised last September the company is paying a maintained final dividend of 1.7p making a same-again total of 3.4p for the year. This is just covered by earnings per share of 3.5p (7.9p losses). COMMENT Prowting's land bank, including 2,000 plots acquired with Galliford, is in the books at an average cost of Pounds 11,400 per plot, or Pounds 130,000 an acre - a slightly higher price than 12 months ago but enough to provide a more than healthy margin of 17.2 per cent. To replace this land would cost Pounds 250,000 an acre at current prices. Few housebuilders will achieve better margins. The company's virtues, however, are already recognised in a share price which has outperformed the sector by a fifth during the past 12 months. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 9m would put the company on 21 times earnings which is high enough given Prowting's justifiable concerns over the mismatch between land and house price increases.</p>

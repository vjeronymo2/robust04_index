			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 180.407  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the table in paragraph (c), chlorine cargo tanks must be leakage tested annually. These cargo tanks are also required to be pressure tested every two years. Based on a comment, RSPA has extended the frequency for conducting the leakage test to two years to coincide with the pressure test. Certain minor editorial changes are made in paragraph (d)(1)(i) for clarity. Paragraph (e)(1) is revised to clarify that when a particular tank design such as a cargo tank with a lining, coating or internal baffles, precludes an internal visual inspection, the tank must be hydrostatically or pneumatically tested. Paragraph (e)(4), which is duplicative with the requirements in paragraph (f)(3), is removed as proposed in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA proposed to revise paragraph (g)(1)(iv), covering the pressure test of specification cargo tanks for consistency with the proposed changes to &sect;178.346&hyph;10; however, commenters who initially sought this change recommended that the proposal be withdrawn and the current provisions retained. Therefore, no change is made in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(2) is revised to permit the use of the EPA Method 27 vapor tightness test on any cargo tank fitted with a vapor recovery system and used in gasoline or benzene service, as discussed earlier under the preamble discussion to &sect;178.346&hyph;13(c)(2). A commenter suggested that paragraph (h)(2) require the use of oil or soap to detect leaks in cargo tank seams, piping, valves and accessories when performing the Method 27 test. RSPA believes that oil or soap can be very useful in locating leaks, but that it would be an unnecessary burden if required for all Method 27 tests. Accordingly, RSPA has not adopted the suggested change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i) prescribes that the heads and shell of all unlined cargo tanks used for the transportation of materials corrosive to the tank must be thickness tested. Consistent with changes made to &sect;178.345&hyph;1(1)(2) in this final rule, a new paragraph (i)(4)(x) is added to specify that thickness testing must be performed on connecting structures of a carbon steel, self-supporting multi-tank cargo tank motor vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements for continuing qualification and maintenance of cargo tank motor vehicles include periodic measurement of the thickness of heads and shells. This has focused attention on interpretation of specification requirements for minimum thickness, especially of specification MC 306, MC 307, MC 312 cargo tanks and their predecessors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the specifications for MC 306, MC 307 and MC 312 cargo tanks constructed of steel, minimum thickness requirements for heads and shells were expressed in terms of U. S. Standard Gauges for sheet material or, for some MC 312 units where plate material was specified, in terms of fractions of an inch. These data were found at Table I and Table II in specifications for each of the respective types. Although not explicitly stated in the regulatory text, the tabulated values were the minimum nominal sheet and plate sizes permitted for these cargo tanks. For aluminum, values in Table I and Table II were the minimum nominal thickness expressed in decimals. The tolerances on mill thickness and the minimum thickness after forming were not covered. Although major steel purchase orders and steel mill production controls for sheet stock and thin plate are based on specific thicknesses and tolerances rather than on standard gauges, manufacturing tolerances have been established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for standard gauges and plate. For example, ASTM A480/A480M provides general specifications for stainless steels and heat-resisting steel plate, sheet and strip; Tables A1.2 and A1.17 in this specification are of special interest to manufacturers of DOT specification cargo tanks. For MC 307 and MC 312 cargo tanks which were required to be designed and constructed in accordance with the ASME Code, minimum mill undertolerances are set forth in Section VIII, Division 1 at UG&hyph;16(c). The ASME values are more restrictive than those of ASTM A480/A480M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

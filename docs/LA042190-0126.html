			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> INSECTARY'S BUGS TARGET CITRUS PESTS  </P> <P> The 9,000 acres of orange trees surrounding Fillmore and Piru are swarming with  insects -- and that's good news to Monte Carpenter, manager of the Fillmore  Insectary. Servicing the pest-control needs of the 350-member Fillmore Citrus  Protective District, the insectary has raised and released 20 species of  beneficial insects since 1926.  </P> <P> During the past 20 years, Carpenter said, less than 5% of the district's total  acreage has required insecticidal spray. Consequently, some beneficial insects,  such as ladybugs and green lacewings, have stable and abundant populations. The  insectary no longer raises them for release in local groves.  </P> <P> "The cooperation of area growers is what makes it work," Carpenter said. Only  one or two smaller orchards do not belong to the district, which means that one  farmer's beneficial insects are not endangered by the management of his  neighbor's grove.  </P> <P> "Any time you spray for injurious insects, you kill the beneficials as well,"  Carpenter said. Orchards such as those in the San Joaquin Valley "are on a  pesticide treadmill," he added.  </P> <P> With five full-time workers supplemented by two part-time staff members, the  insectary raises two insect predators that feed on red and black scale, the  most prolific citrus pests. About 180 million beneficial insects are released  annually in member orchards. Spraying is reserved for the rare, heavy  infestation that defies biological control. JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / First November snow since 1969 in London Motorists were warned last night to expect more snow after a day in which some roads in Scotland and northern England were blocked. Yesterday's heaviest falls were in the eastern half of Britain, and London had its first November snow since 1969. The heaviest falls, of more than 5mm, were in Lincolnshire, East Anglia and near Ashford in Kent. Today's falls are expected to be lighter and more isolated, but the AA advised motorists to slow down and keep their distance. Main roads were blocked yesterday near Perth and in Kent, and conditions were so bad on part of the A1(M) in County Durham that several vehicles slid off it. The threat of more snow this week has prompted the Meteorological Office to rush forward the long-planned launch of a new way to deliver forecasts to the public - by fax. Today the Met Office introduces Weathercall Fax. It enables anyone with a fax machine to dial up instant copies of the latest charts, graphics and written forecasts. There are estimated to be 1.25m machines in the UK. Callers can select 24-hour and five-day forecasts covering any of 27 local areas, seven regions or the whole country. They can even choose to receive the latest satellite pictures taken from a height of 36,000 km - though these take six minutes to come through with their fine details of swirling cloud systems. The Met Office, based in Bracknell, has been developing its service for three years. 'We're already the largest single provider of information by fax in this country,' said Mr Roger Hunt, sales director. The Met Office, an agency of the Ministry of Defence, has developed Weathercall Fax in partnership with Telephone Information Services, a London company. Forecast, Page 16</p>

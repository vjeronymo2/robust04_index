			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Open letter to Shevardnadze from Brokers Guild and National </F> Union of Free Entrepreneurs of Georgia: "When Entrepreneurs Are  Unfairly Restricted.... An Open Letter to the Head of State of  the Republic of Georgia"]    [Text] The extremely harsh and hostile policy that has been  conducted toward commercial structures lately compels us to  write this open letter to you as the Head of State of the  Republic of Georgia.    At a time when the republic is experiencing an economic  crisis, declining production, inflation, and a declining  standard of living, there are certain state bodies which,  through their unthinking actions, are further aggravating the  situation. They are making decisions whose aim is to restrict  the activity of commercial structures. This can hardly fail to  cause concern among entrepreneurs, most of whom are trying to  help the country improve the economic situation.    Article 10 of the 25 July 1991 Republic of Georgia Law "On  the Principles of Business Activity" states specifically that  the entrepreneur shall be independent in his activity. State  intervention in the entrepreneur's activity is not permitted  except in cases stipulated by laws of the Republic of Georgia.  The state is the guarantor of protection of the rights and  lawful interests of entrepreneurs in Georgia.    Unfortunately, things happen differently in practice. The  entrepreneur is unfairly restricted in his commercial activity,  but the state does not protect him.    In particular, not only has the state failed to create the  necessary elementary conditions for the normal existence and  development of business activity, conditions such as  communications, swift and reliable banking transactions,  supplies of electricity, functioning transportation, protection  against criminal elements, and so on, but in fact has, through  frequent unlawful intervention by its official agencies,  actually harmed entrepreneurs.    On 26 March 1993, the National Bank of the Republic of  Georgia made a decision which prohibits the sale of cash  currency via cashless transaction. The Caucasian Stock Exchange,  as a law-abiding organization, complied with the requirements of  this document, but it appealed to the Republic of Georgia  Parliament, Cabinet of Ministers, Procuracy, and other bodies to  act to overturn the above-mentioned unlawful decision of the  National Bank, because that decision only served the narrow  interests of the National Bank and the personal interests of  some of its official. Given the rate of hyperinflation, if the  National Bank cannot guarantee swift cashless transactions and  they take several banking days, sales and purchases of currency  via cashless transaction make no sense at all. Add to this the  fact that the National Bank prohibits the removal, for business  needs, of any currency that winds up in a currency account via  cashless transactions (it is permitted only for travel), and it  is clear why entrepreneurs benefit from purchasing currency via  cashless transactions while the National Bank benefits from  prohibiting them. Again, add to this the fact that the volume of  these transactions on the Caucasian Stock Exchange ran as high  as several tens of millions of rubles and several tens of  thousands of dollars as a result of legal trading, and it is  clear that, after it was banned, the state budget and the  Caucasian Stock Exchange lost the chance to earn considerable  income.    Unfortunately, the state has taken a year now to react to  the  considerable damage inflicted on itself and on business  structures, damage which has been caused by the unlawful  decision (No. 2/4, 26 March 1993) of the Board of the National  Bank of the Republic of Georgia. Let us note that according to  the Republic of Georgia General Procurator's 17 May 1993  Representation (No. 7-8 g-1993) on eliminating violations of  laws regulating and licensing currency transactions, the  aforementioned decision by the Board of the National Bank was  ruled unlawful and was to be brought into compliance with the  law within one month, but in vain.    Batono Eduard! We appeal to you in the hope that measures  will be taken and competent bodies will be ordered to study the  issue in greater depth and resolve it on legal principles  reflecting the republic's interests.    We are confident that your intervention will produce  positive  results.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Long-term investors to get 30% of BNP THE FRENCH government plans to reserve 30 per cent of the shares in Banque Nationale de Paris, one of France's largest banks, for long-term investors when the bank is privatised later this month. Union des Assurances de Paris, the powerful insurance group which is scheduled for sale to the public later in the privatisation drive, will take around 15 per cent of BNP's equity. UAP presently holds 10 per cent of BNP which, in turn, plans to take a 20 per cent stake in the insurer after its privatisation. A number of other long-term investors, or noyaux durs shareholders, will take smaller minority stakes of between 0.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent. These investors will have to agree to hold their stakes for at least three years. The French government has long made it clear that it plans to encourage long-term shareholders to participate in the privatisation programme, thereby helping to protect the former state-controlled companies from the rigours of the private sector. The noyaux durs are intended to form strategic alliances with the privatised companies and to ward off the threat of hostile takeovers. Societe Generale, another French bank, mobilised its noyaux durs to protect it against a late 1980s raid by Mr Georges Pebereau, the French financier who is the brother of Mr Michel Pebereau, the BNP chairman. BNP, one of the biggest banks in Europe which recently disclosed net profits of FFr552m (Dollars 97m) on net banking income of FFr21.23bn for the first half of this year, will be the first candidate for sale in the current French government's privatisation drive. The structure of the BNP issue should offer an important indication as to the government's approach to future share sales. The final details of the issue are expected to be announced before the end of this month.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Directors quit Standard after bribe inquiry Two directors of Standard Chartered's bullion arm, Mocatta, one in London and one in Hong Kong, resigned after taking responsibility for the corruption to hit the bank, it emerged yesterday. This followed an investigation into bribes paid by Mocatta employees in exchange for business from junior civil servants at the central banks of both the Philippines and Malaysia. It is a further embarrassment for Standard Chartered, which has built up a reputation for being accident prone. It recently announced the resignation of the managing director of its Hong Kong stockbroking arm, which was found guilty of illegal share support schemes. Standard Chartered said the bribes took place last year, and appropriate action had been taken. A spokesman said: 'We have properly reported our investigation to regulatory authorities, wherever appropriate.' This included Standard Chartered's primary regulator, the Bank of England, Hong Kong's Monetary Authority, and also Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, and the authorities in Manila. A Standard Chartered official said these authorities appeared satisfied with the bank's investigation into the bribery allegations, and it was understood that no further action was likely. The Bank of England launches investigations only where there is a serious and immediate risk to depositors. 'We regard the matter as closed,' the official said. The revelations come at a sensitive time for Anglo-Malaysian relations, which were rocked by more allegations that Wimpey offered bribes to senior Malaysian politicians, in exchange for contracts. A ban on handing out Malaysian government contracts to UK companies still stands. The Malaysian link is also sensitive for Standard Chartered, since it has a substantial presence there, with 35 bank branches. Its south-east Asian operations (excluding Hong Kong), which are primarily focused on Singapore and Malaysia, made profits before bad debt provisions, of Pounds 166m last year. It has three offices in the Philippines. It is understood that the sums involved at Mocatta were relatively small. 'No one is living an extravagant lifestyle as a result,' a Standard Chartered executive said, indicating that the bribes involved a few thousand pounds. He added that the offering of small bribes was regarded as normal business practice in Malaysia and the Philippines. However, Standard Chartered had ensured that this attitude should not apply to its own operations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a news conference, Enrique Iglesias, president of  the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB], said the Venezuelan  crisis is not as serious as has been reported. Following two  working meetings with ministers charged with social issues  portfolios, he noted that President Caldera's government should  control the crisis in the public's perception of the country's  economic problems. He observed that the monetary crisis, for  example, is a key issue. It seems to be following a kind of plot  that engenders a lack of confidence in the current  administration.    Enrique Iglesias explained that other countries have  experienced worse situations and overcome them with fewer  resources. He is therefore "reasonably optimistic" that  Venezuela will be able to "manage the crisis" and overcome  difficulties.    Iglesias praised the government team's economic guidelines.  He believes that the budget and tax policy, in conjunction with  incentives for private investment, are enough to achieve  economic balance. The Finance Ministry is coping effectively  with the core of the problem, which is the fiscal issue, in an  effort to balance the economy. Also, guidelines are being  drafted so that relations between the private sector and the  government will be consistent.    This year, the IDB will invest 50 percent of its funds  earmarked for social projects in Venezuela. This sum is over  $300 million. Regarding IDB conditions for the loans, the IDB  president explained that the feasibility and profitability of  the projects will not be the most important concern but that  each project will be discussed with the head of each ministry.    The resources will be used in three fundamental areas:  health, housing, sanitation, and potable water works. An urban  transportation plan designed to improve the highway  infrastructure in several states of the country is being  contemplated.    The program, which will be cofinanced by the IDB and the  nation's private sector, will have an accompanying plan for  maintaining the country's principal highways.    Overall investment in the health plans will be $300 million,  of which 50 percent will be contributed by the IDB and the other  half by the national government.    Health Minister Carlos Walter, member of the social cabinet,  explained that the money will be used to decentralize medical  services, restructure the Health Ministry, and implement health  education plans. He explained that the resources will not be  used to equip hospitals, as he feels it is necessary first to  restructure the health system in order to improve services.    In this regard, Iglesias added that "before spending," it is  necessary "to improve the impact of what will be spent. This  will be achieved by making the central administration more  efficient."</p>

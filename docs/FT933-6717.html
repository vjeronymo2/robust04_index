			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Bottomley call for last NHS opt-outs THE FEW remaining hospitals that have not opted out of local health authority control were yesterday invited to apply to do so within a month. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said she expected the next wave of applications to 'finish the job' of reforming the National Health Service. 'The complete separation of trusts from health authorities is a long-awaited goal,' she said, though she added that any hospital could 'of course continue to be part of the NHS'. Mrs Bottomley yesterday announced that 145 hospitals and other health units, such as ambulance services, had applied to become trusts in the fourth wave of applications. As a result of the first two waves nearly 300 units are in the hands of self-governing trusts, accounting for two-thirds of the NHS budget. Another 139 - the third wave - are due to become trusts in April. Only 44 units have so far not opted out or applied for trust status. Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, yesterday wrote to the managers of the 44 inviting them to apply for trust status by September 24. Outlining the benefits she believed were offered by the new system, Mrs Bottomley said: 'Trust status provides clarity. It means the unit is able to solve its own problems and have greater autonomy, greater freedom . . . Above all it means improvements for patients.' She said there had been a 7 per cent increase in activity in trust hospitals last year, compared with a 4 per cent increase in directly managed units. Labour reiterated its pledge to 'stop the commercialisation of the health service, and the self-governing nature of the trust hospitals and community facilities'. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'Trusts in themselves are the same hospitals that existed before, but the difference is that they are now run by a self-perpetuating group of people who, once they are appointed, take part in appointing the managers and officers at senior level within the trusts. It's unaccountable to local people, it's undemocratic.' The NHS Support Federation said many trusts were expanding private care at the expense of NHS patients, some closing NHS wards and re-opening them as private wings. Mr Bob Abberley, head of health in the public sector union Unison, which represents half of staff working in the NHS, said: 'The government is pressing ahead despite the mounting evidence of serious financial and managerial problems in many trusts.' Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association council, said: 'I am very disappointed about the government's determination to press on with a system which, despite today's show of con-fidence, is clearly not working. 'Indeed the problem of hospitals running out of money is likely to be even more serious this winter than last.'</p>

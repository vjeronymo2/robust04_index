			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): The problems of dealing with two tax offices I HAVE TO deal with more than one tax office and this has raised several questions. If tax office A asks me, via a standard tax return form, for a full disclosure of my tax affairs and the corresponding certificates of pension contributions, including the income and certificates which I know are required by tax office B, then: (i) Is it up to me to tell A that they are asking for data required by B, not A? (ii) Having made a full and accurate disclosure to A, and received A's acknowledgement, have I any statutory obligation to supply duplicate details to B?. (iii) Do A and B have an obligation to communicate with each other? I have corresponded at length with Somerset House about this, but the only effect is that B keeps issuing joke assessments, bearing no relation to the facts, and I have to plough through their cumbersome appeal procedures. You recently reported that the Revenue has at last had the unoriginal idea of one taxpayer - one tax office, but we have to try to cope with the present attitude that each tax office incommunicado with the others. A great deal of a taxpayer's time can be wasted by inefficient communication between tax offices, and even between sections of a single tax office. (i) It is quite a good idea to make a polite remark in a covering letter, along the lines of 'No doubt you will be forwarding . . . your colleague at B District, under reference. . . . (ii) No (except in rare circumstances). (iii) Yes, failure to do so constitutes maladministration (except in rare circumstances). The circumstances in which a tax inspector 'may make assessment to the best of his judgment' are prescribed in section 29(l)(b&amp;c) of the Taxes Management Act 1970. From what you say, it looks as though the inspector at B District has acted beyond his statutory authority and is in breach of his statutory duty. We suggest that you submit a formal complaint to the District Inspector at B (marking both the envelope and the letter 'For the attention of the District Inspector') briefly recapitulating the relevant facts and dates, and claiming (a) reimbursement of your expenses in ploughing through the appeal procedures necessitated by his having made assessments not authorised by section 29 of the management Act, and (b) compensation for the hassle and annoyance caused by the persistent maladministration within his office. If, by chance, the Inland Revenue do not give you an adequate response, we recommend that (after the new Parliament assembles on April 27) you invite your MP to refer your complaint to the Ombudsman. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

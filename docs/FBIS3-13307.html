According to the 1373 [21 March 1994-20  March 1995] budget bill, the expenditures of government  companies, banks, and for-profit establishments affiliated with  the government will be 56,294 billion rials[R], which makes up  more than 70 percent of the expenditures.    The economic correspondent of RESALAT reports that the  budget  of government companies, banks, and for-profit establishments  affiliated with the government will increase by 59.7 percent  next year. The amount of the budget of government companies next  year is projected at R50,034 billion; for-profit establishments  affiliated with the government, R1,043 billion; and banks,  R5,216 billion.    According to this report, while in next year's budget the  income of government companies and banks has been estimated at  R47,937 billion, these units will have R52,300 billion in  expenditures. In other words, government companies and banks  will spend a total of R4,363 billion beyond their revenues.    Government companies and banks will receive R7,313 billion  in  loans from domestic sources in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995], and only R2,412 billion will be repaid that year.    The national budget next year has been estimated to be  R79,686 billion, of which R36,011 billion is from revenues  gained, including those from oil, taxes, and special and other  revenues.    Of the revenues of the national budget, 27.7 percent is  income from oil; 8.13 percent from taxes; 70 percent from  government companies, banks, and for-profit establishments  affiliated with the government [percentages as published]. It is  noteworthy that those items that have been included twice have  not been deducted from the above-mentioned revenues.    Next year, the government has projected R2,224 billion in  special revenues in its general budget. Due to the procedures  for the collection and payment in this budget, a need for more  control and supervision is felt with regard to them.    The general budget, which was set at R25,425 billion in 1372  [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], will reach R36,011 billion in  1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], with 41.6 percent, which is  about a threefold increase over the final figure in 1371 [21  March 1992-20 March 1993].    Economic experts believe that, considering the failure to  realize the projected oil revenues this year (1372 [21 March  1993-20 March 1994]), the fact that there is no clear picture of  price increases due to the continuing crisis in the world oil  market, the deviation of members from production quotas, and the  likelihood of Iraq's entry into the market, the oil revenues  that have been projected on the basis of $14 per barrel must be  evaluated and examined.    The oil revenues, which in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March  1993]  were in practice R5,133 billion, based on the budget law this  year are set at R15,597 billion. This figure will increase to  22,096 billion for next year.    Economic experts believe that since the tax figures ratified  for 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] have not yet been  obtained, an increase in tax figures, at least within the  existing mechanisms, will face problems with regard to  collection next year. Taxes collected in 1371 [21 March 1992-20  March 1993] amounted to R3,773 billion. This amount was  projected at R5,409 billion , which did not materialize in  practice. In 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], taxes have been  projected at about R6,400 billion.    Next year, from the source of the general revenues, R12,613  billion have been allocated to implementing developmental  expenditures and R21,153 billion to developmental expenditures  [as published], which compared to the funds ratified for this  year (1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]) mark an increase of  30.2 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively. [as published]    The complete elimination of the single foreign currency rate  as a result of setting the foreign currency for basic goods, oil  products, medicine, and defense items at a floating rate and  making up the difference through rial subsidies as well as  changing the rate of tariffs on electricity, oil products, and  telephone are other features of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] budget, which were reported earlier by RESALAT.    It is noteworthy that the government has projected R3,005  billion in subsidies for essential goods, R600 billion in  subsidies for chemical fertilizers, R30 billion to make up the  difference in the rate of foreign currency to publish textbooks,  and R210 billion for recreational hajj pilgrimages.</p>

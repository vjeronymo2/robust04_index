			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Suzanne Vos, member of the IFP Central </F> Committee, issued by the office of the chief minister of kwaZulu  on the SAPA PR wire service on 22 March]    [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] yesterday provided  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone with a copy of a document, obtained  by an informant, outlining ANC [African National Congress]/SACP  [South African Communist Party] proposals to produce a situation  of "ungovernability" and "crisis" in kwaZulu through "mass  action", including the destabilisation of the kwaZulu civil  service.    The central committee of the IFP is in no doubt that this  document is authentic and has requested Judge Goldstone to  investigate its contents as a matter of urgency. The informant  cannot be publicly identified for reasons of his/her safety.    The document (attached) reveals sinister ANC/SACP plans to  secretly orchestrate "emerging instability" in kwaZulu, leading  to TEC [Transitional Executive Council] and military  intervention, while publicly downplaying the actual and direct  involvement of the alliance.    The author(s) confirm reports from IFP intelligence sources  that there are approximately 2,000 members of Umkhonto we Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] (MK) deployed in  so-called "self-defence" units [SDU] throughout Natal, working  together with members of the Transkei Defence Force and "several  thousand" informally trained SDU members.    Cynical reference is made to "carefully considered"  approaches to his majesty the king of the Zulu nation, designed  "as a means to an end -- the destruction of Buthelezi's  political and social base." We have provided Judge Goldstone  with official ANC documentation using the same language.    The contents of this document go far beyond robust politics  and we believe the proposals, if implemented, would plunge  kwaZulu/Natal into full-scale civil war.    The IFP and the kwaZulu government have long borne the brunt  of a sustained campaign of violence and intimidation initiated  by the ANC/SACP alliance and there is already evidence that the  steps, as outlined, to attempt to destabilise the kwaZulu civil  service have begun. The untruthful and insidious propaganda  about the safety of kwaZulu government pensions (paid, in fact,  to the South African Government in terms of the South African  Government Pensions Fund Act of 1956) is but one example.    The document is taken seriously and viewed with alarm as the  tactics and strategies enuniciated merely follow through  existing and blatant ANC/SACP political machinations ignored, of  the most part, by what appears to be a national and  international conspiracy of silence and obfuscation in holding  the ANC/SACP alliance directly accountable for its overt ANC  covert actions in kwaZulu/Natal, Bophuthatswana, and elsewhere.    March 21, 1994    Mr Justice Richard Goldstone,    Commission of Inquiry Regarding the Prevention of Public  Violence and Intimidation,    4th Floor, 24 Sandpark Building,    Fredman Drive Sandton. (by hand)    Dear Sir,    With Ref: "Prepare the Anvil for the Coming Hammer Towards a  Programme of Action in Natal"    I have been instructed by the president of Inkatha Freedom  Party, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to provide you with a copy  of a document (attached) which was obtained by an informant late  last week.    The informant insists that his/her identity remain a secret  and that under no circumstances can it be revealed as the person  fears for his/her life. This informant insists that the  document is genuine and was produced by a senior member(s) of  the SACP/ANC alliance. Any further details in this regard would  jeopardise revealing the identity of the informant.    The document was studied by the central committee of the IFP  at a meeting on Saturday, March 19. It was the view of the  central committee that the contents warrant your immediate  attention and urgent investigation.    We highlight, in particular, the intention to produce a  situation of "ungovernability" and "crisis" in kwaZulu through  "mass action", combined with other strategies as described,  including the destabilisation of the kwaZulu civil service.    The author(s) of the document outline tactics to produce  "emerging instability" in kwaZulu, secretly orchestrated, noting  that "direct ANC involvement must be played down."    "Immediate proposals" call for (in part) creating  condition??V??Zich would lead to "future military intervention  in kwaZulu" and the direct involvement of the TEC.    Mr Justice Richard Goldstone:    The IFP equally views as extremely sinister the expressed  requirement of "restrengthening of an effective MK's (sic)  presence and more active implementation of people's self-defence  measures", coupled with the information that there are  "approximately 2,000 MK members deployed in a self-defence  capacity throughout Natal, several thousand informally trained  SDU members, as well as disposition of some members of the TDF  (Transkei Defence Force)."    The author(s) admit "successful and long-term efforts by the  people's movement to isolate Buthelezi and separate Inkatha from  its constituency and potential constituencies", which we observe  is a direct acknowlegement of the tactics of violence and  intimidation employed against members and supporters of the IFP  over a considerable period of time.    We have every reason to believe that this document is  authentic and goes far beyond robust politics in its call for  the creation of conditions "for the fall of kwaZulu" and efforts  to "win over" his majesty the king of the Zulu nation through  "carefully considered and assessed approaches" as a "means to an  end -- the destruction of Buthelezi's political and social base."    We therefore formally request that your commission accepts  the very real concern expressed by the IFP in urging that this  document and the information as well as the tactics and  strategies outlined therein be taken extremely seriously.    It has been decided that we will release the document to the  media tomorrow, Tuesday March 22, following your receipt today  of this communication.    [Signed] Yours sincerely, Suzanne Vos Member, Central  Committee, IFP    Copies: Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, President    Dr F. T. Mdlalose, National Chairman  <H3>  Prepare the Anvil for the Coming Hammer Towards a Programme  of Action in Natal </H3>   The recent period has seen further-dramatic shifts in the  balance of power towards the people's camp. The collapse of the  Mangope regime in the Bophutatswana bantustan is a signal  achievement in this regard.    The demise of the tyrant Mangope represents a serious  reverse  for the forces of counter-revolution in our country. It is a  reverse from which these forces cannot recover. Continuing  maximum all-round pressure must continue to be exerted against  remaining, and weakening obstacles to a democratic transition.    The most significant outstanding obstacle which confronts  the  people's movement is the problem of Buthelezi and the IFP.  Events in Bop [Bophuthatswana], combined with the deteriorating  situation in Natal now urge the accelerated implementation of a  strategy, which though generally accepted within the movement,  needs to be more fully elaborated.    That strategy is the destruction of the kwaZulu bantustan  and  its reincorporation within a united, non-racial and non-sexist  South Africa. Though timing is important, the fact of kwaZulu's  reincorporation, together with the destruction of Buthelezi's  power-base cannot be gainsaid. Whether that emerges as a final  moment, or whether that destruction is process-based, conditions  for the fall of the kwaZulu bantustan must speedily be created.    Bop has served to underline the fatal weakness of all the  bantustan administrations. That is that they cannot survive for  long without the financial support from the De Klerk government.  Combined with the long-standing programme of mass action against  Mangope, the mere threat that the tap would be tightened,  combined to create a situation of ungovernability, culminating  in an effective military coup by South African security forces.    Though conditions in kwaZulu and Bop differ materially, and  the strategy of the people's movement towards the Mangope regime  cannot be mechanistically applied, our strategy towards kwaZulu  includes important common elements.    There can be no doubt that sufficient consensus now exists  within the TEC for using maximum firmness for dealing with  threats to a democratic transition. But we must first create  conditions, primarily through mass action, heightened public  awareness and work amongst kwaZulu civil servants, for decisive  state intervention in that bantustan. In other words, we must  need to prepare the anvil for the coming hammer.    Successful and long-term efforts by the people's movement to  isolate Buthelezi and separate Inkatha from its constituency and  potential constituencies have unfortunately been offset by  serious and unexpected reverses in the Natal region.  Principally this is evident in the growth of ethnic chauvinism  under the banner of the Zulu King Zwelethini. Not only has this  stabilised Buthelezi's support base, but this unprecedented and  dangerous ethnic mobilisation poses a grave threat to the united  non-racial South Africa which is the lodestar of the liberation  movement.    This expanding chauvinist mobilisation is combined with  increasing militarisation or this reactionary constituency,  assisted by the cynical involvement of former members of the  apartheid security forces. This militarisation, which has at  its core the provision of military training to IFP supporters  has contributed to the dramatic upswing in violence against the  people's movement in both Natal and the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region.    These dangers counsel for accelerated implementation of a  strategy which has as its objective the destruction of the  kwaZulu bantustan. Apart from the burning need to create  conditions in which free and fair elections can be held, it is  only the destruction of the kwaZulu bantustan, and its  reincorporation under a government committed to non-racial  goals, that the poisonous weed of tribal chauvinism can be  finally cut down and the violence attached to its obnoxious  cause effectively suppressed.    Immediate proposals for the ending of this state of affairs  are as follows.    --The Natal situation should be more closely monitored by a  task force of the TEC, and decisive practical steps recommended  vis-a-vis the Natal situation. All intelligence reports  generated within state intelligence organisations which relate  to the Natal situation should therefore be provided to and  analysed by this task force.    --Parts of Natal should be declared disaster areas and  similar steps taken here as on the East Rand. Principally,  security force functions presently carried out by the ISD  [Internal Stability Division] should be assumed by the SADF  [South African Defense Force] and NPKF [National Peacekeeping  Force].    In particular, those units which proved themselves most  reliable in Bophutatswana, should be considered for priority  deployment in crisis areas of Natal. For its part, the SAP  [South African Police] in Natal may well prove unreliable in any  such TEC initiative. With a view to future military  intervention in kwaZulu, the SAP leadership in Natal must be  firmly subordinated to the TEC.    --The military training and deployment of IFP members in  Natal also requires restrengthening of an effective MK's  presence, and more active implementation of people's  self-defence measures. In any event any security action  considered by the TEC should be supplemented by informal MK  deployments.    According to intelligence sources approximately 5,000 IFP  members have been trained in a relatively short space of time.  Counterpoised to this private army are approximately 2,000 MK  members deployed in a self-defence capacity throughout Natal,  several thousand informally trained SDU members, as well as  disposition of some members of the TDF.    The development of what is by all accounts a disciplined IFP  military capability -- an important factor in political violence  in the Natal region and beyond -- is deeply disturbing and  requires urgent TEC attention. This training and the murderous  activities of its products need to be suppressed as a matter of  urgency.    --The TEC also needs to assume the payment of salaries of  amakhosi [chiefs] subordinating reactionary institutions to the  control of the TEC and a new democratic order is necessary not  only a prelude to their transformation, but it removes an  important instrument of social control from the hands of  Buthelezi and the IFP.    --The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] needs to assume  a far more active role in Natal.    --This must be combined with the organisation of a broad  front of forces against any disruption of elections or further  chauvinist inspired attempts to balkanize the country. This  organisation could also serve as the basis for further isolation  of Buthelezi and the IFP.    --Most critical of all is work amongst the kwaZulu civil  service, and efforts to win over the Zulu king. In this regard  Zuma's diplomacy should be understood as a means to an end --  the destruction of Buthelezi's political and social base. Apart  from Zuma's sympathy for the incarnations and institutions of  tribal consciousness, he may confuse the means as an end in  itself. Approaches to the king therefore must be carefully  considered and assessed and continuously oriented within the  purposeful strategic framework of the liberation movement.    Organisation amongst civil servants must be immediately  stepped up. Though significant advances have already been made  in this regard and important sectors of the kwaZulu civil  service are already organised by the ANC and allied formations,  continuing efforts must be made to persuade civil servants that  job security and their pensions can only be secured by a  people's government and not by tribal despots of Buthelezi's  mould. One may go so far to say that the kwaZulu civil service  is the most important base of ANC support north of the Tugela.  And, even though the KZP [kwaZulu Police] have traditionally  functioned as Buthelezi's private army, increasingly members of  the KZP, including command elements, side with the people's  movement. It is clear that in a situation of crisis Buthelezi  cannot take the loyalty of the KZP for granted.    One of the stabilising pillars of the bantustans under  apartheid rule was the development of a bureaucratic bourgeoisie  whose interests were fundamentally bound up with the continued  existence of these administrations. This pillar has now been  removed. The class interests of this stratum now lie outside  the bantustan administrations. Only a new, non-racial  democratic state can secure its interests. This motivation was  a principal factor in rendering Bophutatswana ungovernable.    Though the kwaZulu administration differs in that it has a  social base, a vast number of civil servants do not identify  with this base. Thus, whilst the kwaZulu administration poses a  challenge to the people's forces, this challenge is hardly  insurmountable. The role of white civil servants and central  state appointees should not be overlooked. A common commitment  between the people's movement enlightened elements of the SAG  [South African Government] to foreclose upon the powers of the  kwaZulu bantustan, as in Bop, could lead to further  disorganisation of efforts by IFP and tribal loyalists within  the kwaZulu bantustan administration to resist TEC decisions and  to act against our own organisation within those structures.    Combined with mass action, and stepped up organisation  within  the sectors of the kwaZulu government, a situation of  ungovernability could reproduce itself fairly rapidly in the  areas it administers. Though the consequences will be more  extensive than in Bop, this should not deter us from the  political correctness of such a strategy. It is important  however for this crunch moment to have an appearance of  spontaneity and popular support. Direct ANC involvement must be  played down.    Emerging instability within kwaZulu, as well as providing an  increased public profile to acts of violence, particularly when  directed against the ANC and its allies should provide a  persuasive argument for TEC intervention in kwaZulu. The tempo  and extent of that intervention will be conditioned by  development of these conditions and the degree of resistance  encountered by the TEC.    Comrades within the TEC have made it clear that in  conditions  of growing instability or ungovernability, and partial or  general uprising, or organised resistance to the imperatives of  a new democratic order, that as in Bop, decisive military steps  will be taken. In this regard no centre of counter-revolution  or tribal chauvinism which stands outside the process of popular  integration should be considered exempt from pre-emptive action.</p>

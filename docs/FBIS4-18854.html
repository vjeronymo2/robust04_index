			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens (DPA) -- Finance Minister Theo Waigel has  called for a single concept for creating "lasting growth and  employment dynamism" in the European Union [EU]. According to  members of delegations at the meeting with his EU counterparts  in Athens on Friday [8 April], Waigel said he supported the  strategy paper that was presented by the European Commission,  the so-called white paper. However, he sees a danger that the  important impulses in terms of economic policy that are  contained in the document "threaten to fall apart."    Waigel warned that a policy to secure growth and employment  must not only concentrate on measures related to infrastructure.  The extension of the trans-European networks -- at the level of  transport, telecommunications, and energy--are important, but it  is not sufficient yet.    In concrete terms, Waigel requested that the growth  perspectives be urgently improved and the burden on enterprises  as a result of over regulation be reduced. Wage policy to  secure employment must contribute to this objective. The  efficiency and dynamism of the economy continue to meet too many  obstacles, particularly excessive and ever more complicated  regulations. Waigel suggested that a deregulation group be  established at the EU level to reduce bureaucracy. Such a group  should thin out EU laws and free them of "over regulation that  obstructs investment."    In Athens, the finance ministers also wanted to discuss the  controversial funding of growth programs for the economy in the  Union. The Twelve and the European Commission are at odds  whether parts of the equivalent of almost 39 billion German  marks, which have been earmarked for investments into the  trans-European networks, should also be financed via credits.  In addition, the president of the European Monetary Institute  (EMI, Frankfurt), Alexandre Lamfalussy, wanted to brief the  group of ministers on the efforts to establish the newly created  institute and recent developments in the European Monetary  System.</p>

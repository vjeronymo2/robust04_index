			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Industry in price-cut turmoil The newspaper industry was in turmoil last night as managers went into huddles to discuss the intensifying price war between The Times and The Daily Telegraph. Concerns spread far beyond the national broadsheet newspapers to provincial dailies and caused particular tremors in the Irish Republic, where newspapers are both expensive to produce and burdened with value added tax. 'This makes me feel very ill,' said one newspaper industry specialist after feeding the numbers into a matrix of revenue and circulation. 'Millions and millions will be lost.' There was growing concern that the cost-cutting process would break down loyalty to particular titles. First indications were that The Independent, at 20p for a single day yesterday, increased sales by 15 per cent to 16 per cent. The Daily Telegraph at 30p claimed a rise of more than 25 per cent, although some wholesalers put it closer to 12 per cent. The Times said last night it had lost only 2 per cent to 3 per cent. The middle-market papers, the Daily Mail, Daily Express and Today, are believed to have lost 4 per cent to 6 per cent. It was not clear whether any other national newspaper planned to join the price war, although there is growing speculation that The Independent may go to 40p. The Guardian, whose circulation rose last month, will be extremely cautious about any price cutting. Mr David Bell, chief executive of the Financial Times - at 65p the most expensive national daily - said: 'The Financial Times is priced according to what it costs to produce. We think that is in the best long-term interests of both the paper and its readers.' Lord Rothermere, chairman of Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, is understood to be reviewing the situation and a cut in the price of the mid-market papers should not be ruled out. The Daily Mail has been selling at 20p in Northern Ireland and is understood to have achieved a 24 per cent sales increase.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A responsible source has said the following: The  Arab side is committed to peace and to supporting the draft  Palestinian resolution presented to the UN Security Council on  the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the required measures in light  of this massacre, especially those concerning the security of  Arab citizens in the occupied Palestinian territories, in  accordance with the stipulations of the draft resolution. This  draft resolution has been approved by the Arab and Nonaligned  groups at the UN Security Council and other states. In light of  the contacts that have been held with U.S. President Clinton,  and after consultations with some Arab brothers directly  concerned with this subject, Syria will soon invite the Arab  parties to the peace process to a meeting to discuss the  resumption of the peace talks, and to set a date for the  resumption of talks in April. Syria believes that the odious  massacre that was committed against defenseless Palestinian  worshipers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque and the subsequent death  and injury of many people affirm to the entire world the need to  end the Israeli occupation of the occupied Arab territories and  to arrive at a just, comprehensive peace in accordance with the  Madrid formula, away from any procrastination and obstacles.  Syria is of the view that the issuance of the UN Security  Council resolution by unanimous vote and the resumption of the  peace talks will bolster the international measures to provide  protection for our brothers in the occupied Arab territories to  prevent the recurrence of such spiteful crimes.</p>

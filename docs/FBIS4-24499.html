			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Han Nai-kuo] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 26 (CNA) -- The Clinton  administration will proceed with its review of US policy toward  Taiwan in the next few weeks, White House Security Adviser  Anthony Lake said Thursday [26 May] afternoon.    In response to questions at a press briefing, Lake denied  that the Clinton administration has put its Taiwan policy review  on hold in the past several months because of the issue of  most-favored-nation trade status for Mainland China.    "I would prefer to say that it has been proceeding apace,  rather than was on hold," he said.    Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian  and  Pacific affairs, said a high-level meeting on the issue would be  held soon.    Asked whether the administration will consider increasing  contact with Taiwan and Tibet as a tool to push for human-rights  progress in the mainland, Lord noted that the United States  already maintains a strong unofficial relationship with Taiwan,  and has done so through several administrations.    "If anything, we believe it has become stronger in this  administration. We will pursue that," he said.    Lord said the one-China policy of the United States is very  successful because it permits the United States to improve its  relationship with Beijing and at the same time allows it to  maintain a strong friendship with Taiwan and strengthen Taiwan's  de facto security.    "So, we will not play games or alter our one-China policy.  We will continue to strengthen our unofficial ties with Taiwan.  It's worked for many administrations. It's going to work under  this administration," he said.    He added that the Clinton administration also will continue  contacts with the Dalai Lama.    He said the administration is disappointed that Beijing has  not yet agreed to enter into a dialogue with the Dalai Lama  after the Tibetan spiritual leader stated openly that he was  willing to hold talks without including the issue of Tibetan  independence on the agenda.    Lake said the Clinton administration is "very disturbed" by  many of Beijing's actions in Tibet with regard to Tibetan  culture, and that the issue will remain on the US agenda with  the mainland.</p>

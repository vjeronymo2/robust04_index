			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WEATHER BEFRIENDS FIREFIGHTERS IN VANQUISHING CHINO HILLS BLAZE  </P> <P> Light winds mixed with high humidity and scattered showers helped firefighters  gain the upper hand on a fast-moving brush fire Friday that had raged out of  control in the hilly countryside between Yorba Linda and the San Bernardino  County line.  </P> <P> The fire, the second to burn through the environmentally sensitive area in less  than three weeks, charred more than 6,500 acres of state parkland, fire  officials said.  </P> <P> "It's pretty much under control," Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman  Maria Sabol said. "It's going nowhere now."  </P> <P> With mop-up procedures well under way, most of the 700 firefighters who were  called in to battle the blaze were released back to their stations, Sabol said.  </P> <P> About 150 firefighters were left to monitor and attack the numerous hot spots  that remain, Sabol said. They are expected to stay at the fire scene at least  through today.  </P> <P> Firefighters got a quicker-than-expected handle on the blaze, which swept  across acres of tinder-dry sagebrush, grass and scrub oak, thanks to an  unusually high level of humidity that blanketed much of Southern California  overnight.  </P> <P> Scattered sprinkles in the area Friday also served to quench the flames that on  Thursday bounded across the rural territory at speeds estimated to be more than  25 m.p.h.  </P> <P> By early Friday morning, fire officials declared the blaze 95% contained and  began sending home weary firefighters who had worked throughout the night  battling the stubborn fire.  </P> <P> "We've got it surrounded, but there are occasional flare-ups, and we'll be  controlling it for a few days," Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young said as he  surveyed the scorched hillside.  </P> <P> Still, a blanket of smoke hovered above Yorba Linda and surrounding areas for  most of Friday, extending for more than five miles in all directions. Steaming  ash covered thousands of acres of hillside in Soquel Canyon, where most of the  flames were concentrated.  </P> <P> The Chino Hills fire was the second in recent weeks in the area. On June 27,  fire consumed 6,600 acres in nearby Carbon Canyon off Carbon Canyon Road, a  bucolic country roadway that environmental activists are attempting to have  designated as a scenic highway in an effort to preserve the pristine area from  development.  </P> <P> "Essentially, Soquel Canyon now looks like Carbon Canyon, where we had the fire  a few weeks ago," said David Miller, president of the Chino Hills Land  Conservancy. "It's a really nice area out here, and it's a shame that it's all  burned."  </P> <P> The blaze was started accidentally by a 15-year-old boy playing with a model  rocket near his home in Yorba Linda, on the southwestern corner of the park,  authorities said. The youth, who was not identified because he is a minor,  apparently launched the rocket into a highly flammable grassy area that soon  exploded into flames. Fueled by moderate winds, the flames quickly spread  north.  </P> <P> The boy suffered minor burns to his legs trying to extinguish the fire, then  ran to a telephone and dialed 911, fire officials said. Although he apparently  did not start the fire deliberately, he will likely be held liable for the  tremendous expense of the firefighting effort, which could exceed $1 million  per day, authorities said.  </P> <P> Under state law, because the youth is underage, authorities may seek to recoup  the costs from his parents. Officials were unsure how many people in the past  have been forced to pay for fires they started.  </P> <P> The fire broke out about 12:40 p.m. Thursday near Blue Gum and Ridge Crest  drives and raced toward the San Bernardino County line. Fire crews from the  U.S. Forestry Service, San Bernardino County, Brea, Santa Ana and Anaheim were  called in to assist the Orange County Fire Department.  </P> <P> Four prison-inmate firefighters were injured, three of them impaired by smoke  inhalation as they labored to dig trenches along the perimeter of the fire.  </P> <P> A fourth inmate, whose name was being withheld, broke his arm after slipping  some 75 feet down a canyon wall, Young said. Firefighters spent more than 1 1/2  hours attempting to rescue the injured man, finally hauling him out of the  ravine in a metal basket. All four inmates were treated at area hospitals and  returned to jail.  </P> <P> The only structure damaged by the fire was an unoccupied shack, firefighters  said.  </P></p>

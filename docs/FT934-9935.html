			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (7): Hard line approach - Fresh realism in dealing room applications PASCAL BERTAUD is responsible for kitting-out the City of London dealing room of Lloyds Bank. Over the past decade his professional colleagues might have approached this task with an open chequebook and unbridled enthusiasm for the latest technology on offer. This being 1993, Mr Bertaud has no intention of flooding Lloyds' dealing floor with innovative technology. His brief is to find a system that works at a price the bank can well afford. It is a strategy based on experience. The current Lloyds dealing room relies on data feeds from Reuters and Dow Jones Telerate mixed through IBM's early implementation of the Unix operating system AIX. IBM PS/2 PCs are backed up by Stratus computers performing the heavier processing. Lloyds spent Pounds 3m to get this 120-position dealing room up and running. It was a successful project in its time, but is due for replacement. Lloyds has surveyed the market and rejected the obvious and costly solution of a large off-the-peg dealing room system. In the boom days of the late 1980s, these systems were de rigeur. In today's more cautious climate, the bank has refused to embark on any solution that might run late and over budget. 'I just believe that the big bang approach is no longer viable,' says Mr Bertaud, a veteran of computer programming at systems house Scicon and the merchant banking arm of Lloyds Bank. As senior manager for front office systems he must reconcile the users' needs with a controlled budget - 'they want a dealing system. The challenge for me is to update it at a cost-effective price.' His strategy is a rolling replacement of the PS/2s by Compaq and Dell PCs. He defines it as an incremental approach that will take place over three years. Mr Bertaud takes an uncompromising line with the financial systems industry  -'I'm constantly plagued by salesmen. I tell them what we're doing. If they can't add to that, then we're getting it right.' This hardline approach has introduced Lloyds to systems not immediately associated with complex dealing rooms. PC software giant Microsoft has emerged as a pivotal supplier. Mr Bertaud's team is using standard programming utilities from Microsoft to link dealing terminals. The best-selling Windows PC environment provides the back-drop. The current generation of development software from Microsoft, retailing at between Pounds 500 and Pounds 3,000 per copy, allows the user considerable autonomy in devising an appropriate local system. Lloyds have built a simple but effective application that links dealing positions. A deal keyed into one terminal will automatically update the spreadsheet on another screen. The proven Microsoft Excell spreadsheet will be the prime tool for the new dealing room. Mr Bertaud has looked at the possibility of installing high-powered workstations from Sun. In the late 1980s these machines were touted as the box to match the dealer's Porsche. But many dealing rooms wound up with excess power at the dealer's fingertips. Foreign exchange staff were in fact quite content to operate a conventional spreadsheet on a 'run of them mill' PC. As PCs acquired more power, the workstation has reverted to its original role as a specialist tool for engineers and scientists. And PCs are familiar. If you agree with Mr Bertaud that 'the only thing that matters is being able to use the thing,' then the more comfortable Lloyds' dealers feel, the more successful the implementation. Lloyds will spend Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m following this option. Going overboard with a Big Bang era dealing room would have cost perhaps twice that sum. Telerate was in the forefront of the dealing room systems boom. Before its takeover by Dow Jones, described by European managing director Dan Casey as 'relatively painless,' Telerate interwove data feeds in a variety of ambitious projects. It expanded from providing information feeds to producing dealer workstations. Telerate stumbled badly with the Telerate Trading System (TTS). This attempted to challenge Reuters dominance in the foreign exchange field and sank in the face of a user base weary with technical innovation. Now the company has re-entered the dealer box fray with Minex, billed as a complete electronic broking system. Minex has been developed hand in hand with a consortium of banks. Telerate knows the climate has changed. The current generation of powerful PCs have redressed the balance in the customer's favour, allowing the user to return to basics. Technology is no longer allowed to distract financial institutions from their prime purpose. Dan Casey claims that today's Telerate wouldn't dream of hoisting an over-elaborate system on a client - 'the market asks for the information and the product separately. We try to stick to the financial community and their wishes.' Tony Coveney is the director of Lazard Brothers banking division. When Telerate entered a three-cornered fight with Reuters and financial systems house ACT to upgrade an 80 position dealing room for Lazard, it won out by dropping technical jargon - 'I insisted the suppliers all speak plain English and avoided acronyms so I could explain our system to my fellow board members' says Mr Coveney. Telerate is carrying out a Pounds 500,000 rewrite of Lazards' software. It will provide a Unix workstation backbone while the dealers attend training courses intended to make the most of the PC software packages that have become their standard tools. Microsoft features prominently. The project was triggered by a desire to boost dealer productivity without hiring extra staff.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Revenues from MTV Europe at Dollars 60m a year MTV Europe, the London- based satellite rock music channel, is now producing revenues at the rate of Dollars 60m-Dollars 70m a year, according to Mr Frank Biondi, president and chief executive of Viacom, which owns MTV Europe. Until now MTV has declined to give any financial numbers for its European television network which is available in 43m homes in 32 countries. 'MTV Europe's revenues have been increasing at 70 to 80 per cent a year although it will be tough to keep that up', Mr Biondi said. The revenue figures are at least double that suspected by analysts. 'We (MTV Europe) will be available in 50m homes by the end of this calendar year,' Mr Biondi forecast. He stuck to a previous formula to describe MTV Europe's profits. 'It is marginally profitable.' In fact all the signs are that the company is being conservative in its public statements and after 5 1/2 years on air MTV Europe is comfortable profitable. Viacom recently announced that it was bringing its American children's channel Nickelodeon to the UK in a joint venture with British Sky Broadcasting. Mr Biondi said the aim was to take Nickelodeon to other European countries through joint ventures with local partners. MTV, which worldwide is available in more than 200m homes, plans to launch a service for Latin America in October. The 24-hour channel will be for Spanish speakers in the US and central and south America.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Bonuses give sharp boost to directors' earnings Top directors' earnings at many of Britain's biggest financial services companies have risen sharply over the last year, mainly because of large profit-linked bonuses. The scale of the increases is shown in the latest study of board earnings published today by Monks Partnership, the independent remuneration advisers, and reflect a marked improvement in financial companies' performance as the economy recovers. According to the study, total median earnings for executive directors employed by financial companies in the FT-SE 100 index rose by 23.1 per cent to Pounds 240,000, of which Pounds 94,000 was made up of bonuses. Last year their total earnings rose by 4.9 per cent. The highest increases in the financial sector were at the Royal Bank of Scotland, where the top director received a 201.8 per cent rise through bonuses. The top director's rise at SG Warburg was 197.1 per cent, and 183.2 per cent at Barclays Bank. In industrial and commercial companies, total earnings increases for the highest paid directors were much lower - 10.8 per cent, compared with 8 per cent in 1993. But there was a 98.6 per cent improvement at Cadbury Schweppes, 67.4 per cent at Thorn EMI and 65.2 per cent at British Aerospace. A number of industrial companies reported falls in the total pay of the highest paid director. These group's included Guinness, Cable and Wireless, the Argyll Group, BAT Industries and ICI. Where a bonus is paid, it is now worth a quarter of a director's basic salary in the industrial and commercial sector and a third of salary for top paid directors in financial services. 'Most incentive payments at board level are dependent on the achievement of corporate financial targets,' said Mr David Atkins, the author of the report. 'With nearly 80 per cent of FT-SE 100 companies recording an increase in their profits before tax, it is logical for this performance to be reflected in an increased number of directors with a bonus award,' he added. With the exception of the upper quartile in financial sector organisations and the largest industrial companies, all increases in fixed pay for executives were below last year's study. The median rise in basic salaries for the top paid directors was 5.5 per cent in industrial and commercial companies and 3.6 per cent for financial and property sector companies.

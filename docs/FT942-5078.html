			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: France renews gas deal with Norway - NKr50bn contract lifts Oslo's market share Norway yesterday announced a 20-year contract to supply natural gas to France. The deal, valued at an estimated NKr50bn (Pounds 4.6bn) based on current gas prices, also includes an undisclosed price revision for gas supplies covered under existing contracts with Gaz de France. Norway's Gas Negotiating Committee - comprising Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum, two other Norwegian oil companies -agreed to provide Gaz de France with fresh annual quantities of gas from 1996 or 1997 which will build to a level of 4.0bn cu m from 2001. The deal will boost Norway's market share for gas in France to 30 per cent by the year 2000 from 18 per cent in 1993. Gaz de France has imported gas from Norway since 1977 from the North Sea Ekofisk, Statfjord, Heimdal and Gullfaks fields. Gas exports under the Troll sales agreement began last year. Statoil said: 'Based on these contracts and the new agreement, annual deliveries to France will reach 13bn cu m soon after the turn of the century.' France last year consumed 33bn cu m of gas but indigenous production is rapidly declining and totalled less than 3.0bn cu m in 1993. France also imports gas from the Netherlands, Russia and Algeria. Norway recently postponed by two years a decision to invest in new capacity to meet increasing demand for gas. A sellers' group led by Statoil will take responsibility for the new contract with France. Last year Norway supplied about 25bn cu m of gas to Europe and expects deliveries to rise sharply to 60.8bn by 2005. It currently holds a market share of 10 per cent in the European Union, but this is predicted to rise to 12 per cent by 2005.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by IEC official Kumi Naidoo at IEC </F> Headquarters, Gallagher Estate -- live, broadcast in progress]    [Text] [Naidoo]... at 3.30 when the chairperson of the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Justice Johann Kriegler  pointed out that the problems that have been experienced today  have substantially now -- we have put plans into place to  actually address them. The purpose of this press conference is  to actually take you through a few additional updates that have  come through to us, and also to give you a chance to answer any  questions that you might have.    One of the questions that we were asked earlier today was  with regard to -- just an overview with regard to special  voting. At the close of special voting yesterday, this is the  overall situation as we recorded it. Only 16 percent of the  3,409 of the voting stations deployed during special voting day  experienced difficulties, of which 10 percent were major  difficulties, and 6 percent minor. In 77 percent of the voting  stations of special voting day, the progress was good, and in  fact there was a routine general performance. We have some  updated figures with regard to the overseas voting which I will  take you through briefly: Argentina, 93; Austria, 405; Brazil,  89; Bulgaria, 48; Chile, 86; China, 444; the Czech Republic,  147; Denmark, 126; Finland, 45; France, 803; Gabon, 12; Germany,  1,637; Greece, 50; India, 69; Italy, 774; Japan, 101; Jordan, 8;  Korea, 28; Luxembourg, 60; Madagascar, 17; Malaysia, 108;  Maldives, 149; Mozambique, 959; Namibia, 8,474; Pakistan, 110;  Paraguay, 38; Russia, 75; Senegal, 8; Singapore, 365; Slovakia,  17; Swaziland, 3,446; Sweden, 115; Switzerland, 1,089; Thailand,  215; Turkey, 108; United Kingdom, 7,464; USA, 1,251; Uruguay,  11; and Zambia, 708.    This morning and throughout the day we have been giving you  updates with regards to reported problems. What we want to  report now is that a substantial number of these problems have  been addressed and are at hand, and we also want to report that  in fact we have received 10,807 reports from voting stations  around the country during the course of the day which indicate  there were no hitches with the voting process.    There's one specific issue that has come up which we should  report to you. In the Western Cape, in response to allegations  by the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] of partiality by IEC  officials in the Western Cape, the provincial electoral officer  of the Western Cape, Mary Burton, has written to the PAC's  candidate for the provincial premiership, Mrs. Patricia de  Lille, giving the following assurances:    Firstly, presiding officers will be reminded of the need not  to favor any one party over another. Secondly, the regulations  dealing with the role and attendance of party agents will be  strictly adhered to. Thirdly, the perimeters of polling  stations will be clearly demarcated and the behavior of IEC  officials strictly monitored, and finally, problems experienced  with ballot boxes, rods and seals will be dealt with as a matter  of greatest urgency. Additional monitors and observers will be  dispatched on Thursday to voting stations identified by Mrs. de  Lille as problematic.    Two commissioners, Mrs. Don Mokhobo and Dr. (Teckley) will  accompany Mrs. de Lille to a voting station of her choice to  observe that the measures are being adhered to. We also have a  minor statement that has come in with regard to the situation in  Alberton. Some of you have been asking questions with regard to  that. Ballot papers arrived there four hours ago and are being  distributed to polling stations and polling was expected to have  started at 4 o'clock    There is further information regarding the supply of  election  materials to the East Rand stations. Delamika High School and  Backen Park Community Center have now received adequate supplies  of election equipment and are fully operative. Two other  stations in Katlehong have also opened, we are awaiting names of  the exact polling stations, and we will update you with these  details later. The SADF are presently collecting supplies from  Springs to take to Katlehong. I must point out that this report  was -- that was the status at 6 o'clock.    I think we just want to return to one issue before I open  the  floor for discussion, for questions, and that is the issue of  the IFP stickers, and I think just for clarity, we have been  requested to read out what directive exactly went out to the  presiding officers with regard to this matter. And if I can  just read it out to you, this is the directive that went out  from the IEC headquarters to presiding officers in the field.    It read as follows: Voters wishing to cast their votes for  the IFP where no stickers were provided for the ballot papers  have been marking their preference in writing on the ballots.  The IEC will deal with such ballots in due course in terms of  Section 47 of the Electoral Act dealing with voting  irregularities. This section empowers the commission to make  such determinations and adjustments in respect of the counting  of irregular votes as it may consider appropriate in the  circumstances. The commission has decided that it will print  additional ballot papers locally as they are required. This  process has already begun. The two provinces already being  addressed are the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and  Orange Free State.    That's what went out to our presiding officers in the field.  And the status report on this is that the printing is advanced  and deployment about to begin with the SADF [South African  Defense Force] providing assistance in this matter. Our  assessment at this stage is that the difficulties that were  encountered today are in hand and with our people on the ground  working through the night, we would be able to have a smooth  running operation first thing tomorrow morning, and just to note  that, in many cases several voting stations will be opened  beyond the 7 o'clock period. OK the floor is now open for  questions.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Naidoo what is the IEC  doing about the IFP's threat of withdrawing from the election,  especially from Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi? How is this thing  addressed, and what's your reaction to it?    [Naidoo] The judge and -- Judge Kriegler and the other  commissioners are presently in dialogue with the representatives  of political parties. I think what is very important to place  on record is that the concerns that have been raised by the IFP  and Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi are similar concerns  that have been raised by the other political parties as well,  and these are concerns that the IEC also shares in part, and we  are hoping that in the discussions that will happen tonight we  would be able to provide greater clarity on the situation, but  that will have to be forthcoming from the commission itself, and  we hope to be able to release that shortly.    [Correspondent] [question indistinct]    [Naidoo] OK. On the first question with regard to the number  of problems or concerns that were raised during the course of  the day, there have been close to 2,000. Most of these were  regular concerns, like for example, if a monitor did not arrive  on time that would have been recorded as a problem, as one  incident. If there were communication problems between a  monitor at a voting station and the sub-provincial operations  center, that would also have been recorded as an incident,  furthermore, if there were equipment problems. All these  together with more substantive issues such as the problem of  materials, which has been one of the major problems spoken about  today. I think what is important to note is that of those 2,000  plus incident reports, most of them have actually been addressed  at this stage. With regard to the Inkatha Freedom Party sticker  at the bottom of the ballot, I think it is quite important that  we do not read it the way you have read it, and that is that the  scale of the problem is enormous. I think what -- the  initiative taken by Judge Kriegler and the commission is to put  in place an enabling way of dealing with this potential problem,  and a way in which we can address the problem, particularly at  the counting stage. It is quite important that we reiterate  that this statement does not suggest that for example, the  ballots that are now being presently printed do not have IFP on  it. It does have IFP at the bottom being printed, and secondly  it does not suggest that attempts to get the IFP stickers to  voting stations that at this stage do not have them are not in  process as well.    [Correspondent] [question indistinct]    [Naidoo] Yes.    [Correspondent] My information is that originally there were  88 million ballot papers printed. Now, another 9.3 million have  been printed. Does this -- Judge Kriegler explained that there  were some extra ones at some stations that could not be moved to  other stations -- but, does this mean that 66 million ballot  papers are stacked up somewhere not being used, or have some of  these new ballot papers been printed to avoid the problem of the  Inkatha sticker, because Inkatha will be on the ballot papers?  Is that perhaps the thinking behind it?    [Naidoo] OK. I think you are right. That has been a factor  that's taken into consideration, that obviously by printing the  IFP sticker on the ballot it prevents us having to deal with  trying to get the IFP stickers to the voting stations, but I  think the other issue has been to ensure that at this time we  rather have sufficient and excess ballots rather than less.    [Correspondent Lulama] Two questions, Mr. Naidoo. The  first one is, you just rattled through those numbers of the  special votes. Can we just get a total figure? And then the  second question is, you said yesterday in one of the briefings  that the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region was  not necessarily a priority area, and I mean, in Natal for  instance couldn't it have been foreseen? I mean, couldn't Natal  and the PWV region have been made priority areas, especially  with regard to the dispatching of ballot papers that had  stickers?    [Naidoo] OK. I'll take your second question first, and I am  very glad that you asked it, because I think that I was quoted  out of context. Let me first reiterate what I said yesterday.  What we said yesterday was that most of the problems with  regard to deployment of materials were being experienced in the  PWV. In the deployment plan of the IEC with regard to these  material, we started deploying the materials from outside  inwards, meaning that inward being the PWV because all the  materials were in fact procured in the PWV region itself. So I  think by no ways was anyone suggesting that the PWV wasn't given  priority. I think just in terms of the deployment plan, it made  sense to us to start with those outlying areas like the Northern  Cape and move inwards, and unfortunately they weren't able to  reach all the PWV locations and some of the other areas in time.  With regard to the figures, we will make it available to the  press at the media desk later this evening.    [Lulama] OK, my other question, a part of it was, couldn't  there have been -- couldn't Natal have been the one area in  which all the ballot papers with stickers on -- couldn't that  have been the first area in which ballot papers could have been  dispatched?    [Naidoo] OK. I think I need to clarify you on one area, and  that is, you are suggesting that all the ballot papers with the  IFP stickers should have been deployed in KwaZulu-Natal first.  Is that what you are suggesting? OK, I think what needs to be  clarified is that the way in which the IFP stickers were to be  put on was as follows: Given the lateness of the entry of the  Inkatha Freedom Party into the election, and the printing of the  stickers itself, unfortunately we did not have the time to affix  those stickers on the ballot papers prior to the ballot papers  themselves leaving for the voting stations. So in the end we  couldn't do it centrally, and what we needed to do was to  appoint a voting officer in each voting station who was  responsible for the specialised tasks of affixing this sticker  on. So there were no ballot papers that left centrally with the  IFP sticker on. All the affixng of the IFP stickers took place  at voting station level. I am glad that you asked the question  because I think that matter needed clarification. Sorry, there's  the gentleman behind Lulama?    [Correspondent] Thank you. I was wondering whether you can  explain to us why it hadn't been possible to have a contingency  plan for the kind of situation that you encountered on the East  Rand today? I mean, it's not a long drive to IEC headquarters.  Why was it not possible for people to get into cars and go over  there and get the equipment and go back and have the polling  stations open within an hour?    [Naidoo] I think that the assessment of how the deployment  is  going -- the problems actually surfaced fairly late. We had  anticipated that things would flow much more smoothly than they  did, and that the supplies at the central deployment office,  which is not in central Johannesburg, had been deployed out to  the regions and to PWV sub-provincial regions, and we had  anticipated that in fact there was sufficient supplies at PWV  sub-provincial level, and hence the difficulty has been that the  provision as -- particularly with the ballot papers -- just  wasn't there and hence we have to produce more ballot papers.  And I think in the main today the problem has been with ballot  papers themselves in the PWV.    [Correspondent Dale Lautenbach] I think we can all say that  we don't want the IEC to fail, but I sense that there is an  enormous amount of frustration both as reflected in media  reports and public calls to radio, that people don't understand  what is happening and they feel they are not getting direct  responses from the IEC. I think this latest thing on the IFP  stickers, the quoting of Section 47, is enormously fuzzy for  anyone out there to understand, plus, it doesn't address the  very obvious issue of illiteracy and the inability of people to  write the IFP as a party onto the ballot paper. And I think the  overwhelming sense of people who have been frustrated today is  that their frustrations are not being answered and have not been  not addressed, and no one is saying yes, this is the scale of  the problem. For example, what is the scale of the IFP sticker  problem? How many stations were affected, how many ballots were  affected? I do feel that we are not getting the answers and  perhaps we want to know why?    [Naidoo] I think it has been difficult to track the scale of  the problem. It certaintly is not the intention of the IEC to  deliberately withhold information from either the voters or the  media. It has been a difficult situation in those areas that  you've actually mentioned, and we have been attempting to assess  the situation. In some cases I think its just been very  difficult to get information on time and to process it  sufficiently so that we can provide verified information to the  press. I think the important point, generally, that we would  like to make is that in fact yesterday, from the moment the  special voting started, there were several rumors that almost  became fact, in terms of the number of polling stations that had  been occupied. Many of you would have heard of the Settlers Way  example that was running for about two hours, so much so that we  were confused as to whether it really was happening or not.  This morning I can point to several members in the audience who  came up to me and said: have you heard of this bomb blast in  Rosebank and etc., etc. And I think generally our apparoach in  terms of responding to the various problems has been one of  caution, and one in which we are seeking to get absolute  verification before we commit ourselves to a position. I think  it wuld be undesirable for us to say that we are sure that there  are X- number of IFP sticker problems when we are at this stage  not able to verify it. So I think at the moment we do, we  certainly would. I think it's also important that we make the  point that we are certainly as concerned about the problems as  the political parties and the community at large. Yes. We also  want to place on record our appreciation for the fact that  millions of voters actually conduct themselves with absolute  patience, with understanding, and even though there have been  frustrations, I think it's been remarkable, the level of  patience and understanding that has been exhibited by the voters.    [Naidoo] The other point that we also want to make is that  -- I don't want to, maybe for those of you who weren't at the  earlier press conference I should just give you a statistic on a  provincial by provincial basis in terms of the extent of the  success, in terms of the operation of the voting stations in the  different provinces. I can take you through that very quickly,  because I think some of you missed that at the last press  conference. In the Western Cape we are recording a 94 percent  fully normal operational voting station situation, in the  Eastern Cape 80 percent, in the Northern Cape 100 percent, in  KwaZulu-Natal 75 percent, in Orange Free State 87 percent, in  Eastern Transvaal 80 percent, in Northern Transvaal 75 percent,  in the North West 95 percent, and in the PWV 70 percent. These  figures were calculated at 5.30 PM this afternoon. Some of  them, most of them have actually increased. The one, the two  areas where there has been a decrease has been in the OFS  [Orange Free State] and the Eastern Transvaal. [program switches  back to studio]    [Announcer Penny Smythe] We have to leave the press  conference at Gallagher Estate there. This concludes the  English broadcast on Channel 1 for Election 94.</p>

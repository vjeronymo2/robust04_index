			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (XINHUA) -- The Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia and Serb leaders in former Yugoslavia today  strongly denounced the U.N.-authorized NATO air strikes against  Bosnian Serb positions, saying the world body had been directly  involved in the civil war.    In an emergency government meeting called to discuss the  latest developments in Bosnia, Yugoslav leaders said the United  Nations, instead of disarming the Muslim forces in Gorazde,  tolerated the two-week spring offensive against Serb-held  positions launched by the Muslims in a systematic way.    When the Muslims were defeated in their spring offensive,  the  U.N. gave the go-ahead to launch air strikes on Serb positions  under the pretext of the Muslim enclave of Gorazde being one of  the U.N.- designated "safe areas," they said.    By authorizing NATO to launch air raids against Bosnian  Serbs, the U.N. has been directly involved in the Bosnian war,  the Yugoslav leader said, urging the world body to immediately  renounce its "dangerous" policy of siding with the Muslims in  the conflict.    NATO jets today launched a second air strike on Serb  positions around Gorazde in less than 24 hours. According to  U.N. military sources, Serb artillery, tank and machine gun fire  into Gorazde town abated soon after NATO warplanes destroyed at  least one Serb tank.    On Sunday [10 April], NATO war planes dropped three bombs on  a Bosnian Serb command post controlling artillery attacks on  Gorazde. The raid was the first time NATO has used air power on  Serb forces attacking a U.N. "safe area" in Bosnia.    Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said that by giving the  go- ahead to NATO air strikes, the reputation of the world body  as a mediator in the Bosnian peace process had been seriously  impaired.    The NATO air raids also drew an angry response from Bosnian  Serbs.    Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic called off a meeting  planned for today with U.S. peace envoy Charles Redman, and one  of his senior adviser threatened to take actions against U.N.  peacekeeping troops and put the Serbs at war with the U.N. if  NATO continued to launch air raids.    Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' parliament,  said the air strikes showed that neither the U.S. nor the U.N.  wanted peace in Bosnia.    The threat of air strikes forced the Serbs to withdraw their  heavy artillery from besieged Sarajevo by February 20. Eight  days later, NATO jets shot down four Serb war planes violating  the U.N. declared no-fly zone over Bosnia.</p>

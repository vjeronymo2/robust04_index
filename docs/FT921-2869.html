			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Observer: Indecisive Perhaps it is Sir David Walker's own uncertainty about his next career move that explains the apparent difficulty in filling the chairmanship of 3i, Britain's biggest venture capitalist. Then again, it may be that 3i's clearing bank owners can never agree among themselves. Whatever the reason, the delay in filling the post is rather odd since an in-bred organisation like 3i urgently needs a familiar face at the top in the run-up to its flotation. Sir John Cuckney, who has been chairman since 1987, would be ideal, but he is stepping down, and the gossip is that the job is Sir David's. . . if he wants it. If this really is the case then it is rather disturbing. Clearing bankers may believe that the Bank of England knows best when it comes to making these sorts of appointment but putting well-known mandarins in charge of City institutions has not always worked, witness Sir Kit McMahon's unhappy tenure at the top of Midland Bank. Much better to look outside the City and appoint an industrialist with a proven track record, such as Shell's Sir Peter Holmes.</p>

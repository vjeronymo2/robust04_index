			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Japanese buying more foreign cars - Michiyo Nakamoto reports on changes in taste and value-for-money marketing The streets of Otemachi, Tokyo's business district where leading Japanese companies are based, is something of a showroom of the chosen cars of Japan's corporate establishment. Recently, a larger number of foreign cars, from Volvo estates to Cadillac Sevilles, can be spotted among the Toyotas and Nissans that have long dominated Otemachi's avenues. Imported cars are enjoying an unprecedented surge of interest in the Japanese market, which has often been criticised as unreceptive to foreign vehicles. While domestic car makers continue to suffer weak demand, with registrations down nearly 4 per cent to 1.5m units in the first four months of 1994, imported passenger car registrations rose 28 per cent year-on-year to 78,825 units. In the fiscal year between April 1993 and March this year, imported vehicles saw registrations increase 14 per cent to a record of over 217,774, according to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association. Imported passenger cars rose 10 per cent to 206,633 in the same period. That record compares with a drop in demand of 7 per cent to 6.4m for vehicles manufactured in Japan and a 6 per cent decline in domestically made cars to 4.15m units The increasing globalisation of the motor industry and the need to cultivate global markets is finding more foreign car makers keen to expand in Japan. Opel, the German car maker owned by GM, sold 17,000 cars in the first year of a distribution deal with Yanase, Japan's largest foreign car importer and retailer. Volvo, the Swedish car maker, has carried out an active marketing campaign in Japan and saw record registrations last year. Globalisation has also meant that car makers, including the Japanese, are making different cars in different countries. Honda, for example, only manufactures the Accord Wagon and Coupe in the US, where those two models were developed, and imports them into Japan. The popularity of Honda's US-made models has made the company, with 27,245 registrations, the second-largest car importer in 1993 after Mercedes-Benz, which had 29,693 cars registered. The yen's strength against leading currencies has also been a boost to imports, making them far more affordable. Rover, the UK-based car maker, for example reduced its Japanese prices last year by an average 13 per cent to reflect the yen's rise. 'The prices of our cars are not that different any more from those of domestic cars,' says a Rover representative. The general suspicion of the quality and reliability of foreign cars that pervaded Japanese consumer attitudes for decades is also gradually being replaced by interest in the different styles that foreign cars offer. 'As the generation changes, consumption patterns are freer than in the past and the attitude toward foreign products has changed,' says Mr Shoji Sugimoto, a director of Yanase. 'The nationality of foreign products no longer has that much influence,' he points out. Japanese consumers have long been concerned about the lack of service and maintenance facilities for imported cars. But more foreign car makers are following the lead of the most successful German motor companies in Japan and addressing such concerns. In addition, foreign car makers are adjusting their marketing strategies to the growing mood in Japan that favours value for money rather than luxury, and with the help of the yen's appreciation have offered value-for-money packages and low interest loans. Earlier this year Volvo offered loans at just 3 per cent while BMW, the German car maker, launched a programme that offers free maintenance for three years at a moderate price. Even luxury car makers which have long guarded their image of exclusivity have moved to accommodate the growing quest for value for money. BMW reduced prices last autumn by up to 7 per cent and Mercedes-Benz lowered its loan rates. Slow but steady changes in Japanese industry practices and government regulations, which have been criticised as hindering market access, are also taking place to the benefit of imported cars. Tokyo Nissan, a dealer affiliated with the car maker, has started to sell Ford cars, for example, in a move that is unusual in Japan where most dealers are tied to one manufacturer. Meanwhile, in its deregulation package to be finalised next month the government has proposed adjusting Japanese standards and testing methods to international levels and easing the process of acquiring official approval for imported cars, two factors which have been cited as obstacles to greater imports. 'The consumer attitude is changing, but in addition the total environment will support growth in imports,' says Mr Siegfried Richter, president of BMW Japan. Mr Richter is certain that 'efforts for deregulation will, of course, support both physical and mental openness'.</p>

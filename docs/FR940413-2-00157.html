			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the MSRB's determinations as to the amount of the de minimis exemption and limiting its application to contributions to officials for whom the municipal finance professional is entitled to vote are appropriate and reasonable. As discussed, the proposal provides specific guidelines to prevent ``pay to play'' contributions. The proposal provides an appropriate balance between limiting ``pay to play'' practices and the ability of dealers and their employees to demonstrate support for state and local candidates. The proposal recognizes that certain contributions made for legitimate political purposes present less risk of a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Although an individual may have a legitimate interest in making contributions to candidates for whom she is ineligible to vote, there is a greater risk in such circumstances that the contribution is motivated by an improper attempt to influence municipal officials. Thus, the proposal enables municipal finance professionals to contribute $250 per election to candidates for whom they are entitled to vote without triggering the proposal's business limitation. As discussed, the proposal does not prevent dealers or their employees from demonstrating support for local and state officials in other ways including volunteer political campaign activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. General Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentators believe that the proposal is operationally too burdensome to implement. These commentators believe that because of the number and types of persons subject to the rule's prohibitions, it will be difficult for municipal securities dealers to implement and enforce compliance procedures. <FOOTCITE>91</FOOTCITE>  Some commentators believe that the proposal's disclosure and recordkeeping requirements are overly burdensome. <FOOTCITE>92</FOOTCITE>  Several commentators also believe that the scope of the proposal is uncertain and recommend that it provide more complete standards regarding employee contributions, <FOOTCITE>93</FOOTCITE>  the use of consultants and law firms, <FOOTCITE>94</FOOTCITE>  bonds issued by corporations with the assistance of local governments, <FOOTCITE>95</FOOTCITE>  the definition of ``election,'' <FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>  and the definition of ``official of such issuer.'' <FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>  One commentator requests that the proposal contain a ``sunset'' provision to require the MSRB to review rule G&hyph;37 after a fixed number of years. <FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 91 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, Piper Jaffray Inc. expresses concern regarding the ability of broker-dealer firms to screen newly hired employees or current employees seeking employment with the firm's municipal securities departments, and the ability to hire civil servants. Piper Jaffray Inc. believes that ``[t]his would require firms to screen all applicants for these jobs by requiring them to declare to whom they made political contributions and make judgmental evaluations as to whether their earlier campaign activities would be potentially violative of the rule and not offer a job to any offending contributor.'' Piper Jaffray Inc. believes that this will almost certainly expose broker-dealer firms to the risk of civil litigation. Letter from William H. Ellis, President and Chief Operating Officer, Piper Jaffray Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 10, 1994). Another commentator states that ``a person who has made a contribution within the past two years apparently taints a firm which hires the individual even if the individual was not involved in the municipal securities business at the time of the contribution. Two serious problems exist. The first is that even a firm with strict reviews for hiring may find itself barred *&blank;*&blank;*. The second is that many active citizens will find themselves de facto barred from entering the public finance, banking and brokerage businesses.'' Letter from D. Kelly, A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 10, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 92 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> E.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> letter from A.B.

Price, Chairman, Federal Regulation Committee, Securities Industry Association, to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 17, 1994). The Securities Industry Association believes that the proposal's reporting provisions should be amended to: (1) Require quarterly submissions for only those quarters in which the dealer has any contributions to report; (2) delete the requirement to report lists of issuers with which the dealer conducts municipal securities business; and (3) delete the requirement to disclose the name, company, role, and compensation arrangement of any person employed by the dealer to obtain municipal securities business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 93 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc. believes that the ``provision is ambiguous. Read most broadly the definition of municipal finance professional in proposed Rule G&hyph;37 could be construed to include any retail broker who sells municipal securities *&blank;*&blank;*. As a result of the possible ambiguity and the changing application, firms employing retail brokers likely will interpret the provision broadly to avoid being barred from the municipal finance business. The result will be that numerous brokers who have no participation in securing municipal securities business will be barred from political activities.'' Letter from D. Kelly, A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 10, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 94 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> E.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from William H.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry  has told construction companies to handle on their own an  expected U.S. lawsuit over allegedly inflated work costs on a  U.S. naval base due to bid-rigging, ministry sources said  Tuesday [14 June].    In a move to distance itself from a potentially costly  bilateral row, the ministry sent a document to a construction  industry organization, saying each company is responsible for  coping with the suit, which it says is a civil case, according  to its own judgment.    The document was dated June 6 and sent to the Japan  Federation of Construction Contractors as a simple liaison. The  document is in effect designed to make clear to the United  States that the ministry has nothing to do with the case, a  senior ministry official said. "We drew up the document to  remove the misunderstanding within the U.S. Government that the  ministry is behind the alleged bid-rigging and the companies'  handling of the issue," the official said on the condition of  anonymity. "The industry should also supply clear accounts on  the case for an accurate understanding by the U.S.," he said.    The U.S. Government is seeking a total of 1.1 billion yen in  compensation from some 70 Japanese construction companies for  the alleged overcharge for work done at the base at Atsugi near  Tokyo.    Rampant alleged collusion to rig bids in construction  contracts, a practice called "dango," has been criticized by the  U.S. as a major obstacle to the U.S. companies' entry into the  Japanese construction market. The U.S. is expected to start  filing suits in autumn after the new U.S. fiscal year begins.  U.S. officials recently visited Japan to seek talks with the  companies involved, but many of them refused meetings, the  officials said. Washington wrongly views the cold shoulder as a  move orchestrated by the ministry, they said. The ministry  stressed in the document that it has given no instructions or  advice to the companies concerning the case.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKING THE GULF STALEMATE;  </P> <P> STRATEGY: TACTICS MUST SPOTLIGHT IRAQI WEAKNESSES, THUS FORCING HUSSEIN TO  CONFRONT THE COSTS OF HIS INVASION AND WEAKENING HIS GRIP ON KUWAIT.  </P> <P> Rashid Khalidi, who teaches history at the University of Chicago, spoke for  many of his deeply concerned colleagues last Sunday when he shared his fear  that the United States is proceeding, "half-blind," toward a war in the Persian  Gulf. His audience of more than 1,500 teachers and specialists was assembled --  not far from the Alamo in San Antonio, Tex. -- for the annual meeting of the  Middle East Studies Assn.  </P> <P> Guild rules require the specialists to grumble frequently about policy-makers  in Washington who do not seek -- and may even spurn -- their advice. This time,  the complaints were often coupled with general astonishment that President Bush  seems to have no one on his top decision-making team who knows very much about  the Arab world. Citing the potential backlash from the region and the dangers  involved in upsetting its balance of power, Khalidi roused his audience by  insisting that the specialists exert themselves to overcome the pro-war  "idiots' consensus" in the press.  </P> <P> But Khalidi faces a dilemma, one not unlike that bedeviling the President and  his policy-makers: Despite anxiety about war, the professor believes that  Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait must be reversed. Which prompted a  scholar from Kuwait to stand and ask the unavoidable question: How do you  propose to get Iraq out of Kuwait?  </P> <P> What's needed are military measures that, by spotlighting Iraqi weaknesses,  force Saddam Hussein to confront the cost of launching an attack on allied  forces, while simultaneously weakening his grip on Kuwait. The point is to  design steps that will withhold force as long as Iraq complies, and to make  compliance an overwhelmingly obvious choice. In contrast to the war option,  steps of this sort are likely to be widely supported in the international  community and in the U.N. Security Council.  </P> <P> Creative ideas about the calibrated use of military power against Iraq have  been offered. For example, the United States and its allies should, at the  request of the legitimate Kuwait government, protect Kuwaiti airspace from  Iraqi intruders. Given the availability of highly sophisticated battlefield  technology like AWACS, the allies could police Kuwaiti airspace with minimal  exposure of friendly aircraft.  </P> <P> Most important, this airspace option illustrates how the logic of the crisis --  yield or be attacked -- can usefully be changed to increase pressure on Iraq.  </P> <P> For a few exciting weeks in August and September, it was easy to bask in the  warm glow of a new international order and marvel at the rejuvenation of the  United Nations. But reality has a way of chilling hopes. It will be six months  or more before the embargo ordered by the U.N. Security Council really begins  to cause pain in Iraq, and time can be a fickle ally of such efforts.  </P> <P> The President has emphasized that his decision to bolster U.S. forces in the  gulf by 200,000 soldiers is intended to leave no doubt in Hussein's mind that  his demand for unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait is deadly serious.  Unmistakably, the military posture of U.S. forces is rapidly moving toward an  offensive capability.  </P> <P> But by making the threat of war more credible, the President has dramatically  stoked the fear of war. Ironically, the new deployment will likely increase  pressure on Washington to accept a compromise solution rather than push the war  button.  </P> <P> Time is a crucial dimension in the crisis, but only afterward will it be clear  whether the U.S. decision to send more troops to the gulf put time to work for  or against Hussein. The Iraqi leader has apparently calculated, not without  good reason, that he might outlast the United States and its allies.  </P> <P> By accelerating the clock and assembling what -- by almost any conceivable  standard -- is a truly remarkable fighting force, the United States has raised  what soldiers like to call the "pucker factor" for Hussein. But -- and here the  dilemma thickens for Washington -- these substantive and psychological gains  are unavoidably offset by a narrowing of options in concert with the allies.  </P> <P> The ad-hoc coalition of forces in the gulf, now numbering more than 300,000,  may remain intact only as long as it is not called to action. As the United  States strides boldly to the brink of war -- what would be the first  Arab-American war -- its allies, for the most part, are content to march in  place.  </P> <P> Though they would apparently be happy if the United States decided to crush  Iraq, the Egyptian and the Syrian governments know there are limits to what  their domestic constituencies will tolerate vis-a-vis another Arab state.  Presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Hafez Assad of Syria have emphasized that  they have not deployed forces in order to invade Iraq or Kuwait, but to defend  Saudi Arabia. Egypt wants to give the embargo at least two to three months more  time to work before upping the ante. Even then, it will move into Kuwait only  as part of a U.N. force. The European allies, with the notable exception of  Great Britain, remain committed to a diplomatic rather than a military  solution.  </P> <P> Yet it is difficult to imagine a diplomatic settlement that would satisfy both  Baghdad and Washington. Hussein says "Let's talk," but aggressively reiterates  that Kuwait is an inextricable part of Iraq. If Bush has painted himself into a  corner by refusing to entertain any outcome short of an unconditional Iraqi  withdrawal from Kuwait, Hussein, by making peace with Iran and conceding Tehran  all its war objectives, has done the same thing. If the Iraqi army withdraws  unconditionally from Kuwait, the Iraqi leader will not only have lost his war  with Iran but his confrontation with the world as well. He is too shrewd and  wily to think that he could survive in power after such a double loss.  </P> <P> It is increasingly recognized in Washington that the costs of unilateral action  are likely to be high, and thus it is essential for the United States to remain  under the U.N.'s umbrella of legitimacy. Secretary of State James A. Baker III  has emphasized that the gulf crisis is a test of the U.N.'s capacity to cope  with serious challenges to the international order in the 1990s. But even if  nine or 10 members of the Security Council could be persuaded to vote in favor  of a large-scale attack to push Hussein out of Kuwait, the risk is that the  price of military "victory" may be so high that this experiment in U.N. action  would become a negative model. For nearly three decades, the 1960 U.N.  intervention in the Congo crisis inhibited any suggestion that offensive  military actions should be taken under the U.N. banner.  </P> <P> If the gulf crisis erupts into a maelstrom of combat, the real danger is not  that the United States or its allies will lose on the battlefield, but that a  Pyrrhic victory will be won. This is why the war option makes many  policy-makers uneasy: It opens up too many routes to subsequent disasters.  </P> <P> The logic of geopolitics -- the maintaining of a balance of power between Iran  and Iraq -- also argues against a massive military assault on Iraq. Any  sensible military plan for action against Hussein and his army must be  reconciled with the axiom that a weakened Iraq necessarily produces a  strengthened Iran. As William G. Hyland, editor of Foreign Affairs, notes: "It  would be a supreme irony if the United States destroyed Iraq, thus permitting  Iran to re-emerge as the strongest power in the gulf and, in passing, also  strengthen Syria."  </P> <P> Some experts argue that Iran is currently weakened by internal problems --  economic chaos, political disorder and waning popular support -- and that the  last thing Tehran wants to do is embark on ambitious efforts to extend Iranian  influences and power. This may all be true. But a power vacuum in the gulf  would create new realities, sucking in Iran despite its disclaimers.  </P> <P> In its complexities, its dangers, its diverse effects on the world economy and  its ramifications for the international system, the gulf crisis is without  historical precedent. But the crisis, and especially its denouement, will  become a precedent for world politics in the 1990s -- and probably beyond. If  it all comes down to war, the dead will overwhelmingly be Iraqi -- and  American. History strongly hints that both sides, in retrospect, will wonder  whether war really was the only option. In retrospect, it seldom is.  </P></p>

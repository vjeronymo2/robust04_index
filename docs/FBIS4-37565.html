			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with South Yemen Presidential Council member </F> 'Abd-al-Qawiyy Makkawi by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Abu-Husayn] To begin with, will the dialogue  between you and the north lead to unity again, or are there new  proposed formulas?    [Makkawi] Unity is not subservience and annexation by force  of arms, nor is it the return of a branch to the origin, as they  say. Unity is equality, justice, and parity between two  regimes. Unity can only be forged amicably in order to promote  love and brotherhood, not the use of arms. And that can only be  achieved when intentions are sincere and trust between the  parties consolidated. As for recognition of the democratic  state, it will inevitably and without doubt come from all peace-  and stability-loving states, and it is not far off.    I have learned from consultations conducted between  officials  and the Security Council states that these states are currently  consulting among themselves in preparation for announcing their  recognition. If the other side continues to try to capture and  occupy Aden by force, it is impossible for it to achieve that.  The time of occupation, hegemony, and colonization has gone  forever. Our people will defy death and bravely defend their  land and fight the invaders to the last drop of blood. We have  seen women, children, and young men carrying guns to defend  their territory.    It is also noted that we have named the new state the  Democratic Republic of Yemen. We have not called it the  Republic of South Yemen. And we have appointed a number of  northerners in the government -- which means that we have not  ruled out the possibility of returning to unity, but on the  basis of sound democratic foundations and a new formula based on  reality.    [Abu-Husayn] If the fighting continues and the northern  leadership backtracks on the dialogue, will you seek military  assistance to rescue Aden?    [Makkawi] We do not want any foreign military intervention.  We want to rely on ourselves, which is why we have formed a  national defense council to take charge of the state of  mobilization with a view to continuing the steadfastness and the  defense. [passage omitted]    [Abu-Husayn] Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that a  unified state could be stronger at the international level and  better than partition. What is your opinion?    [Makkawi] I do not think so. I disagree with the Russian  president. We are not against unity. We are still for unity  and not against it, but in better conditions. It was President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who imposed partition through the war he is  currently waging. Unity is not annexation. Actually the unity,  which lasted formally for four years, had not been completed.  For example, the currency, ports, civil aviation, and education  curricula were not unified, nor were the Armed Forces  merged...and above all, the war came to destroy what was left of  the unity and to perpetuate secession.

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STIFF ABORTION LIMITS BECOME LAW ON GUAM  </P> <P> A bill creating the nation's most restrictive abortion statute was signed  Monday by the territorial governor. The new law was hailed by anti-abortion  forces, but civil libertarians promised to fight it.  </P> <P> "In my heart, I believe that a fetus is a human being," Republican Gov. Joseph  Ada said in signing the bill, which prohibits abortion except when the mother's  health or life is endangered.  </P> <P> The law, which was passed despite a ruling by Guam's attorney general that it  is unconstitutional, makes it a third-degree felony for a person to perform or  help in an abortion. Seeking or having an abortion or soliciting someone to  have an abortion is a misdemeanor.  </P> <P> The law provides that the Nov. 6 general election ballot include a referendum  in which residents of this Pacific Ocean island about 1,500 miles east of the  Philippines will decide whether to retain the statute.  </P> <P> Guam's 21-member unicameral Legislature unanimously approved the bill on March  8 after Archbishop Anthony Apuron threatened in an interview with a television  reporter to excommunicate any Roman Catholic senator who voted against it. All  but one of the senators are Catholic, as is Ada. However, most of the senators  said that they had been unaware of the threat.  </P> <P> Territorial Atty. Gen. Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson issued an opinion on Feb. 26  holding that the bill is unconstitutional because it violates a woman's  constitutional right to privacy.  </P> <P> Both sides of the abortion debate agree that the new law could provide a direct  challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 landmark Roe vs. Wade decision  legalizing abortion on privacy grounds.  </P> <P> The new statute cannot coexist with Roe vs. Wade, said Janet Benshoff, director  of the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project.  </P> <P> Roland Rivera, vice president of the anti-abortion Guamanians United for Life,  said the law "is the ice pick that's going to chip away at the big block of  ice" that is Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the Reproductive Freedom Project, said she  expected immediate action.  </P> <P> "It will be either a lawsuit or a negotiated agreement to suspend enforcement  pending outcome of a lawsuit," Pine said in a telephone interview from her New  York office.  </P> <P> Among those hailing the new law was the National Right to Life Committee.  </P></p>

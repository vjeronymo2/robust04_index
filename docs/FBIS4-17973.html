			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaly Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] In the near term Russia should ratify the agreement  on the leasing of the Baykonur cosmodrome signed with  Kazakhstan. Early May the Russian Space Agency (RSA) and the  Russian Foreign Ministry intend to prepare all the necessary  documents related to the agreement on the leasing of the  cosmodrome so that Russian President Boris Yeltsin would present  them to the State Duma for consideration. A top-ranking  employee of the RSA reported to Interfax that the text of  Yeltsin's letter which explains the need to ratify the agreement  as soon as possible should be prepared by Friday.    The RSA representative underlined that "the presidents'  signatures dated March 28 are not enough to hand over the  cosmodrome for lease." "The sum totalling 115 million dollars  (for the lease) is a large amount money and the decision on its  allocation should be included into the budget of the Russian  Federation," stressed he. "If this does not take place Russia  will remain without Baykonur," he said.</p>

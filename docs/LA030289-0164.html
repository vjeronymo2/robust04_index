			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> IT'S STILL HAIRY FOR BLYLEVEN, WHO YIELDS HOMER TO FIRST BATTER HE FACES  </P> <P> They have been trademarks for Bert Blyleven for years -- the home run pitch and  the bright red beard -- and as of Wednesday afternoon, both remained intact.  </P> <P> Blyleven holds the major league record for home runs allowed in a single season  -- 50 in 1986 -- and it didn't take long for his reputation to catch up with  him at Gene Autry Park. In the first inning of his first intra-squad game,  Blyleven hung a 0-and-2 breaking ball to the first batter he faced and Dante  Bichette hit it into a ditch well beyond the 365-foot sign in left field.  </P> <P> "It was windy out there," Blyleven deadpanned. "Windy as hell. In a normal  ballpark, that would have held -- except, maybe, Minnesota."  </P> <P> Blyleven immediately burst out laughing. Few parks this side of Yellowstone  would have held Bichette's blast.  </P> <P> "A little hanging sidearm breaking ball," Blyleven said. "I'm going to put that  away for a while. It's not ready to come out yet."  </P> <P> So Blyleven can still give up the long ball. Some things simply transcend  trades and uniform changes.  </P> <P> But he came close to losing the beard he has worn for more than a decade,  requiring the vote of his teammates to preserve it.  </P> <P> "I was informed by Mrs. Autry that Mr. Autry didn't like facial hair," Blyleven  said. "I offered to sit down with them and explain the reasons why I had it.  Like I told the players, I'm not here to buck the system -- I just feel  comfortable with it. And, I keep it clean-shaven."  </P> <P> But the issue proved more hairy than that. Blyleven eventually had to take his  case to Angel Manager Doug Rader and Angel Vice President Mike Port, where a  compromise was struck.  </P> <P> "They told me that if I held a team meeting . . . and if the players did not  object . . . and if other players would promise not to grow beards of their  own, then I could keep it," Blyleven said.  </P> <P> The players voted to keep Bert and the beard a tandem.  </P> <P> "It's not what you look like, it's what you do between the lines that counts,"  Blyleven said.  </P> <P> And, he added, his beard is there to improve the team's appearance.  </P> <P> "What's behind this beard, nobody wants to see," Blyleven joked. "There's just  an ugly man under this beard."  </P> <P> Mark McLemore figures to open the exhibition season as the Angels' leadoff  hitter, almost by default.  </P> <P> Brian Downing, Rader's No. 1 choice as leadoff man, has been bothered by the  rib-cage injury that plagued him through much of the 1988 season and will miss  this weekend's trip to Yuma, where the Angels will play three games against the  San Diego Padres.  </P> <P> Johnny Ray, McLemore's rival in the team's second base derby, strained his  right hamstring during running drills Wednesday and has also been scratched  from the Yuma trip. Ray's injury is not considered serious, but Rader is  beginning to worry about Downing's.  </P> <P> "If Brian is healthy, the general consensus of the (coaching) staff is that  we'd be best with him leading off," Rader said. "But he's had a problem with  his side, the same thing he had last year, and he hasn't made that much  progress."  </P> <P> Six Angels remain unsigned and, with Mike Port's Friday deadline at hand,  center fielder Devon White believes he's headed for an automatic contract  renewal. "That's what happened last year -- and the year before that," White  said. "This is pretty much the same thing. It's been a source of aggravation."  </P> <P> Port renewed White's contract in both 1987 and 1988, but kept negotiating with  White beyond the deadline last spring and reached a one-year, $185,000  agreement.  </P> <P> This spring, after winning a Gold Glove in 1988, White is seeking a salary in  the range of fellow third-year veteran Kevin Seitzer of Kansas City. Seitzer  recently signed a one-year contract for $340,000.  </P></p>

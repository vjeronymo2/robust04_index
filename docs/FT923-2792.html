			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The limits of force in Bosnia THIS WEEK'S UN decision to authorise the dispatch to Bosnia of an additional 6,000 troops is a fitting, if belated, response to the prospect of a humanitarian calamity in the former Yugoslav republic this winter. Given the fullest commitment of food, medicine and other aid to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the reinforcements should permit a quickening of the Bosnian relief effort in coming weeks. But it is important that the governments whose troops are now to be placed in the firing line recognise both the risks that such an operation entails, and the limits on what it can achieve. In particular, those responsible should be explaining their objectives much more clearly to their own electorates and to those caught up in the conflict. Without such clarity, there is a real danger that the western military forces protecting aid convoys could be sucked into a Lebanese-style quagmire, incurring heavy casualties and facing a choice between still heavier intervention and a humiliating retreat. What, precisely, is the international community trying to do in Bosnia? That there is confusion is scarcely surprising given the complexity of the conflict, the seriousness of the mistakes committed by western governments over the past year, and the profound reluctance with which they have now become more directly involved. But the question needs answering. Is the UN moving, as is being claimed in some quarters, from peace-keeping where there is no peace to keep, towards peace-making? If so, it is certain to fail. The level of forces now being committed will not suffice to raise the sieges around Bosnian towns or provide safety for the 2m refugees uprooted by Serb forces. Still less does this week's move bring the UN any closer to an ability to force the parties to stop fighting. A protectorate in Bosnia would require tens of thousands more troops, a commitment which neither western public opinion nor the hard-pressed UN is prepared to contemplate. The 15,000 UN troops in eastern Croatia are themselves over-stretched in keeping a peace to which the parties to the conflict have grudgingly agreed. In Bosnia, no such will to stop the fighting is yet discernible. Any extension of the UN's mandate permitting foreign troops to do more than defend themselves if attacked would rob them of the perceived impartiality which they need to carry out their job, and expose them to greater danger. It might also jeopardise the continuing Geneva peace talks. Under such circumstances, the UN should go out of its way to draw a distinction between its military protection of humanitarian aid efforts on the one hand, and its efforts to restrain the fighting (for example, by placing all heavy weapons under UN control) on the other. Both activities - one under the UNHCR, the other overseen by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the EC and UN mediators - will need more manpower and resources. They will also have to be accompanied by an intensification of sanctions pressure on Serbia, and by the dispatch of more observers to Bosnia's borders to stem the flow of weapons from Croatia and Serbia. Even determined action on all these fronts scarcely offers a prospect of rapid progress. The governments now preparing to dispatch troops had better be ready for a long haul, and concentrate in the short term on doing what they can to save lives.</p>

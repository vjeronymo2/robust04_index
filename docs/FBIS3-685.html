			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The leader of the Somali National Alliance, SNA,  and chairman of the United Somali Congress, USC, Mohamed Farah  Aidid has delivered a very important speech to the Somali  people. In it he discussed the current situation in the country  and the SNA's political role. Aidid, who delivered the speech  in Nairobi, Kenya, sent warm greetings in which he expressed his  confidence and great love for the Somali people. He  congratulated them on the advent of the holy month of Ramadan,  wished them a successful completion of Ramadan, and further  wished them a blessed and prosperous [word indistinct].    Explaining his long absence from the country, Chairman Aidid  said that this was due to the difficult situation facing the  country. Giving a detailed explanation of the outcome of his  talks in Nairobi, the chairman said his efforts were being  directed towards: a) bringing the Somalis closer together so as  to reach a lasting peace; b) forming a government of national  unity, and; c) giving precise information to the world at large  on the true situation prevailing in Somalia and on the SNA's  program on ways of addressing the issues facing Somalia.    On the SNA's contacts with various factions and their  supporters, the chairman said: We have established a temporary  base in Nairobi, Kenya because members of many Somali  organizations are residing in Kenya. This will help us dispel  the doubts and skepticism bred in Somalis by the civil war. The  chairman added that, because during the past few years Somali  communities had had no direct contacts, it was imperative that  they engaged in consultations, talks, meetings, exchanges of  ideas and detailed discussions, face to face.    On the outcome of those steps, Chairman Aidid said: Somalis  and organizations we met understood the need for brotherhood and  understanding, and declared their readiness to strive to bring  lasting peace to the country and to participate in the  reconstruction of the Somali nation. He went on to say that the  benefits derived from the meetings and understanding reached  included consensus on the need to establish peace in every part  of the country where hostilities prevail between the Somali  communities. He added: We have agreed to ensure that  confrontation and fighting in Kismaayo, Lower Jubba and its  environs will cease in line with the peace that has been  established in the central and northern regions of Somalia.    Referring to the overall political scene, the SNA leader and  chairman of the USC said that the SNA shared identical views  with many individuals and political organizations on issues  affecting the Somali people's interests. He said: This paves  the way for the formation of a government of national unity.  Mr. Aidid said he was delighted that during his stay in Nairobi  with his delegation, a fifth peace-loving Somali faction, the  Somali peace-loving union, SPLU [preceding word in English] had  joined the SNA. He added that other factions had also applied  to join the SNA.    On the SNA's foreign policy, Chairman Aidid said that he and  his delegation got the opportunity to visit several countries in  eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, where they held fruitful  meetings and exchanged views with their presidents. Mr. Aidid  added: We also held talks with high level delegations from  other countries, such as America, Russia, Italy, Eritrea,  Ethiopia, Uganda and Sudan. We also met delegations from donor  countries and the OAU deputy secretary general, ambassadors and  many diplomats, all of whom were interested in Somali affairs.  He said: During our meeting with these delegations, we  realized that the world now understands us and supports our  stance that Somalia be left alone to decide its destiny.    Mr. Aidid said that the world had realized that the  aggression launched by the United States and UN Operation  Somalia [UNOSOM] on the Somali people resulting in many being  killed and a lot of public and private property destroyed was  ill-advised. The chairman of the SNA and USC stated: The whole  world has now agreed that the incorrect policy of UNOSOM must be  completely changed. This had been stated in two resolutions  passed by the UN Security Council on Somalia, 855 and 879. It  had also been confirmed that the new organizations assigned to  Somalia's reconstruction and rehabilitation would be completely  independent of UNOSOM. The change could also be seen in the  complete change and removal of those leaders of UNOSOM who were  involved in the crisis that took place. The chairman of the SNA  and USC said: In response to the UN's new policies, we recently  held talks with the new UNOSOM leadership and agreed that  Somalia is to be left alone to decide its own destiny, and for  UNOSOM to help in this respect, with the UNOSOM forces being  confined to safeguarding the humanitarian program and the safety  of those working in relief activities.    On the need to gain maximal benefits from the international  relief program, the chairman said: It is imperative that we  devote our total attention and join hands to ensure peace and  the reconstruction of our country as we are now free to direct  our affairs. He further added: We have a great responsibility  in safeguarding the foreigners who have come from distant places  -- for no other purpose other than to help us through the  difficult situation facing our country. He added: It is worth  noting that the international relief program has a time limit  and limited resources. That is why it is imperative for the  Somali people to facilitate the relief program, so that they can  derive maximal benefits whether they are inside or outside the  country.    Aidid also said: We must ensure that the UNOSOM forces  leaving our country are allowed to do so in total peace, and are  left to leave our country honorably.    In conclusion, the chairman of the SNA and USC greatly  lauded  the UNSC, the donor nations, the governments of the Horn of  Africa and all those who gave a helping hand to change the  policies of UNOSOM in Somalia and restore respect for UN on the  part of the member states. The chairman also thanked the U.S.  Administration and people, who courageously rectified their  mistakes after fully realizing the true situation in Somalia.  Chairman Aidid similarly thanked the Ethiopian Government,  which made great efforts to bring about a change in the policy  of UNOSOM on Somalia, as well as playing an important part in  reconciling the SNA and the new leadership of UNOSOM.  Concluding his speech, Chairman Aidid called for peace,  justice, unity and progress.</p>

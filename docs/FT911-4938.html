			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: Sharply reduced losses at LIT LIT HOLDINGS, the transatlantic futures clearing and corporate finance group which last November agreed a Pounds 26.2m refinancing with its bankers, yesterday said that it had made a 'promising start' to the current year as it reported sharply reduced losses for 1990. The pre-tax deficit was Pounds 344,000. After a Pounds 499,000 extraordinary credit for realisations net of provisions, retained profit was Pounds 215,000. LIT said that net borrowings had fallen to Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 51m) by the year-end, which compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 1.2m). Shareholders' funds were buoyed by Pounds 5.75m worth of convertible capital bonds issued as part of the refinancing and converted into first preference shares two months ago. First preference shareholders will become entitled to their maiden dividend at the end of June. No dividend for the year is being paid on an old issue of preference shares or the ordinary shares. Losses per share were 3p. Mr Christopher Castleman, chief executive, struck a cautiously optimistic note on current year trading. 'This patient is showing some distinct signs of life,' he said. So far profits of LIT America, which provides clearing and other services to the US futures market, were substantially ahead against a background of weak commodities markets. Johnson Fry, the UK financial services company, experienced a jump in Business Expansion Scheme activity: it had raised Pounds 51m during the first quarter compared with Pounds 18m in 1990. Enterprise Zone issues were also up. Results for 1989 were extensively restated to reflect last year's restructuring which involved some 30 disposals, releasing about Pounds 35m, and consolidation of remaining interests into two core businesses. Mr Castleman said this was compatible with the recommendations on accounting for discontinued activities made last week by the Accounting Standards Board. Restated losses available to ordinary shareholders remain at Pounds 21.2m. But Pounds 2.6m of what was originally a Pounds 14.2m extraordinary debit has been brought up into losses before taxation, increasing that figure to Pounds 4.46m. Losses per share were 13.4p against a previously reported 8.7p. In 1990, turnover was Pounds 91.14m (Pounds 114.27m). LIT America made operating profits of Pounds 2.52m (against a restated Pounds 4.04m) and Johnson Fry Pounds 1.59m (restated Pounds 1.76m). Central costs, which include a loss of Pounds 421,000 from discontinued activities against a prior-year profit of Pounds 2.83m, were Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 10.25m). The refinancing involved, besides an open offer and placing of convertible capital bonds, preference shares in the holding company for Johnson Fry and a new medium term loan.</p>

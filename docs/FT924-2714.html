			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Ministers rapped by Labour on homeless THE Labour party last night attacked as 'complacent' the government response to figures showing that the numbers of homeless families in temporary accommodation have reached record levels. Environment Department statistics released yesterday showed that the number of homeless families living in temporary accommodation in September was 65,230. That was 8 per cent up on the previous year and a new record, continuing the steep rise from the 1980 figure of 4,170. Sir George Young, the housing minister, commented on the figures by describing as 'most encouraging' the fall in the number temporarily housed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation - down from 13,550 in September 1991 to 10,390 this year. He said that reflected the success of government initiatives. Sir George also welcomed the small decline in the number becoming homeless, which fell to 35,520 in the third quarter of 1991 from 36,380 in the same quarter of 1991. The proportion made homeless because of mortgage arrears fell from 12 per cent in last year to 9 per cent this year. Mr John Battle, opposition housing spokesman, said that the minister's response was 'riddled with complacency'. He said: 'In the past year alone, almost 100 families a week have been added to the growing number of people in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, hostels and other overcrowded accommodation.' At Westminster, Mr Tony Newton, standing in for Mr John Major at prime minister's question time, insisted that government measures had led to a fall over the past year in the number of families described as homeless. Mr Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, suggested that the houses of parliament should be used during the Christmas recess as shelter for those sleeping in the streets.</p>

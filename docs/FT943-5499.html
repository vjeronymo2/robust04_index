			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fund management boosts Schroders Schroders, the merchant bank, yesterday insisted that it wanted to remain independent from securities brokers in the UK as it disclosed a 7.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the 1994 first half to Pounds 103.2m. Mr George Mallinckrodt, chairman, said there was no intention of buying a stake in a broker such as Cazenove &amp; Co or Smith New Court in an effort to become an integrated investment bank similar to SG Warburg. Mr Mallinckrodt spoke after rumours that Schroders might follow its acquisition of the remaining 42.5 per cent of its US subsidiary Wertheim Schroder with a UK acquisition helped drive up shares in the lead-up to its results. Schroders did not believe it needed to distribute securities in the UK, and there was no pressure from its customers to be able to do so. 'We are not doctrinaire about it, but we absolutely do not believe we need it now,' he said. Schroders announced a 50 per cent rise in its interim dividend to 6p (4p) after earnings per share rose to 56.6p (55.1p). But Mr Mallinckrodt said this was partly to restore the interim to being about one third of the total. 'I am anxious to make it clear this does not mean there is another significant dividend increase in the pipeline next year,' he said. Net asset value per share rose to 572p from 474p, and shares closed 25p down at Pounds 14.78p. Earnings from fund management nearly doubled to Pounds 40.6m (Pounds 22.7m), while those from merchant and investment banking fell from Pounds 73.2m to Pounds 62.6m. The fall in the latter was mostly due to a drop in dealing income from Pounds 32.8m to Pounds 18.4m. Expenses rose to Pounds 157.2m from Pounds 132.5m. Mr Mallinckrodt said this was mostly because it had taken on 300 extra staff, but partly because it had provided more in the first half this year against bonuses to be paid for the full year. The fund management business gained from a strong inflow of new business, and funds under management grew from Pounds 52.9bn to Pounds 53.1bn despite a fall in market values. Corporate finance activity also picked up through mergers and acquisitions. Capital increased by Pounds 64m but Dollars 76m (Pounds 51m) will be absorbed by a goodwill write-off from the Wertheim acquisition. The write-off comprises a Dollars 41m premium over book value, and Dollars 35m of goodwill carried in Wertheim Schroder's accounts. Mr Mallinckrodt said the price was 'at the topside' but the overall purchase price including that for the original stake in Wertheim was advantageous.</p>

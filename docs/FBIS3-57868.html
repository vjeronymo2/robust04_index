			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F> announcer Bruno Masure -- live]    [Text] [Masure] Yesterday, live from Zagreb on our 1300  bulletin, French General Jean Cot said his 30,000 blue helmets  are ready for an offensive intervention if, of course, he has  the permission of the UN secretary general. Thank you, Francois  Leotard, for being with us this evening. Is such intervention  conceivable and envisaged?    [Leotard] It is conceivable and envisaged. At this very  moment, we have troops taking action or responding to fire in  some places when it is necessary. One should know that this  action should not be taken without careful consideration because  air bombing or action to break blockades would and can have  repercussions on our troops on the ground. In other terms, one  should be careful when one talks about these issues. We are in  a very difficult situation on the ground and the use of force  should not be resorted to to worsen the situation of the blue  helmets who are still not engaged in hostilities and who are  there either for humanitarian reasons in Bosnia or for  peacekeeping in Croatia. One should understand that the  military situation as such demands a lot of sangfroid,  abnegation, and dedication which in fact honor the blue helmets,  be they French or from other nationalities.    [Masure] It seems that we are heading toward the withdrawal  of the Canadian troops, according to what we are hearing this  evening. Do you agree with the statement of Jacques Baumel,  deputy chairman of the Defense Commission of the National  Assembly, who said that the impotent presence of French blue  helmets is meaningless?    [Leotard] No, I don't share this opinion and I will tell you  why. First, we are there because the parties to the conflict  asked us. We are there because the role we are playing at this  very moment is still useful. We are still protecting women and  children. We are escorting convoys that allow them to live or  survive. Finally, we should think carefully about the  consequences of a withdrawal. I will tell you what the  consequences of a withdrawal would be if we are compelled to go:  the spread of the conflict to the whole of the Balkans, the  likely capture of Sarajevo by the Serbs, and thus a massive  deportation of population, the capture of Srebrenica and some  other enclaves, and the resumption of hostilities with heavy  weapons on some fronts in Croatia. Obviously we are facing  something which is not a success; it is undeniable and it hurts  the heart when one looks at the pictures. However, as far as I  am concerned, and I hope everybody would do the same, I would  not say anything that would discourage our soldiers or undermine  their action or their morale, and both are needed at the moment.    [Masure] You were reminding us a moment ago that we are  there  because we were asked to go by the main parties to this  conflict. At the ceremony when he presented his new year wishes  to the press, Alain Juppe said: We have been betrayed by  everyone, all the factions. None of the factions wants peace,  and all are preparing for war.    [Leotard] Unfortunately, what he says is true. That's to  say, yet again we have those who are holding discussions in  Geneva -- there they are polite, civilized, courteous, very  understanding. And then it is the same people, or their  associates, who, on the ground, are stepping up attacks against  our forces, or stepping up their battles with the other sides in  the conflict.    So I have every sympathy with what General Cot said. He is  right to say it: You have to choose between these two roles.  Either you discuss peace with us, or you make war on the  ground. But as far as we are concerned -- and I am saying this  publicly to the French people, because they have to know it --  we have not declared war on anyone. We are there because we are  defending our values, and if we did not, it would be a terrible  abdication of responsibility by Europe. We are there because we  want to avoid a failure for the United Nations, for NATO, for  Europe. And we are there because otherwise we would be  abandoning the civilian population.    Of course, we are not going to stay there to the point of  absurdity. At the proper moment, probably in spring, we will  have to discuss with our partners, with the United Nations, the  conditions under which we will stay there.    [Masure] Next Monday and Tuesday [10-11 January] there is a  summit of the Atlantic alliance in Brussels. Alain Juppe has  hinted at a new initiative. What might it be? Do you share the  pessimism of David Owen, who is very familiar with the case, and  who is talking of a possible withdrawal of all the UN  peacekeeping forces in spring?    [Leotard] That would be an astounding failure, much more  serious than today's failure. But of course, we have to look at  all possibilities. When we hold this NATO summit next week, we  will express the hope, we will ask the United States, for  example, to intervene and help us, to ensure that this hotbed of  war does not spread over the whole of southern Europe and the  Balkans. This is our responsibility. As you know, as everyone  knows, this is where the First World War started. So we have to  be very careful, and France -- this redounds to its honor -- has  stepped up its diplomatic and military initiatives to prevent  this conflict from spreading.    So let us keep our cool. It is difficult. It is a very  thankless task, but personally, I should like to express my  support for these soldiers, most of them French, as you know,  who are trying today, as best they can, exhausted and  demoralized, to save women and children. We must not let them  down, these women and children.    [Masure] Thank you, Francois Leotard, for having discussed  this delicate matter with us.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THORNBURGH VOWS TO BE FIRM ON CIVIL RIGHTS  </P> <P> Some Americans may be in for "rougher and tougher" treatment from the Justice  Department as it helps implement President Bush's version of "a kinder, gentler  America," Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh declared Monday.  </P> <P> Although he did not spell out what measures the Justice Department will take,  Thornburgh vowed that there will be "firm law enforcement" in several areas,  including civil rights and environmental protection and illegal drug  trafficking. "Very high priority" will be given to prosecuting any law  enforcement officers linked to drug trafficking, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reagan Officials Accused  </P> <P> During Ronald Reagan's eight years as President, his Administration was widely  accused of shunning civil rights leaders and of failing to adequately enforce  environmental and civil rights laws.  </P> <P> Thornburgh stressed that he already has met with civil rights leaders and that  under Bush they have access to the Justice Department and are being consulted  on civil rights cases.  </P> <P> Already, he said, some civil rights leaders have "grudgingly agreed" that there  may be instances where they will agree with the Justice Department that old  court orders decreeing school desegregation should be terminated because the  schools are now desegregated and the orders are not needed.  </P> <P> During the Reagan Administration, he said, the department "aroused a great deal  of animosity" when it moved to terminate such orders without consulting civil  rights groups.  </P> <P> In 1987, the Justice Department sent out its first letters seeking to remove  desegregation orders from schools that it said had become integrated. A civil  rights group -- the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- contested the  department's attempt to strip the orders from 11 districts, all in Georgia. In  the words of one department attorney, "substantial litigation ensued," and so  far none of the cases have been dismissed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Animosity' Developed  </P> <P> Bush's primary goal, Thornburgh said, is to re-establish lines of communication  with civil rights groups that became "snarled" during the Reagan years and to  "reduce the apparent level of animosity" that developed between them and the  White House.  </P> <P> While civil rights groups often found themselves aligned against the Justice  Department in civil rights cases during the Reagan Administration, Thornburgh  said that under Bush the department and the groups can make "joint assaults" on  problems as they "work together to solve the nation's civil rights problems."  </P> <P> Thornburgh, interviewed at a luncheon session with reporters, also disclosed  that the Justice Department soon will announce a special task force to work  with U.S. attorneys in the mushrooming investigation of fraud in Chicago's  commodities markets.  </P> <P> He called it a "serious and substantial" investigation that has included  extensive FBI undercover work, but he declined to say when criminal charges are  expected. The Justice Department task force, he said, will coordinate the work  of several U.S. attorneys.  </P> <P> Thornburgh, who was appointed attorney general by Reagan last July and  reappointed by Bush, bristled when a reporter suggested that he had been  reluctant to criticize his predecessor, Edwin Meese III, even though the  Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility filed a report  accusing Meese of ethical violations while in office.  </P> <P> "I'm not reluctant to criticize him," Thornburgh said, adding that he had  released to the public the department's report of how Meese had "violated  departmental and governmental ethical standards."  </P></p>

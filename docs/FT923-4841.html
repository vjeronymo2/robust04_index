			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: Dave Valentin at the Jazz Cafe WHAT has happened to the flute? There was a time when music was bristling with the things - from the Arran-knit folk of James Galway to the 'gentry' rock of Ian Anderson's Jethro Tull. Jazz music too has had an on-off affair with the most fragile of wind instruments, usually where it has been wielded as a second choice to the sturdier saxophone. The late Eric Dolphy and Roland Rahsaan Kirk were wild about it, the tradition being just about continued by tenor/alto player James Moody. Apart from him though, and our own Eddie Parker, the instrument seems to have been sidelined in recent years. American Dave Valentin, heard at Camden's Jazz Cafe for three nights this week, is a full blown flautist, however, who is equipped to redress the balance. His playing is lively Latin jazz first, and alluring world music second. Unfortunately, away from his New York-based quintet and accompanied instead by a taciturn five-piece jump band in the cold environment of the Jazz Cafe, it proved hard for Valentin to generate much heat. Not that he didn't try hard. With a broad selection of standards from Wayne Shorter's 'Footprints' to Gershwin's 'I love you, Porgy', Valentin's robust playing and tough intonation showed that the flute can still be an easy alternative to the reed. Technically accomplished in the regular registers (he was taught as a youngster by arch-jazz flautist Hubert Laws), Valentin overblows energetically, putting substance and solidity into the usually airy notes of the instrument. Often, he expands the flute's vocabulary further by bringing his huge collection of 'ethnic' flutes and pipes into the act. At Camden he dug into a kitbag full of Peruvian pipes and Bolivian flutes for a solo and improvised skit which employed reverb and delay. This technique, often used nowadays with strings and where the soloist accompanies himself via the echo chamber, must be a new departure for the flute. Here Valentin's eery voicings, blown over a repeating and bleeping cycle of notes, added a new dimension to the most universal and folk-rooted of instruments.</p>

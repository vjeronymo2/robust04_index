			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The appraisers concluded that the value of public land grazing ranged from $4.68 per head month (equivalent to BLM's AUM for billing purposes) in the southwest pricing region to $8.55 per head month in the northern plains pricing region. In 1992, the appraisal was updated, based on additional data for private grazing lease rates gathered during 1991. The update found no change in the $4.68 per head month value of grazing in the southwest pricing region, and found an increase to $10.26 per head month in the northern plains pricing region. The $4.68 appraisal value is the lowest of the appraised values and is considered a reasonable amount on which to base a westwide fee. Using the lowest of the appraised values would minimize the impact on livestock grazing permittee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would establish a new base value of $3.96 per AUM by averaging the results of the two studies ($3.25 plus $4.68 divided by 2 equals $3.96). By averaging these two values the base value is established in consideration of the economic value of the forage and costs of production. After an initial phase-in period, the fee would be adjusted annually by multiplying the base value by the Forage Value Index (FVI), which reflects the change in the private grazing land lease rate in the 17 western States weighted by the number of public AUMs sold in each State. The private grazing land lease rate estimate is prepared annually by the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service. Although the FVI does not explicitly use indices based on production costs or on the value of the livestock produced, both of these factors influence the prices paid for grazing livestock on private lands and, therefore, are implicit in the forage value index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of the FVI in this proposed rule has been changed from the definition presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. In the advance notice the FVI was to be calculated by dividing the prior year weighted average AUM price on private grazing lands in the 17 western States by the weighted average AUM price on private grazing lands in the 17 western States during the years 1990 through 1992. That method would have established 1990 through 1992 as the base years from which the Federal grazing fee would be indexed. Beginning in 1994, the FVI would have been used to calculate the Federal grazing fee under the advance proposal. In this proposed rule, the concept of the FVI has been retained but the FVI base year would be 1996 and the FVI would not be used to calculate the Federal grazing fee until 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of this change in the FVI base year is to address the concern that the FVI calculation proposed in the advance notice would have resulted in adjusting the Federal grazing fee by several years' worth of change in private grazing land lease rates, resulting in an uncertain and possibly significant jump or drop in the calculated fee. Under this proposed rule the FVI would first be used in calculating the 1997 grazing fee and would be based on the 1996 private grazing land lease rates in each of the 17 western States. By definition, the FVI in the year 1997 would equal one, resulting in a 1997 grazing fee equal to the base value. In subsequent years the fee would reflect changes from the 1996 private grazing land lease rates. The Department recognizes that basing the FVI in a single year, as opposed to the three year average presented in the advance notice, could result in slightly greater volatility in the index. However, the Department feels this potential volatility in the index, given the relative stability in the private grazing land lease rates and the limitation on annual fluctuations discussed below, is overshadowed by the need to avoid some of the uncertainty associated with an FVI based on less current data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grazing fee charged in 1994 is $1.98 per AUM. Under this proposed rule the formula would result in a grazing fee in 1997 of $3.96. The fee would be phased-in by establishing the 1995 grazing fee at $2.75, and the 1996 fee at $3.50. Thereafter, except as explained below, the fee would be calculated by multiplying the $3.96 base value by the FVI. After the phase-in, the grazing fee would be allowed to change by no more than 25 percent annually, plus or minus, from the amount charged the previous year. The phase-in and the 25 percent per year limit are intended to moderate the impact of fee changes on livestock operations and ranching communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

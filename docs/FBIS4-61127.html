			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] On Monday [2 May], the German ambassador acting on  behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, accompanied by  the two other "troika-members," the Danish ambassador and the  French charge d'affaires, made a demarche with the foreign  minister of Estonia in connection with slow implementation of  the aliens law, the German Embassy in Estonia informed ETA.    "The European Union expresses concern to the Estonian  Government regarding the implementation by Estonian authorities  of some aspects of the aliens law which came into force on 12  July 1993," the demarche says. "The European Union considers  that all state organs, including the parliament, have a  particular role in stabilizing the situation of the non-citizens  and in contributing towards their future integration into  Estonian society," it continues.    Estonian Foreign Ministry press service told ETA that at the  meeting with Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik, the "European  Union stressed that it accepts Estonian aliens law and its  juridical logic."    Spokeswoman of the Ministry Mari-Ann Rikken told ETA that  the  demarche had no connection whatsoever with the Russian troop  withdrawal issue from Estonia and European Union still demanded  Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by 31 August 1994,  connecting it to no other issues.    Rikken said that the demarche was caused by discontent of  the  EU in the slow application of the law, which has caused "tension  and dissatisfaction" among non-citizens.    Last week, the ruling coalition decided at its two-day  meeting in Lohusalu near Tallinn, that the implementation of the  aliens law had to be prolonged and most probably the application  deadline for residence and working permits for the aliens will  be prolonged for one year from the present 12 July 1994  deadline. Deputy head of the ruling Fatherland Party Kalle  Jurgenson told the POSTIMEES daily that in the nearest future a  respectable bill on amending the aliens law will be handed in to  Riigikogu [parliament] proceedings.</p>

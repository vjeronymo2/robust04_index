			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Compelling logic of sale that points to secure future The takeover of Lancer Boss may not be to everyone's taste - including a man who wrote to the receivers complaining bitterly about the sale to a German company - but for its workers and managers it has a compelling industrial logic. The sale to Jungheinrich of Hamburg means the last significant UK-owned lift truck producer has passed into foreign hands. But precedent suggests the deal will mean a new beginning for the company based in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Five years ago, Lansing Bagnall, the great rival of Lancer Boss in the UK lift truck industry, was short of money and heading for trouble. It would probably never have made it through the recent recession had it not been purchased in 1989 by Linde of Germany, the world's biggest lift truck company. The Basingstoke-based company, now called Lansing Linde, has become an important part of Linde's global product and manufacturing strategy. If the optimism and bonhomie yesterday at Leighton Buzzard were anything to go by, Lancer Boss - or Boss as it will now be called - is destined for a similarly secure future under Jungheinrich's ownership. Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB) and one of Germany's best known UK-based German industrialists, pointed out that the booms and busts of the UK lift truck market were far more pronounced than in Germany or elsewhere in Europe. He said it was very difficult for a company of Lancer's size to manufacture under those conditions. The takeover by the financially strong Jungheinrich should make it much easier for Boss to weather recessions. It also brings Jungheinrich a highly regarded product range that will make the German company a much stronger third company in the increasingly global lift truck markets. Jungheinrich has already purchased Steinbock Boss - Lancer's German arm - from its German receiver. Crucially, it brings Jungheinrich a manufacturing plant in a relatively low-cost country making engined products complementary to its own electric trucks. Yesterday this gave the 700 workers at Boss a sense of security after all the uncertainty of the past four weeks. There are no plans to expand production but Dr Hans-Peter Schmohl, a senior Jungheinrich manager, said: 'If we do expand we will do it here.'</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (16): Weak borsa points the way for a fall - David Lane digs deep to discover why Europe's third largest economy has only 23 representatives in this year's FT500 and why most companies have dropped in the rankings / Italy UNCOVERING Italian entries in this year's FT500 takes patience and a sharp eye. It is necessary to dig deep to find the first, insurer Generali Assicurazioni at 23rd place. And the second is much further down, Turin automobile group Fiat scraping into the leading 100 at 94. With only Generali and Fiat earning places among the first 100, notwithstanding its position as Europe's third largest economy behind Germany and France (measured by GDP), Italy is under-represented among the biggest companies. This under-representation is, however, a feature from top to bottom of the FT500. Italian names are even harder to find in 1992's listing than in previous years. Only 23 companies win places, compared to last year's 34. Just one third of the Italian contingent makes the first half of 1992's FT500, while another third falls into the bottom 100 with rankings lying between 400 and 500. Excluding Italy's one new entry, only four Italian names moved upwards, none making dramatic leaps. On the other hand, there were some noteworthy falls in the generally downward movement, with six entries dropping more than 100 places. An important factor behind Italy's poor showing was the weak performance of the stock market. Last year continued the run of disappointing years for investors in Italian stocks. When the market closed at the end of September 1992, the Comit general index (1972 base 100) registered 364. A year earlier it stood at 539. Between September and year-end 1991 the slide had been limited, the Comit general index closing 1991 at 508. But a heavy reversal wiped nearly 30 per cent off the total capitalisation of quoted companies in the first nine months of 1992. (Reset to 1000 at the start of every calendar year, the MIB index stood at 706 on September 30.) From L5,200 Fiat ordinary shares fell to L3,460 in the year to September 30, 1992, a drop of 33.5 per cent. Shares in Olivetti suffered even more. Their price dropped from L2,920 to L1,681, a 42.4 per cent fall that helped take one of Italy's leading industrial names out of the FT500. (Olivetti had held 375th place in 1991's Top 500.) The sharp fall in the share prices of both Fiat, badly hit by a declining share of its home automobile market and facing difficult times in the commercial vehicle sector, and Olivetti, suffering as much as any leading computer maker, reflects the heavy impact of adverse economic conditions on profits. And expectations for the short and medium term are not bright in much of Italian manufacturing. Shares in financial and service sector companies were not faring much better. The share price of Italmobiliare, the holding company of the Pesenti family which controls cement leader Italcementi, crashed in the year to September 30, 1992, from L73,000 to L28,350, and the company dropped out of the FT500. It was 107th in 1991. Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura also left the FT500, having previously been ranked 327th. Indeed, all the banks in 1991's listing have lower positions this year. The ranking of Milan investment bank Mediobanca fell from 117 to 186, reflecting the drop in share price from L15,020 to L9,400. And Italy's largest private sector bank, Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (BAV), suffered a similar fall from 279 to 348. BAV's share price fell from L4,510 to L3,095 during the year. Both Banca Commerciale Italiana (Comit) and Credito Italiano, controlled by the IRI state holding corporation and now subjects for privatisation, slipped back. Comit's position worsened from 166 to 250 and Credito Italiano's from 190 to 261. Over the year their share prices fell from L4,440 to L2,838 and from L2,440 to L1,743 respectively. (Privatisation prospects have since provided a boost, and at year-end 1992 Comit's shares stood at L4,677 and Credito Italiano's at L3,160.) The positions of two of Italy's leading commercial banks spotlight another key factor causing Italian under-representation in the FT500: Italy lacks large companies. Comit and Credito Italiano stand above their national competitors in a banking sector with about 1,100 different banks, but they are small by international standards. Scottish, Irish and Danish banks, as well as Dutch and Belgian, rank higher in the FT500. Only a process of concentration will remedy this situation and lift Italian banks to the levels of the European leaders. A factor that tells against a higher-ranked Italian contingent in the FT500 is the practice of quoting more than one company of the same group. Comit, for example, controls two banks that have stock market quotation, the Banco di Chiavari and the Banca di Legnano. Equally, industrial groups are characterised by cascades of holdings and operating companies, or fragmented structures. IFI, the quoted holding company of the Agnelli family, controls Fiat, IFIL and Unicem, all of which are quoted. And the Fiat Group's consolidated accounts include quoted companies like La Rinascente (retailing), Toro (insurance), Gilardini and Marelli (engineering). Ravenna-based Ferruzzi is similar in having several quoted companies. The Italian 'borsa' (stock market) is, in any case, very small. There were only 376 quoted securities at the end of September 1992, an increase of 10 on the previous year. Moreover, companies often have more than one type of security listed, their ordinary shares being flanked by convertible or non-convertible savings shares. The 1991 year book of the Milan stockbrokers' executive committee records that only 224 different companies enjoyed stock market listings at the year end. Only a handful have joined their ranks since then. An inclement economic and financial climate has been a disincentive to Italian companies to seek quotation. And the borsa's reputation for non-transparency and as a market for speculators rather than serious investors has also been a deterrent. But while legislation enacted during recent years has helped to improve the borsa's image, adverse conditions have worked against enlargement. Attilio Ventura, chairman of the Milan stockbrokers' executive committee, says that the Italian stock market has made gigantic strides over the past decade, and that these have brought it into line with principal foreign markets. 'But this renewal has only partly been matched by revitalisation of the board,' said Mr Ventura. Yet the potential exists. A study commissioned by the executive committee, and published in May last year (1992), found 851 quotable companies outside groups with companies that are already quoted. The study showed that the number of companies quoted on Milan's borsa at the end of October 1991 was much smaller than London, Frankfurt, Paris and Luxembourg. Moreover, the number was half of that in Amsterdam, Madrid and Zurich, and was smaller than Brussels and Copenhagen. In terms of capitalisation, Milan ranked sixth, but was closely pressed by Madrid in seventh place. Against continental standards, the Italian stock market fails to box the country's economic weight. To do so, there must be a substantial enlargement of the borsa, with a large increase in the number of listed companies. And the companies themselves need to be bigger. Mr Ventura, in common with his colleagues in Italy's securities dealing companies, believes that privatisation ought to make a valuable contribution to enlargement. And there are considerable expectations of the stimulus of long-awaited legislation on pension funds. But bad old practices, of which examples were still evident last year, will have to be abandoned. Such developments offer prospects for the Italian stock market to outgrow its pygmy stature. Only then will the Italian contingent in the FT500 be consistent with Italy's position as a leading industrial economy.</p>

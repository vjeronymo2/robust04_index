			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Estonia will not express in the near future an  official wish to become a NATO member, the head of the first  bureau of the Foreign Ministry, (Raimo Reinart), asserted to the  BNS [BALTIC NEWS SERVICE]. In the words of the foreign ministry  representative, all three Baltic States have already expressed  their wish to become integrated in the security structures of  Europe, among them NATO. In what forms one or another state  expresses its plans is no longer that important, considered  (Reinart) in the interview given to the BNS. He said that the  question of Lithuania will not be discussed in Brussels  separately, but in the joint context of central and eastern  European states. (Reinart) emphasized that joining NATO was a  lengthy process, in the course of which armaments, control of  troops and many other questions would have to be generalized.  This was enabled by the Partnership for Peace program offered  by the United States of America, which, in the words of  (Reinart), was supported by all three Baltic states.</p>

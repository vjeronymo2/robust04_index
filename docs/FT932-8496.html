			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / US housing starts rise by 6.7% US housing starts rose 6.7 per cent last month and by 11 per cent compared with April last year, indicating the market is rebounding after severe winter weather hit construction in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The figures follow other signs of stronger growth after the weak first quarter, including a 1.2 per cent increase in retail sales between March and April and a modest rise in industrial output last month. The rise in starts was broadly based, affecting all regions except the mid-west, where they fell fractionally, and most types of residential property including family homes and apartment buildings. Starts in the northeast, the area worst hit by bad weather, rose 22.5 per cent between March and April. Building permits - a guide to future construction trends - registered a healthy 5.8 per cent increase last month. The increase in starts, a volatile monthly series, was reassuring news for forecasters who were disturbed by the weakness of the housing market in recent months in spite of the lowest mortgage rates for two decades. Most economists are projecting a steady recovery of housing as the summer progresses. Even after last month's increase, starts were still running at an annual rate of 1.21m, 3 per cent below the average level in the fourth quarter of last year and lower than would be expected in a normal economic recovery.</p>

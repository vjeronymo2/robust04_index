Today  our people are welcoming the new year overflowing great pride  and faith of brilliantly advocating and adhering to socialism of  our own style amid rigorous trials.    Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and  people, delivered a historical New Year address to all the  people on the occasion of the new year, 1994. In the New Year  address, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song proudly summed up  the results of last year's struggle of firmly adhering to the  fortress of socialism of our own style through the might of  single-hearted unity, and presented militant tasks that our  party and people must adhere to in the new year.    The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New  Year address is a beacon brilliantly elucidating the future of  our people, who are accelerating the general onward march of  socialism of our own style, an immortal program calling on the  whole nation to carry out the sacred cause of the fatherland's  reunification, and a militant banner that vigorously takes the  initiative in the independent cause of our era.    The respected and beloved leader's New Year address is  currently inspiring all the party members and workers with faith  and fighting spirit of the invincibility of the cause of  socialism of our own style and is vigorously imparting them with  the responsibility to achieve a new victory by single-heartedly  uniting around the party and the leader.    In 1993, our party and the people vigorously displayed the  justness of the independent revolutionary line and the might of  the chuche Korea through the might of single-hearted unity.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The year  1993 was a historical year that vigorously displayed the  justness of our party's independent revolutionary line and the  might of the chuche Korea.    Last year our party and people resolutely smashed  [chitbusyoborigo] the vicious challenges and aggressive  maneuvers of the enemies and honorably defended the dignity and  security of the socialist fatherland. This was the greatest  victory achieved by our party and people last year.    Last year our country was in an extremely acute situation.  The imperialists and reactionaries isolated and suffocated our  Republic and strengthened unprecedented offensives in the fields  of politics, economics, military, and diplomacy to crush [apsal]  our socialist cause.    Our people vigorously launched into the struggle to  safeguard  the nation's sovereign rights and revolutionary gains as one by  bearing in their hearts the indomitable faith and will given by  the party and the leader and successively achieved victories in  the political and military confrontations with the enemies.    Last year's struggle clearly showed that nothing can squelch  the resolute will and faith of our people, who are moving toward  the one road of chuche with firm faith only in their party and  their leader. Thus, 1993 will be brilliantly recorded in our  people's revolutionary struggle history as a year of victory in  our party's revolutionary line and as a great year of victory of  single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses.    The last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan was brilliantly  decorated by achieving great progress in all fields of socialist  construction. This was an important achievement fulfilled by  our people last year.    Our people resolutely overcame great difficulties and  barriers facing economic construction, increased the productive  capacity of our chuche industry on the whole during the period  of the Third Seven-Year Plan, further strengthened its  self-dependence, provided a solid basis in agricultural  production to achieve bumper crops forever, and built many  monumental creations elucidating the era of the Workers' Party.    Today, the communist virtue of helping and guiding each  other  throughout the society and sharing joys and sorrows is  beautifully blossoming, and all the people are enjoying a  worthwhile and happy life without any social uneasiness. This  is a clear manifestation of the superiority of socialism of our  own style.    All the victories and results achieved in the revolution and  construction last year by our people are a brilliant fruition of  the wise leadership of the party and the leader leading our  revolutionary cause toward the ever-victorious road under the  banner of the chuche idea.    The leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] is a  banner for the victory of socialism of our own style and a  fundamental source for the prosperity of chuche Korea.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il, with deep insights into the prevailing  situation facing the revolution, have presented sagacious  strategies and tactics in a timely manner and led the entire  party and all the people to new exploits and victories.    Having an iron will and belief and firm fidelity to  revolutionary principles are important characteristics of the  leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. When the  fatherland and revolution were faced with stern trials and when  a touch-and-go situation prevailed, the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, our supreme commander, took the resolute  self-defensive measure of declaring a state of semi-war in the  entire country and had all the people and the entire Army meet  the enemy's antirevolutionary offensives head-on by launching  revolutionary offensives. He also vigorously led all the people  to the grand onward march to glorify the 40th anniversary of the  victory in the fatherland liberation war as a grand festival of  the victors.    The fact that we won a victory last year in a fierce  confrontation to defend the country's destiny and the nation's  supreme interests is unthinkable apart from our party's firm  belief and incomparable boldness. Outstanding wisdom,  scientific insights, and a tested organizational capability are  important features of our party's leadership.    Last year, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il released  "Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable" and numerous other  documents and, thus, further developed and enriched a theory on  building chuche-oriented socialism and clearly elucidated the  road of the socialist cause of our era.    He presents revolutionary economic strategies to comply with  actual requirements for socialist construction, enhances the  militant functions of party organizations of various levels,  scores new upsurges in economic construction, and organizes and  mobilizes the entire party and all the people by using powerful  militant slogans. His extraordinary leadership in the party is  matchless.    Recalling the struggle of last year when we brought about  the  most brilliant victory amid the sternest trial, we have come to  cherish deep in our hearts the indomitable belief that as long  as the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has an iron will  and tested leadership, leads us, we can win a fight with any  enemy and complete building socialism of our own style to the  end.    The New Year 1994 is a year of revolutionary change in which  socialist construction will enter a new stage of development and  a year of worthwhile struggle in which the entire party, the  entire country, and all the people must stand up to score  revolutionary great upsurges in all fronts.    In hearty response to the militant call of the party and the  leader [suryong], all party members and workers must continue  making innovations and advancements in the spirit of Chollima  spurred on by the speed of the nineties and, thus, make the New  Year 1994 a historic year of change in revolution and  construction in our country.    The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has  taught: We must consolidate and develop our achievements in  socialist construction and win greater new victories. By so  doing, we must glorify the popular masses-centered socialism of  our country and more highly fly the banner of chuche socialism.    The international environment facing our revolution today is  still complicated and tense, and we are building socialism amid  a tense confrontation with the enemy.    In compliance with the prevailing situation and the demand  for the development of our revolution as the great leader  elucidated in his New Year address, we must thoroughly implement  the revolutionary line of independence, self-sufficiency, and  self-reliant defense; vigorously carry out the three revolutions  -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- and, thus,  further strengthen the country's political, economic, and  military strength.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy put forward at  the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee is  a most just and revolutionary line for consolidating the  nation's self-reliant economic foundations and for further  upgrading the people's living standard in keeping with the  demand of socialism.    When this strategy is thoroughly implemented, the  superiority  of our-style socialism will be more vigorously displayed and we  will occupy a new stronghold for offensive.    This year we should continue to firmly adhere to  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy.  This year, which marks the 30th anniversary of publication of  the socialist rural thesis, we should vigorously carry out the  struggle to accomplish historic tasks of rural thesis and should  effect a new turn in development of the rural economy. Thus, we  should fulfill the lofty target of grain production set forth by  the party without fail.    At the same time, by vigorously accelerating light industry  revolution, we should register great innovations in the  production of consumer goods and should develop external trade  in compliance with changed circumstances.    For us to vigorously accelerate the nation's overall  economic  construction by developing agriculture and light industry, we  should direct strength at coal, electric power, and metal  industries, and should find a solution to the problem of rail  transport.    For us to successfully carry out economic construction tasks  facing us this year, we should vigorously wage the struggle for  increasing production and conservation in all domains and units  as a mass movement. At the same time, economic guidance  functionaries should carry out economic organizational work and  production command in compliance with the demand of the party's  economic strategy.    By upholding the party's cultural revolution policy,  intellectuals should devotedly struggle to effect a new  development in all domains of socialist cultural construction.    This year we should further strengthen the nation's defense  capabilities by upholding the leadership of Comrade Kim  Chong-il, our supreme commander.    All the people and officers and men of the People's Army  must  be fully prepared politically and ideologically, militarily and  materially, to deal with any contingency on our initiative, and  must establish a social climate of regarding military affairs as  important and assisting the People's Army whole-heartedly.    What is most important in vigorously pushing ahead with  revolution and construction at present is to further strengthen  the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the  masses and to highly display the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance.    Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are imperishable,  glorious traditions of our revolution, as well as the banner of  victory. The history of the Korean revolution is the history of  single-hearted unity and the history of self-reliance. With the  strength of single-hearted unity our people have broken through  harsh trials and opened up a brilliant road of victory and with  the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance we have overcome all  difficulties and brought about great changes in the revolution  and construction.    Today our single-hearted unity has been firmly consolidated  with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as its center. The  ever-victorious indomitable road of the socialist cause is in  the firm ideological and moral unity with the party and the  leader based on will and principle.    All party members and working people should hold the leader  [yongdoja] in high esteem with the sense of loyalty and should  actively defend and protect him. They should regard the ideas  and lines put forward by the leader [yongdoja] as most just ones  and should thoroughly implement them under any condition and  circumstance.    Thus, we should consolidate the single-hearted unity of our  revolutionary ranks, which has been firmly cemented rock-solid  under the leadership of our party, and with the strength of such  unity, we should vigorously push ahead with the socialist cause  of our own style.    Self-reliance and arduous struggle are traditional spirits  of  the struggle of our people, who are carrying out the revolution  and who are a revolutionary banner for successfully building  socialism of our own style.    "Let us accelerate vigorously the general march of  socialism in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  fortitude." This is the call of our party and the militant  slogan our people must uphold today.    When we advance by upholding this slogan, we can tenaciously  defend and protect our-style socialism by crushing various  challenges and disturbance maneuvers of the imperialists and  reactionaries. We can resolve all problems raised in the  socialist construction with our own strength under any  condition, no matter how difficult.    Just as in the postwar Chollima great upsurge period, we  must  more highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance  and fortitude and must effect a new upsurge in socialist  construction by breaking through all difficulties.    To reunify the country without fail in the nineties and to  hand over the reunified fatherland to future generations are the  supreme tasks of the nation.    The principles and line of our party and the government of  the Republic to establish a unified state in the manner of  confederation based on one country and one state and two systems  and two governments remain unchanged.    All Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas  should firmly unite as one, transcending the differences in  ideologies, systems, and religions under the banner of the  10-point program of great unity of the whole country and should  subjugate everything to the cause of national reunification.    We should smash at every step aggressive and interfering  maneuvers of outside forces with the strength of unity of all  people who want reunification and want to live under democracy  with patriotism. As members of the Korean state, those who have  strength, knowledge, and money, should make characteristic  contributions to the cause of national reunification with  strength, knowledge, and money respectively. Thus, this year we  should open a new phase in the struggle for national  reunification.    The United States and its followers should look straight at  today's realities in which the spirit of national reunification  is being enhanced higher than ever before, and should act with  discretion. They should discard the anachronistic way of  thinking to handle the Korean issue from the standpoint of  strength.    Pressure or threat will have no effect on us; such an  attempt  may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the  problem.    The imperialists are now blustering on the international  arena by vociferating about the end of socialism, but they  cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence,  sovereignty, and socialism, nor can they turn back the trend of  history.    In the new year, just as in the past, we will unite with  socialist countries based on the principle of independence, and  will make active efforts to unite with nonaligned countries. We  will develop good neighborly relations with the capitalist  countries that respect our nation's sovereignty.    Upon hearing the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year  address, our people's revolutionary zeal and spirit of struggle  are very high.    All party organizations should aggressively carry out the  organizational and political works to brilliantly achieve  rewarding tasks in the new year.    Party organizations at all levels should infiltrate the New  Year address made this year by the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song deep into party members and working people, and should  vigorously organize and lead them to the struggle to accomplish  tasks put forward in the New Year address.    Our revolution is an ever-victorious indomitable revolution  that advances with the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song as  its vanguard and by following the leadership of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    We have loyal people and one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary  Armed Forces who are firmly rallied behind the party and the  leader [suryong]. We also have a mighty self-reliant socialist  national economy that enables us to survive with our own  strength under any circumstance.    A political and ideological offensive, an economic blockade,  and a military threat by the imperialists and reactionaries,  cannot block our people's advance forward. Although our people's  struggle today is arduous, it is a glorious and sacred struggle  for prosperity and development of our nation and for the future  of mankind.    Let us all more vigorously fight to accomplish the socialist  cause of our own style in firm unity with the party Central  Committee headed by the respected Comrade Kim Il-song by  upholding the banner of the chuche idea.</p>

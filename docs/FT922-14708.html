			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Labour push for middle ground vote intensifies MR NEIL KINNOCK pledged yesterday that a Labour government would strive to build a new political consensus at Westminster in what appeared to be a push for the support of Liberal Democrat and floating voters. At the end of a week of campaigning that left the outcome of the general election as uncertain as ever, the Conservatives last night used a party election broadcast to launch their fiercest attack yet on the Labour leader. With just five days until voters go to the polling stations, the prospect of a hung parliament - and a possible second general election soon afterwards - loomed larger. Officials of all the parties were braced for tomorrow's opinion polls which will give the first indications of the state of the election race since the mid-week polls showed Labour with a slight advantage. Mr Kinnock's comments were taken as a fresh attempt to narrow the options of Liberal Democrat MPs in the event of a hung parliament by reducing their ability to vote down a Labour programme, which would include many items from their manifesto, such as Scottish devolution. Speaking on BBC Radio, Mr Kinnock promised a Labour government would use 'its power to try and involve others and to show how strong and confident it is by consensus'. Later, the Labour leader refused to close the door completely on the possibility of a referendum on electoral reform. But his stance on proportional representation continued to fall well short of the terms demanded by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader. In an interview on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Mr Kinnock said his personal preference was for any proposal on new electoral systems to be dealt with at the general election after the one to be held on Thursday. But he did not totally rule out the earlier option of a referendum on the findings of an expanded commission on proportional representation. However, Mr Ashdown, who has seen a significant advance for his party in opinion polls this week, again vowed to try to vote down a minority government which rejected proportional representation in its first legislative programme. He seized also on comments by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, which Mr Ashdown claimed showed the Conservatives would be prepared to accept a minority Labour government, rather than the need for proportional representation. In their election broadcast last night, the Tories renewed their attacks on Mr Kinnock for his policy turnabouts on Europe, devolution and nuclear disarmament. But a decision to broadcast the telephone number of Labour's Walworth Road headquarters, so viewers could complain at what Tories say is the opposition's gloomy image of the UK, was attacked as 'a silly prank' by Labour. Mr John Major used the broadcast to reiterate the Conservatives' claim that voters were faced with a simple choice between him and Mr Kinnock. On tour earlier in Kent, the prime minister mocked Labour's move on electoral reform and again said he did not want even to discuss it. 'Cuddling up to the Liberal (Democrats) for support is like leaning on candy-floss,' he said. But his attack was weakened by a call for a Speaker's commission on electoral reform from Mr Edward Heath, the former Tory leader. The final phase of the Conservative campaign, to be launched in newspaper advertisments tomorrow, will focus on the positive reasons for voting for the party as well as warning of the consequences on financial markets of a Labour government.

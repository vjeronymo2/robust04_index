The talks reached a comprehensive agreement which  will further unclog the channel of world trade and create  favorable conditions for the development of world trade and  economy in the late 20th century and early 21st century.    The world economy has been in a recession since the late  1980's. Under such a situation, all countries have adopted  various measures to revive their economy, but without any  remarkable success. So, to strive for success in the Uruguay  Round of talks has been regarded as the only chance for getting  the world economy out of stagnation. Since the GATT became  effective in 1948, seven rounds of talks have been held, tariffs  have dropped drastically, and the world's trade volume has risen  from $57 billion in 1945 to $3.7 trillion in 1992. The GATT  played a valuable role as an impetus to economic development  which should not be overlooked.    The vast number of developing countries, considering the  interests of the whole, have made relevant concessions and  greatly contributed to the success of the recent round of talks.  However, the Western powers nearly ruined such a historic  opportunity despite the fact that they would benefit the most  from the success of the talks. The Uruguay Round of talks was  originally scheduled to end three years ago, but the talks were  repeatedly delayed due to sharp differences between the European  nations and the United States over such issues as trade in  agricultural products, financial services, subsidies to aircraft  manufacturers, and trade in audio and visual products; and at  times the talks almost reached a breaking point. Many people  with breadth of vision warned that the failure of the talks  would inevitably lead to intensified protectionism and  consequences worse than anything imaginable. After repeated  bargaining back and forth, the European side and the U.S. side  at last had to make compromises.    The Uruguay Round of talks had 117 participating parties and  dealt with 21 items, including market access, tariff reduction,  service trade, and intellectual property. The text of the final  agreement reached by the talks is as long as 450 pages,  containing 45 independent documents. The major achievements are  as follows: First, the problem of market access for almost all  industrial and agricultural products has been solved. All  non-tariff barriers which various countries have set up over the  years to protect their industry and agriculture will be  gradually removed in next 10 years. Second, tariffs for  industrial goods will be drastically reduced, by approximately  40 percent. Third, developed countries will reduce tariffs for  agricultural products by 36 percent in six years, while  developing nations will reduce the tariffs by 24 percent in 10  years; and farm subsidies will be reduced by 36 percent in six  years, and the export of subsidized farm products will be  reduced by 21 percent. Fourth, banking, telecommunications, and  other services, as well as intellectual property, will be placed  for the first time under the control of the GATT. In addition,  the agreement also deals with the establishment of multilateral  trade organizations.    The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks is a  welcome event for all countries. As Sutherland has said, the  agreement means "more trade, more investment, more employment,  and better income" for everyone. All parties, both developed  countries and developing countries, will benefit to varying  degrees. Of course, countries with more developed commodity  economies and greater exports will benefit more. For this  reason, developed countries will benefit much more than  developing countries. According to calculations by several  international organizations, after the agreement is completely  carried out in 2005, the benefits obtained by all countries will  range from $230 billion to $270 billion, and the actual benefits  may even be much higher than these figures. According to an  estimate by U.S. President Clinton, the United States alone will  obtain benefits ranging from $100 billion to $200 billion and  create several hundred thousand jobs. The indirect impact of  the agreement will not be felt until after it is carried out,  and it is too early to estimate what will happen now.    For the developed countries, the advantages from the  agreement are evident, while to the vast number of developing  countries, there could be more disadvantages than advantages.  However, some developing countries which are achieving  industrialization will benefit more from the agreement. First,  these countries will be able to freely export their industrial  products to developed countries. Next, these countries, with a  good investment environment in which the production costs are  much lower than in developed countries, will attract a great  deal of investment from major transnational companies. The  major disadvantages are as follows: First, although the  agreement permits the poorest developing nations with no  industrial foundation to adopt measures to protect their  national industries, it is in fact not easy for them to do so.  This is because if they adopt high tariffs, their people will  be unable to afford to imported industrial goods; and if they  adopt low tariffs, their national industries will be strangled.  Second, the agreement has not solved the problem of high tariffs  for textile goods, leather products, tropical products, and  primary products, while these products are major export products  of many developing countries. In particular, textile goods will  continue to be subject to the control of the 1974 agreement on  various fiber products in the next 10 years. The 1974 agreement  is very unfavorable to developing countries because it sets  quotas and high tariffs for imported textile goods. Third, when  service trades such as banking and telecommunications enter  developing countries, they could cause unexpected consequences.    Many international organizations have calculated the  advantages and disadvantages of the agreement of the Uruguay  Round of talks to developing countries. Their consensus is that  the poorest countries, particularly black African nations south  of the Sahara, will get only the smallest piece of the Uruguay  Round cake. A serious defect of the Uruguay Round agreement is  that it has not paid due attention to the commodity production  and trade of the poorest countries.    An agreement is merely an agreement, and the key is how to  carry it out. Some Western nations usually place their domestic  law above international agreements, and frequently bring  fabricated charges against other countries according to their  domestic law and take "reprisal" measures against the latter,  resulting in international agreements existing in name only.  For this reason, it is not so easy to truly seize this historic  opportunity, and it is still necessary to make a great deal of  effort.</p>

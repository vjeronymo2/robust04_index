			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluating halon substitutes also requires assessing the efficacy of substitute agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The efficacy of a fire protection agent can be compared using a cup burner or full scale test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to obtain the extinguishing concentration in a particular fuel. NFPA standards require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional 20 percent be added to obtain the design concentration. Most values identified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule are obtained by cup burner, while some are obtained by full scale testing, and most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are in heptane. This measure is included in the discussion of halon substitutes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and comparative purposes, and EPA does not assert that the efficacy values listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> here are appropriate for all fire or explosion hazards. The user community is cautioned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consult the appropriate NFPA standard, relevant OSHA regulations, and professional fire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultants to determine actual requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After concluding the analysis of halon alternatives, EPA in some cases finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable the use of an agent only under certain conditions. In implementing its use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, the Agency has sought to avoid overlap with other existing regulatory authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that section 612 clearly authorizes imposition of use conditions to ensure safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of replacement agents. EPA's mandate is to list agents that ``reduce the overall risk to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human health and the environment'' for ``specific uses.'' In light of this authorization, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is only intending to set conditions for the safe use of halon substitutes in the workplace until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA incorporates specific language addressing gaseous agents into OSHA regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under OSHA Public Law 91&hyph;596, section 4(b)(1), OSHA is precluded from regulating an area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently being regulated by another federal agency. EPA is specifically deferring to OSHA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has no intention to assume responsibility for regulating workplace safety especially with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to fire protection. EPA's workplace use conditions will not bar OSHA from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating under its Public Law 91&hyph;596 authority. The substitutes for halons in fire protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications are discussed in the next section by class of chemical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brominated hydrofluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Brominated hydrofluorocarbons (HBFCs) are effective halon substitutes. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these substances contain bromine, they act as chemical action agents in the same manner as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the halons. In fact, some HBFCs are more effective than Halons 1211 and 1301 in specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications. For this reason, HBFCs can replace Halons 1211 and 1301 on nearly a one-to-one basis and appear to have significant applicability in existing systems. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of bromine also means that these agents have higher ozone-depleting potentials than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other halon substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, only one HBFC, HBFC&hyph;22B1, is expected to be commercially available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the near term. HBFC&hyph;22B1 can, however, serve only as an interim substitute for halons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The substance has an ODP of 0.74 and has been listed as a class I substances. Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Montreal Protocol and the Clean Air Act, production of HBFC&hyph;22B1 is required to end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hydrochlorofluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have also been suggested as halon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacements. These include HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;123, and HCFC&hyph;124. These HCFCs will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extinguish fires but because they are physical action agents, they are considerably less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective than halons or HBFCs. Thus, high concentrations must be achieved to extinguish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fires. Further, although the ozone depletion potential of HCFCs is considerably lower than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that of either halons or HBFCs, they are listed as class II chemicals under the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The production of HCFC&hyph;141b will be phased out beginning January 1, 2003; HCFC&hyph;22 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;142b beginning January 1, 2020; and all other HCFCs beginning January 1, 2030 (58  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 65018, December 10, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, under section 610(d) of the CAA as amended, HCFCs in pressurized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispensers are banned from sale or distribution after January 1, 1994. Under the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking for section 610 (58 FR 69637, December 30, 1993) EPA interpreted section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 610(d) to exclude HCFCs which are part of an installed `system.' The final rule exempts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total flooding systems and those streaming applications which incorporate fixed, automatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. However, section 610(d) only allows the sale of an HCFC in a portable fire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extinguisher where other unregulated agents are not suitable for the intended applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because alternatives are available for residential uses, EPA intends to publish a proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking under section 612 to update the SNAP list of acceptable substitutes and to ban the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sale and use of HCFCs in portable fire extinguishers for residential applications. However, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial (including industrial and military) settings, the variety of hazards are too broad to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create standards through rulemaking, and therefore under section 610(d) EPA has established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry-based mechanisms for controlling the sale of HCFCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, while HCFCs can serve only as interim halon substitutes due to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled phaseout as class II substances, EPA believes that they serve an important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transitional role in the phaseout of class I substances. HCFC&hyph;22 has been suggested as a total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flooding agent, but this compound is unlikely to be used as a single agent in normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupied areas due to its cardiotoxic profile.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The sources revealed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone  yesterday that an Iranian delegation arrived in Iraqi Kurdistan  last Tuesday and held talks with Kurdish officials. The talks  resulted in the Iranian delegation recovering the helicopter,  which suffered a technical fault while returning to Iranian  territory -- which forced the pilot to conduct an emergency  landing in the mountainous area of Azmar near the Iranian border.    The sources expressed their belief that the helicopter has  probably now returned to its Iranian base. [passage omitted]    The KDP sources stressed that the Kurdish authorities  refused  to hand over to the Iranian delegation the Kurdish [as  published] pilot whose application for asylum -- the first if  its kind since the Kurdish government was established 20 months  ago -- is still being considered by the relevant authorities.    Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that leading bodies in  the "Islamic Movement in Iraqi Kurdistan" have ratified the  reconciliation agreement concluded on 17 February between its  general guide Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz and Jalal Talabani,  leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. [passage omitted]    At another level, KDP sources have said that Iraqi Interior  Minister Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan, half brother of Saddam Husayn,  recently supervised the execution of 20 citizens from the  Kurdish city of Karkuk, which is under the control of the  central government in Baghdad. The sources added that bodies of  the citizens, arrested in December on charges of opposing the  Iraqi regime, were later handed to their families. The bodies  were disfigured as a result of the torture they suffered during  their interrogations.    The sources mentioned the names of five victims: Mala Hakim  Ghafur Hamah Rida, Mala Najm-al-Din Sayyid Rashid Banghuli,  Fakhr-al-Din Hamah Sa'id, Amanj Fakhr-al-Din Hamah Sa'id, and  'Ali Dawudi. Their ages range between 13 and 50.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (9) Navajo EPA stated that because NAMLRD had already received Council approval for the revised code, its review seems after the fact unless suggested revisions are also put through the SAS (signature approval sheet) process and presented to the Council. As required by 30 CFR 884.15 and 884.14, OSM must approve the Navajo Nation plan amendment, of which the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 is a part, before it is effective. If Navajo EPA identified inconsistencies between the code and SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations, OSM would require the Navajo Nation to revise its AMLR Code of 1987. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Navajo EPA expressed concern that although NAMLRD prepares all environmental documents required under Federal law, the documents are only reviewed by OSM, but none of the documents are reviewed by Navajo EPA, as required. This comment concerns Tribal policy and procedures, which are not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Navajo EPA noted that Title II, section 201(d) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 provides that NAMLRD shall be protected from suite by sovereign immunity, and that no employee can waive this immunity. However, Navajo EPA suggested that this right may be abrogated by the Federal government as provided in section 405(1) of SMCRA. Section 405(1) of SMCRA provides for Tribe or State immunity from lawsuits except those resulting from gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the Tribe or State, so to the extent that the Tribe or State is liable under Federal law, it is held liable. Therefore, OSM responds that the sovereign immunity claimed by the Navajo Nation extends to all liability situations except those involving gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the Navajo Nation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) Title IV, section 401(b)(2) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 indicates that the Navajo AMR fund shall consist of monies deposited in the fund from sources including any user charges imposed by the Navajo Nation on or for land reclaimed pursuant to the code, after expenditures for maintenance have been deducted. Navajo EPA asked that the type of user charges be clarified, because the code does not specify if these charges refer to grazing or other non-mining activities, whether fees are already appropriated to other departments, what maintenance expenditures are being referred to, and who will conduct said maintenance. Navajo EPA stated that this section was copied directly from SMCRA and may have limited relevance as applied to the Navajo Nation. Specific criteria pertaining to the type of user charges, appropriation of fees, and maintenance are not addressed in Title IV of SMCRA or the implementing Federal regulations. Therefore, decisions made by the Navajo Nation regarding user charges it imposes under its AMLR program are limited only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with SMCRA. Because this provision of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 is substantively identical to section 401(b)(2) of SMCRA, it meets the requirements of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) Title IV, section 401(b)(6) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 indicates that the AMR fund shall consist of monies deposited in the fund from sources including ``all other reclamation fees lawfully imposed by the Navajo Nation.'' Navajo EPA expressed concern that the statement ``all other reclamation fees'' is extremely broad, and wondered if it is meant to include reclamation fees for active coal and non-coal mines, for sand and gravel, or oil and gas activities; whether it applies only to reclamation bonds held by the Nation, or by Federal agencies; and suggested that it is in direct conflict with regulations outlining how those fees are held and allocated. Section 402 of SMCRA provides for payment of a reclamation fee on mined coal to be deposited in the Federal AMR Fund. SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations do not require the payment of any additional fees and do not restrict a Tribe or State from collecting other kinds of reclamation fees. Therefore, for these reasons and for the same reasons discussed in comment No. 12 above, OSM finds this provision of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 to be consistent with section 401(b) of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14) Navajo EPA pointed out a typographical error in Title IV, section (401)(c)(1) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987. The phrase ``prevent abatement'' should be ``prevention, abatement *&blank;*&blank;*'' as in the counterpart section 401(c)(1) of SMCRA. OSM agrees with Navajo EPA in its comment and recommends that the Navajo Nation review its plan amendment to correct grammatical, punctuation, and typographical errors and inconsistencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

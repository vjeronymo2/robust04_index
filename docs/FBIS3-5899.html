			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pusan, Mar. 11 (YONHAP) -- Travel agents here were  reacting furiously on Friday against the decision of the U.S.  Consulate General in this port city to stop issuing U.S. visas  through travel agents.    The American Consulate told the representatives of 21 travel  agents in this area on Friday afternoon that the consulate would  cease to issue visas through agents effective April 1.    "This is a retaliatory step against us as there has been a  move among us to denounce the consulate's earlier decision to  restrict the number of travel agents authorized to handle visa  requests," a travel agency official said.    The consulate said that beginning April 1 travel agents or  individuals should apply for visas directly at the U.S. Embassy  in Seoul.    The U.S. Consulate said, however, it would continue to  handle  visa reissuance for those in Pusan and South and North Kyongsang  Provinces, whose application, it said, should be filed  individually not through travel agents.    The new decision is expected to cause much inconveniences to  would-be U.S. travelers as well as to adversely affect the  business of travel agents in the region.    "We will condemn this measure of the U.S. Consulate General  through large-scale rallies to be held jointly with citizens  organizations," the travel agency official said.</p>

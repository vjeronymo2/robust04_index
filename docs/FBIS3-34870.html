PANORAMA  interviewed him.    [PANORAMA] Your movement is mostly Nuer. Garang is a Dinka.  Was this the reason for your dispute?    [Mashar] No. The reasons are political. Garang is a  despotic and autocratic dictator who recruits kids from the  refugee camps and violates human rights. In addition, he wants  a federal state while I think that there is no alternative to a  completely independent south: The unification imposed by the  English in 1946 has no historical basis. The Khartoum regime  has massacred and starved the population there for years, and  now it wants to impose the laws of Islam and the Arabic language  on the south. But it will not succeed. The Muslims are  entitled to claim membership of the Arab nation, but we claim  our right to assert our Christian and African roots. We will  fight until we win independence.    [PANORAMA] Your divisions favor Khartoum's strategy. Is it  impossible for you to reach an agreement with Col. Garang?    [Mashar] On 6 January we met and identified some common  aims.  A global accord is still a long way off, but we cannot lose more  time. The Sudanese Army has launched a new offensive and the  civilian population is at the end of its strength. We have to  stop the genocide of our people.</p>

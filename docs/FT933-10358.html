			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Cash triggers Iridium countdown  -Motorola's satellite project has taken the lead COMPANIES from three continents this week threw their weight and credibility behind the world's biggest private-sector aerospace project. They have invested Dollars 100m in cash and promised another Dollars 700m as the first stage in financing Iridium, a Dollars 3.4bn satellite-based global mobile telephone network. Another five consortia have planned similar schemes since the late 1980s. This, however, is the first time hard cash has replaced mere blueprints. Motorola, the originator of Iridium, has a clear lead over competitors, including US aerospace companies Loral, TRW and Fairchild; France's Matra, Aerospatiale and Alcatel; Deutsche Aerospace; Matra-Marconi, the Anglo-French joint venture; Italy's Alenia; and Inmarsat, the 69-member international co-operative that operates satellites for mobile communications. Motorola's success promises to trigger a race between the contenders to establish infrastructures. Not only are there limits to the world's satellite launching capacity, but the size of the market may mean there is room for just two competitors. Each of the rival projects is breathtaking in scale. Iridium, for example, plans to launch 66 small telecommunications satellites in the two years between 1996 and 1998. The rockets will be launched from the US on the McDonnell Douglas Delta rocket, from Russia on the Proton Rocket, and China on the Long March. The network will carry telephone calls, fax messages, paging, facsimile, computer data and radio-determination satellite services (RDSS), which locate telephones by latitude and longitude. Iridium hopes to attract 1.5m customers - between 1.5 and 2 per cent of the number of cellular telephone users - by the end of the century. Each customer will have to buy one of two types of telephone. The first will work only with Iridium, and the second will work with both Iridium and the buyer's own local mobile telephone network. Mr John Mitchell, a vice-chairman of Motorola, said these would sell at about 40 per cent more than ordinary cellular telephone handsets. Motorola's business plan specifies charges of about Dollars 3 a minute. Although this is more expensive than ordinary cellular telephones now, they are cheaper than the Dollars 10 a minute charged for satellite calls made from aircraft. Pricing is a crucial issue. 'Our service should be cheaper and with a service quality as good as, or superior, to that proposed by Iridium,' said Mr Jai Singh, executive vice-president at London-based Inmarsat, which hopes to have its scheme financed after February 1994. Although any service Inmarsat established would be similar to Iridium's on paper, customers are likely to notice significant differences because of the way the infrastructures are built. Motorola has designed a network based on 66 small satellites orbiting not far above the earth's surface. Inmarsat, on the other hand, abandoned the principle of a low-earth orbit (Leo) network just last week in favour of fewer satellites placed in higher orbits. As a result, Inmarsat's telephones may have to be larger to transmit their messages further. Or it could use tested technologies, which it says need only Dollars 1bn to set up. Motorola is taking a risk by breaking new ground in its design. Moreover, a network of 66 satellites will be inherently more complicated than one with fewer, such as Inmarsat's. Two further obstacles remain for Motorola: money and government approval. This week's Dollars 800m tranche will be followed within two years by another of almost equal size. The remaining 60 per cent of the money needed will come from the debt market, says Goldman Sachs, Motorola's adviser. Regulatory problems remain less clear. Motorola only has experimental approval from the US Federal Communications Commission, while a European Commission report on Leo satellite networks in December 1992 said it would take at least another five years to answer regulatory and other questions. Hard heads in the international debt markets are likely to want to see regulatory approval from both sides of the Atlantic before happily handing over almost Dollars 2bn.</p>

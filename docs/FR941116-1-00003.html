			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain Airbus Model A300 B4&hyph;2C, B4&hyph;103, and B4&hyph;203 series airplanes, and Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A300&hyph;600 B4&hyph;620, B4&hyph;622, B4&hyph;603, and B4&hyph;601 series airplanes. The DGAC advises  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the results of a quality survey, conducted by Airbus Industrie, revealed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrical bonding of the fuel jettison system has insufficient protection from a lightning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strike. Investigation revealed that the existing lightning protection could fail to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately safeguard the fuel jettison pipe against a lightning strike at the fuel pipe exit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This condition, if not corrected, could result in electrical arcing and resultant fire in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> event of a lightning strike.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airbus has issued Alert Service Bulletin A300&hyph;28A065, Revision 1, dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 14, 1994 (for Model A300 series airplanes), and Alert Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A300&hyph;28A6033, Revision 1, dated February 14, 1994 (for Model A300&hyph;600 series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes), which describe procedures for modification of the fuel tank jettison system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This modification involves removing the bonding strap that bridges the flexible hose and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installing a new thicker bonding strap from the fuel jettison pipe to the No. 5 flap track  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beam, which will improve the electrical bonding at both ends. Accomplishment of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification will improve the bonding method at the interface of the fuel jettison pipe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the adjacent fuel tank. The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;074&hyph;144(B), dated May 12, 1993, in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require modification of the fuel tank jettison system. The actions would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 34 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would take approximately 21 work hours per airplane to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $42,840, or $1,260 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

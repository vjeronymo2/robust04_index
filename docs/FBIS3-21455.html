With the repeal of the Air Corporation Act, 1953, the  monopoly of Indian Airlines and Air India to operate scheduled  flights has been ended. Simultaneously, the operations of  private air taxis have been given the sanction of law.    The Air Transport (Transfer and Repeal of Undertakings)  Ordinance comes in place of a Bill with a similar title, which  had been introduced in Parliament some 18 months ago. The  ordinance was enacted owing to lack of time available to  Parliament to pass the Bill.    During the last session of Parliament, the Bill was listed  for enactment, but again other commitments prevented its  passage. Given the fact that the coming Budget Session, too,  will be hectic, the Government, instead, chose to issue an  ordinance.    In 1990, the then V.P. Singh Government had allowed the  operations of private air taxis in the country, but legal  sanction eluded these "unscheduled airlines."    In fact, there has been a general clamour from private air  taxis operators that the Air Corporation Act, which give only  Indian Airlines and Air India the right to operate scheduled air  services, be repealed.    With the promulgation of the ordinance, Indian Airlines and  Air India, have been placed at par with private airlines as far  as domestic operations go, though only these two companies can  fly to destinations abroad.    According to government sources, this is one of the first  major steps taken to denationalise the public sector. Though  there have been demands from the private industry to  de-monopolise the aviation industry, the employees of these air  corporations have been against such a move.    With the repeal of the act, the age of "open skies" has  dawned in the country. Private air lines, finally, have been  conferred legal status.    PTI reports from Bombay:    A spokesman of the Indian Commercial Pilots Association said  the measure was not going to be healthy.    The Air Corporation Employees Union Regional Secretary, Mr  R. Ramanathan, said "our campaign and struggle will further  intensify."</p>

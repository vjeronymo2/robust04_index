			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Import rules are no solution (1) Sir, C Fred Bergsten's article defending the setting of targets to increase imports by Japan is an unfortunate example of erroneous economics and partisan politics ('Good and bad managed trade', August 18). Mr Bergsten seeks to argue that, for a free trader, setting voluntary export restraints (VERs) is wicked, whereas imposing voluntary import expansions (VIEs) is virtuous. VERs restrain trade, VIEs expand it; VERs create cartels; VIEs break them. Balderdash. Both policies set traded quantities instead of defining trading rules. Where VERs are import protectionism, VIEs are export protectionism. The former give your producers a guaranteed share of the domestic market, the latter give them a guaranteed share of the foreign market. If VERs lead to cartels to allocate targeted reductions in exports, VIEs lead to cartels to allocate targeted increases in imports. Mr Bergsten presumes that the VIEs will be set 'judiciously', for short periods, and will be confined to Japan and to her '12 sectors', where he has now found to his satisfaction - and contrary to his earlier and long-held conclusion that earned him the wrath of the Japan-fixated Suslovs of the Clinton administration - that Japan is unfairly restricting imports. Of course, Mr Bergsten forgets that those who seek VERs also claim that Japan is unfairly expanding exports and that VERs are simply cutting them back to 'appropriate' levels. To look upon VIEs with indulgence while frowning on VERs is plainly wrong. It flies in the face of the historical reality. VERs, when begun, were also considered to be temporary and judiciously targeted at industries and nations. But they spread and grew into a systemic problem. It also ignores the current reality of spreading demands for VIEs beyond (the original) semiconductors to other products and of the threat by the European Community to follow the US in that event. That the Republican administrations embraced VERs and initiated VIEs whereas the Clinton administration has not actually implemented any more of either is technically correct. But it is also misleading, if not disingenuous. The rhetoric and the oft-asserted objective of managed trade with Japan has left no one in doubt about what the US administration badly wants: a shift in the ground rules to targets. Has Mr Bergsten forgotten already the Miyazawa visit to Washington and the Tokyo Summit where managed trade, and even targets for surplus reduction, were assertively demanded of Japan? If we have been spared these foolish policies we have to thank, not the Clinton administration, but the Japanese government. By saying no to these demands Japan has exercised the leadership that the US has abandoned. Both countries need to turn energetically instead to the multilateral system, to strengthen the rules under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (instead of weakening them as the Clinton administration's negotiators are reputedly demanding at the Uruguay Round), and to seek resolution of trade complaints through the GATT's impartial dispute settlement processes that are symmetrically available to each against all others. Mr Bergsten can do no better than to return to the ranks of those who seek those goals with clarity and commitment, instead of applauding and accommodating the managed-traders who, once properly on the fringe, now occupy centre stage in Washington.

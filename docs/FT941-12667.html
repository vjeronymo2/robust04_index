			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A lacklustre day in the derivatives saw the March futures contract breach its recent support level as Wednesday's disappointing gilts auction continued to cast a shadow over the market, writes Joel Kibazo. The sombre mood that followed the gilts auction failed to deter the early bargain hunters for the March contract on the FT-SE 100. Moving gently forward, it reached the day's high of 3,456 at mid-morning. As the buying orders were completed, dealers turned their attention to the continuing weakness in the bond markets. The sellers soon had the upper hand and March went into retreat, falling through its recent 3,450 support level and pulling the underlying cash market lower. The tentative opening on Wall Street only served to increase the selling and the contract finished at the low of the day of 3,427, more or less in line with the cash market but at a discount to its fair value premium to cash of around 7 points. Volume, at 8,725 lots, was dull. Turnover in the traded options declined to 42,788 contracts from Wednesday's 50,704, with 14,087 transacted in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,005 in the Euro FT-SE option. British Steel once again led the league table of active stock options (at 3,523), with most of the day's trading done in the April calls and puts. It was followed by National Westminster Bank, at 2,280 contracts, and Storehouse, at 2,170. A big seller of calls was responsible for the majority of the turnover in Argyll Group and it finished with a total of 1,814 lots dealt.</p>

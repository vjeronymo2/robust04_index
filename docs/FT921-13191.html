			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Institutions face Pounds 200m losses on MCC shares Correction (published 23rd January 1992) appended to this article. SOME OF the UK's leading pension funds and insurance groups together face losses of up to Pounds 200m on their investments in Maxwell Communication Corporation. They may now take legal advice about whether they could recover some losses on the grounds that there was a false market in the shares. Despite growing worries about MCC's financial state, 20 per cent of the company was still in the hands of two dozen blue chip institutions and about 2,000 individuals when the Maxwell empire collapsed. The other 80 per cent is now controlled by banks who took the shares as security for loans to Mr Maxwell's private companies. Mr Maxwell had secretly breached the Stock Exchange's 75 per cent ceiling on ownership of quoted companies, and the Serious Fraud Office is investigating whether he illegally bought MCC shares to support the share price. The suspension price of 35p values MCC at Pounds 226m, but the shares are almost certainly worthless. Most institutions would have invested between 150p and 200p per share - the range in recent years - and face big losses. Several have said they may follow some of the banks in taking legal advice on whether they can recover some of the value of the shares. Legal &amp; General, the insurance giant which holds 2.5m of the shares, said 'We are watching with interest to see if investigators establish that there was a false market in the shares.' L&amp;G would not disclose its losses, but they are believed to be over Pounds 3m. The company said the MCC shares were held in the Pounds 2bn pooled index fund, for which the loss was not significant. Other MCC shareholders are the pension funds of the Post Office, National Westminster Bank, Barclays Bank, IBM UK, British Airways, British Aerospace, Scottish Power, Rover Group and Rolls Royce staff. Institutions contacted all held the MCC shares in index funds, which track the performance of indices such as the FT-A All-Share Index. Several fund managers commented that 'regrettably' the strict specifications of these funds did not allow them to exclude index stocks from portfolios even when they were concerned about the company. Correction (published 23rd January 1992). The pension funds of British Aerospace and Barclays are no longer shareholders in Maxwell Communication Corporation, as reported in yesterday's Financial Times. They sold their shares before trading was suspended last November.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India's multitarget surface-to-air missile, Akash  [sky], was successfully test-fired at Chandipur in coastal  Orissa yesterday. In a technological breakthrough, the missile  used an integrated two-stage rocket ramjet propulsion system.  While a normal rocket has an inbuilt oxygen supply system, the  ramjet rocket draws air during flight for combustion in  conjunction with the fuel-rich propellants. India now joins an  exclusive group of three nations possessing such technology.  They are the United States, Russia, and France. The 650-kg  missile Akash has a range of 25 km. It has a (?face) and a radar  called Rajendra capable of multitargeting. Manufactured by the  Defense Research and Development Organization, the missile Akash  has multiple warheads which could target four to five enemy  aircraft at long range. More than 100 parameters were monitored  during the test-flight. Apart from propulsion parameters, the  measured and predicted range values were in close agreement.</p>

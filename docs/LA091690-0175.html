			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FULLERTON STAYS ON THE GROUND, RISES TO 21-13 VICTORY OVER CERRITOS  </P> <P> Fullerton College showed off an impressive running game Saturday that rolled up  395 yards as the Hornets defeated Cerritos, 21-13, at Fullerton District  Stadium.  </P> <P> Fullerton's running game was so dominant that the Hornets attempted only two  passes -- both incomplete -- in the second half.  </P> <P> The surge was led by a quick offensive line and darting quarterback Eric  Robinson. Robinson, who was a wide receiver at Fullerton last season, rushed  for 146 yards in 24 carries. He completed four of 11 passes for 78 yards and  one touchdown. Fullerton had 473 yards in total offense.  </P> <P> "He a tremendous athlete," Fullerton Coach Hal Sherbeck said of Robinson. "We  knew he could do some things, that's why we moved him."  </P> <P> Fullerton's two freshman tailbacks also had strong performances.  </P> <P> Brian Williams rushed for 118 yards in 14 carries and scored a touchdown. Coy  Collins ran for 81 yards and a score in 17 carries. Sophomore fullback Don  Norris added 32 yards in nine carries.  </P> <P> "If there are better backs in this league, I don't want them," said Sherbeck,  who is in his 30th season. "I'll take ours."  </P> <P> Fullerton's defense also had a strong night, led by linebacker Ward Van Pelt  and defensive back Matt Shackelford. Van Pelt recovered a fumble and nabbed an  interception.  </P> <P> Shackelford had a pair of interceptions, each near the end of both halves.  </P> <P> Fullerton scored on a 14-yard run by Williams and on a 31-yard pass from  Robinson to tight end Rob Coons in the second quarter and led, 14-10, at the  half.  </P> <P> Fullerton took a 21-10 lead on a four-yard run by Collins in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Cerritos got a 37-yard field goal by J.D. Barker to cut the lead to 21-13 with  12:53 left in the game.  </P> <P> Cerritos (1-1) then got as close as the Fullerton 2 before the Hornet defense  came up with an important play with about 7 minutes left.  </P> <P> Cerritos quarterback Pete Montera completed a 10-yard pass from the 12 to  Charles Hicks, but as Hicks turned to run for the goal line he was smashed by  several Fullerton players and the ball popped out. It was caught in the air by  Toby Howell.  </P> <P> Fullerton then used its ground game to run out most of the remaining time.Twice  on third down, Robinson was able to convert by scrambling as the Hornets drove  to the Cerritos 28 before turning over the ball on downs with 1:10 left.  </P> <P> Montera, from Kennedy High School, completed two passes before he was  intercepted by Shackelford with 18 seconds left.  </P> <P> Montera was nine of 33 for 270 yards and one touchdown. He also threw three  interceptions. The touchdown was a 75-yarder to Cliff Parks in the second  quarter. Parks ran a simple post pattern, but the Fullerton secondary bought  into a play fake by Montera, leaving Parks at least 20 yards in the clear for  the easy score. Parks caught four passes for 172 yards.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Santa Monica 33, Saddleback College 16 -- Jeff Barrett threw for a touchdown  and ran for two others as Santa Monica (1-0) won at home. Chris Bisgaard scored  on a five-yard run to pace Saddleback (0-1).  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago 32, San Diego Mesa 6 -- Estrus Crayton rushed for 93 yards on  21 carries and caught three passes for 94 yards to lead the Dons (1-0) at San  Diego Mesa. Crayton scored three touchdowns, two on passes from Richard Fanti  and one on a one-yard run. Fanti completed 10 of 14 passes for 195 yards and  two touchdowns. Reserve quarterback Steve Calhoun was five of eight for 57  yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago amassed 449 yards in total offense and limited San Diego to 12  yard rushing.  </P> <P> Golden West 35, Long Beach 14 -- Frank Vaccara rushed for 116 yards in 19  carries, including a 72-yard touchdown run on the first carry of the second  half, to lead Golden West (1-0) at Long Beach (0-2).  </P></p>

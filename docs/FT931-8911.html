			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Labour accuses Major of 'abuse' over Maastricht MR JOHN MAJOR was accused of 'outright abuse' of Britain's constitution by Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, yesterday over the government's handling of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. The attack, which followed an embarrassing about-turn by ministers on Monday, foreshadowed a possible clash between the government and parliament over Labour's amendment to include the social chapter in the bill. Labour leaders said they would try to turn the debate on its amendment 27 on the social chapter into a vote of principle, even though the government said on Monday that fresh legal advice meant that Maastricht could still be ratified without changes if the amendment was passed. Separately, Lord Tebbit, former Tory party chairman and opponent of Maastricht, stepped up his attacks on the prime minister, saying in a speech in Hammersmith, London, that Britain's political leaders no longer cared about the country's independence. Although the government has removed some of the sting from Labour's amendment, the spectacle of Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, correcting the government line set out a few weeks ago by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Europe minister, gave ammunition yesterday to Labour - and Tory opponents of the bill. Last night Mr Smith wrote to the prime minister asking for the publication of the apparently conflicting advice on amendment 27 given by the government's law officers and by the Foreign Office. Earlier in the Commons, Mr Smith said the prime minister was 'determined to use every slippery manoeuvre to avoid parliament deciding this issue. Aren't you engaged in an outright abuse of our unwritten constitution?' He asked Mr Major to say whether parliament should be able to decide if the social chapter should be incorporated. The prime minister confirmed that MPs who back the social chapter will only have the choice of accepting the treaty as a whole or not at all. 'It is for this house to decide by its vote on third reading whether to approve the European Communities (Amendment) Bill and enable the government to ratify the treaty.' There were two sorts of amendment, Mr Major said. 'Those that would render our law incompatible with the treaty and must be defeated, and others which are undesirable but would not prevent us from ratifying.' The government sees amendment 27 as in the second category. But asked by a Labour MP whether he was planning to ignore parliament, Mr Major replied: 'I can't and I don't' Euro-sceptic Tory MPs signalled that they may still vote for Labour's amendment because of possible embarrassment to the government and the faint prospect that it would scupper ratification of Maastricht. With the Liberal Democrats still pledged to back Labour and less likely to back down, the chances of a government defeat have risen since Monday, one Tory rebel said. Labour has been restricted by Commons procedures over what amendments it can table. Amendment 27 would in fact remove the Maastricht treaty protocol including both the social chapter for the other 11 EC members and Britain's opt-out. Labour believes its amendment could still force the government to call an EC conference and implement the social chapter. Edward Mortimer, Page 16 Blocking a two-tier Europe, Page 17</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 May (NA) -- Interior Minister  Carlos Ruckauf today asserted that if the current government  wants to win the 1995 presidential elections it must "eliminate  all pockets of corruption."    Ruckauf acknowledged: "Showing our meritorious  accomplishments will not be enough." The minister said the  government must not only corruption it must also "clearly state  how -- while maintaining the present economic policy -- it  intends to enhance growth and put provincial economies in order  so that their authorities may maintain the transformations the  country is undergoing."    Ruckauf played down the increased popularity of the Grand  Front and other opposition parties in the past 10 April  elections. He remarked that to be a valid alternative "protests  are insufficient."    Ruckauf, talking on the radio, said that in the 10 April  election, some sectors "thought it was important to protest,"  but things will be different in 1995 "because whenever there is  an election for the presidency, governorship, or mayoralty,  voters want to know how they will fare on the market or in life  in the forthcoming months."    He underlined the support the Justicialist Party managed to  maintain in Greater Buenos Aires noting that "men and women  living in the most humble areas voted for the plan that wiped  out hyperinflation and achieved stability" because "they know  there are more jobs, which is quite noticeable among those who  work rather than among those who just hang about."    Ruckauf added: "Nowhere in the world do people kill the  goose  that lays the golden egg, least of all when they have endured  the economic setbacks Argentina has experienced." The minister  concluded: "This country has registered the fastest growth in  the western world over the last three years."</p>

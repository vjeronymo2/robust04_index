The Council reviewed the topics listed on  its agenda, foremost among which was the accord document signed  in Amman, the capital of fraternal Jordan, on the 10th of the  blessed month of Ramadan.    The Presidential Council blessed the signing of the accord  document and commended the efforts made by the Political Forces  Dialogue Committee to draft the document. Moreover, the Council  underlined the importance of the commitment by all to honor the  letter and spirit of the accord document. The Council noted  that this requires the convening of meetings by the state's  constitutional institutions, which are charged with implementing  this document, particularly since this document, which is  binding on all, is supposed to have resolved all political,  media, and military aspects of the crisis. The convening of  such meetings is part of the constitutional responsibilities  that must be shouldered in unison. There should be no attempts  to evade or slacken off on the part of anyone, the Council  maintained.    The Council also expressed its immense appreciation to  fraternal Jordan--king, government, and people--for hosting the  signing ceremony. It also commended the fraternal efforts made  by His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal to safeguard Yemen's unity  and end all manifestations of the political crisis.  Furthermore, the Council praised the efforts and good offices  extended by brothers and friends to enable our country to cope  with the tough challenges posed by the continuation of the  political crisis.    The Presidential Council underscored the need for everyone  to  adhere to this historic national document agreed to by the  Political Forces Dialogue Committee with a strong national  spirit grounded in the certain basic constants, foremost among  which are the following:    --Islam is a creed and a law,    --Unity must be safeguarded,    --Democracy must be protected,    --There must be compliance with the Constitution,    --The base of popular participation in the decisionmaking  process must be broadened,    --Violence must be renounced,    --Dialogue must be used as a civilized mode of behavior to  resolve all disputes.</p>

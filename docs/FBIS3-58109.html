			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Jan 6 (AFP) -- The privatization of  state-owned French companies will continue "at a sustained  rhythm" in 1994, French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said  Thursday [6 January], starting with an oil group and an  insurance company.    The Elf Aquitaine oil and UAP insurance companies will be  privatized "in the next few weeks," Alphandery announced  Wednesday.    Providing further details Thursday, he said that current  core  shareholders in Elf Aquitaine would hold 10 percent of its  capital after privatization.    A call for future core shareholders, who will hold 8.5  percent of capital, will be launched in the official government  journal at the weekend, while the remaining 1.5 percent reserved  for core shareholders will be taken by Union des Assurances de  Paris (UAP), he said.    The state will remain the leading shareholder in Elf  Aquitaine, with 10 to 15 percent of the capital, through the  Erap state holding company. It also reserves the right to veto  an investor's crossing the limit of 10, 20 or 30 percent of  capital or voting rights.    Elf Aquitaine's current stock market value exceeds 100  billion French francs (17.25 billion dollars), 50.76 percent of  which is controlled by Erap.    France is expecting to earn 55 billion francs (9.49 billion  dollars) from privatization of state-owned companies in 1994, 50  billion of which will go into the general budget.    Total state earnings from privatizations between 1994 and  1997 are expected to reach 200 billion francs (34.5 billion  dollars), bringing the budget deficit down to 2.5 percent of GDP  (gross domestic product) in 1997, compared with 4.5 percent in  1993.    The 1993 privatizations of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP)  bank and the Rhone Poulenc pharmaceutical company brought some  41 billion francs (7.1 billion dollars) into French state  coffers.</p>

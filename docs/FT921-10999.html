			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Inquiry into school arson rise CHILD arsonists are wreaking millions of pounds of damage to British schools, according to insurers who will today announce their backing for a research initiative into the problem. The cost of damage caused by arson attacks has doubled over the past five years and is already leading to a rethink about the design of school buildings. It may prompt the government to back costly new fire prevention measures. Evidence suggests that in some areas, such as Tyneside and Strathclyde, school arson is becoming endemic. Municipal Mutual, the company which insures four out of five local authorities, reports that claims from all school fires cost it more than Pounds 57m in 1991, up from Pounds 47m in 1990 and Pounds 18m in 1987. More than two thirds of the claims stem from fires started deliberately. The insurer reported 84 fires costing more than Pounds 100,000 each in 1991, compared with 51 five years ago. Mr Larry Stokes, fire underwriting manager at Municipal Mutual, said the average cost of school fires had risen sharply. He said this reflected the increased use schools were making of electronic equipment such as computers and videos. The research is being launched by the Arson Prevention Bureau, a joint Home Office and insurance industry initiative set up last year. The bureau has asked a team of academics to examine the causes of the fire attacks. There is also increasing concern among educationalists about the long-term costs of arson such as the disruption of classes and the loss of project work and records. The APB investigation is also expected to look closely into ways arson can be prevented. It will examine possible changes in building design, the introduction of new safety and security devices and risk management techniques already being deployed by some headteachers and school managers. Insurers say all schools are lagging behind the private sector in the introduction of alarm and sprinkler systems, and protective fences.</p>

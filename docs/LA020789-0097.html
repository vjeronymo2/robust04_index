			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: FILM MAKERS TRY TO MAKE SALES HUM BY RELEASING  MUSIC BEFORE MOVIE  </P> <P> Turn on any rock music radio station during the next few weeks and chances are  you'll hear a pulsating new song from the movie "Rooftops."  </P> <P> "Rooftops?" Never heard of it, right? That's OK; the film won't even hit local  theaters until mid-March. So what is a song from its sound track doing on the  radio already?  </P> <P> Ask Tom Andrews. He's the guy whose idea it was to release the single recorded  by Etta James and Dave Steward, "Avenue D," to radio stations this week. In  fact, Andrews has just one major mission during the next few months: to get  people humming the music from "Rooftops."  </P> <P> After all, the same people who hum the tunes today are likely candidates to  stand at the box office tomorrow. The soon-to-be-released film is about a gang  of hard-luck New York teen-agers that live atop a tenement house. The film's  director, Robert Wise, also directed "West Side Story."  </P> <P> "If a movie has the right music in it," said Andrews, who has just formed a  Hollywood music marketing company, Extended Wings, "it can create awareness for  the film even before it opens." And if all goes according to plan, when  "Rooftops" does open at theaters nationwide in eight weeks, it will already  have a hit song or two -- and the sound track album will be moving quickly up  the charts.  </P> <P> More and more film studios are recognizing that movies with hit songs often  become bigger hits at the theaters. So Andrews, who formerly was director of  music marketing at Columbia Pictures, will be a sort of middleman between film  studios and record companies. Basically, Extended Wings will do its best to get  radio stations to play the music, and cable television networks such as MTV to  play the music video. It will also be on the lookout for promotions that push  both the movie and music at the same time. They already have filmed the music  video to "Rooftops" on the movie set.  </P> <P> Although most major film studios usually prefer to handle their own music  marketing, some independent film studios go outside for help. "It's probably  not the kind of thing an MCA would be interested in," said Gordon Armstrong,  who formerly oversaw advertising at Universal Pictures and is now executive  vice president at Universal Studios. "But there is a need for this kind of  thing at independent film companies that don't have much expertise in this  market."  </P> <P> Newly formed New Visions Pictures, for example, has just signed Extended Wings  to handle music marketing for its next five motion pictures, including  "Rooftops." The film company's chairman, Taylor Hackford, directed the  box-office hit "An Officer and a Gentleman" and co-produced the film "La  Bamba."  </P> <P> "Music and film companies have traditionally been like oil and water," Hackford  said. He should know, too. When he directed the 1980 box-office flop "The  Idolmaker," about a manager who tries to create rock stars, the album wasn't  released until several weeks after the movie. "As a result," he said, "both the  film and record suffered."  </P> <P> But the studio and record company can make out like bandits, he said, if good  music is correctly used as a marketing tool -- especially when trying to appeal  to teen-agers. The film "Rooftops" is strongly geared toward teens, with young  stars and several songs that were produced by Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics.  So all the ads on radio, TV and at the movies will feature the music. "The  object," said Hackford, "is to get teen-agers to say to themselves, 'Gee, I  like that song, I might like the movie, too.' "  </P> <P> In a bid to reach out to young trend-setters, Andrews is helping to set up  dance contests at popular night clubs in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago that  will feature the music -- and some stars -- from "Rooftops." The object, of  course, is to get young people talking about the music and movie, even before  it opens.  </P> <P> "Often, movie companies and record companies have separate agendas," said Ron  McCarrell, vice president of marketing at Capitol Records, which will issue the  "Rooftops" album weeks before New Visions releases the movie. "The process for  marketing a film can be far different from that of marketing a sound track. But  if you can find someone with a foot in both businesses, that can be the key  marketing link."  </P> <P> Certainly, everyone involved would love to mimic the success of the 1977 film  "Saturday Night Fever," which was not only a box-office smash, but which also  produced a sound track that ranks as one of history's top-selling movie albums.  And more recently, the hit film "Dirty Dancing" sold 10 million albums and  cassettes. But that didn't happen by accident, either.  </P> <P> "Seven months before the movie opened, we saw the rough screening and began  talking about the music and how to market it," said Mike O'Mansky, vice  president of marketing at RCA Records in New York. In fact, RCA knew just how  to reach teen-agers. It quickly struck a deal with a national chain of mall  video arcades that begin to pipe in the music. The arcades sponsored contests  that gave away records and posters to the film.  </P> <P> "None of these things guarantee success," said O'Mansky, "but they sure don't  hurt your odds."  </P> <P> </P> <P> FM Station's Billboard Comes to Life on TV  </P> <P> Stevie Wonder's radio station, KJLH-FM, has never done much advertising. But  about six months ago, Southland commuters began to see highway billboards that  show a group of smiling disc jockeys from the popular station. Now those  billboards have literally come to life in 10-second TV spots.  </P> <P> The television ads, by Jon Byk Advertising of Los Angeles, recreate the  billboard backgrounds that freeway drivers see. In the TV commercial, however,  the eight disc jockeys can talk, laugh and pitch the station. "When you see the  same thing on TV as you see on billboards," said Jon Byk, who created the  campaign, "the synergism helps you remember it better."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The 'Liar' Lives Despite Crash in Isuzu Sales  </P> <P> Joe Isuzu is still firmly in the driver's seat at Isuzu -- even though Ward's  Automotive Reports says 1988 domestic sales of Isuzu cars were off more than  38% in 1988, compared to 1987.  </P> <P> A series of four new spots featuring the popular comic actor David Leisure will  hit the airwaves between now and March. The commercials were all created by the  Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS.  </P> <P> One spot features Joe Isuzu calmly passing a speeding Porsche on West Germany's  Autobahn, while the "liar" is at the wheel of an Isuzu I-Mark RS. In another,  he lures a customer away from a Toyota dealership by shouting from a bullhorn  about better deals on Isuzu trucks. The two other spots, which will not air  until March, feature Joe Isuzu in two new roles: one as the storybook character  who cries wolf once too often and the other as "Dr. Isuzustein," a takeoff on  the mad scientist from Transylvania.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DDB Needham Wins Regional Movie Work  </P> <P> When Universal Pictures released the film "Twins" last year, many people found  out about it when they saw ads that were mutually purchased by Universal and  various movie chains.  </P> <P> This is called "co-op" advertising. And last week, Los Angeles' DDB Needham --  which already handles Universal's national ad business -- was awarded the film  studio's $5-million co-op advertising business in San Diego, Sacramento, San  Francisco and Denver. It marks the first job that the ad agency's newly formed  entertainment division has won.  </P> <P> "To start 1989 with a new piece of business is delightful," said Dave Park,  president of DDB's Los Angeles office. The agency's first new assignment:  placing ads for the March release of the upcoming Chevy Chase film, "Fletch  Lives."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Designers' Contest Ad Left Out Key Points  </P> <P> "Jay Chiat has won: 15 Clio awards, 16 Art Director awards, 13 One Show awards,  15 Andy awards and 0 Designers &amp; Art Directors Assn. of London awards. See  why the D&amp;AD awards are the hardest to win."  </P> <P> That print ad -- which actually refers to awards the ad firm Chiat/Day won last  year -- appeared in last week's issue of the trade magazine Adweek. It seems to  imply that the event is so selective that even the Los Angeles area's most  successful ad man, Jay Chiat, can't make the grade at the contest, which is  co-sponsored by Adweek.  </P> <P> But that's not quite the case. Chiat/Day's Los Angeles office reports that it  didn't even enter the contest last year, and its New York office had just one  print ad in the competition. In fact, last year was the first year the contest  accepted entries from U.S. ad agencies.  </P> <P> "In no way is this ad a snipe at Chiat/Day," said Edward Booth-Clibborn,  chairman of the association, which plans to run more ads that cite other large  American ad agencies that have failed to win any of its awards. "This is simply  a campaign to show that this is the most difficult award to obtain."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agency to Target Small Regional Latino Firms  </P> <P> When Latino ad firms open in Los Angeles, they're usually on the prowl for big  national advertisers.  </P> <P> Last month, however, one Latino ad firm opened here with a far different  mission -- local and regional advertisers. That agency, Font &amp; Vaamonde,  will also help its New York office create some local and regional Latino  promotions for General Foods products, including Kool-Aid and Jell-O. But it  plans to go after mostly local operations in Los Angeles -- such as restaurant  chains with ad budgets as small as $100,000 annually -- that want to reach  Southland Latinos.  </P> <P> "Everyone else is so concerned about the big national accounts, that they're  ignoring these smaller companies," said Elda Bravo, manager of operations for  the West Coast office, which already has 14 employees. "We won't be bringing in  any people from New York," she promised. "We'll only be hiring local people."  </P></p>

Wards is a national chain of retail department stores, and of specialty stores selling appliances and consumer electronics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complaint alleges that Wards has violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR 702.3(a)) pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C. &sect;2301). This Rule requires Wards to maker manufacturers' warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the Rule, are to improve the information available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in the marketing of consumer product warranties offered by manufacturers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either 1) displaying the text of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or 2) furnishing the text of manufacturers' warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties. The complaint alleges that Wards has not complied with either of these options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed order requires Wards to comply with this Rule, to inform its retail store executives of their compliance responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing its sales personnel about the availability and location of manufacturers' warranty information. Wards will be subject to civil penalties if it does not comply with the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Tokyo's department stores suffer further sales decline DEPARTMENT store sales in Tokyo - an early indicator of Japanese consumer spending - declined in real terms in February for the third month running, the Japan Department Stores Association said yesterday. Sales for the month totalled Y191.9bn (Pounds 835m), with a reported 0.2 per cent increase from a year ago accounted for by the extra day in February this year. The figures provided further evidence that continued strong consumer spending may fail to underpin the otherwise weak Japanese economy, as many economists had hoped. Clothing sales were up modestly by 0.6 per cent, while household goods sales rose by 1.6 per cent. Foodstuffs sales were 7 per cent higher, while miscellaneous goods were off by 5.3 per cent. Sales of highly-priced items such as paintings were depressed. February steel production fell below 8m tonnes for the first time in four years, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. Output fell by 11.7 per cent to 7.8m tonnes as weak demand forced companies to reduce inventories. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry also revised upward earlier estimates of inventories in January, which are now reported as 12.2 per cent higher than a year ago. Industrial production fell by 4 per cent compared with a year ago. The net operation rate of industrial facilities was 6 per cent lower.</p>

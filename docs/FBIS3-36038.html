The editing  commission made 173 amendments to the draft.    Two amendments were made by the Russian president. He  proposed that the upper chamber should take into account, when  voting, the total number of Federation Council members (178  under the constitution) and not the number of elected  legislators (171) if the chamber votes on such decisions as  release from the posts of upper chamber speaker and his depties  as well as elections of members of upper chamber committees.    The presidential amendments were turned down.    The Federation Council continues discussing the draft  regulations, and, to all appearances, the debate will take the  rest of the day.</p>

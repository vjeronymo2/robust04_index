			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ALMOST' IS ALMOST A GOOD FILM  </P> <P> "Almost an Angel" (citywide) might just as well be called " 'Crocodile' Dundee  Gets Religion." As amiable as ever, lean and leathery Paul Hogan plays a career  criminal and electronics wizard who, fresh out of prison, assumes a hilariously  precise Willie Nelson impersonation and knocks over a bank. Before he can do a  repeat performance, this time disguised as Rod Stewart, he instinctively rushes  into oncoming traffic to shove a toddler to safety.  </P> <P> The next thing Hogan knows he's up in the clouds being interviewed by the Big  Probation Officer in the Sky, played to perfection in his silvery Moses mane  and beard by an unbilled Charlton Heston. In a stroke of inspiration, Hogan --  who is the film's writer as well as its executive producer -- keeps us guessing  whether he has actually died or has just dreamed he did, but fails to make  anything of the dilemma.  </P> <P> Indeed, after a lively and imaginative start, the film is downhill, a treacly  business about how Hogan, now on the lam, lands in Fillmore, where he comes to  the rescue of the dying young operator (Elias Koteas) of a recreation center  for latch-key kids and his acerbic sister (Linda Kozlowski). Koteas and  Kozlowski are likable, but their roles are pretty thankless.  </P> <P> The chronic dearth of family films, plus Hogan's undeniable laid-back appeal,  may work to the film's advantage over the holidays, but "Almost an Angel"  really belongs on the tube. It was produced and directed with warmth and  efficiency by John Cornell, who produced Hogan's Australian TV programs and  created with Hogan the Australian Tourist Commission's celebrated advertising  campaign for the United States.  </P> <P> To the filmmakers' credit they fill the film's countless small roles with  numerous minority actors and with such seasoned veterans as Doreen Lang (as  Koteas and Kozlowski's mother), Parley Baer and Hank Worden. "Almost an Angel"  (rated PG but G is more like it), which is enlivened by Maurice Jarre's  helpfully melodramatic score, is in the Christmas spirit but is a  disappointment in the wake of the "Crocodile" Dundee movies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Almost an Angel'  </P> <P> Paul Hogan: Terry Dean  </P> <P> Elias Koteas: Steve Garner  </P> <P> Linda Kozlowski: Rose Garner  </P> <P> Doreen Lang: Mrs. Garner  </P> <P> A Paramount presentation of an Ironbark Films production.

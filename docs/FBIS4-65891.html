			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Shortly after returning from Brussels as  part of the Foreign Ministry team that negotiated Finland's  accession agreement with the European Union [EU], Esa Harmala  was elected chairman of an occupational association that has  publicly expressed concern about the livelihood of its  constituency under the EU, the Farmers and Forestry Owners'  Association (MTK). Harmala, 39 and a forest owner, had gained  recognition as MTK's trade policy chief prior to 1991, when  Prime Minister Esko Aho appointed him chief economic adviser.  When negotiations began with Brussels, Aho asked him to move to  the Foreign Ministry post. Though widely applauded in the press  for his efforts in Brussels as the negotiator in charge of  agricultural issues and enjoying the support of Aho and his  farmer-oriented Center Party, Harmala's narrow margin of victory  (37-33) over active farmer and Center Party MP Juha Korkeaoja on  28 April was attributed by Helsinki's two leading dailies  (HELSINGIN SANOMAT and HUFVUDSTADSBLADET editions of 29 April  1994) to be largely due to controversy surrounding his Brussels  role. Many MTK board members blamed Harmala for helping forge an  agreement that will result in lower producer prices and farm  incomes, and may eventually force them off the land. Although  voting in the leadership board was by secret ballot, in comments  before and after the balloting, many Harmala supporters  emphasized they did not want their vote for him interpreted as  supporting EU membership, according to HUFVUDSTADSBLADET  reporter Inger Blomqvist.    Following approval of the entry document by the European  Parliament on 2 May, Finnish opponents and proponents are now  organizing for the membership referendum campaign. While the  government has not yet set the date for the referendum, it is  expected to be held in late September or early October, leaving  Harmala, who will not assume his new office until late June,  very little time to heal wounds and unify the MTK before the  vote.    The mood in MTK, according to the HUFVUDSTADSBLADET article,  is perhaps the bleakest in the history of the 80-year-old  organization. In April last year, Prime Minister Esko Aho  appointed then MTK Chairman Heikki Haavisto as foreign minister.  Haavisto had served as chief of the MTK since 1976, and like  Korkeaoja, had been a farmer, gaining great popularity among his  constituency as a farmers' champion. As in choosing Harmala, Aho  picked Haavisto as part of his overall strategy for overcoming  resistance from the powerful agricultural lobby. Haavisto was  deemed best able to assuage the powerful farmer and  food-processing sectors while directing Finland's entry bid  (HUFVUDSTADSBLADET editorial, 16 April 1993). While food  industry leaders have indicated that most of their objections  have been overcome (HUFVUDSTADSBLADET, 14 April 1994) many  farmers -- especially those in the colder and more remote north  -- still feel doubly betrayed with Harmala's victory, having had  their demands for a special "Arctic Agriculture" arrangement  largely rejected (HELSINGIN SANOMAT, 23 February 1994).    In the hour-long prevote discussion, Harmala said he  understood that many farmers blamed him personally for negative  provisions in the entry document, especially the lack of a  "transition" regime toward open trade. At the election meeting,  Harmala pleaded that his role as a Foreign Ministry official was  to get the best deal possible for Finland as well as for the  farmers, and that as their new chairman he would put their  interests above all else (HUFVUDSTADSBLADET, 29 April 1994). He  also reiterated the current MTK posture of delaying definitive  announcement on the membership referendum until the details of  the accession agreement are made clear, asserting that some of  the provisions are "subject to interpretation." According to an  editorial in the HELSINGIN SANOMAT of 29 April 1994, this delay  is a clear sign that even though the entry document has been  published and the European Parliament has given its sanction,  the MTK may still have difficulty formulating a position  acceptable to its membership.</p>

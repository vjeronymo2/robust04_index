			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Computer model could cut nitrogen applications Predictions of the nitrogen needs of crops on different fields at varying times of year can be made available to farmers on a computer model developed by Horticulture Research International, the company said this week. It claimed the computer programme would enable farmers to target their nitrogen applications more accurately so that crops grew well. It should help eliminate the environmental damage and waste of money associated with using too much nitrogen fertiliser. The company said the computer model, which had been tested over 3,000 hectares, offered nitrogen predictions for a wide range of crops. The model comes as farmers face mounting pressure from environmentalists about cutting their use of nitrogen fertilisers.</p>

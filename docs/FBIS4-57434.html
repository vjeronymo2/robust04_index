			<p>BFN     [Text] (NA-DYN) -- President Carlos Menem signed a decree  extending federal control of the province of Santiago del Estero  until 10 days after next year's general election, local news  agencies announced last night. Menem signed the executive order  early this morning at Jorge Newbery Metropolitan airport before  departing for the fourth Ibero-American Information Science and  Law Congress in San Carlos de Bariloche.    Federal trustee Juan Schiaretti's tenure in Santiago del  Estero was due to end yesterday under the original measure  approved by Congress last December following several days of  violent protest in the provincial capital. The President sent a  bill to Congress last week but the body was unable to make  quorum and thus Menem decided to resort to a decree.    Earlier yesterday, Santiago del Estero National Deputy Jose  Luis Zavalia warned that the use of a decree could endanger the  Radical-Justicialist Olivos Pact on constitutional reform  because "federal takeovers must be ordered exclusively by  Congress." The deputy accused Menem of extending federal  control in order to take over the province's social security  system and privatize public agencies "without adequate  legislative control."</p>

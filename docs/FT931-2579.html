			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises as inflation worries are overcome Wall Street BIG BOARD stocks rallied strongly yesterday as Wall Street shrugged off forebodings of shrinking consumer spending and lingering worries about inflation, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 38.90 up at 3,465.64, after forging ahead more than 50 points in the afternoon and triggering the New York Stock Exchange's rules limiting computer-driven programme buying. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 3.58 at 451.89. Nasdaq gains were more modest, with the composite only 0.01 higher at 687.41, and the American SE composite also posted a marginal rise, of 0.64 to 421.12. New York SE volume amounted to 241m shares, and rises led declines by 1,257 to 645. There was little stock market reaction to the release of data showing a 6.7 per cent drop in exports and a 4.8 per cent decline in imports for January. In the bond market, however, the numbers sparked speculation that consumer spending would ease, and contributed to higher bond prices. The drop in the long bond's yield, and Germany's reduced discount rate, contributed to a picture of falling interest rates and helped to lift share prices. Equities also overcame Wednesday's inflation worries following reports that the core consumer price index rose more sharply than expected. The Dow rallied in spite of continuing pressure from drug company stocks, which continued to lose ground yesterday. Ford Motor climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 51 5/8 . Analysts at Salomon Brothers increased their 1993 earnings estimates to Dollars 3.25 a share from Dollars 2.10, reflecting a strong start to the year by the US automaker. Salomon predicted first-quarter earnings of 80 cents a share, well above its earlier estimate of 25 cents. A year ago, Ford earned 36 cents in the first quarter. Anheuser Busch dipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 3/8 in heavy turnover. On Wednesday, the brewer predicted a decline of about 7 per cent in first-quarter earnings to 69 cents a share. Although Anheuser had already warned Wall Street to expect slimmer sales volume, the company's outlook grew grimmer after a blizzard hit the east coast ahead of St Patrick's Day, an important time for beer sales. Western Digital fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 5 7/8 in active trading after predictions that third-quarter earnings will drop significantly below analysts' estimates of 20 to 26 cents a share. Gains in the Nasdaq market were offset by weakness in several healthcare stocks. Tokos Medical tumbled Dollars 1 3/4 to a 52-week low of Dollars 6 3/4 after predicting disappointing sales. SciMed Life Systems, a medical device maker, dropped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 . Canada TORONTO closed firmer after fairly heavy trade, underpinned by strength in US and Canadian bonds and equity gains on Wall Street. The TSE 300 index rose 18.3 to 3,559.3 and advances led falls by 376 to 266 on volume of 44.5m shares.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Suzuki to export cars from India - Geneva Motor Show Suzuki, the Japanese carmaker, is to begin exporting cars to west Europe from India. Later this year it will launch in Europe its Alto minicar produced by Maruti Udyog, its Indian production base. The car was launched last summer in India, where it is sold as the Maruti Zen. The Alto is the first model Suzuki has developed at an overseas production base for introduction in overseas markets. Maruti Udyog is India's largest car manufacturer and was the first large-scale Japanese-Indian joint venture. It is 50/50 owned by Suzuki and the Indian government. Maruti is expanding its production capacity from 130,000 vehicles a year at present to 200,000 by the end of the year in order to expand sales in both the domestic and export markets. This spring it will produce its one millionth vehicle since it began production in 1983 under India's 'people's car plan'. It controls 70 per cent of the Indian car market. Suzuki's move to begin supplying the European market from India comes at a time when it is has run into serious problems with its production plant in Spain, where it assembles small four-wheel-drive sports/utility vehicles, the Vitara and the SJ series. Santana Motor, its 82 per cent owned Spanish subsidiary has recently applied for protection from creditors under pressure of mounting losses, and Suzuki has threatened to close the plant unless it receives state aid. Suzuki also has an assembly plant in Hungary, from which it will export cars to west Europe next month.</p>

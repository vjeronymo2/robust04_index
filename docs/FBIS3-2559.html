A  senior Chinese official yesterday confirmed for the first time  that Chan, the former secretary for education and manpower, and  Yeung, the former secretary for the treasury, had been  approached by the New China News Agency (XINHUA) and invited to  be among the third batch of advisers.    Neither was available for comment yesterday. They are  believed to be considering the offers.    The Chinese source also confirmed that Peggy Lam one of the  most senior legislative councillors and chairwoman of Wan Chai  District Board, had accepted the offer to become an adviser  along with four other district board chairmen. They are Shum  Choi-sang of Eastern, the former owner of WAH KIU YAT PO; Choy  Wai-shek of Sham Shui Po, also a member of the Airport  Consultative Committee; Pang Hang-yin of North; and Chau  How-chen of Tsuen Wan. The appointments will be announced in  Beijing at the end of this month.    The new advisers will be invited, like their predecessors,  to  go to Beijing to attend a certificate awards ceremony.    XINHUA is understood to be involved in final consultations  with several other candidates who are still to decide whether to  serve on the influential advisory body.    Chan, now managing director of Kowloon Motor Bus, was once a  key strategist for the government in handling talks with China  over the future of Hong Kong leading up to the signing of the  Joint Declaration in 1984. He is also tipped as one of the  strongest candidates for the future chief executive of the  special administrative region (SAR) government after the  handover in 1997.    When Chan left the administration last summer, he said that  he would be prepared to offer advice to the Chinese government  if it was sought. Chan's resignation was a surprise to the  administration and he has refused to reveal why he quit. It has  been speculated that he left to distance himself from the  controversial political reform plans of the Governor, Chris  Patten, and to further his political future after 1997.    Yeung was a more distant runner in the chief executive  stakes. It was believed that he resigned from the government  last year over differences of opinion with Patten over the  administration's style of management. Yeung is regarded as a  top administrator and is now an executive director of Sino Land,  a land development and investment company.    It is Beijing's intention to invite former government  officials to be advisers because of their knowledge,  understanding, and experience. It is understood that there will  be about 40 new Hong Kong affairs advisers, bringing the total  to more than 100. China has already invited two democrats,  Antony Cheung, chairman of Meeting Point, and Frederick Fung,  chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's  Livelihood, to become advisers. They have accepted the  invitations.    China has appointed three levels of advisers: The  Prepapartory Working Committee, the Hong Kong advisers and the  more junior district affairs advisers, who were appointed last  week to advise on nonpolitical matters. Two district board  chairmen, Ambrose Lau of Central and Western and Lau Wong-fat of  Tuen Mun, were appointed in the first and second batches.</p>

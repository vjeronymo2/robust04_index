			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Chevron to learn fate of Kazakh venture 'in month' CHEVRON, the fourth biggest US oil and gas company, expects to learn within a month whether its long-delayed joint-venture plans to develop Kazakhstan's Tenghiz field will get the green light, according to Mr Ken Derr, the group's chairman. 'It will be a very high-risk deal from our point of view,' Mr Derr said in London. 'On the other hand, it is unique in terms of the size, and could have a meaningful impact for a company the size of ours for a very long time.' His comments come in the wake of a deal signed by Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, to explore for oil in Kazakhstan. The former Soviet republic is understood to have potential reserves of almost 100bn barrels. Elf has said exploration costs could amount to more than Dollars 600m (Pounds 342m), with production targeted for 1995. Chevron's plans to develop the Tenghiz field, one of the world's largest with total reserves estimated at 20bn barrels, and recoverable reserves of about 4bn barrels, have been severely disrupted by the upheavals of the past two years inside the former Soviet Union. Talks began three years ago, and went into top gear after Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, visited the US two years ago. Two expert commissions set up by Moscow to examine Chevron's proposals called the terms of the deal into question. The break-up of the Soviet empire led to the newly independent Kazakh government setting up a its own negotiating committee, with fresh proposals from Chevron being presented in autumn last year. 'In 1990, I said the deal would be settled by the end of the year. I said the same at the end of 1991. Now I have quit making forecasts,' Mr Derr said. 'All you can say is that there is nothing the country needs more than developments like this.' First the Soviet government, and now the Kazakhs, have sought foreign collaboration because of peculiar difficulties in developing the Tenghiz field: 'It's a high pressure, high-sulphur, high-cost project, with a lot of gas recovery involved,' Mr Derr added. Full development would involve total investments of up to Dollars 1bn. The break-up of the Soviet empire has added complexity not just because of the confusion and disruption it has caused: pipelines from the field pass through Russia to the Black Sea and to Russian refineries. Any significant increase in output from the field would need new pipelines to be built across Russia. Until the break-up, arrangements could be negotiated with a single Soviet entity: now, any joint venture set up between Chevron and the Kazakhs would have to negotiate with the Russian authorities over pipelines and access to ports and refineries.</p>

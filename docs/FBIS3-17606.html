According to the  Commission, the turnout at these elections is lower than in the  elections for the president of the Republic of Crimea at the end  of January, when, for instance, by 1200 43.4 per cent of the  electorate had voted already. [passage omitted] But all of that  does not give rise to fears and the elections will take place.  The election turnout in the rural rayons is the highest. There  are rayons where over 40 percent of the electorate have voted,  in particular in the Pervomayskiy [Pervomayskoye], Razdolnenskiy  [Radzolnoye], and Sovetskiy rayons. Almost 20 percent of the  electorate have voted in the city of Simferopol, and 21.45 per  cent of the electorate in the city of Sevastopol -- the Black  Sea Fleet base.    As is known, elections to the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine are  taking place simultaneously in Crimea and their are no instances  of mass refusal to take part in the elections. A poll is also  being carried out in which the people of Crimea have to express  their attitude about Crimea building mutual relations with  Russia and also about dual citizenship.    Sergey Nikulin, spokesman of the President of the Republic  of  Crimea on relations with the Central Electoral Commission,  reported that the poll is being conducted in an organized manner  and the poll ballot papers are being given out along with the  ballot papers for voting on elections to the parliament of  Crimea and the parliament of Ukraine.    John Finerti [name as received], the CSCE representative,  gives the same assessment at the first stage of today's  elections in Crimea. He said that his first impression from his  acquaintance with the organization of the elections and his  visits to a number of polling stations makes it possible to say  that everything is proceeding as normal so far.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] With respect to future evolution of underground  waste disposal research and development, it is based on the  fruits of research and development mentioned in the ``Technical  Report.'' The following are ideas to be used for enhancing the  drive for further research and development.    Also, at the same time, surveys and studies in order to  properly grasp the deep geological environment, the technical  development of the highest level and validity for design and  construction work of artificial barriers and disposal sites, the  near field performance evaluation, and further advancement on  the reliability of the multiple barrier system are considered  especially important items.  <H3>  Importance of Grasping the Concept of Reciprocal  Relationship with Natural Phenomena </H3>   Survey Studies of Geological Environment  Conditions. With respect to geological environment  condition survey studies, viewing from the point of underground  waste disposal, further focus on geological environment  condition is important in obtaining a long term safety security.  It is necessary to develop and improve survey, measuring  techniques and related instruments in order that highly reliable  and substantial data of the deep underground geological  structure, the distribution of rocks and strata, rock-bed  materials, hydro-geology characteristics and the earth chemical  characteristics of underground water can be accumulated.    On the other hand, historical records of activities created  by natural phenomena such as volcanic activities, earthquakes,  fault activities, upheavals and erosions, weather fluctuations,  and changes in ocean surface should be made and together, it is  important to evaluate the possibility of the influence these  effects might have on the multiple barrier system. At this  point, not only is the evaluation of individual natural  phenomenon important but it should include into consideration  the reciprocal relationship of each phenomenon in order to  obtain a collective picture. Also, with natural phenomena such  as volcanic activities which are thought to be area dependent,  there exists the importance and necessity of appropriately  evaluating the phenomena of the area by further developing  evaluating methods and techniques. Furthermore, in addition to  effects from natural phenomena, large scale human originated  activities such as forestry conservation work and resource  development can influence geological environment that should  preferably be investigated.  <H5>  Tests for Assumed Severest Conditions </H5>   Research Development for Waste Disposal  Techniques. With respect to research and development for  waste disposal techniques concerning artificial barriers, upon  clarifying the required businesses, it is necessary to perform  research and development with strong emphasis on developing a  highly reliable artificial barrier. In regards to overpack, a  long term durability research and development should be  continued for carbon steel and at the same time, it is desirable  that materials other than carbon steel such as titanium should  be investigated. Also, it is necessary to advance investigations  of design and production including the soundness of welding of  the overpack. As for the buffer, using clay (bentonite) as the  main product should be of central concern, but other new  material should be investigated widely on its individual  characteristics and methods. In regards to operational methods,  security in performance is of utmost importance and therefore,  research and development for large scale testing is necessary.  For the technical development of the waste disposal site design,  construction and operation, it would be important to plan  improvements on the basis of various elements in technology such  that an overall combined technique composed of analytical,  inspection and application be included. Furthermore, it is  desirable that investigation on long term stability of caves and  drifts be tested under assumed severe conditions for safety.  <H5>  The Expansion of Radioactive Material Data Base </H5>   Performance Evaluation Study. In the area of  performance evaluation, presently, the most demanding ones are  concerned with near field and the improvement in trust of the  multiple barrier system. For the purpose, analytical models,  technical skills on improvements and developments accompanied  with reasonable confirmation, and the securing of confidence in  the analytical data are thought to be especially important.    Also, by efficiently utilizing the research institution for  performance evaluation run by Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel  Development Corporation (PNC), a plan for a complete basic data  and the expansion of data base that includes necessary data for  analysis such as thermodynamics of radioactive material will be  necessary. On the other hand, in order to grasp scientifically  the long term phenomena, it is useful to understand natural  phenomena. Therefore, the continued enforcement of natural  analog study should be made together with the observation of  kinetics pertaining to earth chemical reaction.  <H5>  Further Raising the Level of Deep Underground Studies </H5>   Mutual Subjects and Ways for Future Progress. In  order to advance future research and development, the products  yielded from the past shown in the ``Technical Reports'' should  be further realized. The geological environmental conditions  should be gasped even more in fineness, attainment of high level  technology needs to be planned, and precision improvements in  analytical skills are going to be needed. It will be pertinent  that consideration in obtaining high level results that are  trustworthy from all research areas is absolutely a requirement.  In order to satisfy this, it is important to advance research  institutions, substantiate facilities and proceed in educating  human resources.    Especially, the deep underground study institution is the  necessary base for the mutual research of survey studies of  geological environment conditions, research and development of  waste disposal techniques and for performance evaluation  studies. Also, in combination, it is a useful research institute  for educational contributions to our country's collective  research on geology, hydrologic, earth chemistry, rock  engineering etc. that relates to deep underground. In the case  of PNC, it is now in progress of planning and establishing a  research and development of underground waste disposal  techniques that is in agreement with our country's geological  surroundings. However, since the research and development will  be long term, it will come under the number two overall  collection planned by PNC prior to year 2000, and through  federal evaluation, the progress of the research and development  will be ascertained, and it would be necessary to further  evaluate and examine future study policies.    Furthermore, in the future, in order to collectively and  efficiently advance research and development, PNC, which is  acting as the kernel and the propelling force, will be central  for others such as Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute,  Geological Survey of Japan, and the federal testing and research  system. Also cooperation from universities and active  contributions from related civilian technical power together  with international cooperation is going to be necessary for  efficient advancement.</p>

Musa said the Damascus Declaration foreign ministers will  discuss the situation in the Middle East in light of  developments in the peace process and the tense situation in  other areas of the region.    The conferees will also discuss economic cooperation in the  Middle East, follow up on the declaration's contents, and hold  consultations on various issues in the region.    Commenting on the Syrian-U.S. summit scheduled to be held in  Geneva in mid-January, Musa said that Egypt believes that this  summit is especially important because it concerns the  Syrian-Israeli track, a primary track in the peace process. He  added that the issue of land for peace will be discussed  specifically and decisively at this summit, noting that the land  in question is the Golan Heights, which was occupied in 1967.    The summit will also include a discussion on the concept of  peace, making the meeting an important landmark in the peace  process. Musa noted that the U.S. role is fundamental because  the United States is the main sponsor of the peace process,  which it launched in Madrid.    He said that this process is based on several guarantees and  rules governed by the principle of land for peace, and therefore  the U.S. role is fundamental.    Musa said Egypt attaches special importance to this summit  and fully supports it. He added that President Husni Mubarak  discussed this summit during his contacts with the various  parties involved in the peace process.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by IFP President Mangosuthu </F> Buthelezi in Ulundi on 27 April]    [Text] We now cross over to Ulundi for that report that I  promised earlier on. Gary Alfonso is standing by.    [Alfonso] Good evening. We have just returned from a news  conference with the chief minister of KwaZulu and also the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and  unfortunately our previous program cut out halfway due to a  failure of power here, and we hope you can see it at the moment.  So this is the news conference, as it happened a short while  ago. It seems there's a crisis looming, the IFP could pull out  of the elections. That's the scenario. Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi  said, when he said that the elections are not free and fair in  this area, and unless something happens, that could change. We  bring you that news conference as it happened.    [Begin recording] [Buthelezi] I think the crisis revolves  around the IFP stickers, because that has been the case since  yesterday that many elderly people who queued up in various  places could not -- I was in Umlazi this morning and also here  in Ulundi and other places, they are confused as most of our  people, more than 60 percent I would say are either illiterate  or semi-literate. They were told that those who support my  party must go for the bottom, must go for the last party. But  now we discovered that even in Cape Town people were supplied  with papers which didn't have the IFP sticker. So there was a  lot of anger among those people in Cape Town who would have  liked to vote for the IFP.    But now Dr. Mzimela, who is in Johannesburg permanently in  order to be available to the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission], has just reported to the head of my department that  a suggestion has been made. It appears as if the IFP stickers  are really running short, if they are not exhausted -- supplies  already exhausted. Now that prevents a very serious crisis as  far as I'm concerned because it seems that a suggestion which in  fact we rejected on the 19th when we signed the agreement with  the state president and Mr. Mandela on the basis of which we are  participating in the elections, when someone suggested that  people could just write IFP at the bottom. That was out of the  question, first of all because most of our people are  illiterate, and secondly, we believe that it interferes also  with the secrecy of the ballot.    So, I have been informed by our information office in  Durban that in fact such papers, you know, have been completely  exhausted now. The supplies are exhausted, and if that be the  case then we are heading for a very serious problem because I  have already sent a fax letter to Judge Kriegler, as the  chairman of the IEC. In this letter, I am asking him in fact  whether we are really trying to foist that option of writing IFP  at the bottom of the paper, when it was rejected, when it was  rejected before we signed the agreement on the base of which we  are participating in the elections, because quite clearly I  think that I will have to ask for a very special meeting of the  Central Committee to rule out whether, in fact, we can be part  of that which is now...[pauses] if that is true, if we are going  to be part of that, that it's going to be an operation now  outside of the four corners of the agreement that was made on  the 19th in Pretoria. So I felt that this matter was serious  because all of you here are aware that these stickers, from the  very word go, yesterday, in many parts they were not even  available. But to actually hear now that the supplies have been  exhausted completely -- they represent us with a serious ... a  serious ... a serious crisis, I think, because there is no way  ... there is no way in which we will accept -- I don't know of  course what the Central Committee will say if I put it to them,  but as far as I'm concerned we made it clear on the 19th that,  that was unacceptable, and there is no way in which we can  accept that today, because quite clearly we would be losers. And  Judge Kriegler of course was here, on television just now, after  I had invited you already to come here, and he was saying some  things about those papers that do not have this or those papers  where people write IFP could be counted separately and they  could decide how ... [pauses] what their value is and so on. I  mean, there is a lot of confusion.    Ladies and Gentlemen, don't say later that Buthelezi is now  saying that I told you so. But really, all the difficulties  that have been reported by some of you in the media that I'm  being difficult, I'm being obdurate, I'm being stubborn, I'm  being obstructive arose because I said purely on the basis of  logistics, I could not see that in fact the 27th was an  appropriate date because quite frankly, having grown among our  people, the black people here, and knowing actually that the  voter education hadn't gone far enough itself, I was very  skeptical that one could have an election that has any chances  of being declared free and fair. But nevertheless, in spite of  the fact that we had only about seven days to campaign, in the  interest of the country, once the king's matter and the issue of  the KwaZulu kingdom was sorted then I thought that it would then  confirm that we're all the names that we've been called, if we  said that in spite of the fact that that has been sorted out,  even a special session of parliament has been called, but  nevertheless we still would not want to participate. [end  recording]    [Alfonso] That's the news conference as it happened here a  few moments ago here in the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly just  about half a kilometer from here, and maybe it's a bit strong to  say that the IFP is threatening to pull out of the election if  one looks at it in a summary sort of way, but it appears more  that this is a warning from the IFP leader that if the situation  here on the ground in KwaZulu/Natal where ballot boxes and  ballot booths and polling stations are sadly lacking in many  rural areas, if that's not sorted out, then maybe some meeting  will have to be called with other political leaders to address  how free and fair this election was. That's what I as a reporter  read into it.</p>

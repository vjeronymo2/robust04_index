			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vuoristo: "New Road Projects in </F> Supplementary Budget. The Academy Will Get Money To Pay Top  Experts Studying Reindustrialization"]    [Text] The supplementary budget bill presented by the  government on Friday [4 February] is intended to speed up public  investments mainly. For the most part they are transportation  projects. Employment promotion and research appropriations are  added.    There is only a small portion in this supplementary budget  for measures to speed up private investments. They are intended  to accelerate primarily through tax relief and investment  assistance that have not yet been budgeted. The idea is that the  relief will be received this year, in particular by the projects  starting at the beginning of the year.    The final amount of the supplementary budget is over 1.7  billion markkas, but paying for it will require only a little  over 700 million in new loans. The remainder will be collected  as additional income from business establishments, among other  things. The supplementary budget will raise the expenditures  budgeted for the current year to 195.2 billion markkas and the  new borrowing requirement to 69 billion markkas.  <H5>  Almost a Billion for Transportation Routes </H5>   The government is proposing 455 million markkas for road  work. With the money, work will begin on a freeway between  Hameenlinna and Iitala, road work between Jyvaskyla-Etu-Palokka  and Imatra-Kaukopaa, as well as the Iisalmi bypass, the  Raippaluoto bridge, and the Miukki interchange in Tornio.    In addition road work between Paimio-Turku, Oulu-Ii,  Benbole-Vanhakartano, and Matinkyla-Helsinki will be speeded up.  About 20 smaller maintenance sites will be started in various  parts of the country.    Railroad improvements will be speeded up by 400 million  markkas including the sectors between Helsinki and Turku and  Helsinki and Seinajoki. Railroad yards will be repaired in  Niirala, Vainikkala, and Kouvola. The Board of Navigation will  receive 40 million markkas for repairing the Rauma channel.    Construction of the Vaasa courthouse will be speeded up, and  the Glosholm coast guard station, the Kajaani barracks of the  border guard, the Mikkeli technical institute, and the Joensuu  forestry center will receive additional repair money.    Since the highway and rail work map did not satisfy the  Center Party ministers in particular, it was decided to propose  money also for investments in areas with the worst unemployment.    The Labor Ministry will receive 310 million markkas and  substantially more authority to grant government assistance for  local government investments that improve the prerequisites for  industry as well as the state's own employment-creating projects.  <H5>  Top Researchers for the Academy </H5>   The government proposes 55 million markkas more as  assistance  for renewable energy investments and energy conservation.  Appropriations this year will be 175 million markkas. Additional  money is also proposed for establishment costs for the local  governments' social and health services.    The Board of the Finnish Academy proposes an appropriation  of  60 million markkas for reindustrialization and research on it.  The money is intended to be used to hire 30 top researchers and  their assistants for a period of two years to do research in the  interests of reindustrialization.    The institutions of higher learning will be given money for  hiring 300 recent graduates as research assistants.    It is proposed that 22 million markkas be allocated for  publicizing the European Union question. Of this amount 10  million will be distributed to organizations for promoting  publicity and the remainder to the Foreign Ministry's Europe  information office.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong and Bangkok turn back after bull runs SHARP reverses were suffered in Hong Kong and Bangkok, although other markets continued the region's record-setting run. Tokyo was closed for a national holiday. Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel said that given the region's performance so far this year, it was due for a consolidation. He believed some centres would now 'catch their breath' in preparation for the rally that traditionally precedes the Chinese New Year HONG KONG retreated 3 per cent as a late wave of profit-taking pulled the Hang Seng index 290.80 lower to 9,352.11. The correction was attributed to short-term speculative activity by investors keen to book some profits after the market's 25.6 per cent bull run since the start of October. Among the most active blue chips, HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 88, Cheung Kong lost HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 36.25, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 54.50 and Hong Kong Telecom dropped 70 cents to HKDollars 16.50. In a recent strategy report, Kim Eng Securities noted that much of the recent aggressive buying activity had centred on blue chip stocks, leaving most at post 1987 highs in p/e ratio terms. However, this had occurred in the absence of any improvement in economic or political fundamentals. Kim Eng commented that while the current wave of liquidity might well continue in the short term, there would have to be a return to fundamentals. 'Therefore, until there has been a consolidation of the index at these new higher levels, we think that many of the main second line stocks offer better value than blue chips.' BANGKOK fell 4 per cent in an active day of rollercoaster trade over a 100-point range. The SET index closed 54.36 down at 1,303.39 after a six-day rising streak that has seen the market advance 18.1 per cent. Turnover surged to a record Bt36.3bn: the previous record, set on Monday, was Bt28bn but that compared with a daily average of Bt3bn to Bt4bn at the end of last month. The fall came in a market beset by apparently baseless rumours of impending political upheavals and a farmers' protest march to Bangkok. SEOUL succumbed to heavy institutional profit-taking and the composite index, which managed a 15-point rally early in the day, gave up the advance to finish 2.55 lower on balance at 756.87. AUSTRALIA saw its second consecutive fall in the absence of foreign buyers and the All Ordinaries index, down 25 points at one stage, recovered slightly to end 16.9 off at 2,108.4 in turnover of ADollars 536.7m. Blue chips to suffer included News Corp, which lost 20 cents at ADollars 11.04, after a day's low of ADollars 10.88. Analysts commented that the stock was affected by a proposal to issue so-called super voting shares. NEW ZEALAND finished easier but above the day's lows as the market demonstrated some fatigue in the run-up to Saturday's election. The NZSE-40 capital index, which had posted gains over the previous eight trading sessions, shed 4.62 to 2,198.46 in turnover of NZDollars 62m. SINGAPORE climbed to another record close, the Straits Times Industrial index adding 3.58 at 2,127.43, with activity again focused on cheaper priced issues. The market was led forward by a 70-cent, or 4.8 per cent, advance in Singapore Press Holdings to SDollars 15.30. BOMBAY moved higher on buying triggered by false rumours of a resolution of the stand-off between separatists and the government at Kashmir's most sacred mosque. The BSE 30-share index ended 18.73 ahead at 2,630.98. Local newspapers reported that the army siege of the mosque was lifted after the government reached an agreement with the militants, but the government subsequently denied the reports and said negotiations were continuing. MANILA was propelled to an all-time closing peak by pent-up domestic and foreign institutional demand as the market returned to work after a four-day holiday. The composite index moved ahead 94.71 to 2,467.54, following last Friday's 46-point advance, in volume of 1.2bn shares. Mr Matthew Sutherland of Asia Equity noted that in spite of repeated calls for a correction, 'the index never manages to consolidate for more than a day before pushing back up again'. He believed the market was still good value at current levels, seeing bright prospects for the economy in 1994, with corporate earnings far exceeding consensus forecasts of around 17 per cent. TAIWAN rose to its best level for almost five months amid hopes that the central bank may ease credit further at its board meeting today. The weighted index ended 55.49 stronger at 4,283.34, after touching 4,298.99. Turnover of TDollars 51.13bn was the heaviest since April. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded to finish generally higher as investors sought second line stocks and the composite index gained 9.67 at 982.03.</p>

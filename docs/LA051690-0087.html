			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY: CONSUMER NEWS  </P> <P> Aviation Fuel Recalled: Chevron Corp. said it completed a recall of more than  500,000 gallons of below-standard small-airplane fuel from aviation fuel  customers and airports in the West.  </P> <P> Chevron began the recall late last week, when it found the fuel to have lower  than permissible octane levels. Chevron estimated that it has spent more than  $1 million replenishing aviation fuel supplies in a distribution area bounded  by Bakersfield, Medford, Ore., and Reno. Chevron stressed that the fuel posed  no danger and that the recall was merely a precaution. The recall did not apply  to commercial jet fuel, which is an unrelated product.  </P></p>

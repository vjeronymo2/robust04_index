			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Leading Article: White House and Casablanca After President Bill Clinton's gestures towards peace and security during his Middle East trip last week, the current conference in Casablanca provides a timely reminder of the economic developments required to make peace durable. But participants would do well to remember that the region is far from being able to beat swords into ploughshares as the more visionary Israeli leaders sometimes suggest. In fact, it is still in urgent search of the political solutions that are an essential precondition for development. The cornerstone of the peace process is the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians, and that is in trouble. Israel has so far only withdrawn from part of Gaza and the town of Jericho, leaving in its place an ill-functioning Palestinian self-rule authority which has failed to get to grips with the economic issues confronting it. Scarcely any of the Dollars 720m earmarked by international donors for infrastructure projects this year has been spent, while Palestinian infighting has led to the absurd confusion of the same telecommunications contract being awarded to different companies. Israel has added substantially to the problems by shutting its borders to tens of thousands of Palestinian workers, thereby deepening poverty in the territories and bolstering Hamas, the radical Islamic group intent on sabotaging the peace accord. Israel and western aid donors agree that the modest prospects for a viable Palestinian economy depend heavily on a close association with its Jewish neighbour. To talk, as Israeli leaders have done recently, of a permanent physical separation between the two communities, is a recipe for economic, and probably political, disaster. To avert this debacle, two things need to happen. First, Israel must withdraw speedily from the West Bank so that already overdue Palestinian elections can be held. If a sizeable part of the Palestinian electorate shares western suspicions that Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is not up to the task of running the self-rule authority, the sooner its voice is heard the better. Second, the World Bank, EU and US must intensify their efforts to ensure that donor money is spent quickly and effectively. Part of the problem here is the lack of regional support for the aid effort. A few years ago Saudi Arabia and Kuwait would have been expected to be among the most generous contributors to an emerging Palestinian state and to the regional development projects being mooted in Casablanca. But President Saddam Hussein, the price of oil, and President Clinton's success in selling billions of dollars worth of military equipment have meant that even the revenues from 8m barrels of oil a day are insufficient to halt the Saudi budget sliding into deeper deficit. With the kingdom's per capita GNP now little more than a third of the average for the EU, what was the world's most affluent welfare state is being rapidly eroded, and political pressures are growing. Now Saudi Arabia and Kuwait face the need for substantial additional outlays to support the latest US military deployment in the region. Security in the Gulf does not come cheaply. Enhanced security in the Middle East may be what Mr Clinton sees from the White House. But the political obstacles remain daunting, and the economic underpinnings for peace are fragile indeed.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / 'Retire at 35' as workers lose jobs THE ECONOMIC slowdown in Japan, where many employers promise their workers jobs for life, is leading many companies to restructure their operations, with two groups yesterday announcing vol-untary redundancy prog-rammes for staff. Japan Air Lines said it was opening its early retirement programme, which it had offered to employees over 45, to employees between the ages of 35 and 44. Those who apply for early retirement will be awarded a 50 per cent increase in their retirement pay. The airline hopes to enlist 150 volunteers by the end of July. 'We have no intention of changing our basic policy of lifetime employment,' a JAL representative said. The airline is also offering a one-year leave of absence to managers over 50 to encourage them to consider a second career outside JAL. Managers who make use of the programme will be paid in full and are under no obligation to leave the company, the airline said. JAL is suffering from a sharp downturn in business, with a fall-off in first-class air travel and intense price competition on international routes. The company is expected to have made a Y50bn (Pounds 294m) pre-tax loss for the year to March, the worst result it has reported, and has signalled its intention to restructure its operations. It has postponed the recruitment of stewardesses this April and announced that it will not recruit administrative staff and stewardesses next year. Meanwhile Alps Electric, the electrical parts manufacturer, and its subsidiary, Tohoku Alps, are looking to cut their workforce by 12 per cent, or 1,300 employees, through a voluntary redundancy programme announced yesterday. All employees with a year or more of service are eligible for 'retirement'. Alps is closing three factories in northern Japan and reducing new recruits next year to 100 from a previous 400. Production at the factories, where Alps manufactures volume controls and switches, will be transferred to nearby plants and a facility in South Korea. Alps also plans to start production through a joint venture in China soon. The company has been hit by a sharp fall in the electrical appliance and motor industries which it supplies and expects to see pre-tax profits fall by about 70 per cent in the year to March to Y2.1bn. It said it had seen an increase in orders since last year but the recent strong rise of the yen had led to a drop in orders.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool ALTHOUGH there is no auction guidance from the main primary markets in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa prices are still subject to the vagaries of volatile currency markets. Weakness in the US dollar has recently been slightly outpaced by weakness in the Australian dollar, and related prices in Europe have been plumbing their recent lows. Inevitably this downward drift does not help those who are trying to persuade buyers to move in. The uncertainty and lack of confidence keeps business quiet, which in turn tends to soften selling prices further.</p>

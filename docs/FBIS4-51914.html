			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cho Se-hyon] </F>   [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- The public's attention has  shifted to Chongwadae [presidential office] after Chong  Chu-yong, who is being tried on charges of violating the  election law, declared Tuesday that he would keep his hands off  the Hyundai business group's management.    Like it or not, the ball is now in Chongwadae's court and  political and business leaders, as well as ordinary citizens,  are waiting to see how the office of President Kim Yong-sam  treats the beleaguered honorary chairman of one of the nation's  largest conglomerates.    It is true that the judicial branch of government will have  to handle Chong's case in court while the economic ministries  must decide whether to ease various restrictions imposed on  Hyundai companies.    But it is almost common knowledge that their actions depend  largely on how Chongwadae receives Chong's retirement  declaration, seen by many as a desperate plea for presidential  leniency.    The initial reaction from Chongwadae was said to be cool.    "It is none of Chongwadae's business," one official was  quoted as saying. "Chongwadae is not interested in what becomes  of the chairman or honorary chairman of one particular business  group."    Another senior presidential aide went so far as to ask  reporters to describe Chongwadae's reaction to Chong's statement  as "cold."    Chong managed to earn the wrath of President Kim when he ran  in the Dec. 18, 1992, presidential election and "muddied" the  campaign climate by "abusing" his group's money and manpower.    In the eyes of then-presidential candidate Kim Yong-sam,  Chong may have personified the evil force in society which holds  that "money can buy all."    Even after Kim was elected president, he reportedly vowed to  "straighten out the bad habit with which (he) tried to buy power  with money."    The cool response from Chongwadae is understandable since  the  presidential office has gone on record as saying that in Chong's  case, it would simply follow "the principle of law."    Behind the stony facade, however, Chongwadae appears to have  received Chong's declaration somewhat "positively," although  suspicions about his true intentions linger as he did not say he  would give up his honorary chairmanship of the Hyundai group.    Chong is likely to gain from his move only when he proves  through deeds, not words, that he indeed intends to drop  business and retire to his farm in Sosan, South Chungchong  Province, to concentrate on farming.    "We have never discriminated against the Hyundai group,"  said  one Chongwadae official, brushing aside complaints by many  Hyundai executives.    "The problems of the Hyundai group, if any, are one thing  and  those of Chong Chu-yong are another," he added.    In other words, the government is expected to take phased  action in starting to treat the Hyundai group the same as other  business conglomerates -- that is, if Chong really does leave  behind the world of business.    As for the legal case against Chong, there appears to be no  change: Chongwadae will let it take its full course.    The feeling is that Chong's actions must be handled in  accordance with the law, if only to show the public that before  the law, everyone is equal.    In view of Chong's advanced age, however, many Chongwadae  officials appear to believe that he is likely to receive a  suspended sentence even if he is convicted.</p>

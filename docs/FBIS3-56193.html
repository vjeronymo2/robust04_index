Estonia, in particular, is interested what conclusion  Yeltsin  and Clinton will reach on the issue of the withdrawal of Russian  troops from Estonia.    As a more general issue, it is important for Estonia what  position the United States takes with respect to Russia's  foreign policy.    Malk reminded how several countries neighboring Russia had  painfully reacted when Russia announced the concept of so-called  near abroad in its foreign policy. He said it was now extremely  important whether or not the U.S. president was going to raise  the issue at all and if the president was also to voice his  position on the issue.    If Russia's foreign political course is aimed toward taking  part in strengthening the European security and communicating  with its neighbors according to democratic principles, the  Moscow summit may give a new impact to the implementation of  NATO's "Partnership for Peace" plan, Malk said.    "But if Russia takes the attitude that she has quite  different rights and that she has the right to prescribe certain  actions to others -- in their relations with NATO, for instance  -- then things are naturally quite different," Malk said.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINING THE THIRD WORLD'S UNCHARTED REGIONS;  </P> <P> ALFREDO JAAR'S MINIMALISM-INFLUENCED SHOW AT LA JOLLA ATTACKS WESTERN  STEREOTYPES  </P> <P> Some pictures can be traced to the eye and mind of an individual artist, but  other powerful images are created by whole societies.  </P> <P> Imagine, for example, the Third World. The picture that forms in your mind is  likely a composite that has been assembled, consciously or not, from bits and  pieces generated by all manner of sources: newspaper stories, television  documentaries, overheard conversations, personal experiences, books, Hollywood  movies and more. Like a Picasso collage, the image is a potent fiction cobbled  together from a diverse array of longstanding traditions, some newly crafted  illusions and even a few assorted fragments of reality.  </P> <P> Yet, for all its multiplicity of sources, and for all the variations rightly  claimed by individuals with differing conceptions of the same subject, pictures  created by whole societies are still characterized by a singular perspective.  The developing nations of the so-called Third World are "third" only from the  perspective of the technologically complex First World, which drew the picture  and coined the term. It's an image "we" have painted to describe "them."  </P> <P> Alfredo Jaar is an artist who, in his own work, tries to drive a wedge into  whatever narrow cracks and fissures he can find in such stubborn and deceptive  pictures. Beginning with a notable entry at the 1986 Venice Biennale, his  installations featuring large, color transparencies mounted on fluorescent  light-boxes have been the subject of steadily increasing attention. Born in  Santiago, Chile, in 1956, and resident in New York City for most of the last  decade, Jaar is surely in a position to have become keenly aware of assorted  gruesome dissonances.  </P> <P> An exhibition of a dozen pieces dating from 1986 to 1990 -- Jaar's first  substantive presentation in Southern California -- opened last week at the La  Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, where it will remain on view through April 1.  The work is decidedly uneven. Yet Jaar is clearly wading through a largely  uncharted territory that is of unusual significance to the present moment.  Aspects of his endeavor suffer from a surfeit of earnestness that conflicts  with an occasionally sleek, vaguely designerish manner of presentation; but  other qualities possess the capacity to make fluid a variety of sluggish,  congealed assumptions. Jaar's is an art that compels notice through the sheer  ambitiousness evident in his project.  </P> <P> The format of Jaar's art reflects the twin poles of his academic background.  After first studying documentary film making at Santiago's Chilean-North  American Institute of Culture, he pursued a degree in architecture at the  city's University of Chile. Today, his art is chiefly composed of documentary  photographs -- some made by Jaar, others found in published sources -- which  are displayed in relation to architecturally based sculptural forms that owe  more than just a formal debt to the geometries of Minimalism.  </P> <P> As disciplines, architecture and documentary photography might seem to be  wildly divergent; in substance and material, obviously they are. Conceptually,  however, the two share something fundamental: a sharp awareness of the  complexities of social relationships, which is the subject of Jaar's art.  </P> <P> At the La Jolla Museum, curator Madeleine Grynsztejn has used the 1986  installation Jaar showed at the Venice Biennale as the touchstone for the  exhibition, which is otherwise composed of more recent work. Now part of the  museum's permanent collection, and the single finest work in the show, "Gold in  the Morning" is composed of several elements dispersed around a darkened  gallery.  </P> <P> Jaar spent several months photographing among the 40,000 laborers in Serra  Pelada (Naked Hill), a huge, open-pit gold mine in a remote corner of Brazil's  Amazon rain forest. Winnowing the thousands of pictures into a selection of  just five, the artist skillfully chose images that show a surprisingly wide  range of viewpoints: the enormity of the site and the resulting anonymity of  the labor force; the human specificity of individual workers; the mythic and  metaphoric power associated with the metal being mined; the brute, physical  power required to do the work; the utterly mundane social interactions among  miners; the fragmentary nature of every documentary enterprise, including this  one; and more.  </P> <P> Any pretense that the photographer is a neutral and invisible eye is erased by  a prominently placed picture of a group of miners playfully mugging for the  camera. In an important way, what we are seeing is honestly declared to be a  performance orchestrated by the artist. He inserts himself, however indirectly,  into the picture.  </P> <P> These five color photographs have been made into large transparencies, several  feet square, and each is mounted on a light-box that uses fluorescent bulbs to  illuminate the image from behind. Four are paired with like-size metal boxes  painted gold; the L-shaped displays that result have been installed at the  junctures of the gallery's walls, floor and ceiling -- any  </P> <P> where but flat on the wall at typical eye level.  </P> <P> The fifth light-box is a free-standing module, placed on the floor as a kind of  headstone behind a large, ornate, gilded picture frame that lies atop a bed of  nails. The nails inside the frame are painted gold, those outside are not.  </P> <P> In this and other installations, Jaar has sought to bridge the wide material  gap between architecture and documentary photography through a knowing  invocation of Minimalist form. The elegant, lacquered boxes of "Gold in the  Morning" put you in mind of sculptures by Donald Judd, while the fluorescent  lights recall the trademark material used by Dan Flavin. It's a canny choice,  because Minimalism shares with Jaar's other interests an emphasis on the social  dimension in which art is experienced.  </P> <P> Minimalist sculptors in the 1960s began to shift a viewer's attention away from  solitary interaction with discrete sculptural objects. Instead, they wanted to  articulate the cultural context within which such interactions take place.  Among the ways in which the feat was accomplished was the wholesale banishment  of the pedestal -- a primary device of Western culture by which sculpture had  been elevated from the realm of the everyday and sent aloft into a hallowed  space called High Art. Minimalism got sculpture down onto the floor, and  sometimes even into and under it.  </P> <P> With strategies such as this, Minimalism harbored a profoundly political  dimension. For all the abstract geometry of its forms, this was an art that  insisted you be aware of the factors through which a society makes art a  powerful and privileged activity. The passive viewer was subtly transformed  into an active and inquiring spectator, who shared a real and distinctly social  space with the work of art.  </P> <P> Jaar's placement of his illuminated pictures anywhere but at typical eye level  on the wall is an extrapolation of the pedestal-banishing formal device central  to the achievement of Minimalist sculpture. He displaces his pictures from  ordinary view, then seamlessly integrates them within the actual architecture  of the room -- a method that may also owe something to the elaborate decoration  of Spanish Baroque churches in colonial Latin America.  </P> <P> Like a number of artists in recent years, Jaar has married this philosophical  implication of Minimalist form to frankly political subject matter. "Gold in  the Morning" invokes the long history of colonization, which counts among its  most recent incarnations the very idea of a Third World. Today, debate centers  on whether First World countries now colonize Third World countries not with  explorers, invading armies or occupying settlers, but simply through  long-distance control over international currency and trading. The precious  gold at Serra Pelada, said to be the richest strike anywhere in the 20th  Century, is aggressively being mined to pay off Brazil's massive foreign debt.  </P> <P> The open-pit miners are simultaneously digging themselves out of a hole and  into a hole. As in the fine 1989 work called "Coyote!," in which a St.  Christopher-like figure carries a veiled illegal alien across the Rio Grande,  religious allusions to crucifixion, sainthood, life after death and other  Catholic iconography abound. Set before a mound of nails topped by a gilded  frame, Jaar's funerary headstone suggests that digging is these peoples' life,  and they are digging their own collective grave.  </P> <P> "Gold in the Morning," "Coyote!" and a triptych called "1+1+1" are resonant  works, but there are decided weaknesses to Jaar's approach. The transparencies  are in color, but they are not colorful. Relying on a golden range of sepia  tones, Jaar blessedly avoids the look of a travelogue or National Geographic  layout, but at the expense of a certain blandness and redundancy. Dull  didacticism, too, is a constant threat not always avoided.  </P> <P> More damagingly, the Minimalist-inspired fusion of architecture and documentary  photography in his light-boxes bears an inescapable visual similarity to  advertising displays at bus-stop shelters, airport lounges and shopping malls  -- situations in which cliche is king. Jaar frequently embraces the trite  slogan, as in the groan-inducing relationship created between photographs of  marginalized people and their placement in the out-of-the-way margins of the  room.  </P> <P> At 33, however, the artist has established a solid and provocative base.  Colonization is hardly new -- the Phoenicians got the ball rolling in the  ancient Mediterranean world, and it hasn't stopped since -- but European and  North American colonialism are virtually inseparable from the modern world. Now  that modernism has become the subject of cultural scrutiny, and as questions of  the social relationships between so-called First and Third worlds are pressed,  Alfredo Jaar is clearly mining volatile and important territory.  </P> <P> The native Chilean's photographs document life in a Brazilian mine and other  harsh realities of the poor.  </P></p>

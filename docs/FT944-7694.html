			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Sugar prices hit fresh highs - Market Report London white SUGAR futures rallied to fresh contract highs yesterday as bullish fundamentals, including talk of fresh buying from China and estimates for a higher 1994-95 deficit, prompted mixed buying, dealers said. COFFEE futures also bounced to close sharply firmer on mixed buying, short-covering and New York's bullish trend, after sliding to over four-week lows in early trading. A quieter day at the London Metal Exchange prompted holders of long positions to lighten their load a little, which put some downward pressure on prices. Compiled from Reuters</p>

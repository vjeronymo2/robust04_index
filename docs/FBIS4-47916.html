			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The interim Government of Rwanda today signed  the agreement to stop fighting and end massacres in the country.  This was stated today by Tanzanian Foreign Minister Joseph  Rwegasira following the two-day session in Arusha which was  convened again by the special facilitator in the Rwandan crisis,  President Ali Hassan Mwinyi. The meetings were chaired by the  prime minister and first vice president, Honorable John  Malecela, on behalf of President Mwinyi, and were attended by  representatives of the interim Government of Rwanda and the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. Minister Rwegasira said that  Malecela met and held talks separately with both sides because  the RPF delegation refused to sit at the same table as the  Rwandan interim government delegation.    Minister Rwegasira added that although the government  delegation signed the peace proposal tabled by the facilitator,  the RPF refused to sign it but they were ready to stop fighting  as proposed. [passage omitted including indistinct portion]  Despite refusing to sign the agreement, the RPF has agreed to  implement it with effect from the day after tomorrow, 7 May in  the areas it occupies throughout the country.    The final signing ceremony was attended by the OAU  secretary-  general Dr. Salim Ahmad Salim, representatives of all the  Western ambassadors in Tanzania, and other observers from the  member countries of the UN Security Council.    Hon. Malecela returned to Dodoma town today.</p>

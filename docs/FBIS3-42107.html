Last year alone, there were 11 attempts to steal uranium  from  Russian nuclear facilities, according to Yuriy Yefimov, head of  the Department for the Protection of Strategic State Facilities  of the Russian Interior Ministry troops.    Speaking at a conference of the Russian Interior Ministry  senior officials in Moscow on Wednesday, Yefimov said that law  enforcement bodies reported about 900 attempts of illegal  penetration into secret nuclear facilities in 1993. In 700  cases their employees were caught while trying to smuggle out  secret documents.    Experts of the Russian Ministry of the Nuclear Power  Industry  tend to blame the stealings on the worsening economic situation  in the country which forces people to resort to extreme measures  in order to eke out their existence.    Experts claim that the thefts of radioactive materials are  carried out by people who know technology as their own palms.  This opinion was shared by Yefimov who said that one of the  attempts to steal uranium and smuggle it out of the country was  made by a group of employees of one of the secret plants near  the city of Yekaterinburg, the Urals region, which included some  of its top officials.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / PM rules the airwaves: How Berlusconi won control of broadcasting The Berlusconi government has achieved its objective in the battle to control the future of the RAI, Italy's broadcasting organisation, at the expense of a bruising battle with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Yesterday the Official Gazette published a decree on the RAI, rewritten to accommodate the reservations of Mr Scalfaro. The president had refused for 24 hours to sign the original decree because it gave the government the direct power both to reject the RAI's accounts and to fire the board. Now the power of appointing the board has been placed back with the speakers of the two houses. It so happens that the speakers both represent the right-wing government coalition. However, Mr Scalfaro insisted to the limits of his weak constitutional authority that the power be formally in the hands of parliament rather than directly with the government. He has achieved a moral victory but he has not endeared himself to Mr Berlusconi and co-operation, already strained, will in future be difficult. The net effect of the rewritten decree is the same as its original. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned prime minister, can now exercise control over the RAI. He also continues to be the owner of the Fininvest empire, which controls over 80 per cent of commercial television. No one disputes the need to reform the RAI, which operates three television channels and a network of radio stations. It was constructed to accommodate the old system of political parties, with the Christian Democrats controlling the first channel, the Socialists the second and the former communist PDS the third. The RAI was also on the point of bankruptcy, with losses in 1993 of over L500bn (Pounds 205m). However, the affair has been badly handled. Mr Berlusconi and his ministers say the RAI was biased against them. This was true during the election campaign; it acted as a counterweight to the huge propaganda effort of the three Berlusconi channels. But lately the news programmes on RAI have become almost servile in support of Mr Berlusconi. Only Channel Three is still openly critical and last Sunday earned itself further opprobrium by screening a film in which Mr Berlusconi's current wife, Veronica Lario, plays a part in a lesbian love affair. Meanwhile, Fininvest channels remain firmly behind the government, with Network Four's presenter Emilio Fede a self-confessed apologist. It thus looks as though Mr Berlusconi has yielded to the temptation of many a government to control the media. But in this case the issue is broader because of the potential conflict of interest with his ownership of Fininvest. The problem is further complicated with the financial position of the RAI. If its funding is now pruned, as promised, it will have reduced scope to operate. Fininvest stands to benefit from this since it has been competing on exactly the same terms as the state channels in both programmes and salaries. If the RAI spends less, so will Fininvest, which is also strapped for cash. The government also needs to decide whether the RAI moves to enter the multi-media era, on which considerable investments have been spent and good technology acquired. It also has to decide if the RAI can operate pay-TV. In either case, the removal of the RAI from these areas of business leaves the field free for competition, which can only benefit Fininvest.</p>

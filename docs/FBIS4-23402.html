			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Abel Abraao in Cuito] </F>   [Text] Jonas Savimbi's men have bit the red dust of this  bloody land as they tried to take the martyred city of Cuito by  storm at dawn today. Those who sow the wind, reap the  whirlwind. UNITA today got what it deserved. UNITA left  several dead bodies behind as others fled in disarray. Today's  clashes were the fiercest since the start of the hostilities on  26 May.    Military sources with the Angolan Armed Forces Operational  Command in Bie Province said this morning that UNITA rebels, who  are still in the outlaying areas of the city, continue to  receive reinforcements for yet another attack on Cuito. As we  file this report, clashes are still in progress and UNITA  continues to shell the city. One cannot yet take stock of the  human and material losses of the past 24 hours.    In view of the unstable military situation, Belgium's  Doctors  Without Borders and Mr. (Hans Peter), a World Food Program  official, left the city of Cuito for Luanda this morning. Mr.  (Dominic Henry), delegate of the International Committee of the  Red Cross for Bie Province, refused to leave the city.</p>

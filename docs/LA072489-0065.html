			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SLUMP CONTINUES FOR THE REDS, 12-4  </P> <P> This may be the first time in major league history that a court order has  enabled a manager to keep his job.  </P> <P> Under normal circumstances, the collapse of the Cincinnati Reds might have  brought about the firing of Manager Pete Rose. Even before Rose went to court  to battle Commissioner Bart Giamatti, there were reports that Red owner Marge  Schott was ready to make a change.  </P> <P> But no matter how long the Reds' current slump continues, baseball cannot take  Rose's job away at least until the court makes a decision on the Rose case.  </P> <P> And, make no mistake about it, the Reds have collapsed. It started with a  series of injuries, but now they can't make routine plays.  </P> <P> Mike Fitzgerald hit two home runs and drove in five runs Sunday at Montreal to  lead the streaking Expos to a 12-4 victory over the Reds. It was the eighth  consecutive defeat for the Reds and their 12th in the last 13 games. From a  team challenging for the pennant in the National League West a short time ago,  they have become a club diving toward the cellar.  </P> <P> The losing streak is their longest since they lost nine early in the 1986  season.  </P> <P> Against the Expos, the Reds took a 2-0 lead on a home run by Ken Griffey in the  first inning, but Danny Jackson (6-11), a 23-game winner last year, couldn't  make it hold up through the first inning.  </P> <P> Dennis Martinez was not especially impressive, but he lasted five innings and  won his 10th in a row. He is 11-1 for the season.  </P> <P> In an understatement, Rose told the Associated Press he had a confused team.  </P> <P> "Because of all these injuries," he said, "the players' roles have changed  drastically. I'm the only one whose role hasn't changed. What do you do about  it? Maybe you guys can tell me."  </P> <P> Rose neglected to say that usually in such confused situations, it is the  manager who departs.  </P> <P> The four-game sweep enabled the Expos to keep ahead of their challengers in the  East. Although the New York Mets won their sixth in a row, the Expos have a  three-game lead.  </P> <P> Chicago 9, San Francisco 5 -- Now that the Cubs are learning how to win at  Wrigley Field, they not only have remained in the race in the East, they have  tightened up the race in the West.  </P> <P> Mark Grace and Andre Dawson each drove in three runs at Chicago, the Cubs  improved their record at home to 26-23 with their third win in their last four  games, and the Giants' lead over Houston dropped to 1 1/2 games. The Cubs are  only 3 1/2 games behind the Expos.  </P> <P> Grace, who extended his hitting streak to 13 games, had a double and a single.  Dawson, who returned Friday after missing five games with knee problems, hit a  three-run home run to break it open in the sixth inning. In the last two games,  he has a triple and two home runs.  </P> <P> "We didn't hit well, we didn't pitch well and we didn't catch well in the  series," Giant Manager Roger Craig said.  </P> <P> The Giants' 34-15 record is the best of any major league team at home, but they  are 24-25 on the road.  </P> <P> Houston 3, Philadelphia 2 -- The Astros' four-game sweep over the Phillies at  Houston was tempered by the loss of hitting star Glenn Davis.  </P> <P> Davis bruised his foot on a foul tip earlier and limped off in the seventh  inning after drawing a walk.  </P> <P> The bright spots were another strong five innings from Bob Forsch (3-3) and a  circus catch by left fielder Billy Hatcher to end the game.  </P> <P> The Phillies had two on and two out in the ninth when Len Dykstra hit a fly  ball to short left off Larry Andersen. Hatcher dived, rolled over and came up  holding the ball. Despite the protest of the Phillies, rookie umpire Charlie  Rehliford ruled it was a game-ending catch.  </P> <P> New York 7, Atlanta 2 -- The Mets' sixth consecutive victory matched their  longest winning streak of the season.  </P> <P> David Cone (8-5) had an easy time after the Mets scored six times in the first  inning. Cone lasted 6 2/3 innings to improve his record at home to 6-0. He is  unbeaten in 10 starts since June 5.  </P> <P> "It's tough when you look up and see Montreal winning," Cone said.  </P> <P> St. Louis 3, San Diego 2 -- Jose Oquendo extended his hitting streak to 21  games with a fifth-inning double, but it was Willie McGee and Milt Thompson who  keyed the Cardinals' attack.  </P> <P> McGee drove in two runs and Thompson had three hits to help the Cardinals sweep  the four-game series at San Diego.

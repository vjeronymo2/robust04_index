			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Young joins Branson in lottery bid Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, and Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways, yesterday announced they were joining forces to launch a National Lottery bid which will covenant all its profits to a charitable foundation. Mr Branson said: 'If we can pull this off I think it will be the most important thing we will achieve in our lifetimes.' Neither he nor Lord Young, a former Tory cabinet minister, will take a fee. Lord Young, who will chair the operating company, said yesterday: 'This is a very, very serious bid which is properly worked out. Because of our structure we believe we are going to have the most competitive bid.' Mr Branson will be managing director of the operating company working alongside a chief executive whom he refused to name. The leading technical partner in the bid for the licence by the UK Lottery Foundation will be IBM, the computer company. The bid is likely to be one of at least eight contenders expected to submit their bids in February. If the Lottery Foundation wins the licence, Lord Callaghan, Sir Angus Ogilvy, Viscount Tonypandy and Viscount Whitelaw will all become trustees in addition to Lord Young and Mr Branson. Mr Branson predicted yesterday that the public would spend Pounds 1 or Pounds 2 a week more on the lottery each week if they knew that all the profits were going to good causes. Mr Anthony Fry, who is putting together a bid backed by NM Rothschild and Tattersalls, the Australian lottery operator, said yesterday the Branson bid would be no different from any other. 'Providers of capital and services suppliers will want a proper return on their investment,' Mr Fry said.</p>

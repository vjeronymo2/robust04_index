			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Greenspan soothes market fears: The Fed chief's assurances on US inflation prospects Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday sought to allay fears in financial markets that rapid growth posed an immediate threat to US inflation prospects. Following the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter point to 3.25 per cent on February 4, the inflation psychology on Wall Street has changed. Instead of interpreting the Fed's move as a sign that inflationary pressures would be tightly controlled, many traders took the view that Mr Greenspan raised rates because he feared inflation would rise. As a result long bond yields have risen sharply - to well over 6.5 per cent. Markets reacted particularly adversely to a report last week from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, showing a marked increase in prices paid by manufacturers. This was seen as indicating that inflation would rise later this year, and more than offset the positive impact of figures showing a zero increase in consumer prices last month. In yesterday's twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony, Mr Greenspan noted that 'a number of commodity prices have firmed noticeably in recent months.' But he warned markets against reading too much into the Philadelphia Fed report. 'In the past such price data have often been an indication more of strength in new orders and activity than a precursor of rising inflation throughout the economy. . . overall cost and price pressures still appear to remain damped. Wages do not seem to be accelerating despite scattered reports of some skilled-worker shortages, and advances in productivity early this year are holding down unit labour costs.' Mr Greenspan also responded to fears in financial markets that inflationary pressures would build up because economic growth was not decelerating much this quarter in spite of bad weather and the Los Angeles earthquake. Official figures next week are expected to show that real GDP grew more than 6 per cent in the final period of last year. Some analysts fear that much of this momentum carried over into the first quarter. Mr Greenspan said it was 'too early to judge the degree of underlying economic strength.' Anecdotal evidence pointed to continued strength of manufacuturers' orders and production. But 'labour markets are signalling a somewhat less buoyant degree of activity as initial claims for unemployment insurance in recent weeks have moved up a notch.' The implication is that Mr Greenspan believes the bond market's negative reaction to recent data is overdone: the economy is probably growing steadily, rather than at the overheated pace of late last year; inflation, meanwhile, remains pretty subdued. The Fed had nudged rates higher not because current inflation data was alarming but in order to prevent problems emerging in 1995 and 1996. Mr Greenspan stressed again that monetary policy takes effect with a lag of at least a year. 'The firming in reserve market pressures was undertaken to preserve and protect the ongoing economic expansion by forestalling a future destabilising build-up of inflationary pressures. . . We viewed our move as low-cost insurance.' He added that rates had been lowered to abnormally low levels in the early 1990s to offset the deflationary impact of the debt build-up at the end of the 1980s and the subsequent decline in real estate prices. 'Debt repayment burdens had been lowered enough to unleash strong aggregate demand in the economy.' Real short-term rates of close to zero thus 'pose an unacceptable risk of engendering future problems.' Hence the decision to begin raising rates. Mr Greenspan signalled that the Fed's goal was to restore real short-term interest rates to a 'neutral level.' He could not say with assurance precisely what constituted neutrality. However, 'to promote sustainable growth, history suggests that real short-term rates are more likely to have to rise than fall from here.' He hoped that some part of any increase in real short-term rates could be achieved 'through further declines in inflation expectations rather than through higher nominal short-term rates." Mr Greenspan said monetary targets for 1994 would be unchanged from the preliminary ranges set last July. This implies a target of 1-5 per cent annual growth for M2, the main broad monetary measure. However, he said the Fed would not put much weight on the behaviour of the monetary aggregates. Monetary signals had been 'effectively jammed by structural changes in financial markets and the unusual nature of the current business cycle.' US monetary policy thus depended on 'ongoing assessments of the totality of incoming information.' Among other indicators, the Fed was closely watching 'the price of gold, which has been especially sensitive to inflation concerns, the exchange rate, and the term structure of interest rates.' The Fed's economic projections for this year closely mirrored those of the administration and private forecasters. It expected real growth of 3 per cent or slightly higher, and a further edging down of the unemployment rate. Inflation would be about 3 per cent, or slighly higher than last year. With competitive products and an improving world economy, US export grwoth was likely to strengthen this year, lessening the external drag on economic growth. Provided a prudent monetary policy kept inflation in check, the long-term US economic outlook remained the best Mr Greenspan had seen in decades.</p>

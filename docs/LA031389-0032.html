			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPERSAL HOLDS OFF MAJESTY'S IMP TO WIN LOUISIANA DERBY FOR SANTOS  </P> <P> Dispersal fought off a late rally by Majesty's Imp, holding on in the home  stretch to win the $150,000 Louisiana Derby Sunday.  </P> <P> Jockey Jose Santos took Dispersal to an early lead and had a two-length  advantage coming around the final turn. Majesty's Imp moved up along the rail  with one furlong to go, but Dispersal held on for the victory. The winning time  for the 1 1/16 miles was 1:43 4/5.  </P> <P> "He's a little green, but he sure has an awful lot of talent to be the third  time out and win the Louisiana Derby," said Dispersal's trainer, Grover (Bud)  Delp. "He's got to be a little special. I just hope he's as good tomorrow as he  was today."  </P> <P> Owned by Harry and Tom Meyerhoff of Maryland, Dispersal paid $9.00, $5.80 and  $3.60. Majesty's Imp paid $9.20 and $4.20, and Dansil, the morning line  favorite, paid $2.80 to show.  </P> <P> "I think everyone here feels it's a good start toward the Triple Crown," Delp  said.  </P> <P> Risen Star, who won the Louisiana Derby last year, went on to win the Preakness  and the Belmont Stakes.  </P></p>

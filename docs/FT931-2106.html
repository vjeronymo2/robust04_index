			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Infrastructure funding Last week's Budget may have signalled a real revolution in the private funding of infrastructure projects. Mr Norman Lamont's comments certainly showed a renewed enthusiasm for the concept. The cynical view is that this will only lead to a re-run of the frustrating - and largely futile - debate following the Ryrie rules of the early 1980s. But there are certainly greater grounds for optimism this time round. The most important factor is the significant shift in Treasury thinking contained in its guidance for joint venture infrastructure projects. In the past, the Treasury has balked at investing public money in projects and simply transferring the rewards to the private sector. But it now appears prepared to do so if it is accompanied by a complete transference of risk. Any continuing government involvement in projects would threaten the PSBR if costs ran out of control. For private sector companies, the profit motivation must be coupled with a real fear of bankruptcy. Government money is clearly needed at the start of infrastructure projects when the risks are primarily political. Further subsidies may be needed in the course of construction. But, if the government is not to bear any residual risk, the private sector must at some stage assume full responsibility for its completion. As long as the Treasury and the private sector can draw that line in an appropriate place, there is now a chance of mixed infrastructure projects working.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Management: Honesty is the best policy - Tom Farmer, chairman of Kwik-Fit, offers advice on how to build a culture of integrity / Tips from the top I have always believed that most people are fundamentally honest and, provided they are given the proper opportunity and recognition, they will give of their best. While there have been occasions when I have been disappointed, it is a view that has served me well throughout my life. With the correct recruitment policy and people it is the only approach that you can take when running a business, whatever its scale. Honesty is an intangible quality for which it is impossible to legislate. You can have as many rules as you want but if people choose to break them then there is little that you can do to stop them. It is the responsibility of management to create an environment which reduces temptation by having adequate controls which are sound but not stifling. The most effective deterrent is to build within the company a culture based on pride in one's job. Not only will this improve the quality of the service or product offered, and produce profit, it will mean that an act of dishonesty becomes a betrayal of oneself and one's colleagues. This culture must stem from the top down and the attitude of management towards their people is a vital element in its creation. I have found that the best results are achieved by treating people as you would wish to be treated. People must be provided with a decent working environment and all the facilities they require to do their job. A proper pay scheme must be in place which reflects their contribution and everyone should have the opportunity to share in the profits they help to create. Everyone should know what is expected of them and should have received sufficient training to enable them to be fully skilled in that task. There should be opportunities for everyone to develop to the best of his or her abilities; the promotion prospects and training programmes within the company should encourage ambition. Last year we served 4m customers - the majority of which were making a 'distress purchase'. At Kwik-Fit we aim for '100 per cent customer delight'. It is a standard that we have set ourselves and a promise to our customers that is the main theme of our advertising on which we spend around Pounds 10m per year. Unfortunately we do not achieve this in every single case. Two years ago we were the subject of criticism by a consumer magazine. While we did not agree with all aspects of their analysis, their findings taught everyone within Kwik-Fit a valuable lesson. It showed that people who did not follow their training and the company's procedures could jeopardise the company's reputation. This criticism made us review our operating practices. While we had procedures and training programmes in place we found that they were not always being carried out effectively. BS5750, together with Investors in People, identified the areas for improvement and helped us to plug the loopholes which can arise in any company's operations. The company which is honest acknowledges where there are areas for improvement and accepts criticism which can be turned into a force for good provided proper steps are taken to make change. We publish our results within 15 working days of the year end. We established systems to improve our profitability but we have realised other benefits. Our people know our culture and it is made clear that anyone who breaks the rules has no place within the company. We have not always managed to achieve all the things I have outlined above all of the time. I know that because human beings are fallible, there have been occasions when someone has been let down - but we try and we keep trying to develop and maintain our standards. It must be an obsession and what I would describe as a 'magnificent obsession'. I have found that our principles form the basis not only for an honest culture but a profitable business.

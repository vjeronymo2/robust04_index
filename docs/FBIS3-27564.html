			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou] </F>   [Text] Soured relations between Britain and China over  Hong Kong's political future was only a minor factor behind  British companies' failure in their bids for the Guangzhou  subway contracts, a senior Guangzhou official said yesterday.    Ou Guangquan, chairman of Guangzhou Urban and Rural  Construction Commission, denied that British companies had been  penalised by Beijing for the British Government's stance over  Hong Kong.    Guangzhou last month awarded the city's subway contracts to  German companies which had strong backing from the German  Government.    Mr Ou whose commission oversees the city's urban  construction  projects said economy, not politics, was the deciding factor.    "Our key consideration is whether their products are  competitive in price and quality and delivery terms," he said.    The Germans were chosen, Mr Ou said, because of their  Government's soft loans which carried a lower interest rate and  longer repayment period than those provided by their competitors.    And British companies, the chairman added, still had an  equal  chance in competing in the eight remaining Guangzhou subway  contracts which carried a total value of about U.S.$200 million  (HK$1.54 billion).    These contracts covered the supply of electrical equipment,  communications, power transformation, elevators and ticketing  systems.    According to Mr Ou, the Government would soon announce the  winners of the remaining contracts. So far, companies from  Britain, U.S., Japan, Italy and Germany have submitted bids.    "We will make a decision (on these contracts) in the first  half of this year," the chairman said.    Meanwhile, Mr Ou yesterday outlined an ambiguous [as  published] transport plan for the South China metropolis  including the second phase subway project and a connecting  light-rail system.    After completion, the three networks will have a combined  daily transport capacity of 1.2-1.5 million passengers.    According to Mr Ou, Guangzhou will likely finance the phase  Il subway construction and the light-rail network through land  sale and soft loans provided by foreign governments.    While the light rail system will cost about three billion  yuan (HK$2.66 billion), cost figures for the phase II subway  were not available yet.    On a related subject, Mr Ou confirmed that the municipal  Government would begin negotiations with the Army and aviation  authorities over the future use of the land where Guangzhou  Baiyun airport is located.    Guangzhou Government announced last year that it would build  a new international airport at Huaduo City to replace the  heavily- congested Baiyun airport.    According to Mr Ou, negotiations have not yet started  because  the central Government has yet approved [as published] the new  airport plan.    "I am confident that the army and municipal Government will  reach a deal over the land," said Mr Ou.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Canadians withdraw from bidding for Air Jamaica A Canadian investment group has pulled out of the consortium planning to buy financially troubled Air Jamaica from the island's government. The purchasers say this will not affect the timetable for a takeover, which is scheduled for July 1. Cochrane Investments of Toronto, which was to have taken about a quarter of the 70 per cent stake being bought by the Air Jamaica Acquisition Group for USDollars 26.25m, could not agree with its partners on plans for the airline's operations or capital structure. 'All parties agreed that it was in the best interests of the project that the arrangements made with Cochrane be terminated,' said Mr Peter Rousseau, chief negotiator for the purchasers. The consortium is seeking a replacement, and appears set to reach an agreement with Mr Gordon Stewart, one of the Caribbean's leading hoteliers. Mr Stewart would not be drawn on whether he would become involved in the deal. The agreement with the consortium, first announced a month ago, will leave the government with a 25 per cent stake in Air Jamaica, with 5 per cent being offered to the company's employees.</p>

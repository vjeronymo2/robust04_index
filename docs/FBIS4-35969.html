			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by Salim </F> Badawi; place and date not given; from "The Event"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Buwayz] As a matter of fact, we think the Security  Council is now facing a a basic and vital test. We believe that  what happened yesterday is a declaration of war, and not only a  circumstantial, temporary, or objective aggression. What  happened was a series of air raids by Israeli aircraft and  helicopters, using all methods, including incendiary bombs, and  the pursuit of civilians who escaped the region, by military  helicopters. This action is absolutely unjustified and can only  be within a process of war launched by Israel against Lebanon.    We think the United Nations, which has recently not  responded  to several attacks that took place, is now facing a test. It  either proves its credibility and its raison d'etre as a frame  of reference for the nations that are attacked, or it proves  once again that it is incapable of adopting positions that  establish justice and right in this world. Therefore, Lebanon  has filed a complaint with the Security Council asking for an  immediate session to discuss the second Israeli attack within  less than 10 days. I believe the climate that surrounds this  issue -- and updating public opinion in Lebanon on this issue  -- are part of the test of the Security Council's credibility  and seriousness.    [Badawi] Mr. Minister Buwayz, in case the Security Council  does not immediately respond to Lebanon's request, what are the  options and channels open to you?    [Buwayz] I think I have already given the answer. We are  facing exposed and unmistakable aggression of clear magnitude.  This aggression martyred around 50 people and left more than 60  people wounded without any justification. We think that if the  Security Council does not act, then we have already provided the  answer to this.    [Badawi] In concrete terms, what are you going to ask the  Security Council to do to deter Israel from carrying out other  operations?    [Buwayz] First of all, a clear and unequivocal resolution by  the Security Council to condemn the Israeli action. Second, we  demand the implementation of the resolution by adopting all  measures to implement Resolution 425. For, it is not acceptable  to pile up resolutions in Security Council files and offices  unless these resolutions have the power of implementation. We  absolutely cannot understand how the Security Council acted and  found all the capabilities regarding some of the issues  worldwide, which especially seek to tame some Arab countries,  but when these resolutions are meant against Israel, the  Security Council is unable to do anything.    [Badawi] Mr. Minister, my final question: What is your  comment on the reports or analyses that these repeated Israeli  operations against Lebanon are linked with the negotiating  tracks, particularly with Syria, and that these operations are a  kind of a message from Israel to Damascus?    [Buwayz] Of course, I do not want to talk about the messages  addressed by Israel, and to whom. There are messages addressed  to the Israeli Army perhaps to boost its morale; there are  messages addressed to Lebanon and Syria, etc. However, what is  clear and certain is that Israel is trying to pressure Lebanon  and Syria by what happened yesterday and is trying to eliminate  the negotiating cards of Syria and Lebanon to embarrass them.    [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. Minister.</p>

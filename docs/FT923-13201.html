			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: A tricky time of year However disappointing the May figure for UK production, the broader picture is still one of just perceptible upturn. In the latest three months, manufacturing output was 0.6 per cent higher than the three months before. What is unclear is whether this was merely part of the second-quarter blip. If the latest retail statistics are a guide, the extra production may simply have gone into excess stocks. If so, the next figure or two in the series is going to look correspondingly depressing. It is getting to the time of year when City economists are having to think hard about whether to revise down their GDP forecasts for 1992. At present, the consensus for growth in the calendar year is approximately zero. But those forecasts were posited on the assumption that some kind of recovery would be coming through by the mid-year. The next retail sales figures and the surveys from the Confederation of British Industry will be scrutinised accordingly. Everything hangs on the consumer, whose spirits seem to be drooping with the passage of time. There remains, of course, the grisly outside possibility that UK interest rates will actually go up. In that case, the forecasting community might as well go fishing.</p>

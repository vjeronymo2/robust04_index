Fifty-two  sick people and 54 carriers of this infection have been  hospitalized. The sanitary and epidemiological station sees the  cause of this terrible disease in migrational processes. Cases  of diphtheria have also been registered in neighboring Kalmykia.    The oblast administration has allocated approximately  50,000,000 rubles for emergency measures to combat the epidemic.  Vaccinations have been given to 25 percent of the children and  80 percent of those in the high-risk group. According to the  law, which specifies that each territory can draw up its own  sanitary regulations, compulsory vaccinations for doctors,  students, teachers, shop workers, and the staffs of public  catering and motor transport enterprises have been ordered.  But, in spite of all the work to provide the public with  information, epidemiologists are concerned at the passive  attitude of the population and the strange apathy towards their  health.

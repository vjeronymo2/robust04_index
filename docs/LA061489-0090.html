			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> ELIMINATING THE DANGERS OF BACK-YARD POOLS  </P> <P> Hauling out the patio chairs, cranking up the barbecue and getting the swimming  pool ready for summer? Remember, the same pool that provides your family with  refreshing dips on hot days also can be a back-yard danger for children if you  haven't followed safety procedures.  </P> <P> "A swimming pool is a tremendous risk for a child -- it's a silent accident, a  silent issue," said Billie Weiss, of the Los Angeles County Health Department,  who has been working on a study of drownings and near-drownings in the county.  </P> <P> Small children -- under age 5 -- are most at risk for swimming pool accidents  and should be under constant supervision. When it comes to safety, nothing, of  course, quite matches supervision of swimmers, whatever their age.  </P> <P> But owners also should put up proper barriers to make pool areas safer. And  though there's no way to totally child-proof a pool or spa, health  professionals and consumer safety advocates recommend that you:  </P> <P>  -- Ensure there's proper fencing, at least 4-feet high, preferably 5-feet  high, on all sides of the pool. Don't forget to see that there is only a 2-inch  clearance between the bottom of the fence and the ground and that no vertical  opening in the fence is more than 4 inches wide. With chain link fences, be  sure the diamond-shaped openings are 1x1-inch so children cannot get a toehold  and climb over the fence. And be sure that the fence permits a clear view of  the pool from your house.  </P> <P>  -- Secure all fences with self-closing access gates and self-latching devices  at least 56 inches from the ground.  </P> <P>  -- Keep all doors leading from house to pool locked routinely; install locks  on those doors at least 5 feet above the floor.  </P> <P>  -- Remove that cover completely when the pool is in use. Swimmers, young or  old, can get trapped under a partially extended cover, as the U.S. Consumer  Product Safety Commission has often warned in alerts it has issued to owners of  solar pool covers.  </P> <P>  -- Put away access steps if you have an above-ground pool and it is not in  use.  </P> <P> In case an accident does occur, be sure you have proper lifesaving equipment --  such as a pole or ring -- at poolside; be sure, too, that someone in your  household knows first aid techniques like CPR or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  It's also a good idea to keep a telephone on or near your patio with emergency  numbers listed next to it.  </P> <P> Last year, 350 children under age 5 drowned in swimming pools nationwide;  another 4,000 youngsters had to be hospitalized after near-drownings, according  to the National Spa and Pool Institute in Alexandria, Va.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Yearly Increases  </P> <P> Records show the national total of drownings and near-drownings of children  under age 5 has increased every year since the mid-1980s. And California is no  exception. In 1985, 103 Calfornia children drowned in pools and spas; in 1986,  there were 123 fatalities; in 1987, there were 140. State statistics are not  yet available for 1988.  </P> <P> But in Los Angeles County alone in 1988, there were 95 pool-related deaths, 23  of them involving children 4-years-old and younger.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Health Department study that Weiss has been working on  shows that from June, 1988, to May, 1989, among all age groups there were 226  water-injury-related reports -- 38 of them fatalities, 188 near-drownings. Of  the 226 incidents, almost 80% of the instances were in swimming pools; 118 of  them involved children up to age 4.  </P> <P> "In Los Angeles County, the leading cause of death between ages 1 and 4 is  drowning," Weiss said. "Children this age in California have a higher risk of  drowning in a pool than dying in an auto accident."  </P> <P> In Orange County, where one child drowned and two others suffered brain-damage  after falling in a swimming pool at a North Tustin home on March 30, recent  statistics also are chilling. There were 15 emergency medical service calls  (EMS) in March just for near-drownings involving children under age 5, said  Dollie Brill of Newport Beach, president of the National Drowning Prevention  Network, which has memberships in 48 states.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 15 Injuries Per 100,000  </P> <P> "There are 100,000 residential swimming pools in Orange County -- and that's  substantially underestimated. With 15 EMS calls, then that's an injury rate of  15 per 100,000," Brill said during a telephone interview. "If that was any  other product, mayonnaise, for instance, it would be banned from the market."  </P> <P> Brill -- who co-chairs Protect Our Kids, a drowning prevention program for  children run by the Orange County Trauma Society -- is closer to the pool  safety issue than many who study it. Her daughter, Cassy, then 15 months old,  was the victim of a pool accident a decade ago.  </P> <P> "She spent 36 hours unconscious and unresponsive, then she woke up," Brill  recalled. "We were very, very lucky. She's fine, is a gifted student and an  excellent athlete.  </P> <P> "But," she added, "so many of those children who nearly drown end up  brain-damaged." With improved emergency medical response, "we're decreasing the  fatalities, but ending up with more brain-damaged children; 1 out of 5 ends up  with brain damage."  </P> <P> It's hard to get an accurate count of the number of residential swimming pools  in the United States but the spa and pool institute estimates there are 6.5  million residential pools and spas in the nation's back yards. California  industry analysts estimate that there are about 300,000 swimming pools in Los  Angeles and Orange counties alone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No National Codes  </P> <P> There are no national codes calling for barriers around swimming pools and  spas. Those codes mostly are left to states and municipalities. Los Angeles  city and county, and Orange County, have pool fencing codes. The consumer  safety commission is working on a proposal for a residential pool barrier code  and hopes that state and local governments, building code groups and consumers  will adopt its recommendations nationwide.  </P> <P> "The use of effective residential swimming pool barriers is believed to be one  of the very best ways available at this time to reduce deaths and serious  injuries sustained by children under 5," the commission has reported. "A  barrier is vital to the safety of children since parents cannot be expected to  keep children in their line of sight 100% of the time."  </P> <P> Commission researchers report that "the typical child drowning victim is a boy  between 1 and 3 years of age who is not thought by parents and caretakers to be  in the pool or spa area . . . In the time it takes to answer a phone call, the  child, if left alone, could be in great danger." National safety statistics  also show that 65% of the drownings and near drownings of small children happen  in a pool owned by the child's family.  </P> <P> Some safety experts suggest a pool alarm can give added protection against a  pool accident but they stress that any such device should be used in addition  to proper barriers. Pool alarms on the market now range in price from $115 to  $300.  </P> <P> But the safety commission, which tested four popular brands of alarms in 1987,  decided not to recommend any of them to pool owners, commenting that the  devices, "although they generally performed in accordance with the  manufacturers' literature" had "significant problems with false alarms and/or  failure to alarm" during tests. "For this reason, the commission staff does not  consider the existing devices as capable of providing completely reliable  warnings."  </P> <P> The report added that "users of pool alarms need to be aware of the limitations  of the devices so that they are not overly relied upon for safety."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SWIMMING POOL DROWNINGS  </P> <P> 1987 figures, listed by county:  </P> <P> Los Angeles: 150  </P> <P> San Diego: 47  </P> <P> Riverside: 25  </P> <P> Orange: 20  </P> <P> SOURCE: State Department of Health Services, Health Demographics Section  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS  </P> <P> Sweepstakes "telescam."

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Grigoriy Nesmyanovich: "A New Weapon May Be an </F> Old One but Totally Forgotten"]    [Text] Ukraine essentially intends to turn to the idea of  creating and producing high-precision weapons as alternatives to  weapons of mass destruction. This was stated by Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk during a visit to the Zhitomir Higher  Military Electronics School of the Air Defense Forces.    He emphasized that work has been going on for a long time in  this direction in the United States, Russia and a number of  other states. The main advantage of such weapons is guaranteed  destruction of military objectives.</p>

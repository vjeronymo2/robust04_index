			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Union launches legal helpline The TGWU general union has become the first large union to launch a 24-hour legal helpline to provide advice and assistance to members and their families - an estimated 3m people. The service is being operated for the union by the Leicestershire-based CareAssist Group. 'From now on no member of a TGWU family will be more than a telephone call away from the union - any time night or day, any day of the year,' said Mr Bill Morris, general secretary.</p>

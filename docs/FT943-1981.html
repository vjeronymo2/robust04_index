			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mirror alerts TV stocks The acquisition of a 14.9 per cent stake in Scottish Television by Mirror Group Newspapers sent a buzz through television stocks as investors moved swiftly to show their support of the move. The stock was secured for the Mirror at a significant premium to the share price - 520p - after a series of agency crosses. Three blocks of shares moved - of 2m, 4.9m, and 50,500. Scottish soared on the Mirror's move, pushing up 58 to 501 with 14m shares changing hands while Mirror Group shares bounced 11 to 139p. The City warmed to the Mirror's effort to broaden its base amid the vicious newspaper price competition and the good premium paid for Scottish fuelled interest in other television stocks. Ms Chris Munroe at Hoare Govett said: 'It is no surprise that the Mirror should take such action. Geographically too it is a very good fit considering the Mirror's interest in Scotland.' In the backwash of the Mirror move in the television sector, Yorkshire jumped 29 to 392p; Ulster added 37 to 720p and Grampian gained 29 to 354p.</p>

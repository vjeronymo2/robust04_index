Apart from one of the subjects of the treaty, namely the  Soviet Union, disappearing, the actual basis of  Russian-Vietnamese relations has also changed considerably. The  new document will be signed during SRV Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet's visit to Moscow. A separate article will determine the  status of the Pacific Fleet Naval Base in Cam Ranh Bay.</p>

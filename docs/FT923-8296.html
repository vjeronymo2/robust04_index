			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Bowater told to sell offshoot MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, acted yesterday to prevent concentration of power in the medical bags and pouches market. He has asked the Bowater packaging group to dispose of one of its two businesses in the sector, under threat of a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Bowater built up a dominant position in the market after acquiring DRG Packaging in March. Mr David Jones, Bowater's finance director, accepted that its two businesses had a combined share of 51 per cent of an Pounds 11m market. He added that Bowater had not anticipated competition problems. Bowater can sell either its Welton bags and pouches business, which has annual sales of about Pounds 2m, or the medical bags subsidiary of the DRG group, with a turnover of Pounds 4m. 'Either way, we will still have a significant share of the market,' Mr Jones said. The company's shares fell on the news but recovered to close 5p lower at 734p on the day after Bowater disclosed that the action affected a business that accounted for less than 2 per cent of DRG's turnover.</p>

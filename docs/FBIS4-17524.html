			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 78 (568): </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] On Friday afternoon President Boris Yeltsin met with  leaders of the State Duma factions. The meeting focused on a  draft agreement on civil accord. The new document which is in  essence a reviewed variant of the draft was discussed the day  earlier by the State Duma. The opinions of the leaders of the  factions differed. Leaders of agrarians, communists, liberal  democrats stated their negative attitude to the draft. These  factions control more than one third of deputy mandates. The  document was also criticized by representatives of the factions  Yabloko, New Regional Policy and Russian Democratic Party.  However, they noted that the final position on this issue will  be determined by the factions later.    The draft agreement on civil accord was unconditionally  supported by representatives of the factions Russia's Choice,  the Russian Unity and Accord Party and Russia's Women.    Summarizing the results of hearings, speaker of the State  Duma Ivan Rybkin stated that "he was absolutely not  disappointed" with the discussion. Speaking to journalists he  pointed out that deputies' speeches were "adequate to what is  happening in the country."    Rybkin considers that it is far from certain that political  parties at their conferences, plenums and congresses scheduled  for this weekend would support positions of their parliamentary  factions which spoke against signing the civil accord agreement.  IF Note: According to the presidential plan, the original  formula for signing the document on April 28 is as follows: the  agreement should be signed by the president, chairmen of the  parliament's chambers, prime minister, heads of the federation's  subjects, and plenipotentiary representatives of political  parties represented in the State Duma, the Public Chamber of the  president, trade unions, "and after that the agreement should be  opened for the signing by other sides."    In this connection, experts indicate a considerable  probability that next Thursday the signing ceremony will be held  without representatives of most major parties represented in the  Duma. Some experts do not rule out that among participants in  this solemn ceremony there will be no the speaker of the lower  chamber. According to their forecasts, that may happen if  deputies, in response to the LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  refuse to authorize the speaker with signing the agreement.</p>

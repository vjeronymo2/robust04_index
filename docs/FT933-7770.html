			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Write-offs hit net at Leighton BIG write-offs on properties and a withdrawal from the US market hit the results of Leighton Holdings, the Australian construction group, in the year ended to June. The company yesterday announced a 33 per cent fall in net earnings, to ADollars 15.1m on a marginal decrease in revenue. The dividend is being held at 8 cents a share. The result followed abnormal losses of ADollars 64.4m, reflecting provisions against properties and write-downs of US operations. The abnormals are not expected to be repeated in the current year, Leighton said. It expects increased net earnings for 1993-94.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy  in Cyprus, has declared that nothing can be achieved unless the  advantages to be granted to the Turkish Cypriot side within the  framework of the confidence-building measures package are  guaranteed. Clark also announced that no agreement has been  reached so far on the package.    The proximity talks on the confidence-building measures are  continuing. President Rauf Denktas received Clark this morning.  Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister; Atay  Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister; Ozel Koray,  under secretary of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry;  presidential advisers; Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's  assistant special envoy in Cyprus; and UN experts also attended  the meeting, which lasted approximately one and a half hours.    In a statement before the meeting, Clark remarked that the  outcome of the confidence-building measures package will become  clearer today. When a journalist reminded him of his statement  yesterday and asked him if he is hopeful about reaching an  agreement on one or two disputed issues, Clark said that these  two subjects constitute the main points that cause differences  of opinion between the two sides. He expressed the belief that  if agreement is not reached because of these two issues, the  efforts exerted so far will have been wasted.    Asked if the two issues concern Maras [Varosha], Clark noted  that the aim is to formulate an agreement that will benefit both  sides equally, adding that if Maras benefits the Greek Cypriots,  then the Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport must benefit the Turkish  Cypriots. Clark declared that if the advantages granted to the  Turkish Cypriots are not guaranteed against those granted to the  Greek Cypriots, the benefits specified for the Turkish Cypriots  cannot be implemented.    In a statement after his meeting with Denktas, Clark  announced that no agreement has been reached so far on the  confidence-building measures package. He said that he is now  hopeful that an agreement will be reached on the implementation  of the package. This has not been achieved yet, Clark remarked,  adding, however, that he is still hopeful that a conciliation  will be reached by the end of the month.    Pointing out that certain new alternatives emerged during  today's meeting, on which both Denktas and himself will reflect,  Clark said that in the coming days UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali will submit a report to the UN Security Council on  the developments.    Questioned by a reporter on the disputed matters, Clark  stated that he does not wish to comment on these issues at this  stage. In answer to another question, Clark declared that if  the package is to be implemented successfully, it must grant  equal and concrete advantages to both sides. Asked if the  proximity talks will continue, Clark said that he will leave the  island today, but his assistant Feissel will continue the  contacts. [passage omitted]    In a statement after the meeting, Rasit declared that an  agreement that could endanger the interests of the Turkish  Cypriot people will not be accepted. He noted that the Turkish  Cypriots are conducting the talks in goodwill. In reply to a  question, Rasit remarked that the issues of Maras and the  Lefkosa Airport are interdependent and one must be careful to  secure the balance. We have not yet reached a balance, he added.</p>

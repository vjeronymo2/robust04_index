			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker incurs Pounds 79m interim losses MR KEN SCOBIE, chief executive of Brent Walker, yesterday said the company's survival remained uncertain as the heavily-indebted leisure group announced interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 79.4m and revealed that it had not yet appointed a chairman. Mr Scobie said it was 'too early to say whether Brent Walker is a totally viable entity. . . We are only a very small part of the way down a programme which stretches well in to the next century.' Brent Walker completed Britain's largest debt restructuring in March. The group's difficulties had prolonged the search for a chairman since the retirement of Lord Kindersley in July. 'I do not think the chairmanship of Brent Walker would be regarded as one of the plums,' said a resigned Mr Scobie. Brent Walker ended the six months to June 30 with operating profits of Pounds 29.5m. This compares with Pounds 34.3m for the 28 weeks to July 14 1991. The pre-tax loss was struck after total interest of Pounds 108m and Pounds 1m in exceptional charges for refinancing costs. It compared with a loss of Pounds 133.5m last year. Turnover fell from Pounds 849.4m to Pounds 816.2m. Mr Scobie said the company had not made much progress in reducing debt - which stands at Pounds 1.3bn, after the Pounds 250m debt for equity swap. When the restructuring had first been envisaged, Mr Scobie said, the company had not believed it was 'looking at a recession of quite this depth or length.' About Pounds 71m in interest payments would be rolled into debt or converted into instruments such as preference shares by the year-end. As a result, net interest payable was significantly reduced from Pounds 117.9m to Pounds 37.3m. Most of this charge was due to the Pounds 350m debt in betting chain William Hill. Mr Scobie said Brent Walker would be able to service these reduced charges. However, there remained the problem of how the remaining obligations would be met when they fell due in 1997. Operating profits in both the William Hill business and the Pubmaster division declined in the first half. The return from betting shops fell from Pounds 32.7m to Pounds 26.8m. Mr Scobie said the decline was a combination of luckier customers and higher operating costs. Pub profits fell almost 17 per cent to Pounds 6m, including a four-month contribution from the 734 pubs leased from Allied Breweries. Losses per share were significantly cut following the debt for equity swap, from 259.47p to 42.48p. There was no ordinary or preference dividend.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin and Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds was today  briefing US President Bill Clinton on developments in the search  for peace in Northern Ireland. The two leaders were meeting in  Indianapolis, where Mr Clinton was unveiling a monument to  assassination victims John Kennedy and Martin Luther King.    Mr Reynolds was expected to discuss with the President a  list  of questions drawn up by Sinn Fein, the political arm of the  IRA, about the Downing Street peace declaration. Sinn Fein  submitted the list to Mr Reynolds earlier this week and it was  then in turn relayed to London.    Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew has said he  will publish the list soon -- together with Britain's response.  However, Ulster Unionists are suspicious of the Sinn Fein move,  fearing it is another attempt at persuading Britain to clarify  the declaration -- something John Major and Sir Patrick have  consistently refused to do.    A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said Sir Patrick had not  ruled out answering specific questions about the declaration,  but still insisted it was not up for negotiation.    Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic  Unionist Party, today warned that any answering of the questions  by Britain would amount to clarification. He added: "Here once  again we have a Government that lies and deceives, a Government  that tells us one thing and does another. It is a Government  that cannot be trusted.    "Rewarding gunmen and bombers is not a proper way for a  Government, especially Her Majesty's Government, to be behaving."    Mr Robinson, MP for Belfast East, also criticised the Irish  Government for acting as "postmen by appointment to the  Provisional IRA".    Sinn Fein's questions are believed to centre on the precise  way forward proposed by the Britain and Ireland if the IRA ends  its campaign of violence. Mr Reynolds has made it clear he sees  the Sinn Fein approach as offering new hope of success for the  declaration he and Mr Major signed in Downing Street last  December.    For his part, Mr Clinton, who requested today's talks, is  anxious to be fully briefed on the latest Northern Ireland  position ahead of an imminent visit to Britain. Mr Reynolds,  who is due back in Dublin on Monday, is planning to deal with  the Ulster issue in a speech in Indiana tomorrow when he is due  to receive an an honourary degree from Notre Dame university.  He said on his arrival in the US that Sinn Fein's questions  should be dealt with "as soon as possible" to permit the peace  process to move ahead.</p>

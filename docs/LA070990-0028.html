			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NATIONWIDE;  </P> <P> RADAR DEVICE FAILS TESTS, PAPER SAYS  </P> <P> The Pentagon is breaking its own rules by pressing ahead with the purchase of a  $4-billion electronic radar-jamming device that failed during crucial flight  tests on fighter planes it is designed to protect, the New York Times reported.  The Airborne Self-Protection Jammer device has become a test of Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney's ability to adhere to guidelines adopted by the Pentagon  last summer. These require that major weapons projects pass strict performance  tests before being purchased by the government, the paper said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> RECYCLING PROGRAM OKD  </P> <P> The solution to limited landfill space is not to ban non-biodegradable  packaging materials, but to encourage recycling, the City Council has decided.  </P> <P> At a meeting Monday, the council agreed with a city task force that a ban on  polystyrene and plastic packaging products containing ozone-damaging  chlorofluorocarbons was unnecessary, said Dennis Danner, director of  administrative services.  </P> <P> The controversial chemical is no longer used by 99% of the nation's polystyrene  manufacturers, industry officials told task force members.  </P> <P> Instead of banning polystyrene, the city will begin a recycling program for  1,000 homes in southeastern Alhambra, Danner said. The three-month pilot  program, scheduled to begin Oct. 1, will offer residents curbside pickup of  recyclable materials such as newspapers, bottles and cans, he said.  </P> <P> Polystyrene and plastic packaging products such as grocery bags and fast-food  storage containers, which also can be recycled, "may perhaps be part of a  citywide recycling program," Danner said.  </P></p>

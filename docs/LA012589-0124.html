			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BONE REPORT DISTURBS MISSING CHILD'S FAMILY  </P> <P> Angered over reports that bone fragments have been identified as belonging to  long-missing Laura Bradbury, the grandfather of the Huntington Beach child said  Tuesday that the family will seek an independent test to verify the findings.  </P> <P> San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department investigators telephoned the missing  girl's father, Mike Bradbury, on Tuesday and told him that they had  commissioned a sophisticated DNA analysis of skull fragments found in 1986 in  the desert. Although Bradbury was told that the tests would not be completed  for several days, preliminary results indicate a "match," Laura's grandfather  said late Tuesday.  </P> <P> "They told Mike, at this juncture, it looks like it's going to be a match,"  Dana Winters said of his son-in-law's conversation with sheriff's  investigators. Winters remarked that it was the first time since early 1986  that the family had spoken directly with detectives.  </P> <P> The family had expressed anger at the investigators after the first report of  the DNA test was aired by a Los Angeles television station Friday evening.  </P> <P> Mike Bradbury told representatives of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's  Department that he would seek a second, independent DNA test, Winters said.  </P> <P> Laura was 3 when she disappeared on a family camping trip to Joshua Tree  National Monument in 1984 and became the focus of a nationwide search.  </P> <P> Winters said the family had heard that a Northern California laboratory  conducted the DNA tests on the fragments, which were found in March, 1986,  about 3 miles from where Laura vanished.  </P> <P> But Ed Blake, a nationally recognized forensic expert, would neither confirm or  deny that his company, Forensic Science Associates in Richmond, had done any  testing of bone fragments in the Bradbury case. Blake's firm is one of only  three private companies in the nation that do DNA analysis, which is also known  as genetic fingerprinting.  </P> <P> San Bernardino County investigators have had custody of the skullcap and other  bone fragments since June, 1988, when they "checked them out" of the coroner's  office, according to Coroner Brian McCormick. McCormick said investigators  wanted the fragments for "further testing and analysis."  </P> <P> "All we keep hearing are reports that those fragments are Laura's," Winters  said. "But nobody, not a single individual involved with this investigation,  has called us. Frankly, even if those test results indicate it's her, we're not  going to be satisfied."  </P> <P> DNA analysis or print testing in criminal cases is a new, highly technical  procedure based on the fact that each person's DNA, or genetic material, is  unique, except in the case of identical twins. Experts in the past have relied  on matching blood types, for example, for identifying bodies or linking a  suspect with a victim. But it is a process that is far less reliable than DNA  analysis.  </P> <P> The DNA print identification test provides for comparisons of genetic codes by  extracting the DNA from a crime scene specimen, such as semen, blood or tissue,  and chemically dividing it into fragments.  </P> <P> The fragments form a pattern that serves as an identity profile, which can be  matched against that of a relative. In the case of Laura Bradbury, the match  was against her parents, Mike and Patty. Winters said the Bradbury couple  submitted samples of their blood shortly after the fragments were found.  Investigators also removed samples of hair from Laura's hairbrush, which can be  examined and compared to test results from the bone fragments.  </P></p>

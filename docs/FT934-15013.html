			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / 30m Europeans out of work by century's end says Delors Europe could face the prospect of 30m people out of work by the end of the century unless it adjusts its post-war model of the social market economy, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, warned yesterday, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. His statement came in a speech to the European parliament. But he expressed confidence that Europe could remain competitive with the US and Asia and resume steady growth by exploiting its greatest resource: human capital. Speaking one day after the German constitutional court ruled favourably on Maastricht, he said the new treaty would allow the EC to 'shift gear'. But he warned that EC governments must tackle mass unemployment and faltering competitiveness.</p>

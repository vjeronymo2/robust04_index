			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] There's been a serious breakdown in discipline in  the Djibouti Army, which has been fighting the FRUD [Front for  the Restoration of Unity and Democracy] rebels in the north of  the country.    The Army have had the upper hand for much of this year, but  it seems a small group of veterans are not happy about the way  they've been treated, and there has been a gun battle in the  capital, Djibouti City, from where Christo Farah telexed this  report:    Yesterday afternoon, an antiterrorist unit attacked a group  of about 20 discontented soldiers who have been pressing the  government to accept their financial demands. The incident took  place in the neighborhood of Belbela on the outskirts of the  capital. The interior minister, Idris Harbi Farah, said the  mutiny has posed a threat to security, because they had refused  to hand in their military uniforms and hand grenades. He said  the clashes began when one of the discontented soldiers took the  pin out of a grenade, while his colleagues got into combat  positions, forcing the police to open fire. Five policemen were  wounded in the fighting and unspecified number of mutineers were  killed or wounded. Interior minister has described the  rebellious soldiers as a handful of demobilized elements from  the Army who have been manipulated by the opposition. The  police are now looking for another group of about 30 soldiers  who were also involved in the mutiny.</p>

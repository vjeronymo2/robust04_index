			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RILEY GETS 500TH VICTORY ON THE FAST TRACK AT INDY  </P> <P> As he has probably done 499 other times as Laker coach, Pat Riley made sure  that the final seconds of a victory Wednesday night ticked away without delay  and then nonchalantly strolled off the court.  </P> <P> Not so fast, Pat.  </P> <P> Before Riley could take a few steps and begin to savor the Lakers' 120-111  victory over the Indiana Pacers before 16,912 at Market Square Arena, he was  double-teammed by assistant coaches Bill Bertka and Randy Pfund. Handshakes and  backslaps were exchanged in acknowledgment of Riley's 500th regular-season  victory.  </P> <P> He earned those victories in 684 games. It was the quickest any NBA coach has  done it. Before Riley, Golden State Coach Don Nelson had reached that milestone  in the fewest games, 817, in 1986. In addition to that milestone, Wednesday's  victory ensured Riley's spot as coach for the Western Conference in next  month's All-Star game.  </P> <P> Consistent with Riley's controlled personality, he tried to play down the  achievement. No one would let him, though. Players briefly chanted "500" in  front of their coach. Later, they gave testimonials to Riley's coaching ability  and perceived lack of recognition.  </P> <P> All of those 184 losses probably still bother Riley, but he seemed to fully  embrace this victory. Call this his personal Indianapolis 500.  </P> <P> And, only when asked, Riley talked about what 500 victories means to him. Turns  out, it means a lot.  </P> <P> "It sure does," Riley said. "I've always said that milestones for coaches and  players are great. They are the residual rewards for winning. All the things  that lead up to the winning are what really matters. I just can't believe I've  already coached about 700 games. It seems like just yesterday I started out on  Nov. 19, 1981 with a 137-117 win against San Antonio."  </P> <P> Actually, it was a 136-116 victory over San Antonio on Nov. 20, 1981. But that  is quibbling. Riley has, indeed, made a quantum leap since that first game  after replacing Paul Westhead.  </P> <P> Carrying on quite efficiently without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Riley has the Lakers  at an NBA-best 30-9. They finished this difficult trip with a 3-1 record,  including victories over Detroit and New York and Wednesday's strong effort  over the improved Pacers.  </P> <P> Several Lakers had big games.  </P> <P> Magic Johnson had 32 points and eight assists. He sank 11 of 15 shots. A.C.  Green made 12 of 13 shots, many from the perimeter, for 24 points. Green also  had 11 rebounds. James Worthy had a career-high 12 assists to go with 17  points, and Mychal Thompson tied his season high with 19 points.  </P> <P> The taxing trip over, Riley even relaxed enough to joke about all the fuss over  his 500 victories.  </P> <P> "I'll say the same thing I said after the 100th, 200th, 300th, 400th, 500th  and, if I'm still around then after my 600th win," Riley said. "That is: If I  had a little more talent, I would've won 'em quicker."  </P> <P> Only now, it seems, is Riley earning a modicum of credit for at least a few of  those victories. He has, after all, never won the coach of the year award even  though he has guided the Lakers to four NBA titles.  </P> <P> Does the 500th validate Riley's coaching prowess?  </P> <P> "That's up to you guys to decide," Riley said. "I feel like I've made it."  </P> <P> When Riley made it to the locker room after Wednesday's game, he was greeted by  a chorus of chants from Laker players.  </P> <P> "We were counting off all of his victories, from one to 500," Thompson said.  "We did it the Evelyn Wood speed-reading counting method, the same way we took  our SATs in college."  </P> <P> In a more serious vein, Laker players from Worthy to Johnson to Byron Scott  praised Riley, though Worthy admitted the 500th-victory scenario was not an  issue until after the game.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of great coaches out there," Worthy said. "But, as far as  winning goes, year-to-year, you have to look at Riley."  </P> <P> Added Scott: "He's done it quicker than anybody, and that's saying something. I  think now he is getting the (recognition). Now that Kareem's gone, and we still  got the best record in basketball and (are) playing great, people are starting  to notice him."  </P> <P> Johnson, who along with Michael Cooper, is the only holdover from Riley's first  victory, said he has "matured" as a coach.  </P> <P> "To win 100 or 200 games is a great accomplishment, but 500 is amazing,"  Johnson said. "I'm proud of him. He's been the head of this gang -- I mean  group of men -- for a long time. And he hasn't always gotten the credit.  </P> <P> "He's matured as everyone else has matured -- as a coach and a person. He's a  good friend, a guy you can talk to about more than just the X's and O's. He's a  players' coach. He understands what we go through, (player) No. 1 one through  12. It's important to know every player."  </P> <P> Knowing the current Lakers as he does, Riley did not expect them to fold  Wednesday night just because it was the end of a trip that consisted of four  games in six days, including intense victories over the Pistons and Knicks and  a last-second loss to Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Though weary, the Lakers never let the Pacers, off for the previous four days,  lead by more than five points. Indiana took an 89-88 lead into the fourth  quarter, but the Lakers scored the first six points of the quarter.  </P> <P> Indiana cut the deficit to one point on four occasions, only to have the Lakers  pull away again. The Pacers made their last stand with 3:52 left, when Mike  Sanders tipped in Detlef Schrempf's miss to cut the Lakers' lead to 106-105.  </P> <P> After an exchange of possessions and then a timeout, the Lakers pulled away for  good. Scott sank a three-point shot with 3:01 to play; Johnson sank two free  throws with 2:23 to play and Johnson made a three-point shot with 1:52 to play  for a 114-105 lead. The Pacers, scoreless on their three possessions, were  finished despite making 57.7% of their shots. The Lakers sank 58.4%.  </P> <P> As far as intensity and marquee value, a victory over the Pacers does not rate  with wins over the Pistons and Knicks.  </P> <P> But Riley, not totally stopping to savor the milestone, talked about how  important Wednesday's victory was in the context of the Lakers' season.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody's going to win the championship unless they have the  home court for the playoffs," Riley said. "San Antonio, Utah and Portland, I'm  sure they are waiting and waiting for us to lose on the road. But this team is  not cracking. They could have settled for a 2-2 trip. But 3-1 is a lot better."  </P> <P> By the same token, 500-184 is not bad for a coach, either.  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Reggie Miller led Indiana with 27 points. Miller made 11 of 13 shots, his only  two misses coming in the second half. . . . A. C. Green made his first 11 shots  before missing a layup with 2:32 to play in the third quarter. Green promptly  grabbed the rebound and converted the miss. It was the only shot he missed all  game. . . . For the second time in the last three games, center Vlade Divac did  not play in the second half. In Detroit, Coach Pat Riley said he did not play  Divac because the play was too physical for him. Wednesday, Riley said Divac  sat because Indiana went with a smaller lineup that had 6-foot-10 Detlef  Schrempf at center. "Vlade is not in the doghouse," Riley said. "That's just  the way it turned out." . . . The Lakers are off today and play the Milwaukee  Bucks Friday night at the Forum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GETTING TO 500  </P> <P> NBA coaches with 500 regular-season victories, the number of games it took to  reach the milestone and the dates of their 500th win.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.66IN:2.44IN:2.55IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Coach  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> No. of Games  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Date of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> to Reach 500  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> No. 500  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pat Riley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 684  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan. 24, 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Don Nelson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 817  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nov. 26, 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Red Auerbach  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 821  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dec. 29, 1958  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Red Holzman  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 881  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Feb. 21, 1976  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dick Motta  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 897  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> April 1, 1979  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Doug Moe  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 907  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Feb. 26, 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lenny Wilkens  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 917  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jan. 18, 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> J.

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Arts: An audacious 'Coriolanus' - Theatre Boy. The real Caius Martius Coriolanus was probably thirty-something when he died, and Shakespeare's hero has been played by many actors older than that. Before killing him, however, his enemy Aufidius calls him 'boy', and it is this brilliant taunt that drives Coriolanus into his final, fatal fury. And this word is the clue to the RSC's splendid audacity in casting Toby Stephens - 24 years old, forsooth - as its new Coriolanus. He charges through the role in a youthful blaze. His voice, a tenor, has steel and clarion attack. Not only proud (the word forever applied to him by other characters), but thrillingly hot-tempered and impetuous too, this Coriolanus has never quite grown up. Assured of his own natural superiority, he lives in action; he has no reflectiveness until it is way, way too late. Even when his mother and friends persuade him to return in mildness to the people, his temper bursts out again, and he shouts 'Well, MILDLY BE IT THEN.' This is, to us, marvellously funny  - but he himself lacks any irony. Something in him dies on being exiled from Rome. When he comes to Antium and is embraced by Aufidius as a friend, he is stiff, lifeless, as if already in rigor. His mother cracks this dead facade, and he cries out in massive misery at how she has undone him. He knows she has sealed his death-warrant, and in his final scene he seems to invite his death. He dons again the same insolent haughtiness that had brought the Romans close to killing him; this time, with his new Volscian colleagues, nothing will save him. The director, David Thacker, has had the idea of setting the play in post-1789 revolutionary France, to lend new force to the republican talk that surrounds Coriolanus and his fellow-aristocrats. Banners around the theatre bear the words 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'. A key image is the stream of corn that pours from above into a locker beneath the stage, and which the hero bars the plebs from taking. But Fran Thomson's designs, handsome and vivid though they be, are so historically specific that they raise problems. Stephens's hair is brushed forward like Napoleon's - ie not an aristo but a self-made man who turns republicanism back into conservatism - and the noblewomen are dressed with Napoleonic neoclassicism. He is uniformed in black and gold like a Gericault officer: ie post-Napoleonic. And the backdrop is Delacroix's 'Liberty Leading the People': which, surely, is all about the barricades of 1830. The more you know about post-1789 France, the more distracting you will find this production's notion(s) of period. This notwithstanding, the production has great vigour and narrative energy. Thacker makes the most of the love-hate nexus between Coriolanus and Aufidius (Barry Lynch, darkly smouldering, as slight and lean as Stephens). At the end, the Volscians leave Aufidius alone to embrace again his now dead enemy. As the hero's mother Volumnia, Caroline Blakiston begins as a hearty and youngish society lady, with horridly Oedipal outbursts against her son's wife Virgilia. Her finest hour is in the helpless fury she unleashes on the tribunes who have exiled her boy. She is, however, too subdued in the great scene when she persuades him to save Rome. And her diction has become muzzy. Monica Dolan makes the ungrateful role of Virgilia into a very interesting study of passivity. And Philip Voss makes old Menenius into the most rounded character in the play: hero-worshipping young Caius Martius, contemptuous of the tribunes, fully possessed of the moderation and diplomacy his boyish hero so eminently lacks. This difficult play can have a vaster scale, the hero a mightier intellect, than in this production. But it is completely alive, and gathers powerfully in excitement. In repertory at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon</p>

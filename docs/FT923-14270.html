			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cementos Mexicanos to pay up to Dollars 1.7bn for Valenciana CEMENTOS Mexicanos yesterday released details of its agreed bid for Valenciana de Cementos, Spain's largest cement producer. The company is paying Dollars 1.25bn for a 75.1 per cent stake after acquiring a 24.1 of Valenciana's treasury stock for Dollars 420m on Monday. Valenciana, controlled by the Serratosa family, was paid Pta14,850 a share for its treasury stock and Cemex is to make its bid for the rest of the company at Pta15,075 a share. The Spanish company, which has about 15 per cent of the Spanish market, reported a turnover of Pta63.7bn (Dollars 665m) last year, to make net consolidated profits of Pta10.2bn. Aker, the Norwegian industrial group, will receive NKr1.3bn (Dollars 219m) in cash through the takeover, netting it a NKr300m profit. This arises through the disposal of the 13 per cent stake acquired during a series of deals aimed at strengthening its international presence in the cement business. It began accumulating the holding in 1984. Euroc, a Swedish cement producer, which also has a 13 per cent stake will suffer a SKr140m (Dollars 25.6m) loss, having acquired its stake in 1990 at a price considerably above that paid by Aker. It will also incur holding costs for the financing of the purchase also made as part of an expansion plan. The two companies in 1990 transferred their shareholding to Scancem, a joint venture. Last April, the companies bought back their shareholdings, yielding Aker a total profit on the Spanish investment of NKr680m. The deal will put Cemex, the world's fourth-largest cement producer, in direct competition in Europe with its main North American rival, Holderbank of Switzerland, which controls Spain's fourth-largest producer, Hisalba. It will more than double the Mexican group's debt, to around Dollars 2.8bn, giving it a debt equity ratio of around 100 per cent. US analysts were concerned about the effects the bid might have on Cemex. Unlike Mexico's growing cement market, consumption in Spain is slowing rapidly as the economy cools and construction activity slows. Cemex, for its part, has felt particularly vulnerable in the face of expansion planned by Apasco, its main competitor in Mexico. Apasco, controlled by Holderbank, has just 17 per cent of the Mexican market but has launched a four-year Dollars 260m programme to increase production from 5.4m tonnes last year to 7.15m tonnes in 1994. Cemex stocks fell by about 10 per cent in Mexico City after the announcement, prompting a fall of 58.73 (3.51 per cent) in the Bolsa index of 40 most-traded issues, which closed at 1,614.19, Reuter reports.</p>

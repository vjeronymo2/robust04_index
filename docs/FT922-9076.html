			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to shoulder debt FOR MANY high-flyers the 1990s have recalled the tale of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun and fell into the sea after the heat melted the wax on his wings. Rather than the sun's rays it is overborrowing and redundancy that is bringing so many down with a bump today. Unable to pay their debts, they receive some of the 208,000 county court judgments which are issued each month. Plunging high-flyers often make matters worse for themselves by desperately flailing about. A private debt counselling firm I visited had just spoken to a man who had rung up an extra Pounds 50,000 in unsecured debts in a desperate attempt to find cash to pay his mortgage. Like many professionals he had been ill-prepared for the trauma of being in debt. The welfare state provides a safety net just above ground level - paying mortgage interest and pocket money of around Pounds 40 a week. But this net can quickly prove to be a trap. For every Pounds 1 a recipient earns, the DSS removes Pounds 1 of support. A person with a Pounds 100,000 mortgage therefore needs to earn Pounds 19,020 before his net income starts to increase. With a Pounds 200,000 mortgage the break-through earnings are Pounds 36,440. No-one who has paid this 100 per cent tax rate at the DSS should ever complain about the Inland Revenue's 40 per cent version. Last month the DSS torpedoed hopes that the Department of Employment may have of reducing the nation's dole queues. From April 6, anyone working over 16 hours a week is disqualified from receiving any income support. Such part-time work is precisely the route that many redundant executives are likely to take in re-entering the labour market. This poverty trap makes it nearly impossible for the former high earner to pay off his or her debts as extra earnings do not increase disposable income. That leaves the unaccustomed debtor with the unedifying pauper's progress of summonses, county court judgments and visits from bailiffs. The depression that debt induces often delays consideration of the ways out of this conundrum. One option is personal bankruptcy. Its stigma is rapidly fading and more and more people have been unloading themselves of their debts through this mechanism. In the first two months of the year the number of people making themselves bankrupt went up by 49 per cent to 1,500 a month. In two years time, if their debts are under Pounds 20,000, (three years if their debts are larger) these individuals will enjoy a completely fresh start with nearly all debts written off. Exceptions include fines and debts arising from fraud. Meanwhile, they can earn a basic income of perhaps Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 25,000 before the official receiver will want the top slice for creditors. The official receiver (or insolvency practitioner operating in his stead) is also considered to be far more generous than the average bailiff in terms of the possessions a debtor may keep. The pecuniary advantages of bankruptcy to the debtor are clear - a modest lifestyle is possible for the two years with no fear of the bailiff calling. But there is also a price to be paid in terms of dignity. After filling forms in triplicate and shelling out Pounds 150 in court fees to petition for bankruptcy, debtors have to go before a district judge and then an official receiver to explain their finances. Remaining assets are not theirs to dispose of during bankruptcy. Fortunately for debtors, the surge in applications for bankruptcy means that an individual is unlikely to be savagely interrogated by an official receiver's staff. Cases are dealt with perfunctorily. Other pitfalls of bankruptcy include the utility companies insisting that the debtor pays for their supply by token meters installed in their home. An official receiver will also tell neighbours of the debtor's uncreditworthiness through an advertisement placed in the local paper. Bankrupts are barred from being company directors without special dispensation. They are also unable to practice as solicitors or accountants. For people in these professions the advantage of renouncing debts as allowed by bankruptcy is outweighed by the need to stay in work. For them a 'voluntary arrangement' is needed through which an insolvency practitioner arranges a deal with creditors. Enough assets must be available to satisfy not only creditors but also to pay the fee of the insolvency practitioner - typically at least Pounds 1,000. So long as three-quarters (by value) of creditors agree to the arrangement, it is binding on all creditors. In the case of bankruptcy, creditors typically might receive 20 per cent of assets. With voluntary arrangements they tend to get around 40 per cent. The payment terms are also important. A woman in Northumberland wrote to me concerning a voluntary arrangement set up seven years ago by which she pays off Pounds 25 a month. At that rate she still has 35 years of payments to go and the stress is affecting her health. She now believes that she may have made a mistake in not going bankrupt in the first place. For those lacking the assets to pay for a voluntary arrangement, but who cannot stomach bankruptcy, the alternative to the bailiffs is to negotiate with creditors themselves. This can be done by letter, through a Citizens Advice Bureau or by attending court to defend summonses when they arrive. Unless particular creditors believe the debtor is stashing away a pot of gold, they should be prepared to settle for less than the sum involved. The prevalence of middle class debt means that the embarrassment attached to it has eased. However, those who have suffered its indignities are likely to be credit shy and avoid taking so many risks again.</p>

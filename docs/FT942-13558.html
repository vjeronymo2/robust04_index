			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Ban lifts Tapie's mayoral chances Mr Bernard Tapie, the French populist businessman-turned-politician, said yesterday he would use all his energies and all legal means to try to reverse the French football federation's decision to bar him from football indefinitely and to relegate his star Olympique-Marseille club to the second division. Ironically, the French soccer authorities' move to penalise the O-M club and its president for seeking to rig a game last year may reinforce Marseille's 'martyr complex' and Mr Tapie's chances of becoming its mayor next year. Mr Tapie, a left-wing national deputy from the Marseille region, won a local council seat handsomely last month by harping on the theme that he and the depressed southern city were being victimised by France's political and sporting establishment. Some observers saw in the Balladur government's recent decision to postpone France's next round of municipal elections until June 1995 its desire not to see Mr Tapie become mayor of Marseille in the run-up to the presidential elections in a year's time. In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche, Mr Tapie said he would comply with the French football federation's ruling, while still appealing to the French national olympic committee and possibly the Conseil d'Etat, the country's highest administrative tribunal, to have it reversed.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   New Police Union Members Threaten Strike -- Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 8 April in a page-10 editorial comments on  the threatened strike by members of the newly formed South  African Police Union (SAPU), saying the primary grievance  fuelling discontent is "financial". Union members object to  discrepancies between their salaries and those paid to soldiers  in the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF). SAPU leaders are  "under pressure to agree to a strike on April 13 if no remedial  action is taken. The argument of militant members is powerful:  SAPU memoranda submitted to President de Klerk and the  Transitional Executive Council have been shelved, but when the  NPKF recruits went on strike their demands for more pay were  speedily met." THE STAR believes a strike by SAPU members can  only "compound the crisis" in police ranks. The NPKF is a  "small and untested military unit" and "a heavy burden of  protecting the electoral process already falls on the  overstretched SADF [South African Defense Force]. If that  burden is increased by a strike in police ranks, the election  itself may be imperiled, particularly if there is renewed  violence outside kwaZulu/Natal."    Article Warns of `Undemocratic' Guarantees for Zulu Kingdom  -- Hugh Roberton writes in an article on the same page that what  Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu  King Zwelithini are demanding "in essence are guarantees of the  survival, and future status, of the Zulu king and his kingdom.  The only way which De Klerk and Mandela can do this is by way  of constitutional guarantees which do not now exist." For the  sake of what would be a "precarious peace at best, are De Klerk  and Mandela prepared to promise to guarantee the king's right,  for instance, to have a say in the appointment of some of the  regional kwaZulu/Natal cabinet?" Roberton believes that "while  a degree of constitutional flexibility is needed in South Africa  to satisfy the `special circumstances' that might exist in a  region, such flexibility surely should not extend to granting  individuals, or groups, powers which they do not now have and  which they have not had for almost a century. Such a profoundly  undemocratic dispensing of power in the case of kwaZulu would  amount to entrenching a 19th century tribal fiefdom into the  constitution of a country standing at the doorway of the 21st  century."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Proposals Can Be Made To Satisfy Zulu Leaders --  Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 8 April finds it "difficult" to be  optimistic about the 8 April meeting between President de Klerk,  ANC leader Nelson Mandela, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and  Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. However, SOWETAN is sure there  are "various proposals that can be made to satisfy both Zulu  leaders. In any case, isolating Buthelezi will not solve the  problem: he is a key factor in the politics of kwaZulu-Natal.  It is now evident that the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front  -- AVF] is prepared to enter the race, which makes a solution in  Natal even more vital. The state of emergency cannot be lifted  immediately even if it were an almost panic-driven move to quell  the violence."  <H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>   Emergency Not Enforced in Natal -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL  &amp;  GUARDIAN in English for 8-14 April in its page-14 editorial says  the emergency regulations imposed in Natal were "horribly like  the emergency regulations of the 1980s, and would fall foul of  the Bill of Rights the government and the ANC purport to  support." The security force members have "blanket immunity"  and the detainees receive "so little protection." However,  having "given themselves these powers, the authorities then fail  to use them in any significant way." Among other things the  soldiers form a "scanty presence in the urban areas," and the  police "find themselves unable to disarm marchers in Empangeni  who are blatantly breaking the ban on dangerous weapons." "It  would have been better to use existing, normal law and order  powers -- of which the authorities have plenty -- to deal with  the problem, rather than a showy emergency that is not enforced."</p>

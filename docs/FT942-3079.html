			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Hot air from British Gas It is time British Gas stopped playing the victim and got on with adding value to its businesses. The company may once have thought that saying how awful things were would encourage the regulator and the government to take a soft line. But it should now be abundantly clear that Ofgas is likely to respond more favourably if British Gas seeks to improve itself than if it moans. There was really little to complain about in Ofgas's transportation price formula. The rate of return is in line with what the Monopolies Commission recommended. The annual price cut of 5 per cent in real terms seems achievable. Assuming volume growth of 5 per cent a year, the target could be hit by annual efficiency savings of 2.5 per cent. Yet British Gas responded by saying it would curtail investment and find it hard to justify dividend increases. The reaction is odd. A promised real rate of return of 6.5-7.5 per cent on new investment is not bad for a safe business like gas transportation. Given the growth in demand, curbing capital expenditure looks a bit like cutting off its nose to spite its face. There may be good reasons for freezing or cutting dividends. But it is strange to pin the blame on Ofgas; British Gas last increased its dividend in February - after the government had responded to the MMC report. British Gas would do better to rise to the challenges ahead. The main tasks are to knock its public gas supply business into shape so it can face the advent of competition in the domestic market and to improve efficiency in the transportation business. Until British Gas communicates strategies to achieve both tasks, its share price will remain subdued.</p>

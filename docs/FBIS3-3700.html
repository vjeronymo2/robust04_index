Work in planning determines the future modern  features of both urban and rural areas in the province, and is a  major issue that has a bearing on many future generations and  their well being. We must be resolute in doing a good job of  work in this domain. Planning for urban and rural construction  must be formulated in accordance with Guangdong's goal in  realizing modernization. There must be an overall,  comprehensive layout, with conspicuous foci. When such plans  are ready, earnest implementation is called for to fulfill the  goal of the plans. This precisely requires all places to adhere  to principles, act according to their abilities, implement plans  step by step, while paying attention to protecting the authority  of the plans. NANFANG RIBAO carries the full text of Xie Fei's  speech in a prominent position in its front page today.</p>

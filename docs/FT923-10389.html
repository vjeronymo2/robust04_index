			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Period rates firmer PERIOD rates in the sterling cash market ended firmer yesterday, due to end-of-month pressures on the market and sterling's indifferent performance on foreign exchanges. At the month's end, commercial banks and discount houses need to show liquidity in their books in order to comply with the requirements of the Bank of England and the credit-rating agencies. Few bills were therefore offered to the market yesterday, and the short rates remained firm. By the day's end, one-week money was offered at 10 1/8 per cent from a previous close of 10 per cent, while the one -month stayed unchanged at 10 3/16 per cent offered. Rates from 3-months out to one-year also firmed, with nothing to take dealers' minds off anxieties that the Bundesbank might lift the Lombard rate from its current 9 3/4 per cent when its council next meets. All these rates ended at 10 3/8 per cent from a previous close of 10 5/16 per cent. Sterling futures were bearish in the morning as sterling hovered nervously around DM2.8430. Dealers were particularly concerned that the gap in the European Monetary System's grid between sterling and its nearest competitor, the Italian lira, has now widened to 2.70 per cent. The September short sterling contract dropped 6 basis points to a low of 89.64, but rallied in the afternoon to close unchanged at 89.70. December short sterling also dropped 4 basis points to a low of 89.85 in the morning, but performed more bullishly than the September contract in the afternoon after an American investment bank put in a large order for the contract at 89.87. The contract closed 5 basis points up on the day at 89.94. The Bank of England's operations in the discount market reflected the paucity of bills on offer. The Bank operated at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreement (repo), repayable on August 18 and 19. In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 50m in the repo, revised the shortage to Pounds 1.15bn, and purchased Pounds 15m in Band 1, Pounds 72m in Band 2 and Pounds 102m in the repo. The forecast was then revised to Pounds 1.2bn. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 354m in Band 1, Pounds 69m in Band 2 and Pounds 50m in the repo. The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 335m.</p>

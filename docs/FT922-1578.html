			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter (3): Demise of NEDC leaves UK without means for valuable industrial dialogue Sir, The idea that the NEDC was a corporatist institution is just ridiculous to anyone who worked there. Of the three parties around the Council Table neither the CBI nor the Trades Union Congress could deliver anything by way of bankable agreements on behalf of their member organisations, and the government probably could not deliver such an agreement itself (which in my time it didn't really want to do except perhaps on one occasion). The council was not a stupid body in concept, however: a regular discussion by the social partners (to use the Continental term) of the economic situation without over-ambitious ideas about trying to agree about what ought to be done would be useful, provided that all issues were open to discussion and that the basis was a previously published independent analysis, like that of the Council of Economic Advisers in Germany. NEDO was set up to provide this analysis. However it was sabotaged by the Treasury, which eventually insisted that discussions must be based on its papers and no-one else's. For a long time the TUC would not discuss pay, and when it did agree the Treasury sabotaged that, perhaps inadvertently, although I doubt it. The CBI spent a lot of its time trying to avoid accidentally agreeing with the TUC about anything. If that is corporatism it has a peculiarly ineffective form, but that is true of many British institutions. The sector committees also sometimes had delusions of grandeur. it often did useful work, but the basic concept was wrong. It should be possible for industry trade associations to talk directly to government, and these trade associations should also talk regularly to the relevant trades unions on the basis of exchange of information about what is going on and not only of negotiation. The need for intelligent communication continues to exist at industry and company level, and British institutional arrangements are conspicuous by their absence. Someone needs to see that independent mechanisms develop for these purposes. Perhaps we should now have a Council of Economic Advisers to provide an independent review of the economic situation which can be discussed without the formality of the NEDC?

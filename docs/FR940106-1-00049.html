			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following the first phase of the new hearings, the State Board in November 1988 issued a draft Plan that included revised salinity and flow standards to protect the fisheries and other designated uses. The State Board subsequently withdrew that draft Plan, however, and issued a revised workplan that served as the basis for the State Board's present Water Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (1991 Bay/Delta Plan).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the revised workplan, the State Board, on May 1, 1991, adopted State Board Resolution No. 91&hyph;34, formally approving the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. The Plan restated the specific designated uses that had been included in the 1978 Delta Plan and related regional board basin plans. As restated, the designated uses included the following: Agricultural Supply, Cold and Warm Fresh-Water Habitat, Estuarine Habitat, Fish Migration, Fish Spawning, Groundwater Recharge, Industrial Process Supply, Industrial Service Supply, Municipal and Domestic Supply, Navigation, Contact and Non-Contact Water Recreation, Ocean Commercial and Sport Fishing, Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species, Shellfish Harvesting, and Wildlife Habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan, which was submitted for EPA's review on May 29, 1991, amended certain salinity criteria and adopted new temperature and dissolved oxygen criteria for specified locations in the estuary. The changes to the criteria, however, were of minimal substance. The 1991 Bay/Delta Plan did not revise the earlier 1978 Delta Plan to address EPA's longstanding concerns about adequate protection for the designated fish and wildlife uses of the Bay/Delta.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 3, 1991, EPA approved in part and disapproved in part the provisions of the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. EPA's letter found that ``[t]he record *&blank;*&blank;* does not support the conclusion that the State has adopted criteria sufficient to protect the designated uses'' of the estuary. The designated uses at risk, as defined by the State Board, include Estuarine Habitat, and also Cold and Warm Water Habitat, Fish Migration, Fish Spawning, Ocean Commercial and Sport Fishing, Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species, Shellfish Harvesting, and Wildlife Habitat. In addition to its general finding that the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan did not contain sufficient criteria to protect the designated uses, EPA also disapproved the absence of salinity standards to protect fish and wildlife uses in the Suisun, San Pablo, and San Francisco Bays and Suisun Marsh, the absence of scientifically supportable salinity standards (measured by electrical conductivity) to protect the Fish Spawning uses of the lower San Joaquin River, and the absence of scientifically supportable temperature standards on the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers to protect the fall-run and winter-run chinook salmon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 303(c)(3) of the Act, the State Board had 90 days to make changes to the criteria disapproved by EPA in its September 3, 1991 letter. The State Board made no such revisions during the 90 day period or at any subsequent time. However, in the summer of 1992, the State Board, at the request of the Governor of the State of California, held hearings for the purpose of establishing interim measures to protect the natural resources in the Bay/Delta estuary. In keeping with the CWA's recognition that the states have primary responsibility for setting water quality standards, EPA participated in these hearings_rather than proposing federal standards at that time_in the hope that the hearings would result in state adoption of approvable standards and preclude the need for a federal rulemaking. EPA submitted opening and closing statements to the State Board, and joined with NMFS and USFWS in submitting an Interagency Statement of Principles. These statements recommended that the State Board adopt a habitat and ecosystem-based approach to standards that would satisfy CWA requirements and meet the State Board's goal of reversing the decline of the estuary's fish and wildlife resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the conclusion of these hearings, the State Board, on December 10, 1992, issued its recommended interim measures in Draft Water Rights Decision (hereinafter D&hyph;1630). The Draft contained new water export limits and pumping restrictions and ordered ``pulse flows'' to help transport young migratory fish through the Delta. It also imposed water conservation measures on agricultural and urban users, and established a restoration fund financed by user fees to pay for conservation efforts in the Bay/Delta. Although D&hyph;1630 proposed several changes in the operation of the water facilities affecting the estuary that would be beneficial to its natural resources, EPA informed the State Board in its comments dated January 13, 1993, that D&hyph;1630, if adopted, would not satisfy the requirements of the Act. EPA noted that D&hyph;1630, a proposed water rights decision, did not purport to revise the State's water quality standards at all, and therefore did not affect EPA's prior decision disapproving the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. Moreover, EPA noted that the measures in D&hyph;1630 were not tied to specific designated uses in the estuary (including the Estuarine Habitat, Fish Spawning, and Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species uses), and that no attempt had been made to assure that the designated uses would be protected. Accordingly, EPA found that D&hyph;1630 ``meets neither the procedural nor the substantive requirements of the Clean Water Act.'' After the close of the comment period for D&hyph;1630, the State Board, in response to a subsequent request by the Governor, declined to adopt D&hyph;1630.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the State Board's failure to revise the criteria disapproved in EPA's September 3, 1991 letter, EPA, pursuant to section 303 (c)(3) and (c)(4) of the Act, is proposing regulations establishing revised water quality criteria which would in effect supersede and supplement the disapproved State criteria for purposes of the CWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Greek reshuffle paves way for austerity MR Michael Papaconstantinou, the Greek justice minister, yesterday took over as foreign minister in a cabinet reshuffle. For the past four months, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, has been handling foreign affairs himself. The prime minister also appointed his daughter, Mrs Dora Bakoyannis, as under-secretary to the premier's office with responsibility for co-ordinating government activity. Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister, was given the Finance Ministry as well, in a move intended to speed economic reform. In a first statement, Mr Manos announced a tough package of measures designed to increase revenues and bring the country in line with its European Community partners. He announced sharp tax increases on bank deposits and fuel and the abolition of Greece's 36 per cent value added tax. 'Parliament last week approved the Maastricht treaty. We said yes to Europe. . . the ticket for Maastricht must be paid now,' Mr Manos said. The ticket, he said, was an economic convergence plan designed to bring the country's economy in line with its 11 EC partners. The new measures will set the stage for the plan, to be submitted for parliamentary approval in October. They include raising taxes on bank deposits from 10 to 15 per cent from September and a 33 per cent rise in fuel prices from today. VAT on raw materials and industrial equipment is to be raised, from 8 to 18 per cent, while the top rate of 36 per cent on items such as electronic consumer goods, tobacco and alcohol was abolished in line with new EC VAT levels. An 8 per cent VAT will also be added to water bills for the first time. Mr Manos said the price increases were expected to bring in revenues of about Drs650bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in 1992. He said the price increases would halt the declining trend in inflation, which is currently around 15 per cent. The government's target was 13.5 per cent for 1992. The Greek parliament yesterday passed a bill privatising the strike-bound state-owned Athens bus company. The bill dissolved the Urban Transport Company (EAS) and gave its buses to a group of private owners. Some 6,000 EAS employees have been on strike for two weeks protesting against a decision to cut 1,200 jobs to reduce the company's debt.</p>

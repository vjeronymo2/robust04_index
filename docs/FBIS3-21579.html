Konstantin Zatulin told a news conference in Almaty, where  he  had been monitoring the parliamentary elections as an  international observer, that Russia and Kazakhstan were going to  enter into a treaty on the further use of Baykonur. The  document was due to be signed by the two countries' presidents  in Moscow on March 30, he said.    Commenting on a meeting he had with Kazakh Deputy Prime  Minister Yerik Asanbayev, Zatulin said Kazakhstan's leadership  preferred not to bring up the dual citizenship issue, but that  the next parliament might consider giving Russian the status of  an official language.</p>

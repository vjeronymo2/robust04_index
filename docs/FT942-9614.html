			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness speculation There were contradictory stories in Guinness, with turnover reaching 5.5m shares, and the share price shading 2 to 496p. Some traders suggested that the drinks group was delivering a bearish message of tough trading conditions to institutional shareholders ahead of its agm on Thursday. However, others in the market were predicting a different outcome, pointing to the expected recovery in the Spanish beer market, as well as better news on spirits sales. There was also speculation that LVMH, Guinness's French partner, may be about to unload the 4 per cent of Guinness shares it has agreed to sell as part of the two groups' recent restructuring agreement - although the deadline to do this is not until June 1995. A stronger US dollar and a rise in the price of Brent crude lifted oil stocks. BP was helped further by an upbeat presentation to analysts and rose 2 to 406p. Enterprise gained 2 to 431p as the market studied the defence document responding to its hostile bid for Lasmo. Lasmo was very heavily traded, closing 2 off at 154p with volume reaching 16m. Newspaper stocks were boosted by a well-received trading statement from the Telegraph and the annual meeting at Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, which both cited the upturn in advertising. Telegraph shares gained 9 to 620p and thinly-traded Daily Mail Trust improved 37 to 1465p in the ordinaries. However profit-taking saw Pearson ease back 5 to 673p. Mining group RTZ gained 10 to 858p on the continued rise in the price of copper and other base metals on world markets. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome jumped 7 to 586p in response to a positive medical journal report. An article in The Lancet, the UK medical industry journal, said a treatment associated with the company reduced the death rate and recurrence rate for patients with a form of cancer. Participation in a big sell programme said to have been carried out by US investment bank Goldman Sachs and a couple of badly handled sell orders hit Lloyds Bank which fell 10 to 567p. Rolls-Royce gave up 7 to 182p, after trade of 5.1m, on fears that sales of spare parts were below expectations. Further selling came from SG Warburg which advised investors to switch out of Rolls and into British Aerospace. BAe eased 7 to 503p on light profit-taking after its strong run earlier this week, which followed a two-day visit by analysts to the group's defence operations. Sentiment was also boosted by speculation that BAe had won a lucrative order to re-fit the Tornado fighter aircraft. Instrumentation and project engineering company Whessoe tumbled 35 after reporting a fall in interim profits and saying it is unlikely there will be an improvement in its performance in the short term. News that the recovery in west European car demand was faltering hit several automotive-related stocks. These included dealers T Cowie, which shed 8 to 300p and Lex Service, down 11 at 502p. There was good volume in Cable and Wireless as dealers reported a large line of stock in the market. Turnover was just short of 7m, with the shares sliding 5 to 455p. Bredero Properties retreated 4 1/2 to 10 1/2 p after announcing an agreed takeover by Slough Estates, up 8 at 248p. Slough, which offered 10p a share, already owns 49.5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Bredero.</p>

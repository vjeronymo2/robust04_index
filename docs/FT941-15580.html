			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Temporary reprieve for Elstree Studios Elstree studios, birthplace of successful cinema and television productions such as Capital City, has won a temporary reprieve from demolition. Yesterday the High Court ruled that Hertsmere borough council had an arguable case for insisting that the owner, Brent Walker, keep the site open. The Hertfordshire studios, where Laurence Olivier made his screen debut, was used to make blockbusters such as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Star Wars, Superman, and the Indiana Jones adventures. Brent Walker has given an undertaking not to proceed with demolition, pending a full hearing of the council's case. The company has outline planning permission to develop half the site as a retail superstore. Last year it announced that the studios complex on the other half would close because it was under-used. But the council says it was a planning condition that the area would be kept for film and TV production until 2015.</p>

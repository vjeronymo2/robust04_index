			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses stage rally before bonds show weakness Bourses rallied at the outset as they caught up with the renewed strength of the dollar against the D-Mark, and of Wall Street ahead of the weekend; but some of them, particularly France, were unable to withstand weakness in bonds later in the day, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT held up quite well considering the afternoon weakness in bunds, and in bund futures. After a 32.61 or 1.6 per cent jump in the Dax index to 2,071.12 on the session, the Ibis indicated Dax closed 24.88 or 1.2 per cent higher at 2,067.26 after hours. There was some popular support for banks ahead of their 10-month results, but the sector did not hold on to all of its gains in the afternoon; in fact, the high flyer in financials was the insurer, Allianz, up DM56 to DM2,496 at the end of the day. To Mr Adrian Phillips, who heads the German analysis team at Kleinwort Benson, this suggested that traders, rather than investors, were taking the initiative. Carmakers did well, although there seemed a tendency to offer German industrials in sizeable lots: BMW put on DM10.90 at DM760.50, and Daimler DM13.90 at DM752.50; Volkswagen improved over the day, ending DM6 higher at DM422.50, after last week's 8 per cent drop which followed the release of disappointing 1995 profits targets in the group's latest five-year plan. Turnover rose from around DM4bn to DM5bn. Other stocks stayed out of favour. Henkel, the chemicals group which owns the Persil brand name in Europe outside the UK and France, lost another DM5.30 to close at a new 1994 low of DM532.70, after a meeting nearly two weeks ago which has since led some analysts to revise their projections. PARIS broke briefly through the 2,000 barrier in the CAC-40 index before losing momentum in the last hour of trading as profits were taken. The index ended the day 9.06 lower at 1,973.65, after a high of 2,003.19. Turnover was FFr3.6bn. Last week the French market made a strong forward move, largely on technical activity, closing at its highest level for nearly three months. James Capel, in a technical analysis of the CAC-40, suggested that the current rally, which began around the start of November, was likely to meet resistance at 2,040. The broker's analysts Ms Deborah Boys and Mr Robin Griffiths remarked that the rally had been more broadly based than in other European bourses. Corporate stories were sparse. Carrefour lost ground as profits were booked following recent strength, and the shares dipped FFr51 to FFr2,234. Elsewhere, some brokers suggested that funds were being switched from Total to Elf Aquitaine, as the former retreated FFr3.60 to FFr331.90 and the latter rose FFr5.70 to FFr387.40. AMSTERDAM tracked strength elsewhere, and the AEX index moved forward 3.34 to 413.35. Two issues stood out: Ahold, on good third-quarter results; and Pakhoed, as news of a French acquisition was well received. The former, an international supermarket and retail group, saw a 25 per cent gain in earnings, helped by an improvement in trading conditions in the US, Portugal and the Netherlands. The company said that the results would have been even better had it not been for dollar weakness. The shares settled at the session's high of Fl 53.50, a gain of 70 cents. Pakhoed, the oil and storage company, rose Fl 2.00 to Fl 46.70 as it announced that it was to take an immediate 66 per cent stake in Lambert Riviere, the French chemicals distributor, and to launch a public offer for the remaining stock early in the new year. ZURICH looked to firm futures to support the cash market, and the SMI index rose 33.5 or 1.3 per cent to 2,611.0. Hopes that bond markets would remain firm helped insurers, which are heavily invested in fixed rate bonds. Zurich rose SFr19 to SFr1,262, Swiss Re picked up SFr6 to SFr773 and Winterthur was SFr7 higher at SFr637. Bearer shares in Berner, a medium sized insurer, rose SFr70 or 5.3 per cent to SFr1,390 amid renewed talk that Germany's Allianz, which already owns 30 per cent, might raise its stake. Roche certificates advanced SFr115 to SFr5,850: dealers noted that BZW had advised clients to take profits in Swedish Astra, and switch into Roche. MILAN was unmoved by political developments and the Comit index eased 1.65 to 629.80 in very low volume of about L300bn, with the banking sector again providing one of the few areas of activity. Credito Romagnolo rose L267 or 1.6 per cent to L17,429 in response to the improved offer of L20,000 a share from Credito Italiano for up to 65 per cent of the shares. Italiano firmed L7 to L1,633. Some analysts were doubtful about local newspaper speculation suggesting that Rolo might face a counter-bid from Cariplo. Olivetti fell L36 or 1.9 per cent to L1,886 and Cir, its fellow De Benedetti group company, receded L35 to L1,786. Both are shareholders in Rolo, and the declines suggested disappointment that Italiano's bid had not matched early forecasts in the L21,000 to L23,000 range. Ras moved ahead L376 or 2.5 per cent to L15,546 amid buying linked to its rights issue which is currently in progress. BRUSSELS was more concerned with constituents of the Bel-20 than with the index itself, which gained a tame 4.61 at 1,413.63. The biggest rise of the day was in the steelmaker Cockerill Sambre, which ended BFr6 or 3.0 per cent higher at BFr203, not far short of its BFr215 peak for the year. On Friday, Cockerill will replace Gevaert in the Bel-20. Gevaert fell BFr48 or 3.2 per cent to BFr1,424 as investors dropped the holding company from their portfolios.

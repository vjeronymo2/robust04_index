			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE ALL LOVED LUCY  </P> <P> Generations of Americans loved Lucy. More than three decades ago, in the  adolescence of television, Monday nights belonged to Lucille Ball as she  schemed to do what she wanted to do, especially if her husband and "I Love  Lucy" co-star Desi Arnaz didn't want her to do it. All these decades later,  there is a national outburst of affection and remembrance for the 77-year-old  comedienne who died Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  </P> <P> In the main, the outpouring of sentiment focuses on this zany redhead's  do-anything nerve. Her comedy centered on everybody's everyday foibles and  everyday joys -- everything from getting in trouble because of bragging to  craving pickles while pregnant.  </P> <P> Those who may not have especially enjoyed her mugging style of comedy had to  appreciate her business sense that kept her at the forefront of the production  side of the industry long after the door closed on her TV series and on her  marriage to Arnaz as well.  </P> <P> Lucille Ball was the last of the quartet that brought the Ricardos and the  Mertzes into our homes. They were our neighbors, too, and our entertainment.  They made us laugh.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing (CEIS) -- Chinese authorities are working  out detailed provisions governing the transfer of equity in  state-owned enterprises to foreign investors, according to a  senior official.    In selling off the country's state-owned enterprises to  foreigners, Yu Xiaosong, vice minister of the State Economic and  Trade Commission, said recently that limitation should be  imposed in two areas.    One is that asset evaluation must be conducted by a  qualified  evaluation organization before a state-owned enterprise is to  transfer part or all of its equities to a foreign investor,  which is a new form for China to attract foreign direct  investments.    Yu said such evaluation is necessary as there is not yet a  fair and scientific method.    The other aspect concerns whether or not one or a group of  foreign investors is allowed to buy all stakes or a holding  stake in a Chinese state-owned enterprise.    And this depends on the status and function of the  enterprise  in China's national economy, yu added.    Such takeovers are not proper for important large  state-owned  enterprises, a large power plant for instance, which will  trigger such problems as electricity supply, charges and  production capacity, Yu said.    Yu said the Chinese partner's stake in a large state  enterprise must be higher than 50 percent regardless of the  number of shareholders in the enterprise.</p>

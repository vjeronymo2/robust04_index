			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / The recovery is now near worldwide There is now strong evidence that recovery is worldwide. It started in North America, where it has already reached the margins of safety, then spread to devaluing European countries and is now reaching hard-currency countries such as Germany and France. Japan is the most doubtful prospect; but even here there are signs that the economy is slowly adapting to the over-valued yen by domestic demand expansion and even more stringent cost-control by exporters. The developing countries, which in previous cycles danced to the tune of the older industrial world, are now a sustaining force. They did not experience the last recession and are now growing at twice the rate of the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Indeed, the OECD has revised its projections upwards for the first time since 1991. Oxford Economic Forecasting, in a more up-to-date comprehensive survey, has higher projections still. The surprise element has been the strength of continental Europe, especially Germany. While at the start of the year many analysts were expecting no growth at all in that country, OEF is now projecting all-German growth to be 2.2 per cent in 1994, rising to 2.9 per cent in 1995. Forecasts are merely a way of articulating present indications; and OEF is very frank that its revised view is based on 'glowing widespread survey evidence across the European continent', especially industrial confidence and production expectations. The present business cycle has much in common with that of the 1980s. Each downturn has engendered a desperate belief that the world has entered a long-term depression phase; then there have been mutterings that recovery will not create new jobs; and finally concerns about inflationary overheating have re-emerged. It is, of course, nonsense to disconnect output and jobs. Unless newly employed workers produce nothing or negative amounts the two must go together. Unemployment has fallen in the US and the UK, where output has been rising briskly; and the OECD expects it to level off in Europe as growth returns to trend. In the Group of Seven countries, total demand in cash terms - measured by nominal gross domestic product - is now growing by about 5 per cent a year. Because of surplus capacity and associated competitive pressures, the inflation rate in these countries has fallen back to 2 per cent, leaving room for normal growth plus modest catch-up of about 3 per cent. So long as nominal demand in the main countries grows at about 5 per cent a year, the world economy is largely self-correcting and unlikely to experience an inflationary take-off or a spiralling depression. Demand growth did, however, dip perilously low in the last recession. In 1993 it was only 4.1 per cent in the G7 countries. In Germany demand growth was 2 1/2 per cent and in France 1 1/2 per cent. Sound money economists could perfectly reasonably warn about demand deficiency last year, as they did at a corresponding point in the 1980s. At what stage does the risk flip over to being one of excess demand leading to renewed inflation? Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, mentioned three contingencies in which interest rates might have to be raised at his June 8 meeting with Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. The first was 'if the pace of activity picked up more rapidly'. The second was 'if cost increases threatened the prospect for prices a year or two ahead'. Third, and more implicitly, he might want to tighten policy if the growth of M0 did not decelerate in the coming months. Nevertheless, the governor's standpoint could be guyed as saying: 'Shoot it if it moves.' The latest flash indicator for the second quarter does indeed show UK output rising fairly briskly - 2.7 per cent for non-oil GDP in the year up to the second quarter. (The North Sea oil sector is part of the economy, but it is so erratic that output trends are best measured without it.) Indeed, non-oil GDP has only just passed its 1990 peak. If capacity has been growing at a normal rate, this suggests that the margin of slack is now about 10 per cent - surely more than the safety level. All the indicators the governor mentioned do, indeed, need to be monitored and many more. But some framework, such as nominal GDP, or nominal domestic expenditure, is required to put them together and provide appropriate weights. Otherwise, he will be playing into the hands of the bond-market commentators who want to resolve all doubts in favour of tightening policy.</p>

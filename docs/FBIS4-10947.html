			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with AD/M-19 presidential candidate Antonio </F> Navarro by Bibiana Mercado; place and date not given]    [Text] Is Navarro in check, now that the M-19 Democratic  Alliance (AD/M-19) has been defeated in parliamentary elections?  Is there a threat to the reintegrated guerrilla groups'  participation in democracy? Why choose an Indian as a running  mate? Antonio Navarro answered these and other questions for EL  TIEMPO.    Despite the recent electoral defeat, the AD/M-19  presidential  candidate, who registered his candidacy under the name of  Commitment Colombia after including Paez Indian Jesus Pinacue on  his ticket as the vice presidential candidate, is confident that  the results of 29 May will favor him.    "The presidential vote involves more freedom, more opinion,  and less coercion and patronage than the parliamentary  elections," he explains.    In addition, he announced that the campaign will enter a new  phase. He will switch from the whistle stops at small towns,  where he signed nearly 160 commitments to the community, to  appearances in the plazas of major cities, always accompanied by  Pinacue. He will launch a publicity campaign that he says will  be very original.    [Mercado] Is AD/M-19 still the decisive political force  destined to disrupt the pattern of liberal-conservative voting?    [Navarro] Let us put things in the proper terms. There are a  number of candidacies: Samper's, Pastrana's, Navarro's...I am  certain that on 29 May we will come in third in the voting, and  we will be decisive in the presidential election.    [Mercado] Why are prominent members of your organization  deserting?    [Navarro] We must speak in the singular. The only member of  parliament who has said he is leaving AD/M-19 is Gustavo Petro,  and I hope to keep him with us. The others are in AD, and so far  they have not said they are leaving.    [Mercado] Is it not true that the inclusion in your program  of Pedro Bonnet, Mario Laserna, and Samuel Moreno, who were  elected with "M" votes and then left the organization, deprived  AD of votes?    [Navarro] It is possible, but the fact that it did not  present a clear and coherent option to the electorate deprived  it of even more votes. The excessive number of lists, without  any that managed to make an impact on public opinion, took away  more votes.    [Mercado] Name four points in your platform that distinguish  you from Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana.    [Navarro] First, our genuine interest and proven experience  in the area of peace. No one has the experience or the vocation  for peace that we have. Second, it appears that the  anticorruption theme has gone out of style in Samper's and  Pastrana's candidacies. This is a central issue, and we are  going to launch an "Operation Clean Hands" to put corrupt  people, no matter who they are, in jail. Third, social justice.  We have felt the impact of social inequality directly and  personally.    The fact that Jesus Pinacue is on our team represents the  need for a social rule of law that is practicable, with a major  investment in social programs and changes in the structure of  society. Fourth, we are adamantly opposed to the economic  liberalization as it has been implemented in the neoliberal  style.    [Mercado] Some say you have brought Jesus Pinacue on board  as  the last vestige of hope for salvaging M-19 from the crisis....    [Navarro] As Pinacue has said, "Do you think we Indians are  still children who allow ourselves to be manipulated?" That is  the best possible response. Pinacue is responding to an  organization that is mature and makes the right decisions.    On the other hand, we are honoring the Constitution of 1991,  which said that this Colombia was for everyone. Pinacue  represents the human face of this country, the silent voice of  millions of Colombians, and the values that have been outlined.    [Mercado] What do you think of Samper's and Pastrana's vice  presidential candidates?    [Navarro] That they add absolutely nothing to the ticket,  because they are nothing new. It is like saying, "I am running  with myself."    [Mercado] What did the defeat of 13 March teach you?    [Navarro] That we must listen to the voice of the citizens,  who are telling us we are not doing things right. We must make a  course change, and we are doing that, among other things,  accepting the need for a clear profile and a definite message of  change.    [Mercado] Will the message of change involve urging people  to  cast blank ballots in case there is a second round of voting and  you do not make the cut?    [Navarro] If I agreed with the idea of casting blank  ballots,  I would not have entered the race for the presidency of the  Republic.    Casting blank ballots is faceless, ownerless; if it had an  owner, it would not be a blank ballot. I think it is simply a  passive position.    [Mercado] Are you willing to negotiate with Samper or  Pastrana in the second round, if you are defeated in the first?  Are your votes endorsable?    [Navarro] We have free and secret balloting, and people  decide how they are going to vote. The decision regarding a  possible agreement will have to be made by the people  accompanying me in that process, not by me.    What I can state categorically is that the commitments we  have signed with more than 200 municipalities will be honored.    If anyone can fulfill them, they will be fulfilled. After  that, the decision we make will be absolutely clear.    [Mercado] What is the message that came through to you the  loudest after the recent electoral defeat?    [Navarro] That of Orlando Fals Borda. He called me and told  me, "Antonio, you have a duty to show some balls. Stick to your  guns."    [Mercado] Are you not afraid that AD/M-19 will cease to  exist?    [Navarro] I think no one ceases to exist here. The Popular  National Alliance (ANAPO) revived after 20 years; the  Revolutionary Independent Worker Movement (MOIR) won a  senatorial seat; the Communist Party is still alive, in spite of  thousands of deaths.    I am certain that AD will remain alive. What we must  understand, in my view, is that we have to go into the local  elections with a lot of strength.    [Mercado] But you said that AD had gotten confused engaging  in traditional politics. Are you a traditional politician?    [Navarro] I am not even a politician in the sense that most  people understand the term; much less traditional. I shun that.  I prefer any other barbarity.    [Mercado] What room do you think is left for the guerrillas  and the peace processes, now that a demobilized group has been  defeated so thoroughly?    [Navarro] I think that peace is still good, beneficial,  necessary, and that whether or not we have a seat in the Senate,  we in the AD are still at peace. I think we cannot turn our  backs on peace just because we suffered a defeat.</p>

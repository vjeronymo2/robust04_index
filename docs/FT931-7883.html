			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / A flawed drive for fairness I was among the first to criticise Lord (then Mr Nigel) Lawson's 1988 Budget which sharply cut British top rates of tax. So I should be madly applauding President Bill Clinton's 'soak the rich' economic package. Yet the crude emphasis on fairness - the selling of the plan as virtuous simply because the affluent are bearing most of the burden - leaves me cold. It is a bit of a cheek coming from Mr Clinton's elite economic team, many of whom got very rich during the now-despised 1980s. Mr Clinton is demanding that the top 2 per cent of families - those with incomes of Dollars 200,000 or more - finance nearly 60 per cent of the total tax increase, which means increases averaging nearly Dollars 15,000 a year. The rest of the top 10 per cent face much lower but still stiff increases. The bottom 90 per cent is barely touched, with increases ranging from nil for families with incomes less than Dollars 30,000 to a few hundred dollars for the near-affluent. The president is proving a marvellous salesman. Yet his cosy sessions with schoolchildren are beginning to get irritating. He projects the image of the 'philosopher king' who knows everything, yet his depiction of the 'greedy' 1980s is decidedly one-dimensional. Mr Clinton argues that the sharp drop in top income tax rates - from 70 per cent to 28 per cent - was a boon for the wealthy. What he fails to mention is that the rate paid on the last dollar of income bears little relation to the overall tax burden. The point about the tax reforms of the 1980s is that they balanced cuts in tax rates (which affect people's incentive to work or save) with restrictions on the loopholes and special concessions that favoured the wealthy. The upshot was little change in 'effective tax rates' - the ratio of all federal taxes (including social security contributions) to incomes. The poorest 20 per cent of families paid 8.5 per cent of their incomes in tax in 1991 compared with 8.4 per cent in 1980; the richest 20 per cent paid 26.8 per cent rather than 27.3 per cent. The very affluent did gain: the effective rate on the top 1 per cent fell to 28.9 per cent against 31.8 per cent in 1980, but the decline was modest relative to the plunge in the top marginal rate. The stability of effective rates reflected Democratic control of Congress. The contribution of affluent families to total revenues actually rose substantially during the 1980s because their share of national pre-tax income rose sharply, more than compensating for the minor decline in their effective tax rates. The shift in pre-tax income shares partly reflected underlying trends such as a decline in the relative pay of unskilled workers but a behaviourial response to lower tax rates was also a factor. As Mr Clinton will shortly discover, the affluent have great discretion over how much income they chose to declare; if rates are high they may, for example, take pay in the form of untaxed fringe benefits. They can also choose how long and hard to work; if rates go up, the golf course becomes relatively more alluring. However distasteful it may seem, the big decline in top tax rates in the 1980s squeezed more, rather than less, tax dollars from the very rich. Inequality statistics are not straightforward. The average income of the bottom 20 per cent has undeniably fallen in recent years. But the families falling into this category constantly change. The Urban Institute, a Washington thinktank, tracked families that formed the bottom 20 per cent in 1977. Surprisingly their incomes had risen 77 per cent by 1986, reflecting the fact that nearly half had moved into higher income groups. The incomes of families in the top 20 per cent in 1977 rose only 5 per cent - half had dropped into lower income brackets over the same period. This mobility is not surprising: for example, when students leave college they move into higher income brackets whereas when senior executives retire they move down a few notches. Taxes should be related to people's ability to pay. But the practicality of trying to raise so much revenue from the top 2 per cent is questionable, especially when the technique employed is a sharp increase in the top marginal rate from 31 per cent to about 45 per cent, allowing for the 'millionaire's surcharge' (which applies to taxable incomes over Dollars 250,000), the lifting of caps on Medicare taxes and other changes. An attempt to broaden the tax base by eliminating perks, such as the deductibility of up to Dollars 1m in mortgage interest, would have made more economic sense. The affluent have never paid particularly high effective rates of tax, if only because they can afford the best legal advice. Historically, high top rates were mainly a cover for lower, but substantial, tax increases on more numerous middle income families. But Mr Clinton has blown this opportunity; he is demanding so little from middle income groups that he lacks the resources both to increase public investment and decisively reduce the budget deficit, which is expected to be still nearly 3 per cent of national income in 1997. If, as is likely, revenues from the affluent prove disappointing, his 'fairness' drive will have been entirely in vain.</p>

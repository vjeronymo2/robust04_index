			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) and his Spanish counterpart  Julian Garcia Vargas have expressed their "determination" to  force down the price of the planned European fighter. Following  talks with Vargas, Ruehe told journalists in Bonn today that  both sides agreed that further savings have to be made relating  to the cost of the aircraft.    Ruehe confirmed that Germany and Spain will need a new  fighter in the year 2002. The estimated price of each aircraft  is now about 102 million German marks. This is "still too  high," Ruehe said. Alongside Germany and Spain, the fighter is  also being developed by Italy and France. Vargas stressed that  the aircraft must also be competitive on the world market.    According to the ministers, a Spanish armored brigade will  be  the first Spanish unit ever to take part in a Eurocorps exercise  this year. The ministers also talked about the Partnership for  Peace concept adopted by NATO with the Central and East European  countries and the CIS states. In this regard, Ruehe referred to  the Bundeswehr maneuver planned with Poland and Denmark in the  Baltic Sea, while Vargas talked of Spain's intensive contacts  with Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria.

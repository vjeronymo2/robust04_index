Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> A. Purpose and Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for environmental regulatory enhancement projects. Approximately $3 million of financial assistance is anticipated to be available under this announcement for environmental regulatory enhancement projects. ANA expects to award approximately 35 grants under this competitive area. The funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $250,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Despite an increasing environmental responsibility and growing awareness of environmental issues on Indian lands, there has been a lack of resources available to tribes to develop tribal environmental programs that are responsive to tribal needs. In many cases, this lack of resources has resulted in a delay in action on the part of the tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the critical issues identified by tribes before Congressional committees include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The need for assistance to train professional staff to monitor and enforce tribal environmental programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The lack of adequate data for tribes to develop environmental statutes and establish environmental quality standards; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The lack of resources to conduct studies to identify sources of pollution and the ability to determine the impact on existing environmental quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, Congress enacted the Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;408) to strengthen tribal governments through building capacity within the tribes in order to identify, plan, develop, and implement environmental programs in a manner that is consistent with tribal culture. ANA is to support these activities on a government-to-government basis in a way that recognizes tribal sovereignty and is consistent with tribal culture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administration for Native Americans believes that responsibility for achieving environmental regulatory enhancement rests with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and with the leadership of Native American groups.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

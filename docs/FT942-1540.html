			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (5): Uphill battle for investors - The south's bid to attract foreign companies South Korea is on the hunt for foreign investment and technology. The rapid rise in wages since 1988 means it can no longer compete as a low-cost manufacturing centre. Compared with the Philippines, Vietnam and China, costs are high. Instead, South Korea must compete in high-technology areas. But although the country is now one of the leading manufacturers in the shipbuilding and automotive sectors, its technological base remains weak. Korean companies, on average, spend only 3 per cent of turnover on R&amp;D, compared with about 7 per cent among their western counterparts. The government is also anxious to attract investment from foreign companies, particularly Japanese component manufacturers. South Korea runs a hefty trade deficit with Japan, mostly caused by imports of sophisticated machine tools and automotive components. But the hunt for foreign investment and technology is proving an uphill battle. Foreign investment in South Korea has fallen in recent years. Investment by Japanese companies fell from a peak of Dollars 697m in 1988 to only Dollars 155m in 1992, rising to Dollars 286m last year. European investment peaked at Dollars 824m in 1991 and fell to only Dollars 307m last year. The reason is that South Korea has a poor reputation as a location for foreign investment. A recent report by Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy, the Hong Kong-based group which canvassed opinions of 95 corporate managers and bankers, was damning of South Korea's attractions. The study suggested South Korea: was the most nationalistic country in Asia; was the most bureaucratic after China and Indonesia; had an economy dominated by cartels and state-owned companies; discriminated more than any other nation against foreign investment; was the most protectionist nation in Asia; had the highest potential for labour unrest; and had a greater potential for social unrest even than China. However, companies operating in South Korea believe there are two main obstacles hindering foreign investment - labour and tax. Foreign investors have been concerned both by the high cost of labour as well as the number of industrial disputes. Admittedly, the latter has fallen by nearly three-quarters since the peak of 1988, but the legacy remains. 'Many Japanese companies were put off by the bitter experience of trade disputes a few years ago,' says Mr Yoshiaki Onuki, chairman of the Japanese Association in Seoul. 'Although the number of disputes has fallen, labour is still a problem. Pay is at a very high level. Japanese companies in Seoul pay their workers, on average, Won3m a month, compared with an average of Won900,000 in non-Japanese companies. Retirement costs are double those in our Tokyo headquarters,' he says. The other main problem facing foreign companies is the National Tax Authority. This body, working under the finance ministry, has recently launched investigations into as many as 25 European and US companies operating in South Korea. Huge tax bills have been imposed on some, leading to complaints that the measures were retroactive - dating back up to five years - and less than transparent. 'The economic co-operation bureau at the finance ministry is saying 'invest here, all is sweetness and light', but the tax authority is imposing five years' worth of retroactive taxes together with penalties and interest that wipe out your profits. It's ludicrous,' says the chief executive of a European multinational. Japanese companies have also been affected by an iniquitous tax regime, says Mr Yoshiaki Onuki, director general of the Korean subsidiary of Mitsui, the Japanese trading group. 'Most of the Japanese banks and trading houses are losing money in South Korea. But the tax authorities then impose taxes on what they think you ought to be making. You end up making unexpected losses,' he says. Other issues include the high cost of land. Mr Byong-Seok Chang, president of Sony Electronics of Korea, explains that land near Seoul costs about Dollars 200 for 3.3 sq metres. That compares with Dollars 85 in Taiwan and Dollars 55 in Malaysia, while in Singapore the same space rents at Dollars 30 a year and at Dollars 15 in China, near Beijing. Intellectual property is another concern. 'South Koreans are reputed to cheat on intellectual property. That reputation may lag reality, but it remains,' says a European businessman. Mr Duck-Koo Chung, director general of the economic co-operation bureau at the finance ministry, insists the intellectual property problems have been resolved. Nevertheless, western and Japanese groups are concerned that by setting up joint ventures and offering technology transfer, they may give away their crown jewels. Mr Onuki doubts if many Japanese component makers will invest. 'Much of the technology they own was developed with the co-operation of the Japanese car manufacturers. The latter would take a dim view of handing over that technology to the Koreans.' However, President Kim Young-sam's government is anxious to make the country more attractive for foreign investors. This month its inter-agency task force for foreign investment will announce a series of measures that continue the deregulation process, ensuring greater competition. The measures include faster approval of investment permits; more rapid approval of land purchases; special investment areas for foreign investors; easier access to short-term overseas loans; and a special tax tribunal for overseas groups. As for labour relations, Mr Chung insists the country's reputation is based on outdated attitudes - there are now fewer disputes in South Korea than in Japan. The policy of attracting investment has paid some high-profile dividends. The most significant have included the Dollars 2.1bn deal concluded by GEC Alsthom, the Franco-British consortium, for South Korea's high-speed railway, and Samsung Heavy Industries's contract with Nissan Motor of Japan to import car technology. Nevertheless, not all companies are convinced. 'Many long-established residents just do not perceive a great deal has changed,' says Mr Alan Twist, president of the EC Chamber of Commerce. 'They seem to be trying to remove disincentives, but are not providing any incentives,' complains one European businessman. 'A radical shift is required even to start catching up with Vietnam or China.' Few Japanese companies seem set to leap back into Korea. 'They need Japanese technology and management expertise, but until they sort out the main problems, I don't think there will be much interest,' says Mr Onuki. Even if such practical concerns are addressed, there remain cultural problems. 'A number of Japanese companies set up joint ventures, but there's a real difference in management styles. The Koreans take so many holidays, and they expect special bonuses all the time,' complains Mr Onuki. Others remain cynical. One European chief executive laments: 'They still want your technology. They still want your money. Then they still want you to get out.'  ------------------------------------------------------------------                 FOREIGN INVESTMENT (IN DOLLARS BN)  ------------------------------------------------------------------            1987    1988     1989    1990    1991    1992     1993  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Japan       497     697      466     236     226     155      286 US          255     284      329     317     296     379      341 Europe      210     243      212     207     824     282      307 Others      101      60       83      43      50      78      110  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Ministry of Finance  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

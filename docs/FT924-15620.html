			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Markets: Searching for a ray of bad news - Wall Street 'SOMETHING in it for everyone,' was how the pundits described yesterday's September employment report. By that they meant there was something in the figures - a decline in the national unemployment rate from 7.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent and a drop of 57,000 in non-farm payrolls - for both the Democrats and the Republicans to exploit politically. President George Bush can point to the fall in the jobless rate, and the fact the payrolls would have been higher but for the one-off impact of Hurricane Andrew and summer jobs programmes, as evidence that economic conditions are improving, albeit slowly. Governor Bill Clinton, Bush's rival for the presidency, can argue that with payrolls, average work week levels and average hourly earnings still falling, and the national jobless rate two points above its levels of four years ago, the Republicans have failed miserably in their stewardship of the economy. While the politicians were busy working out how to put the most favourable spin on the jobs figures, investors were giving them (the figures, not the politicians) an unequivocal thumbs-down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 40 points lower by midday as the markets judged the employment report in terms of what it meant for monetary policy. Before the report was released, bond prices had been rising on hopes that a bad employment number would prompt another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Although stock prices did not join the bond rally, equity investors shared the same hopes. The fact that the 57,000 drop in payrolls was about half what analysts had been forecasting, and that the decline in the unemployment rate was not anticipated at all, was seen to have dashed those hopes, however. It was this thinking that sparked the selling on stock markets yesterday. Equity investors never like bad economic news, except when it leads to an easing of credit conditions. The jobs news just was not bad enough to warrant a policy ease, or so investors judged. Yesterday's selling of stocks, however, may have been a bit premature. The Fed's key policy- making body, the Open Market Committee, assembles on Tuesday for its monthly review of economic conditions, and few on Wall Street are ruling out the possibility that the FOMC will vote at the meeting to cut rates for the 25th time in the last two years. Analysts who remain confident that the Fed will ease policy believe the Fed will take all the recent economic data, and not just the headline-grabbing employment report, into account before acting. In the past week alone there has been bad news on construction spending (down 0.8 per cent in August), consumer confidence (the Conference Board's index of confidence fell for the third straight month in September), new home sales (down 6.1 per cent in August in spite of very low mortgage rates) and from the National Association of Purchasing Management, whose index fell below 50 last month, an indication that the industrial sector is again contracting after a long period of modest expansion. Against such a gloomy background, it is no surprise that stock prices have gone nowhere in recent months. During the just-ended third quarter the Dow fell 1.4 per cent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.3 per cent. Those performances would probably have been worse were it not for the continued flood of cash into stocks. Yields on comparable fixed- income assets remain extremely low, so despite a sluggish market investors are switching into equities in search of higher returns. The story of the week among individual stocks was Sears. The retailing and financial services giant finally took the step that shareholders and analysts have been recommending for years - the company announced it was selling the bulk of its financial services interests in a demerger that is expected to raise more than Dollars 3bn in cash, money which will go towards reducing Sears' debt load. Sears stock climbed sharply on the news, and the restructuring was initially well received by shareholders who had long argued that the poor performance of the retailing side was depressing the market valuation of the company's much more successful financial services businesses. By the end of the week, however, Sears shares had given up nearly half of their initial gains on concern that the plan to spin-off a large part of the financial services operations would not raise enough money to make the retailing business a significantly stronger competitor. Monday      3276.26 + 25.94 Tuesday     3266.80 - 09.46 Wednesday   3271.37 + 04.86 Thursday    3254.37 - 17.29 Friday      3200.61 - 53.76</p>

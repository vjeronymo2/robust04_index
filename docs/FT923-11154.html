			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / The Week Ahead - Economics: CBI data threaten more gloom WITH few sensitive figures out in the UK, this week could see some reprieve from last week's financial jitters. But the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey is likely to add to mounting gloom over the economy. The last survey was optimistic about prospects for manufacturers later this year, with business optimism showing its biggest jump in four years. Another jump would be a welcome signal but movements in the optimism index have been jagged over the past few months and seasonal factors could adversely affect the latest results. Most of the activity this week is in the US. On Thursday, GDP figures are expected to show that the US recovery struggled to keep going in the second quarter. The forecast is for growth of 1.7 per cent, almost a full percentage point lower than growth in the first quarter. Consumer confidence is also expected to have declined this month, in spite of the Federal Reserve's discount rate cut three weeks ago. Since the beginning of the year, the consumer confidence index has jumped from 50.2 per cent to 71.1 per cent in June. Most of the increase was between January and April, since when it has shown little change. Here are some of the other economic highlights. The figures in brackets, from MMS International, are the median of economists' forecasts. Today: US, June existing home sales, housing vacancies for the second quarter; Japan, June retail sales (down 0.7 per cent on the year). Tomorrow: UK, CBI quarterly industrial trends survey; US, employment cost index second quarter (up 0.8 per cent on quarter), July consumer confidence (70 per cent); Japan, June industrial production (up 1 per cent), service price index second quarter.

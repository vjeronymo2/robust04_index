The agreement represents the first significant investment by a western commercial bank in an existing Polish banking institution. Earlier this year the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development took a 28.5 per cent share in the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, the first bank to be privatised under the government's programme. The Bank Slaski, based in Katowice in Poland's industrial heartland, has nearly 60 branches and a balance sheet worth 27,669bn zlotys (Dollars 1.32bn) at the beginning of this year. Its loan portfolio is weighted towards the chemical, steel and coal mining industries. The price of the equity is expected to reflect the figure of 500,000 zlotys per share at which the 30.1 per cent of the bank's 9,260,000 shares were offered last month to small investors.</p>

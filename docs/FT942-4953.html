			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet may raise Pounds 75m from property disposals The upturn in the property market has prompted Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, to put 28 development and investment properties up for sale. The portfolio, which is expected to fetch about Pounds 75m, mostly consists of properties that are no longer used by GrandMet businesses. The portfolio includes three Oxford Street buildings, including a building occupied by Virgin Megastore, close to Tottenham Court Road, which used to house the Sportsmans Club casino. Mr Bob Williams, chairman and managing director of Grand Metropolitan Estates said that the sale was in line with the group's strategy of concentrating on its core food and drinks business. The portfolio covers shops, offices, industrial properties and development sites situated around the country and includes the former Truman Brewery in London's Brick Lane.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Arts: Deserved encore by a master myth-maker - Television ASTONISHINGLY, Edgar Reitz has done it again. In April 1986, BBC2 brought us his 11-part series Heimat, one of the few real masterpieces of television fiction. With Maria Simon as its central character, it told the story of the inhabitants of Schabbach, a village in the Hunsruck area of Germany, between 1919 and 1982. In the process it conveyed the story of the German people during much of the 20th century, particularly around the period of the second world war. BBC2 has just finished repeating the whole, entrancing saga. So deeply involved in the lives of these characters do we become - in the minutiae which vividly illustrate the greater historical events of the time - that the end of the series brings an acute sense of deprivation similar to that caused by reading the last page of War And Peace. But happily this coming Saturday evening BBC2 begins screening The Second Heimat: A New Generation and it seems that Reitz has not only not lost his touch but, if anything, refined and improved it. This conclusion is based upon previewing only six hours of the new work - 'only' seeming the right word when you realise that Part 2 is even longer than the original: 13 episodes of two hours. But such is the magic of Heimat I would happily have sat through the other 20 hours, had the BBC not been still working on the sub-titling. Ironically, in that it is the only aspect not under Reitz's control, the sub-titling is the one technical detail which is less than satisfactory: instead of modern white-on-black, the BBC has gone back to the inferior white-only which is so hard to read against pale backgrounds. At the centre of Heimat 2 is Hermann Simon, Maria's youngest son, whose passionate love affair with the older Klarchen was so cruelly destroyed by the family in Part 1. The date is now 1960 and the setting has changed from country to city, with Hermann, played by a splendid young actor named Henry Arnold, arriving in Munich to begin studying music. He becomes one of a group of young intellectuals who congregate in a large middle class house made available to them by an older woman who enjoys the company of young artists. At least for the first three episodes the development of modern music is one of the main backdrops against which the human relationships are enacted, and presumably this continues throughout. It is not merely a matter of using music as a pretty accompaniment (much of what we hear seems to me far from pretty, though Reitz does more to endear avant garde music to me than anyone else ever has) nor of exploiting music and musicians for the sake of angst-ridden drama as in such Hollywood horrors as Song Without End. Reitz works the music into the very lives of his characters, and makes the difference between the new music and the old one of the keys to the differences between the generations. Some have said that Heimat is merely up-market soap opera; can anybody conceive of a theme such as this in EastEnders? The main difference between Maria's generation and Hermann's is, of course, the experience of Nazism and here Reitz has done more, perhaps, than anyone else in the field of popular culture to deal honestly with post-war attitudes. That means neither atavistic arrogance nor the perpetual wringing of hands among his older characters, nor does it mean endless guilt and tearful rejection among the young. Mostly it means obfuscation, subtle misunderstanding, and a tendency for immediate events to distract from the enormity of what was done . . . as during the war itself, according to Heimat 1. There is a wonderful moment in Episode 2 of the new series when Angelika and her friends are playing Vivaldi at a birthday party and her wealthy bourgeois father slips off to play with his radio-controlled boat in the swimming pool. It encapsulates a powerful Reitz cocktail of social, political and artistic attitudes. Reitz repeatedly makes clear his love of cinema. The sub-text involving the development of stills cameras in Heimat 1 moves on to the development of movie cameras in Heimat 2: Hermann's friends use an Arriflex, the camera which was originally developed for the Wehrmacht. In Episode 3 Reitz inserts a nice joke for cineastes when one of the students says 'We've just been to a film you must see: La Notte by Antonioni. You come out feeling like shooting yourself]' which is spot on for period and also true. But whatever Reitz's own predilections surely neither of these huge works would ever have been made for cinema alone, nor even have been conceived without the model provided by television serial drama. A few people might be willing to devote the money and time necessary to watch 26 hours of material in a cinema, but only a few. Millions in umpteen countries watched Heimat 1 on television, and probably millions more in even more places will watch Heimat 2. Such was the critical and popular success of Part 1 that there are 16 co-producers for Part 2, six German and 10 foreign, nearly all of them television companies, including the BBC. However, saying that Heimat is a true product of the television serial tradition is not the same as saying that it is just high class soap opera. It certainly has some of the characteristics of soap opera: a big cast, considerable time devoted to the dramatisation of the everyday, and that extraordinarily powerful ability to make a set of fictional characters so attractive to the viewers that they simply want it to go on and on, feeling that the drama has become a part of their own lives. You can hardly miss the fact that Reitz has a marvellous aptitude for narrative, and that he loves sex and music as well as cinema: the tastes of a sane and admirable individual. But the similarity between his work and TV soap is really no greater than that between Madam Bovary and the latest Mills &amp; Boon romance which, you may say, are both novels, but that does not tell us very much. Claiming that EastEnders and Heimat are both soap operas tells us as little. Reitz - writer, director, and producer of this vast epic - who was never exactly fumbling around in Part 1, seems even more technically assured in Part 2. Each episode now revolves around one of the friends or acquaintances of the central character. As before, the first person singular voice-over is used to powerful effect (as it was in Brideshead Revisited; why do so many television dramatists overlook this unique route into a character's interior life?) and Reitz is now completely relaxed about switching from one first-person voice-over to another, even within one episode. In theory it should be confusing yet it is not. While makers of British television serial drama are besotted with the look of their period trappings (vintage cars, enamel advertisement hoardings, the precise details of Sylvia's underwear in Lipstick On Your Collar) Reitz can be quite casual about such things. In the first scene of passion between Hermann and Clarissa she is revealed to be wearing tights . . . in 1961? About five years too early, surely. Reitz is far more concerned with the effect of the whole image on the screen. He habitually uses monochrome for daytime and colour for night, a scheme which works much better than the arbitrary switching in Heimat 1. His pictures are often beautiful, and even though Heimat 1 and 2 are products of the television age he shoots as a cinema director. There is a continuous hand-held travelling shot across a river in a snow-covered park, following a conversation between Hermann and Juan in Episode 2 which lasts 1 minute 43 seconds. No television director would dare. Yet whatever the pleasures in technique, sub-texts, social observation, and historical analysis, what matters above all in the end is the narrative factor. Reitz uses 1993 technology, but he is really the story teller beside the fire at the mouth of the cave, surrounded by a rapt audience whispering 'What happened next?'</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICAL FLOW;  </P> <P> MANAGING INVENTORIES, TIMELY DELIVERIES ARE KEY TO KEEPING CUSTOMERS,  CALIFORNIA MARKETS SATISFIED  </P> <P> Melody Salazar thought that the new rug that she ordered on June 2 from the  Sears store in Torrance would arrive in plenty of time for her July dinner  party.  </P> <P> "I paid $200 and they said it (the rug) would arrive in two to three weeks,"  said Salazar, a Manhattan Beach resident who operates her own clothing sales  firm. "I had the perfect spot all picked out. But my rug didn't come until the  middle of August. I was very, very angry."  </P> <P> Anyone who has gone shopping only to find an item out of stock, or who, like  Salazar, has waited months for merchandise to be delivered, knows how important  adequate product supplies can be in maintaining customer satisfaction.  </P> <P> Once a field that drew little notice, the management of inventory has become a  major preoccupation of American business in the wake of the expansion of the  global economy and federal deregulation, in 1980, of the U.S. truck and rail  freight industries.  </P> <P> The interest in maintaining adequate inventories is particularly keen in  California, which is home to the nation's two largest general merchandise and  prescription drug distributors as well as a state that has become an important  hub for products arriving from major foreign manufacturing sites such as  Mexico, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.  </P> <P> "Southern California companies are having to compete in the international and  national market so they are having to think more about distribution," said  Harold Cypress, a senior consultant with Arthur D. Little in Los Angeles. "One  of the true competitive edges in today's global market is speed of  distribution. Quick response has become a prerequisite to being a successful  company. It's an important part of customer satisfaction."  </P> <P> In this absolutely-positively-have-to-have-it-overnight world, retailers,  manufacturers and distributors are dispensing with the old paper-based system  of order blanks and shipping receipts and substituting new technologies such as  computers and bar code scanners to keep shelves adequately stocked. And with  federal deregulation of the trucking and rail industry touching off an  explosion of new freight carriers, the industry has become more competitive  than ever. Still, as Salazar discovered, mistakes can happen.  </P> <P> "When you are dealing with a decorator rug, we usually just carry a floor  sample," explained Clayton Valstad, regional facilities manager for Sears in  Santa Fe Springs. "Our policy is to offer a refund -- at any time, for any  reason -- to an unsatisfied customer. We don't like to inconvenience the  customer."  </P> <P> Keeping inventory on hand, however, is a complex task that requires planning as  well as information on the movement of goods between vehicles, warehouses and  stores that can be hundreds of miles apart. Because the federal government no  longer regulates the number or prices of truck and rail freight carriers, costs  can vary widely, so decisions on shipping products are more crucial today.  </P> <P> "What deregulation has done is dramatically increase the number of economic  choices that we as movers of goods have to deal with," said Robert Wayman,  chief financial officer of Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto. "When  transportation prices were regulated, it didn't make as much difference who you  chose."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Saturn Decision  </P> <P> But today millions of dollars often ride on a manager's decisions.  </P> <P> The cost of transporting cars from the factory to the marketplace, for  instance, was the single biggest factor in General Motors' decision, in the  mid-1980s, to locate its huge Saturn automobile assembly plant in Spring Hill,  Tenn., GM officials said. The company noted that the city is within 500 miles  of nearly 80% of the U.S. population. Other auto makers -- including Nissan,  Honda and Toyota -- have also built plants in the region because of its central  location.  </P> <P> By contrast, Hawthorne-based Mattel Inc. chose to build most of its  manufacturing plants in Asia. Labor costs are lower there, company officials  say, but distribution is more intricate. Mattel relies on a network of ocean  liners, trains and trucks to deliver toys to its two U.S. warehouses in City of  Industry and Ft. Worth, Tex.  </P> <P> Mattel's network was tested earlier this year when student protests in China  disrupted the manufacturing of toys at the company's plant near Canton in  southeastern China, said Jeffery Douglas, vice president of logistics for  Mattel.  </P> <P> "Transit time from the Orient can take anywhere from 14 to 17 days" by ship,  Douglas said. "Toys are time sensitive and if you don't make a product  immediately available on the shelf, parents are going to buy something else."  He said Mattel made "minor adjustments" to its production and delivery  schedules from other plants in Asia to make up for the disruption in China.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rising Expectations  </P> <P> Such planning for distribution efficiency has had a significant effect on  moderating price increases and improving corporate profits.  </P> <P> Robert B. Delaney, a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.,  estimated that businesses have saved about $60 billion annually in  transportation and inventory carrying costs since federal deregulation of the  truck and rail industries helped focus more attention on distribution costs.  </P> <P> But while costs have come down, consumers' expectations have risen.  </P> <P> "We have become used to getting things when we want them," said Harold  Kassarjian, a professor of marketing at UCLA. "With more and more crowding in  the cities, life has become more hectic. Consumers are saying, 'If you don't  have the cereal I want, I'll go to the store next door.' "  </P> <P> The change in attitudes has "caused corporate management to question the  traditional ways of meeting customer needs by accumulating stockpiles of  inventory in close proximity to customer facilities," concluded a study on  consumer satisfaction conducted last year by Ohio State University's College of  Business.  </P> <P> "We've become more sensitive to the consumer," said Wayman of Hewlett Packard.  "By viewing logistics as a vital aspect of customer satisfaction, we're getting  a better appreciation of it. When somebody pays $500,000 for a piece of  computer equipment, they are not tolerant of poor delivery. They want it in a  timely, complete fashion."  </P> <P> A major influence on the new ways of managing inventory has been the Japanese  who, because of a lack of raw materials and space in their country, perfected  the concept of "just-in-time" delivery.  </P> <P> Instead of stockpiling months' worth of raw materials and finished products,  deliveries are timed more closely, reducing carrying costs and storage space  for manufacturer and retailer alike.  </P> <P> Likewise, in the United States, goods are often kept in sparsely populated  areas rather than stockpiled in costly urban locations. To move products  around, retailers rely on frequent deliveries by independent distributors such  as Bergen Brunswig Corp. of Orange or McKesson Corp. of San Francisco, the  nation's largest pharmaceutical and general merchandise distributor. McKesson  had earnings of $100.6 million on sales of $7 billion in the fiscal year ended  March 31.  </P> <P> The two firms distribute more than 100,000 kinds of merchandise. Virtually  every item found in the typical drug store, from camera film and toothpaste to  prescription drugs and sunglasses, is transported or warehoused by one of these  two firms. It is a task that requires military-like coordination.  </P> <P> "You literally have to plan to take in every issue from freeway congestion to  when key managers are on vacation," said Bernard J. Hale, vice president of  distribution for Bergen Brunswig, which earned $47.6 million on sales of $3.9  billion for the fiscal year ended in August.  </P> <P> To keep deliveries within 15 minutes of the promised time, Hale relies on a  fleet of 500 trucks and 30 distribution centers. He stays in touch by phone  with many of his warehouse managers and distributors. But he says his most  important tool is the personal computer.  </P> <P> "We always keep in mind that a customer is depending on us to deliver," Hale  said. "When a pharmacist is running low on a life-saving drug, he doesn't  understand when you are two hours late."  </P></p>

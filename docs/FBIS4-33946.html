			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Suitability of NAFTA"] </F>   [Text] Although the possibility of Chile reaching an  agreement with the United States -- either by joining NAFTA or  by signing a bilateral agreement -- has been a recurrent subject  over the past few months, only now that the two governments have  started informal talks have some people expressed their concern.    Lack of information on the various aspects and consequences  of future negotiations has triggered legitimate fears that must  be discussed. The truth is that these fears should have been  discussed some time ago so that they could be assessed and  debated. Anyway, over the next few months the government will  release adequate information about NAFTA, will study the  suitability of joining NAFTA or some other bilateral agreement,  and will promote technical studies in various sectors.    One thing is quite clear: Reaching a free trade agreement  with the United States -- either a bilateral agreement or by  joining NAFTA -- will be beneficial for Chile because it  involves its main commercial and financial partner. Moreover,  in the case of the second alternative, one must bear in mind  that North America is a market of 360 million consumers with an  annual per capita income of $20,000 in the United States,  $19,000 in Canada, and a little more than $2,700 in Mexico.    Moreover, trade with that region is significant. Some 19  percent of Chilean annual exports go to North America, 17  percent of which go to the United States. Chilean annual  imports amount to $660 million, 75 percent of which come from  the United States, 21 percent from Canada, and 4 percent from  Mexico.    It should also be remembered that an agreement would make it  possible for custom and non-custom barriers, which affect almost  25 percent of Chilean foreign trade, to be lifted over 15 years.    The move would also improve Chile's image because reaching a  bilateral agreement with the United States means complying with  a series of strict requirements. It would step up foreign  investments because Chile's name will occupy a higher  "investment grade" [two preceding words in English], which would  be appreciated by foreign businessmen.    These benefits will vary according to the type of agreement  reached with the United States. They will probably be much  stiffer if Chile joins NAFTA, an agreement that has obvious  advantages.    Among these advantages is that the terms are already known,  thus allowing Chile to simultaneously negotiate with Canada and  Mexico, and increase its chances of gaining access to those  markets. It will clearly regulate labor and environment aspects  and offer a good opportunity to negotiate with other countries,  especially those of the Asian bloc.    On the other hand, in a bilateral agreement Chile's  interests  might be diminished by the greater negotiating power of the  United States. Lastly, failing to reach an agreement would be  very costly for Chile because it would cause uncertainty among  the economic agents and weaken bilateral relations with that  important partner.</p>

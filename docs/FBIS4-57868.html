			<p>BFN     [Text] Uruguay's Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla has  said Uruguay does not support delaying the implementation of  Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. He added that we must  respect all legal instruments, such as the Asuncion Treaty,  which established 1 January 1995 as the Mercosur launch date.    Abreu arrived in Asuncion this morning. He was received by  his Paraguayan counterpart Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner.    Talking about his 3-day official visit, Abreu said he will  discuss the common foreign tariff and other bilateral and  regional issues with Paraguayan officials. He will also invite  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy to the inauguration of the Martin  Garcia Channel dredging, in Montevideo, on 10 June. Argentine  President Carlos Menem is also scheduled to attend.    Tomorrow, Foreign Minister Abreu will sign various  agreements  and a joint declaration at the Foreign Ministry.    At 1600 this afternoon, the Uruguayan official will meet  with  President Wasmosy at the Government Palace. He will then  continue his working meeting with Foreign Minister Ramirez  Boettner.    On the morning of 25 May, Abreu will donate a computer to  the  Artigas School. At 1030, he will give a lecture at the  Paraguayan Industrial Union (UIP) on the topic: "The Uruguay  Round; The Results and Its Relation Within the Global Picture."  Abreu will return to Uruguay at noon on 26 May.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS PASSES BILL RAISING DEBT LIMIT  </P> <P> Congress approved and sent to the White House today a bill temporarily  increasing the national debt limit to $3.195 trillion.  </P> <P> The House approved the bill, 247 to 172, and the Senate passed it by voice  vote.  </P> <P> Treasury Department officials said the government will run out of borrowing  authority in mid-August, while Congress is on vacation, unless the ceiling is  increased from its current level, $3.123 trillion.  </P> <P> The short-term boost of $72 billion approved by the House was estimated to be  enough to carry the government through Oct. 2. Without approval of the  extension, the government could not borrow more cash to pay its bills.  </P> <P> The government has never defaulted on its payments. If it did so, economists  say interest rates would skyrocket.  </P></p>

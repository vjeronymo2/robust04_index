			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister for labor and manpower development, Mr.  Philip Masinde, has declared the strike by the employees in the  banking industry as illegal. In a press release today, Mr.  Masinde said that while negotiations are still under way through  conciliation, the workers have unilaterally taken industrial  action contrary to the spirit of the industrial relations  charter and the provisions of the Trade Dispute Act Chapter 234.  He therefore said that under such circumstances, the workers'  action was untenable and called on them to resume work  immediately.    Touching on the strike by the Kenya Railways Corporation  locomotive drivers which started yesterday, the minister also  declared their strike illegal. Mr. Masinde pointed out that  there exists a machinery for settlement of industrial disputes  which must be adhered to by the parties, an action which, he  said, the employees of the railway did not follow. He called on  the striking railway employees to resume work immediately.  Meanwhile, nearly 30 train drivers currently on strike have  been sacked. In a letter signed by the district mechanical  engineer, Mr. Mithamo, the drivers were summarily dismissed for  deliberately absenting themselves from duty on June 1st this  year. Subsequently, the striking drivers have been evicted from  the staff quarters and ordered to vacate the premises of the  corporation.    As part of the contingency measures, the public relations  manager, Miss Njeri Luseno, said locomotive inspectors and  instructor drivers from the railway training institute had been  redeployed. She said business at all stations had fully  resumed, adding that all passengers and cargo trains would  continue to operate as usual. Miss Luseno pleaded for patience  from the staff saying that the management was currently pursuing  negotiations with the Kenya Railways Workers Union to review the  remuneration package of the unionizable staff. Those striking  are demanding a monthly salary of 25,000 shillings for junior  drivers from the current 2,900 shillings and 45,000 shillings  for senior drivers from their current pay of 5,000 shillings.  As they packed their belongings the drivers vowed to pursue  their grievances through the industrial court.</p>

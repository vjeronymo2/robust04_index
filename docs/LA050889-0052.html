			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> BODY CLOCK THEORY CHALLENGED  </P> <P> A study questions the conventional view of how mammals keep the biological  clock in their brains synchronized with the 24-hour day, researchers say.  </P> <P> The so-called circadian clock governs a host of body processes, and disruptions  lead to such conditions as jet lag and some cases of insomnia.  </P> <P> Scientists generally believe that in most mammals, the brain maintains the  clock's 24-hour rhythm chiefly by monitoring light and darkness in the  environment.  </P> <P> But the new study found that onset of darkness failed to exert its usual effect  in hamsters if the animals were immobilized. So the real clock-setting  mechanism may be the physical activity that darkness usually causes in  hamsters, researchers suggest.  </P> <P> The work was presented in the British journal, Nature, by Fred Turek of  Northwestern University and O. Van Reeth of the Free University of Brussels.  </P></p>

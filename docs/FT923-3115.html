			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Sweden's banks face a legacy from the 1980s: Sara Webb analyses problems facing the centre-right government over the troubled banking sector With two banks already rescued and a third in serious difficulties, the Swedish government is now working to avoid the entire banking sector falling under its control. 'We have reached a point where the whole banking system seems to have severe problems. If we don't take precautions, we might end up with all the banks being state-owned' says Mr Urban Backstrom, deputy to the Swedish minister of taxation and financial markets. For Sweden's centre-right government, committed to the privatisation of state-controlled companies, the last thing it wants is to nationalise banks. Yet two of Sweden's banks - Nordbanken (the second largest commercial bank) and Forsta Sparbanken (one of the large savings banks)  - have had to be rescued by the state. Now a third looks set to join the casualties. Last week, the Swedish government was forced to pledge its support for Gota Bank, the fourth largest commercial bank, after it emerged that credit losses for 1992 are likely to reach SKr8bn (Pounds 782m), or double Gota's previous forecast. The Finance Ministry must now find a solution to Gota's problems, which will not be made easier by last week's turbulence in the Nordic financial markets. The Bank of Finland's decision to cut the markka's link to the Ecu prompted a big outflow of capital from the region. Sweden's central bank increased its marginal lending rate from 16 per cent to 24 per cent and then to 75 per cent in an effort to reverse a currency outflow. Swedish short-term interest rates shot up: if they remain high the effect on the economy and the banks could be serious. 'The banks are being squeezed (by the high interest rates) and are taking a blow' admitted Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, last week. Mr Lars Jagren, an economist at the Federation of Swedish Industries, warned that if interest rates remain high, the consequences would include weak demand for loans, an increase in the number of bankruptcies, and a further fall in property prices - all of which would be bad news for the banks. On Friday, Moody's, the international credit rating agency, placed the long-term debt ratings of Nordbanken, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (the biggest Swedish bank), Svenska Handelsbanken (the third largest bank), and Swedbank (the new savings bank group) under review for possible downgrade. The banking sector's troubles can be traced back to the end of 1985 when controls on bank lending were lifted. Mr Sten Westerberg, of financial advisers Westerberg &amp; Co, points out that tax rules encouraging people to borrow (by making interest payments tax deductible) were retained, as were restrictions on investing abroad. As a result, Swedes borrowed heavily and channelled the money into the domestic stock and property markets. Property and share prices soared in the second half of the 1980s. Banks scrambled for new customers, and paid scant heed to analysing their credit-worthiness. Mr Sahlen believes there were important differences in behaviour between the various banks. Before deregulation, Gota, Nordbanken and Forsta Sparbanken had concentrated on the household sector. But once credit controls were lifted, they concentrated on boosting their corporate business and chased after new customers, particularly in the property sector. Today, about 60 per cent of the banking sector's loans are related to property. Mr Sahlen claims that these three banks have a proportionately greater exposure to troubled property and have a higher proportion of non-performing loans in relation to their total lending than the other Swedish banks. By contrast, Mr Sahlen says, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken both had a long tradition of lending to Swedish industry. Many of their corporate customers belong to 'spheres' of interlinked customers, which the banks know well. As a result neither of these banks was as aggressive in the pursuit of new corporate business after deregulation. The government has promised to meet all of Gota Bank's obligations to other banks, corporate and individual customers. Over the next few weeks, Ministry of Finance officials will discuss with Gota and its owner, the Trygg Hansa insurance group, how best to save Gota. The government is also drawing up a rescue plan for the banking system. 'The banks are suffering from temporary large credit losses' says Mr Backstrom. By the end of 1991, credit losses for the banking sector reached about SKr45bn: Mr Backstrom warns that additional credit losses over the next few years could amount to between SKr50bn and SKr90bn. His department is studying ways of alleviating the burden, either by providing insurance to the banks against credit losses or allowing the state to take on the bad debts, provided the banks pay the state back later. 'We have to maintain the stability of the system' sighs Mr Backstrom. At the end of the day, he admits, it is the taxpayers and customers who will foot the bill for the banks' mistakes in the 1980s.

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ENCINO COMPLEX APPROVED; THEATER DELETED FROM PLAN  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council approved a controversial development on Ventura  Boulevard in Encino on Wednesday, but unanimously stripped from the plan a  five-screen movie theater opposed by neighbors.  </P> <P> Heltzer Enterprises plans to build 70,000 square feet of commercial space --  primarily retail stores and restaurants -- in the 15900 block of Ventura  Boulevard.  </P> <P> The decision to delete the theater cooled the protests of neighbors who feared  the theaters would cause excessive late-night traffic.  </P> <P> "Based on the information we have this morning, we are totally in accord. . . .  We thought it was an obvious attempt to make Ventura Boulevard a movie capital  of the world," said Jack S. Hurwitz, who lives closest to the project, on  Gaviota Avenue.  </P> <P> However, another Gaviota Avenue resident, Kenneth Millman, said he still  objected to the construction of a parking garage on a lot zoned for residences.  The council approved the garage after a spokeswoman for Heltzer Enterprises  said the land already is being used as a parking lot and the developer wants  only to add a second level underground.  </P> <P> By denying the theater, the council followed the lead of its Planning and  Environment Committee, which in June barred the theater and attached a long  list of strict conditions to the project's approval.  </P> <P> The council also approved those conditions, which are intended to reduce the  impact of the development on surrounding residences. They include a ban on  fast-food restaurants and nightclubs; restrictions concerning lighting,  landscaping and fence height, and guidelines to prevent the construction's  making traffic worse on Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> At the June committee meeting, Heltzer spokeswoman Gail Gordon had asked for  more time to develop plans for a smaller theater, but she did not repeat that  unsuccessful plea to the council Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews by Max Jacobson.  Prices are based on average dinner costs for a party of two without wine.  </P> <P> Price scale:  </P> <P> $ = under $15  </P> <P> $$ = $15 to $39  </P> <P> $$$ = $40 to $75  </P> <P> $$$$ = over $75  </P> <P> Be-Bop Burgers, 18575 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-1958. Open daily  from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; weekends to midnight. Carhop service Wednesdays  through the weekend from 7 p.m. to closing. $  </P> <P>  Pinky's Hamburger Grill, 4115 Campus Drive, Irvine. (714) 854-4632. Open  Sundays through Thursdays from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to  11 p.m. $  </P> <P>  Be-Bop Burgers and Pinky's Hamburger Grill are part of a wave of "nostalgia"  hamburger joints engulfing Orange County, and both are longer on atmosphere  than food. The Be-Bop burger is a good value, a full quarter-pound of lean beef  on a seeded bun that just drips with condiments. Pinky's beach burgers are  charcoal-grilled and really taste good. Other sandwiches in both restaurants  are less appealing. Luckily, both restaurants exude energy, plus the mindless  fun of the '50s and '60s.  </P> <P> Burrell's Rib Cage, 305 N. Hesperian St., Santa Ana. (714) 835-9936. Open  daily, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Also at 1701 E. McFadden Ave., J, Santa Ana. (714)  541-3073. Open Mondays through Thursdays 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and  Saturdays till 11 p.m.; Sundays till 9 p.m. $  </P> <P>  Wanna sample of what Magic Johnson and Richard Nixon say is the area's best  barbecue? Come on down to Burrell's and see what the shouting is about. You'll  eat from plastic boxes in a dark, smoky room, and you'll probably get sauce on  your shirt. The good news is you won't care. Beef brisket is as soft and lean  as a baby's cheek, and chopped pork shoulder is a symphony of textures. Save  room for the especially terrific homemade sausage, crumbly and charred crisp.  It's what a food critic lives for.  </P> <P> The Original Pancake House, 1418 E. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim. (714) 693-1390. Open  Tuesdays through Sundays from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. $  </P> <P> The Original Pancake House is one of the very best restaurants in Orange  County. Just ask anyone who has eaten there. All the batters are made with  sourdough yeast and come straight from the grill -- light, finely textured and  complex. The Belgian waffles are eggy and crispy, and the apple pancake, a  giant golden puff with a cinnamon-glaze topping, is one step away from nirvana.  </P> <P> Bayou St. John, 320 Main St., Seal Beach. (213) 431-2298. Open daily from 5 to  10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Bayou St. John in quiet Seal Beach is Orange County's only bona fide Cajun  restaurant. The boom has faded, but not the delights of this cuisine. Indulge  yourself with such specialties as homemade gumbo, full of hidden flavors;  oysters Rousseau, a rich appetizer with cheese, bacon, cream sauce and spicy  tomato; and stuffed trout, pan-fried in pure butter. Blackened items are a  must. Seafoods are flown in from the Gulf.  </P> <P> China Palms, Fullerton Metro Center, 104 W. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton. (714)  526-2196. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10  p.m. $$  </P> <P> Joe Ling put a palm tree in the middle of his restaurant, an airy, ultra-modern  dining room in Fullerton's spanking-new Metro Center. But there is nothing  tropical about the solid pan-Chinese food he serves, made in one of the most  accomplished Chinese kitchens around. Cold dishes, dumplings and first-rate  soups make perfect beginnings. Honey-glazed bananas, plunged steaming into an  ice-filled bowl tableside, make perfect endings. The goodies you can have in  between are too numerous to mention.  </P> <P> Five Feet, 328 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4955. Open Sundays  through Thursdays, 5 to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 5 to 11 p.m.; lunch  served Fridays only, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> Owner Michael Kang has some of the most compelling art around decorating this  restaurant's somber, postmodern walls, and he serves plates of food very nearly  as artful. Dishes of pot stickers or steamed dumpling are no better than you  would get in any Chinese restaurant, but the eclectic lamb, scallop and catfish  entrees demonstrate Kang's flair. The catfish is particularly fine.  </P> <P> Stix, 28251 Crown Valley Parkway at the Center at Ranch Miguel, Laguna Niguel.  (714) 831-7849. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; from  11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. $  </P> <P> Stix is a bright, airy, mirror-lined, new Chinese restaurant where the cooking  offers few surprises but is straightforward and safe: no MSG, high-quality oils  like peanut and sesame -- you get it. The various kung paos, pan-fried  dumplings and twice-cooked pork, may lack the hotness and brio they have in  Chinatown or Monterey Park, but added color and crunch make up for it.  </P> <P> The Golden Truffle, 1767 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-9858. Open  Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through  Thursdays from 6 to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> The Golden Truffle is an eccentric restaurant with an eclectic menu that defies  rhythm or logic. Chef Alan Greeley is whimsical; he cooks for the sheer  pleasure of it, and it mostly tastes terrific. Bay shrimp cocktail Yucatan is  like a combination gazpacho-ceviche, with tiny shrimp and chunky pieces of  avocado immobilized in a thick, tangy puree of tomato and chili. Broiled  marinated skirt steak with pinto beans and cactus is a triumph. Nothing else on  the menu will prepare you for it. There is a wide selection of premium wines  and bistro-like desserts. The ambience is relaxed and casual.  </P></p>

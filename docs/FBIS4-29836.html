			<p>BFN     [Text] Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Paias Wingti has  revealed that talks between government officials, Bougainville  leaders, and rebels had been canceled earlier this week because  the leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army could not  attend. The Port Moresby based newspaper, THE NATIONAL, says Mr.  Wingti told us that the Honiara meeting did not go ahead as  planned because the government decided that Francis Ona and Sam  Kouna had to be involved. He said the government did not want  to waste its time by talking to a variety of people and then not  getting any results. Mr. Wingti reportedly also said that the  government would not make any announcements until talks between  the leaders on both sides were over.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina </F> Presidency, by Senka Kurtovic; place and date not given:  "Embargo on Life"]    [Text] We began the interview with Ejup Ganic, member of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, by asking him about politics.    [Ganic] They say that politics is mostly the sport of older  people. They have the experience, they are realistic and  patient enough. Younger politicians are good for winning  battles, duels. Take the politics of the United States, its  foreign policy in particular. You will see that it was mostly  older politicians who made wise moves. Small countries need  that kind of wisdom even more.    [Kurtovic] Did we have enough of that wisdom?    [Ganic] It was very difficult to have any kind of politics  at the beginning of the war, when there was almost no Bosnian  politics to speak of. Only the Bosniaks had some kind of  program that reflected the moves of that politics. There was  quite a lot of Yugoslav politics. One year before the war broke  out, we abounded in ideas about how to preserve Yugoslavia.  However, other republics did not even dream about that. We  were trying to formulate some ideas about preserving Yugoslavia.  Milosevic wanted to turn Yugoslavia into some kind of greater  Serbia, we know what others wanted.... Later on, however, that  politics boiled down to defending the country, the Bosniaks were  trying to expand at the political scene. It is too early to say  whether they succeeded in that. However, some people in this  country are too selfish. They went away, kept aside, and looked  after their own interests.    [Kurtovic] You have recently returned from the United  States. Considering their concessions at a time crucial for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, do you think that the United States has two  kinds of politics for Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] President Clinton and Vice President Gore are young  people dealing with a serious challenge for the first time. It  was by design that Bush would not do anything for  Bosnia-Herzegovina. He had a relatively good rating owing to the  successfully-ended Gulf crisis and Bosnia-Herzegovina was just  another unnecessary risk for him. It is still not too late for  Clinton, but that confirms my thesis that politics should be  managed by older people. More experienced people would know  that fascism and aggression cannot be stopped on a voluntary  basis. There is not a single case in the history of  international diplomacy of an aggressor willingly giving up its  military advantage in negotiations. Speaking about just peace  -- and we are faced with a mighty military machinery of our  aggressor and with an arms embargo against us -- we cannot  expect a just peace. Older (wiser) politicians would solve this  problem immediately. In my opinion, the politics of the United  States is not ambiguous but undetermined, which is again typical  of young politicians. There is one thing, however, that is good  for the United States: dodging, in the sense that Bosnia is a  European problem and must be solved by Europe. They had two  years to eliminate the problem and did nothing, so now we will  get involved. Therefore, the United States is provided with an  argument in favor of more active involvement....    [Kurtovic] What is really the goal of that indecisive  politics?    [Ganic] Vice President Gore told me that the politics of the  United States is designed to bring peace to Bosnia, peace that  has to be acceptable to the legal authorities. I agree with  that, but we want a peace that will be a just solution for us.  In my opinion, the involvement of the United States is much  greater now.    [Kurtovic] What prompted the more active involvement?    [Ganic] My impression is that Gorazde was the turning point,  for the 720 people who were killed there indirectly saved other  enclaves. The United States knows that Karadzic's and  Milosevic's Serbs (for I cannot blame the entire nation) lie and  that they will try to outwit 30 to 50 percent of the ultimatums.  The problem is that the European leaders are dwarfs,  historically speaking.    [Kurtovic] What about the United Nations, what is its role?    [Ganic] The United Nations organization is lead by people  who have no experience in political management and no refined  sense for human rights and liberties. I told Butrus-Ghali he  reminds me of a manager who has ruined a company. I told him he  was responsible for Gorazde, that the catastrophe happened - -  because of his lack of determination and because he had  destroyed all the mechanisms -- not only for Bosnia, but for all  small countries that counted on the so called UN shield.  Butrus-Ghali told me he could do nothing. We talked for about  an hour and a half and I think the conversation will stick in  the memories of both of us as very unpleasant. Rumor has it  that the United States is hiding behind the UN, behind  Butrus-Ghali, who runs a house that is not functioning. The  United States says it is in favor of lifting the embargo, but  the United Naitons, i.e. Russia, can impose a veto.    [Kurtovic] What are, actually, U.S. and Russian views about  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] I think that their views are alike regarding Bosnia,  in the sense that they both agree about the integrity of the  country. There is, however, an underlying Russian variant - -  the Serbs should be given a large part and the Bosniaks have  already made an agreement with the Croats and they will get the  rest. However, that still presents a division. Our agreement  with the Croats is extremely important and it is in the  interests of both sides. I told the Americans that the  constitution they wrote for us is of extreme importance,  especially if it is applied on the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina  territory. Together with the Russians, the United States must  put pressure on the Belgrade regime to accept it.    [Kurtovic] Akashi also advocates the policy of compromise.  In your opinion, is he a representative of Japanese politics or  just a "player" for key countries in the UN?    [Ganic] I do not think he is a particular representative of  Japanese politics. Akashi made some big mistakes and his  responsibility is documented. He prevented air strikes on  positions from which the Serbs were shelling Gorazde for an  entire day during the ultimatum. At least 28 people were killed  and more than a hundred were wounded. That is direct  responsibility and Akashi could have prevented it. He himself  did a lot to discredit his political career. Even in his own  country. He is directly responsible, for people were killed as  a result of his non-action.    [Kurtovic] What is the influence of the Islamic countries on  the United Nations and the United States?    [Ganic] Perhaps we help Islamic countries more then they  help us. Our problem seems to have united them for the first  time. Before, each of them had their own views. They were not  homogenous enough, not unanimous. They can help us rebuild the  country, the market, create jobs, and in establishing good  relations, which is very important. If Islamic countries were  more homogenous, they could jeopardize the national interest of  the West and dictate the solution for Bosnia to a large extent.  Generally speaking, that is a very slow mechanism. They seem  to be more and more involved.    [Kurtovic] Could the Islamic countries have used an oil  embargo to force the West to act more decisively?    [Ganic] That embargo would be most harmful for the United  States and Japan. However, these are major decisions, and they  are not prepared to make them, at least for the time being.  They built a nice unity on the tragedy of Bosnia. Many Islamic  countries were not even aware that there are Bosniaks-Muslims  living in Bosnia.    [Kurtovic] Who is the main obstacle to lifting the arms  embargo in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] It is probably not very likely that the embargo will  be lifted in its entirety in the near future. When I was in the  United States, I made it clear that we want limited quantities  of defensive weapons. We do not demand tanks but antitank  shells, we do not demand airplanes, helicopters, just guns. We  do not want to win this war but to survive. We cannot use the  word victory, for we have already been defeated by the  international community. Their view on human rights does not  allow us to talk about victory. We discovered darkness and we  were hoping to wake up to the light. In a nutshell, if you are  intent on having names, Britain is most opposed to lifting the  embargo. It is the mouthpiece of such ideas. We know about the  Russians, however. There are solutions that would force them to  make some concessions. If we only had at least one antitank  shell for every tank that attacked us, we would have stopped the  war. However, they did not let us defend ourselves. They  deprived us of the right to defend ourselves.    [Kurtovic] Lately, on the occasion of the events in  Gorazde, we have often heard the public blaming generals of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. What do you think about that?    [Ganic] In every group of people of the same profession,  just a few meet the essential criteria. We say: there are all  kinds of weeds in God's garden. Our generals also range from  bad to the best. The process of forming the army was a  painstaking one and we must occasionally make some personnel  changes, especially among its leadership, in order to create  competition. One must not forget that we are still at war  against an army with a very developed logistics, weapons,  positions, an army of more than 50 years in the making.  Naturally, every criticism is welcome, but it should not be  destructive, it should only serve as a warning for the future.  That became a topic which should be reduced to some reasonable  limits. There are many unknown heroes and we must remember that.  This should teach the generals a lesson in what people  understand best. Be where the action is -- that is a message,  not a topic for discussion.    [Kurtovic] We more often hear that minor fighting for  Bosnia-Herzegovina creates major fighting for power. Can you  comment on that?    [Ganic] With a few honorable exceptions, Bosnia is defended  by poor people. And there are two kinds of authority in Bosnia  -- those who were elected and those who joined them during the  war. Whether we want it or not, we will be forced to send some  people back. That will create a much stronger competition.  Perhaps that is why some want to seize power today, for it will  be more difficult to do it tomorrow. This will be a complex  country. We more or less know, even now, what and how much one  can do. However, our people are much smarter and we all  understand what happened in this war. When the time comes, when  those who are less courageous and more competent come, we will  welcome them.    [Kurtovic] You were recently appointed vice president of the  SDA [Party of Democratic Action]. Since when have you been a  member?    [Ganic] I thought you knew that those two dates overlap  (laughter). But there is more to this. I was overcome by the  desire to help the Bosniaks as much as I can. According to a  theory of my predecessors, the Ganics like many other Bosniak  families were expelled from Bosnia. The circle is now complete  -- now I return to Bosnia and my son will be born here. These  are difficult times for the Bosniaks. They were abandoned by  many, but the Bosniaks proved to be noble gentlemen. I felt I  had political followers and the SDA leadership sometimes asked  for my advice and opinion. I built my political views.  However, I had offers from other political parties, perhaps for  even better positions. I decided to join the SDA, for I think  that my presence can make it a stronger party, not so much now,  as after the war. Now most people are fighting on the front  lines. On the other hand, we will have a different political  system and all activities will go through parties. All those  reasons influenced this decision of mine.  <H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5> <H5>  Even With the Serbs </H5>   A federation is a quite decentralized state. It will even  allow the Serbs to be on their own. They can have a Serb flag  in every room. And let them have it. But we will not let them  divide the country and take what does not belong to them. We  were asked whether we could live with the Serbs. We will live  together in some areas, somewhere as neighbors, somewhere under  the surveillance of the international community on the basis of  some rights. Serb fascism, as did other fascisms, will come to  an end.  <H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5> <H5>  Helicopter and Morality </H5>   One UN soldier was wounded in Gorazde and he was picked up  by  a helicopter around which hundreds of mothers carrying  blood-covered, wounded children gathered. They begged to get  their children in the helicopter, for that was the only possible  help. No! The helicopter was sent out to pick up only that  soldier. The United Nations was unrelenting. You all heard the  mayor of Gorazde, Ismet Briga, who begged NATO to bomb the  inhabitants of Gorazde to end their suffering. That is the  result of the embargo and of the moral quality of that action.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Now private is preferred in Peru: Fujimori's pension reform and state sector sell-off prove popular THE advertising slogan for Peru's new private pension funds, which started operating last Monday, runs: 'The future is in good hands - your own.' It neatly summarises the philosophy of Peru's liberalising government of President Alberto Fujimori. After decades of state control and protectionism, the pendulum has swung dramatically the other way. Privatisation and foreign investment is touted as the panacea for all economic ills - , even those of Peru's traditionally militant leftist workers who are still unionised largely support the move. Acceptance of the private sector as the dynamo of the economy has been assisted by widespread popular disgust at long-standing inefficiency and corruption in almost all state-run activities. Opinion polls show a steady 50 to 60 per cent support for privatisation, while almost a third of workers say they expect to transfer their state pension to the new, private pension funds, AFPs, closely modelled on the successful Chilean experience. In setting up the AFPs, with a minimum of red tape and political opposition, Peru is again in the Latin American vanguard. About 300,000 retired workers depend on the Peruvian state for their pensions. They receive the equivalent of a wretched Dollars 90 a month from their lifetime's contributions - and their plight worsens each year. The new, voluntary scheme aims to provide both a better retirement pension on an individual capitalisation basis and boost Peru's underdeveloped capital markets. About 2m Peruvians affiliated to IPSS, the state social security scheme, are now free to transfer their contributions to privately-managed funds. The state will issue a bond to each contributor who chooses to opt out, its value simply calculated on the basis of age and recent earnings. Workers who switch will contribute 10 per cent of monthly earnings, compensated by a one-time wage increase. Older workers will do better, say experts, to stick with the IPSS system which, the government guarantees, will continue to pay out for their lifetimes. Five AFPs have been authorised by the newly-designated regulatory body and three more are being vetted. International insurance and banking concerns such as Aetna, Citibank, and the well-established Chilean AFPs Habitat and Provida, are participating. The level of interest suggests there are profits to be made in AFPs - although Mr Enrique Diaz, the AFP's technical superintendent says start-up costs for an AFP are high (up to Dollars 8m, including publicity) and could take four years to recover. Between 800,000 and 1.2m Peruvians are expected to affiliate to AFPs in the first year, generating anything between Dollars 150m and Dollars 350m in capital. It is not yet clear where funds will be invested. In the early months, the lion's share is likely to go into term deposits in the Peruvian banking system. The Central Reserve Bank, in association with the AFP superintendency, has the last word on investments but it seems private funds will at first be permitted to place only a tiny percentage in Lima's stock market. 'But the percentages established and the permitted instruments will be under constant revision,' says Mr Diaz. 'The idea is to be very dynamic and respond as new instruments appear.' Mr Diaz hopes the central bank and, later, the government will issue bonds. But the medium-term expectation is that the existence of AFPs will encourage Peruvian companies to raise capital via primary bond and stock issues, thus providing much-needed medium and long-term finance for industry. Meanwhile, if all goes to plan, a substantial portion of Peru's big public sector companies will also be privatised this year. Privatisation is moving farther and faster in Peru than in any other Latin American country. Copri, the government privatisation office, is estimating the treasury will net between Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars 1.6bn from sales this year alone. When the Fujimori regime took office in 1990, the state sector was costing the country about Dollars 2.5bn a year. Mr Fujimori has decreed there are no longer any 'strategic' sectors of the economy, to be reserved for Peruvian nationals - the country's mineral resources, oil and gas, drinking water and sewage, electricity and telephones are all on offer to the private sector. Among the state-owned companies due for sale before the end of the year are the mining and refining units of Centromin and Mineroperu; 20 fishmeal plants belonging to Pesca Peru; the state telecommunication company Entel and the state holding in CPT, Lima's telephone company; plus the distribution networks of Electrolima and Electroperu. Most of the evaluation and promotion work has been allocated by tender to international consultants and investment banks. Coopers and Lybrand, Price Waterhouse, Morgan Grenfell, First Boston, Chase Manhattan and Bankers Trust have all carved niches for themselves in Peru's privatisation process.</p>

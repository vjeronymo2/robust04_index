Speaking about the new Cabinet, he said that  "there is no government united by one idea or one logic."    "There is a group of leaders of different ministries  concerned about the future of these ministries. In the absence  of a central economic concept it is difficult and  psychologically impossible to withstand the lobbyists' demands  coming from everywhere," he told the newspaper Izvestiya.    To quote Gaydar, the old government managed to prevent  hyperinflation, although inflation fever continues to torment  the economy. The situation in foreign trade has changed and  exports far exceed imports. The hard-currency reserve  considerably increased: whereas at the end of 1991 the state  treasury was almost empty, by the end of 1993 Russia's  hard-currency reserves exceeded $4.5 Bn.    The absolute deadlock in November 1991 was overcome avoiding  an economic collapse, civil war and dictatorship, he said.    He also said that his faction in the State Duma would  rigorously and consistently work for broadening the citizens'  right to individual and collective self-defense, toughening  punishment for crimes and for involvement in organized crimes.    In the current situation, a humane attitude to criminals at  their victims' expense is at best out of place. I mean the  decree on amnesty. Society will challenge such a decree and  will be quite right, stated Gaydar.</p>

It  marks the first occasion on which representatives of the  People's Republic of China have taken part officially in South  African affairs.    The first two observers arrived last week with Tian Zengpei,  Beijing's Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs. China made a  specific request to the UN that, as one of the permanent members  of the UN Security Council, it had a right to take part in the  democratic election process in South Africa.    Pretoria and Beijing do not have formal diplomatic  relations,  but it has been reliably learnt that this is likely to change  after the election. At present, the Republic of China (Taiwan)  is recognised by Pretoria. Both countries, however, maintain  "study centres" in South Africa. The centres are headed by  senior career diplomats -- the former ambassador to Tanzania,  Sun Guotong, heads the Chinese mission in Pretoria -- and deal  with cultural matters and visa requirements.    China has purchased property for an embassy in Arcadia,  Pretoria, as well as a house in the exclusive Waterkloof suburb  as its official residence. China is currently mounting a major  diplomatic offensive in southern Africa and has in recent months  forged trade and cultural links with South Africa.    Various trade fairs have been held in SA and China -- the  next is to take place in Pretoria in June -- while top  government officials and trade missions have exchanged visits.  Last year, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Renier Schoeman went  to Beijing to formally open a South African "study centre."</p>

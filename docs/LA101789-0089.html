			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PERSONALITY: NEW CEO AT OFFICE AUTOMATION  </P> <P> Joel Shusterman has been appointed president at Office Automation Systems, a  San Diego-based laser printer manufacturer. He replaces Peter M. Steiner, who  recently resigned to pursue a business opportunity in Northern California.  </P> <P> Shusterman, 51, comes to Office Automation with more than 20 years of  experience in the computer industry. After earning an electrical engineering  degree from Drexel University in Philadelphia, he got his first job with  Philco, designing circuits.  </P> <P> Most recently, Shusterman was vice president of marketing with Commodore  Business Machines. He has also held management positions with Burroughs Corp.,  Sanders Associates and General Electric.  </P> <P> In 1977, at the beginning of the personal computer industry, Shusterman  co-founded Franklin Computer Corp. and came out with a series of computers  closely emulating the Apple personal computer. By 1984, Franklin was ranked the  nation's seventh-largest personal computer company.  </P> <P> In 1983, Computer Reseller News named Shusterman among the 25 most influential  people in the computer industry. "It was the same month Franklin pushed me  out," Shusterman recalled.  </P> <P> "That's the irony of this business," he said. "As CEO at Franklin, I thought  that success would be measured by great revenues and large profits, but that's  not always the case."  </P> <P> Shusterman says he looks forward to working with the staff at Office Automation  and is impressed by the existing talent. "This company is really like a  well-constructed ship sitting in the middle of an ocean that just doesn't have  the head of steam," he said.  </P> <P> "The ship is sound, but it was drifting, it had no direction," he said. "I have  to aim the company where its strengths are. One of my major functions is to  find that formula for success."  </P> <P> From his early days working in the home radio laboratory at Philco, Shusterman  has developed a love of old radios from the 1920s and '30s, and he spends much  of his spare time restoring them. He is also an avid history buff. CAROLINE  LEMKE  </P></p>

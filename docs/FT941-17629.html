			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Auctioneers all bubbly about 1994 - And the trickle down effect will help Antique dealers, from Bermondsey Market to New Bond Street, and fine art auctioneers, from Bonham's, Lots Road to Christie's, St James's, had plenty of excuses to raise a glass last night. They could choose to celebrate a much improved 1993 and bright prospects for 1994, or drown their sorrows at another poor trading year, made worse by the imminent arrival of VAT on imported antiques from non-EC countries which threatens to destroy the UK's attraction as an open market. The auction houses drank the champagne; the dealers the asti spumante. The 1993 results for the auction houses were distinctly encouraging. Sotheby's, globally, raised its turnover by 17 per cent to Dollars 1.32b. (In sterling terms it was a 31 per cent jump to Pounds 879m.) It also managed to stretch its lead over arch rival Christie's, which recorded a 3 per cent dollar gain, to Dollars 1.1b, or a sterling rise of 14 per cent to Pounds 726m. For both salerooms the recovery picked up steam in the autumn season. Facts matter in the art world. The problems of the last four years have concentrated around the shortage of fine antiques to sell. Despite the apparant invitability of the three 'D's which feed the market - death, divorce and debts - somehow sellers (even Lloyds Names) have managed to hold off, awaiting higher prices. The year-end results could spread the word that owners can once again profitably cash in their antiques. There are certainly some appetising sales on the horizon. The new tycoons are often entertainers, and Christie's is disposing of Barbra Streisand's fine collection of art nouveau and art deco in March and the late Rudolf Nureyev's luxurious domestic furnishings in December. Christie's is also excited about an impressive Landseer painting of a stag and Dr Thomas Howarth's collection of Charles Rennie Mackintosh furniture and designs. Sotheby's should have a good January, offering in New York Peter Jay Sharp's collection of Old Masters, including works by Rubens, Canaletto and Guido Reni, plus the most significant collection of folk art in private hands, assembled by the late Bertram K and Nina Fletcher Little. The likely success of these auctions should tempt out yet more major pieces. Of course it is the big price items, Impressionists and jewels in particular, which powered the improvement in turnover last year, but middle range antiques also played their part. Christie's South Kensington auction house, the trading place for collectables and home furnishings, managed a 33 per cent jump in sales, and Bonhams, which also concentrates on affordable antiques, saw its turnover rise 24 per cent to Pounds 31m. Sales at Phillips were only 1.5 per cent greater at Pounds 82m, but at least it recorded growth again. Sotheby's, which at one time spurned to handle goods worth under Pounds 1,000, has realised the need to capture collectors when they have modest means in the hope that their buying appetite will grow with their wealth. Expect many more 'Colonnade' sales, where most lots are estimated at under Pounds 2,000, at Sotheby's in 1994. Few dealers matched the salerooms' performance in 1993 - indeed they are still losing custom as private collectors buy wholesale through the auction houses rather than rely on the advice of dealers. This trend will intensify in 1994. The auction houses, with international outlets, are also taking the arrival of VAT in the UK in their stride. Dealers fear that the initial 2 per cent tax will rise inexorably and in time put many of them out of business. 'We are entering the final death rattle of the London art market' says picture dealer Roy Miles. This is an exaggeration. Relatively few major dealers closed up shop during the recession. More merged or gave up their retail outlets to work from home and through fairs. Dealers should take heart from the improvement in demand at the medium and low price range. If the house market improves; if the stock exchange continues to provide windfall profits; if the City spawns more bonus millionaires - some of this surplus wealth is bound to find its way into antiques. The next few weeks will show whether dealers can hope to join in the better prospects of the salerooms. On January 19 at the Business Design Centre in Islington there is Art 94, the now firmly established market place for contemporary art. Major dealers like Crane Kalman, Anthony D'Offay and Karsten Schubert are showing for the first time, and works by Bridget Riley, Bruce McLean, Richard Hamilton, Chagall, Ken Kiff, Peter Howson, and many more will be on offer. Then on January 26 comes the World of Drawings and Watercolours at the Park Lane Hotel, with a wide range of watercolours, from Constable to Sara Armstrong Jones. First time buyers tend to be attracted to either contemporary artists or to traditional watercolours. These fairs cover the possibilities and prices will be no higher than those asked, and not always acheived, last year. So 1994 should offer the proof of the trickle down effect: high prices paid for Picasso in New York lead in time to more sales in Portobello Road. After years of wishful thinking business should be better for the dealers. There may also be fresh ideas in the auction houses. There is a new team at Sotheby's and some important management changes at Christie's. Collecting rises and falls in line with the state of the economy and the omens for that are bullish. Underpinning the revival there is the arrival in 1995 of the Lottery. This will provide the cash to keep the good objects in the UK. It will help museums and galleries to buy again. It will give confidence to the future of the national heritage. It will raise the profile of art and culture. Those dealers that have managed to survive could prosper again - as long as the VAT genie is kept firmly bottled up.</p>

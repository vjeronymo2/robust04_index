			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carmen Castro] </F>   [Text] The Chilean Government has asked the Peruvian  Government to apply appropriate norms in the case of Chilean  terrorists sentenced to life imprisonment in Peru.    The Chilean Government seeks the application of appropriate  norms in the case of three Chileans sentenced to life  imprisonment in Peru. This was stated by Chilean Foreign  Ministry spokesmen.    The Chilean Government considers unapplicable the norms and  jurisdiction of the Peruvian courts that sentenced the Chileans  for the crime of treason to the motherland, a crime valid only  for Peruvians. The defendants are Chilean citizens; therefore,  they cannot be the object of such an accusation, the ministry  spokesmen said.    The Chilean Government wants them tried by a Peruvian  civilian court for the crimes they committed even if they again  receive prison sentences if their guilt in participating in  terrorist actions is demonstrated. These Chileans are connected  with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Army.    The Chilean Government does not oppose a trial but it wants  the application of appropriate norms and procedures according to  international law.    The trial that took place last week in Lima violated the  law,  given that after the defendants were notified of their charges,  they were given only 24 hours to present their defense. The  sentence was issued within the same time span, which is  unacceptable.    The defendants' relatives also said the detained were  mistreated and isolated. They were even sentenced to life  imprisonment by faceless judges.    Several norms were violated, such as the fact that the  defense did not have enough means and time. The law establishing  that witnesses for the prosecution and the defense must testify  under the same conditions was not respected. The four Chileans  involved in this case were questioned on 14 October without  respecting these conditions.    In the face of these juridical violations, the Chilean  Foreign Ministry asked the Peruvian Government for the  appropriate application of justice. The Peruvian Government has  not given an official answer to the Chilean Government yet.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Anti-dumping policy under scrutiny CONTROVERSY over the European Community's use of anti-dumping measures is likely to be stimulated rather than stilled by Gatt's trade policy review. Gatt notes that the EC ranks among the most intensive users of anti-dumping measures worldwide and that EC officials consider its anti-dumping and anti-subsidy law to be 'one of the most important instruments of its common commercial policy'. Dumping occurs when a manufacturer sells a product on an export market at a lower price than that charged on his home market. If dumping can be proved, Gatt rules allow the importing country to impose duties on the product, to protect its own manufacturers. Other countries, in particular Japan and Asian exporters such as Hong Kong and South Korea, have charged Brussels with using the anti-dumping instrument arbitrarily. EC 'screwdriver plant' legislation applying anti-dumping action to products assembled within the Community from imported parts, has already been sanctioned by a Gatt disputes panel. Between 1980 and 1989 the EC implemented 256 anti-dumping measures, the most conspicuous being those taken against imports of Japanese electronic equipment. In roughly two cases out of three the exporter undertook to raise his price rather than have a duty imposed. Brussels' claim that no more than about 1 per cent of total EC imports has been subjected to anti-dumping charges excludes these price undertakings. Moreover, Gatt argues that the uncertainty generated by the EC's frequent resort to anti-dumping action is likely to affect a larger volume of trade. It cites evidence that countries have voluntarily restrained exports to the EC. Gatt highlights an arrangement reached by the EC Commission in February under which seven Japanese producers of advanced Eprom semi-conductors agreed to price undertakings and the Commission threatened to impose a 94 per cent duty on any newcomer not prepared to give a price undertaking. A public interest clause in EC law has apparently had no major impact on Brussels' anti-dumping practices, Gatt says. It notes that only two of the 40 anti-dumping investigations launched between mid-1987 and mid-1988 were terminated within the 12 months stipulated by EC Council regulations. The EC Commission argues that its anti-dumping practice is fair, equitable and in many instances more liberal than that of other countries. The size and accessibility of the EC market made it a prime target for dumping and it was essential for EC producers to benefit from an effective instrument against unfair pricing, the Commission said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC ANTI-DUMPING ACTIONS: 1980-89 (Number of cases)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1980-89                                                         Total  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Complaints             62     46     75     57     38     449 Initiations            36     24     39     40     27     378 Measures taken         12     29     16     18     14     279 of which: definitive duties       8      4      8     18      9      96 price undertakings      4     25      8      0      5     183 Findings of no dumping  2      4      4      0      0      34 Findings of no injury  15      7      4      5      5      63 Measures in force*    166    187    169    133    120       -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Figures refer to measures taken after Jan 1 1980 Source: EC Commission  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

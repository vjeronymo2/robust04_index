			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi has ordered the country's prisons cleared of  all inmates detained without trial or charge, according to reports in the  nation's three English-language newspapers. Moi reportedly issued the order at  a rally earlier in the week. Moi did not name the affected detainees nor their  number, but the papers identified three as lawyer Mirugi Kariuki, business  executive Israel Otieno Agina and a former air force private, Richard Obuon  Guya. The three were detained in crackdowns on groups suspected of trying to  overthrow Moi. Internal security officials could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

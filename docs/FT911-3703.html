			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Union Carbide earnings hit by plant blast FIRST-QUARTER earnings at Union Carbide, the US chemicals producer, would have matched last year's levels were it not for the serious disruption caused by an explosion last month at its chemicals plant at Seadrift, Texas. Net earnings dropped to Dollars 83m or 54 cents a share from Dollars 94m or 65 cents a share. Sales slipped by 3 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn. Union Carbide estimates that the Seadrift explosion cost it about Dollars 18m in lost profits. It expects to restore most ethylene and polyethylene production at the plant by the end of this month, but production of ethylene dioxide and related products is unlikely to restart before the summer. Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman, said the first-quarter earnings were better than expected, thanks to falling raw material costs and strong export shipments of some chemicals, especially ethylene glycol. But he warned that the recession and extra capacity coming on stream may dampen chemicals and plastics earnings for the rest of this year. Industrial gas sales fell by 17 per cent in the quarter.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Probe Into Police Corruption"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Talk of Plot To Undermine MacMillan </H5>   Investigation of police corruption is being undertaken in  the  face of growing suspicion of links with drug trafficking.    Police Commissioner Colonel Trevor MacMillan confirmed  yesterday that the investigation is to be done by an "internal  affairs division."    He could not confirm, however, reports of a plot to  undermine  his administration of the Force through links between renegade  members of the Force and a leading cocaine dealer in the  Corporate Area.    The recent spate of gangland murders (110 killings in the  first 62 days of the year) is linked by police sources with the  plot.    The plot is said to involve the cocaine dealer, who has  powerful overseas connections and is assisted by some  disgruntled policemen, as well as deportees who are allowed  immediate membership in the gang as long as they bring their own  guns.    Asked about the plot, Colonel MacMillan said, "I have no  evidence of it but I would not be surprised because there are  people in the force who are actively involved in the drug trade.  We are developing strategies to deal with it but I am not  prepared to comment further at this time, other than to say I  have the Minister's total support."    MacMillan, determined to break the link between the police  force and drug traffickers, is striving for hard evidence to  establish that there is a link.  <H5>  Fear </H5>   Citizens are reportedly reluctant to come forward and give  evidence for fear of reprisal from renegade cops.    Colonel MacMillan said yesterday, "recently a doctor brought  a patient and the patient's mother to give us information about  where the patient got hooked on cocaine, and police involvement  with that location. Neither the patient nor mother was prepared  to give a signed statement, attend an I.D. parade, or go to  court."    He said this is the kind of thing that happens, making it  difficult for the police to move from intelligence information  to evidence. "For obvious reasons," he said, "people are  reluctant to come forward. They fear for their personal safety."    In the meantime, those renegade officers are fighting back  through the cocaine boss, whose men are reportedly behind many  of the recent murders. Sources tell The Gleaner that  60 to 70 police officers are involved in an islandwide cocaine  network providing protection for crack houses, and escort  services for the transportation of ganja, cocaine and crack.    "As a result of stated government policy," said the Police  Commissioner "an internal affairs division has been set up to  investigate the corruption of policemen."</p>

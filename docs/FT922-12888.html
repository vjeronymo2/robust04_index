			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Ameritech sees rising economy AMERITECH, one of the seven Baby Bells, said its first-quarter results revealed signs that the Midwest's economy was emerging from the national recession. Its net income for the first quarter was Dollars 337m, up 19.1 per cent over last year's Dollars 283m. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.26 for the three months ended March 31, compared with Dollars 1.07 a year ago. Mr William Weiss, Ameritech's chairman, said the rate of line growth was improving and that customers were using the telephones more. 'We are increasingly optimistic that the Midwest economy is on the mend,' he said. Net income for the first quarter also included Dollars 28m, or about 10 cents per share, from interest income on a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. Without the IRS settlement's interest, earnings per share were Dollars 1.16, or an increase of 8.4 per cent. Revenues for the quarter rose 2.4 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn and the number of customer lines in service increased to 16.7m, or 2 per cent compared with last year. The number of mobile telephone customers shot up 34.8 per cent to 494,000 over the same period a year ago. Ameritech had to postpone the release of its quarterly results until yesterday because of flooding in Chicago on Monday, which also forced it to move the venue of its annual meeting to its suburban offices. Ameritech is the parent company of the Bell companies serving Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.</p>

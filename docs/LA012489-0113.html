			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LOSS OF CABIN PRESSURE FORCES JETLINER TO LAND  </P> <P> A leaky cargo door seal caused the cabin of a Braniff jetliner bound for Kansas  City to depressurize, forcing the airliner to return to Dallas-Ft. Worth  International Airport, a Braniff spokesman said Monday.  </P> <P> None of the 51 passengers or crew of five aboard Flight 548 were injured  Sunday, although air masks dropped from overhead and the Boeing 737 made a  steep descent from 31,000 to 10,000 feet, Braniff spokeswoman Irma Ellis said.  </P></p>

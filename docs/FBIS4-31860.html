			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages between quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] The Czech Government today approved an amendment to  the banking law that does not cover insurance on deposits.  Konsolidacni banka can now be added to the four financial  institutions whose obligations are currently guaranteed by the  state.    [Prime Minister Klaus] "The insurance of deposits will be  dealt with in a calmer, unhurried way."    According to the prime minister, this is a temporary  bridging  amendment until an entirely new banking law is prepared.    [Klaus] "We need more time for this new law, some peace,  which is why we have now opted for a partial temporary amendment  toward strengthening banking supervision and strengthening or  tightening the regulatory framework from the viewpoint of the  central bank vis-a-vis the commercial banks, with the  unambiguous aim of safeguarding or attempting to safeguard the  interests of depositors."    For example, any bank can be fined up to 50 million korunas  or have its basic assets reduced for irregularities in its  activities. To the existing irregularities for which banks can  be punished by the Czech National Bank are now added engaging in  banking trade that harms the interests of depositors and having  nonprofessionals or people who are not civically irreproachable  [osoby obcansky bezuhonne] in management positions.    The amendment also permits the forced administration of a  bank for up to two years and further extends the powers of the  administrator.</p>

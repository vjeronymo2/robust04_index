			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Senate puts off vote on Clinton crime bill: Tempers fray as members yearn for a break Leaders in the US Senate had to put off any vote on the administration's crime bill yesterday, but at least began debate on the measure. On Sunday night, the House of Representatives had voted to pass a slimmed-down bill with somewhat less money for crime prevention programmes than the White House wanted. Some opponents of the legislation, led by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, were still threatening to use the kind of obstructive procedural tactics that held the bill up in the House for two weeks. Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said it would be 'a disgrace to the country' if the bill's opponents were to block the measure. Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, said such an attempt would be 'unwise, both substantively and politically.' Senator Joseph Biden, who as chairman of the judiciary committee will manage the bill in the Senate, said that he believed the bill would be 'awfully hard to stop,' but he acknowledged that he faced a hard task in keeping together a coalition of colleagues so as to maintain the 60 votes needed to overcome procedural obstacles. 'My dilemma is to get virtually all the Democrats and between five and eight Republicans,' he said. In the final House vote on Sunday night, the bill won the backing of 188 Democrats, 46 Republicans and the lone Congressional independent, while 131 Republicans and 64 Democrats - mostly opponents of either gun control or the death penalty - voted against it. Ever since President Bill Clinton's stunning defeat in a procedural vote in the House two weeks ago, the crime bill has overshadowed everything else for the administration. White House officials said the first question on Vice-President Al Gore's lips, when he emerged from surgery on Sunday after injuring his Achilles tendon in a basketball game, was: 'What's going on with the crime bill?' Yesterday, crime pushed aside the Senate's snail-paced debate over healthcare reform, offering some members a welcome break from an argument that has already eaten one week out of the Congressional summer holiday. House members, at least, were able to go home after the climactic vote on Sunday, but Senator Mitchell says he plans to keep the Senate in Washington until it has completed action on a healthcare reform bill, despite the advice of Senator Daniel Moynihan, finance committee chairman, that he allow senators to take a break. 'I will do whatever the leader wants done, but I think he might decide that we've talked enough, and we've listened to each other enough,' he said on Sunday. Congressman Robert Matsui appeared unimpressed by the Senate's feeling that it needed a rest. 'It's not as much a problem for them. As you know, they have older kids because they're older people,' he said. But, with tempers fraying on all sides, Mr Mitchell and Mr Clinton may conclude that, if they can bring the crime bill to passage, they would be better to leave the healthcare reform bill to one last, convulsive effort in September. That may leave very little time to complete the measure before members start fretting to go home to campaign for re-election in November.</p>

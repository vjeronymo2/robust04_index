In a statement issued today, the follow-up committee said  the  humanity of the U.S. Congressional delegation is confined to  Israeli soldiers while the fate of 300 prisoners in Israeli  prisons is ignored. For over nine years Israel has refused to  allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit  al-Khiyam prison. And over 165 Lebanese have been held in the  enemy's prisons since the 1982 invasion. Israel is also holding  the bodies of 125 martyrs.    The committee said this shows the inhumane nature of the  U.S.  stance, which uses Israeli double standards and views our issue  with an Israeli eye.    The committee called on the Lebanese Government to adopt a  firm stance on the international silence regarding the issue of  the detainees.</p>

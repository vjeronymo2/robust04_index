			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 14 (TANJUG) -- The Foreign  Ministry of the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) on Monday sent to  all diplomatic and consular missions in Belgrade a note warning  that the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs was based on false  premises.    On February 9, the NATO council threatened to launch air  strikes against the Bosnian Serbs unless they withdrew their  heavy artillery 20 kilometres from the centre of Sarajevo within  ten days.    The unprovoked ultimatum is based on two false premises, the  first being that the Bosnian Serbs are responsible for the  massacre in Sarajevo on February 5 and the second that the  Bosnian Serb Army is keeping Sarajevo under siege, the RSK  ministry said in the note, which also includes a declaration of  the RSK Parliament on solidarity with the Serbs in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted on Saturday.    All well-meaning people have realised that only the Moslem  authorities in that part of the city could have caused the  explosion, the note says.    "The untruth that Sarajevo is under a Serb seige has been  fostered over the past two years by the Western media and it now  seems beyond question. The truth, however, is different because  the city is actually divided on Serb and Moslem parts which are  both contiguous to their respective states," the RSK Foreign  Ministry said in the note.    The RSK authorities and Army see NATO's ultimatum as a  hostile act also against the RSK, which is ready to help the  Bosnian Serb Republic in its defence from a possible aggression,  it said.    The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in the Serb-populated areas  within the administrative borders of the former Yugoslav  Republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's secession from the  former Yugoslav Federation and the attempt to downgrade the  status of the Serbs from that of the constituent people to that  of an ethnic minority.    In March 1992, the RSK territory was proclaimed a United  Nations Protected Area (UNPA).</p>

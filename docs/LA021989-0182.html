			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO: VAGUE DEFINITION CAN RAISE QUESTIONS  </P> <P> Because the definition of the term Latino is vague, experts say minority  contracting programs are rife with vendors whose status as Latinos is  debatable.  </P> <P> GTE California, for example, is reviewing the status of Doty Brothers Equipment  Co. in Norwalk, which did $2.2 million in heavy construction work for the  utility last year.  </P> <P> The company has qualified as Latino-owned at several utilities and government  agencies, President John T. Doty said, because his grandfather was born in  Brazil.  </P> <P> Asked if he considered himself Hispanic, Doty acknowledged that he is "kind of  ambivalent" about the issue.  </P> <P> "In thinking about the question, I can't give an answer," he said. "The only  racial slurs ever thrown at me have been in Mexico, where I've been called a  gringo."  </P> <P> But Doty said he does not believe that he has taken advantage of the utilities'  minority contracting programs, because he gets work only when he offers the  best price.  </P> <P> "In my experience in construction, it's the bottom line," he said. "It's  whatever we bid." JIM SCHACHTER  </P></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: (Asia Pacific): Strong yen hits Nikkei as Taipei rebounds The continued strength of the yen hit investor confidence and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground as market participants closed their positions ahead of today's national holiday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was off 165.83 at 19,750.65 after a day's high of 19,891.78 and low of 19,713.94. A decline in the futures market due to Tuesday's fall in stock and bond prices on Wall Street prompted arbitrage unwinding, while corporate investors were also seen selling shares. Large-capitalisation steels and shipbuilders were lower on institutional profit-taking. The dollar reached a record low of Y96.35 in spite of heavy Bank of Japan intervention, hurting export-oriented high-technology stocks and car makers. Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of the leading brokerage company, forecast that the yen could rise further in the long term. Nomura took the view that the widening of Japan's trade surplus with the US, due to growth in the global economies and the J-curve effect, could put further pressure on the yen-dollar rate. Volume totalled 250m shares, against 247m. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 10.67 to 1,568.68 and the Nikkei 300 shed 2.18 to 287.01. Falls led rises by 671 to 303, with 194 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.39 at 1,288.60. Mitsubishi Oil, the most active issue of the day, plunged Y60 to Y980. The company confirmed that it had failed to extract oil from its second well off the coast of Vietnam. Other petroleum distributors were also weaker, with Cosmo Oil down Y22 to Y738 and Japan Energy losing Y16 at Y410. Electronics shares were weak. TDK declined Y120 to Y4,700 and Sony Y70 to Y5,850. Heavy electricals fell, NEC retreating Y20 to Y1,210. Carmakers were also lower. Nissan Motor dropped Y16 to Y814 and Isuzu Motors Y11 to Y518. Japan Tobacco dipped Y30,000 to Y10.8m and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y12,000 to Y908,000. Japan Telecom sagged Y90,000 to Y3.53m, while East Japan Railway lost Y2,000 at Y482,000. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 111.57 to 21,976.87 in volume of 59.2m shares. Roundup Wall Street inhibited trading in some Pacific Rim markets, while Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Bombay were closed for holidays. TAIPEI rebounded 2.3 per cent after Tuesday's 5 per cent fall, with rises led by paper, steel and conglomerate shares. The weighted index gained 141.45 at 6,342.66, off a 6,372.65 day's high, but turnover was a modest TDollars 57.81bn. Buying emerged in the last 20 minutes as two new funds, with TDollars 5bn each, entered the market. Paper stocks led the rally, rising 4.6 per cent on pulp price increases, with Chung Hwa Pulp up its 7 per cent limit to TDollars 41.90. HONG KONG saw selling by foreign investors which left the Hang Seng index 121.64 or 1.3 per cent lower at 9,451.76, in spite of comments by a senior government adviser that the long awaited Sino-British airport financing pact would be signed within days. Blue chips bore the brunt of the selling. Swire Pacific 'A' fell HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 56.25, HSBC HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 90 and Cheung Kong 60 cents to HKDollars 36.40. Hong Kong Telecom, which announced interim results on Tuesday, fell further on profit-taking, relinquishing 40 cents at HKDollars 15.80. SYDNEY was lower in light volume, taking its direction from Wall Street. The All Ordinaries index ended 16.8 down at 2,011.2. The debut of Acacia Resources, the minerals subsidiary floated off by Shell Australia, saw strong institutional support, the stock finishing at a 38-cent premium to the ADollars 2.00 issue price. MANILA was supported by a strong nine-month earnings report from Petron, and the composite index picked up 22.13 to 3,090.65. The oil refiner jumped 5.9 per cent to a new high of 27.00 pesos. SEOUL saw profit-taking coupled with Won10bn of sales by the market stabilisation fund which pulled the composite index 2.69 lower to 1,105.74. Construction shares lost ground on market talk that the government might take punitive action against some companies for corruption; the sub-index shed 11.82 to 569.85. In a separate situation, Dong-Ah Construction went limit down on reports that its chairman would be summoned for questioning in connection with the collapse of a Seoul bridge last month. It fell Won1,300 to Won29,600.</p>

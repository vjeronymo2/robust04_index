			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Congressional sources today  told EFE that the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies is investigating  reports on the exchange of young prostitutes for cocaine on the  Brazilian border with Bolivia.    A delegation of three deputies today went to investigate the  charges raised by residents of Brazilian townships located in  border areas with Bolivia in Mato Grosso, Acre, and Rondonia.    The deputies investigating the report are socialist Deputy  Chico Vigilante and conservative Deputies Maria Valadin and  Zelia Mendes, who serve on the Chamber special committee that  investigates child prostitution.    According to the reports received by the committee, the  minors are in the 11-16 age bracket -- although one was eight  years old. They are exchanged for cocaine and taken to coca  growing and producing areas in Bolivia as prostitutes for the  men working there.    The delegation will hear testimonies of state and municipal  officials and local residents.    Some witnesses told the congressmen that a presumably  Brazilian couple is recruiting minors in the Amazon region,  ostensibly to work as household servants in Sao Paulo, but these  minors are taken to the border with Bolivia to be exchanged for  cocaine.    The congressional committee, which started to work six  months  ago, will release its final report on 31 May.    Social democratic Deputy Moroni Torgan, who is a police  officer and the rapporteur of this committee, was rather  cautious about this case but did not rule out this type of crime.</p>

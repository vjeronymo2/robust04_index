			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Markets: A fine line between hope and fear - London Markets THESE DAYS, you have to fight your way to a fax machine at the FT. Other newspapers get their stories by lying amid the bougainvillea above Fergie's holiday hideaway, or bugging Antonia de Sancha's boudoir. Here we wait for people to fax us their recriminations. So the machines are constantly surrounded by a crowd of elbowing journalists, each trying to grab the next scoop as it drops, curled and semi-legible, on to the floor. Last in the queue, the London Markets column could only lay its hands on other people's rejects: a motley collection of wheezes for getting Britain back into the ERM, resignation letters from ministers, hastily crossed-out drafts of Tory conference speeches - all with zero intellectual content. Only one missive, apparently from Germany, appeared worth reprinting: . . . fullest possible support. So there. And another thing. It's all very well Mr Lamont and his colleagues talking as if the UK can now have a made-in-Britain economic policy. But only countries that dominate their economic zone, trade very little, or have a record of long-term monetary stability can truly achieve policy independence. The UK fulfils none of these conditions. Which means that like it or not, the UK will have to pay attention to economic conditions abroad, as manifested through the exchange rate. The working papers that the British treasury is even now preparing, with titles such as 'Monetary Policy in a Floating World', are thus, I regret to say, worthless. What will happen, I confidently predict, is that the government will watch the pound sliding, initially with nonchalance, then with concern and finally with panic. It will find itself forced to take steps to stop the pound falling further, if only by giving up the interest rate cuts it had previously hoped for. The UK will thus have exchanged a 'hard' exchange rate target for a 'soft' one; large-scale intervention will be unnecessary but in other respects the disciplines will be the same. The chancellor, whoever he may be, will find himself tied just as closely as before to the economic policy of his principal trading partners. The only difference is that he will find himself doing so at a rate of DM 2.40 to the pound (or lower]) instead of DM 2.95. Turning now to the comments on the matter in the popular British press, I note with satisfaction the leading article in the Sun dated Friday October 2, giving full support to the policy of the Bundesbank. 'Mr Major dare not get tough with the Germans,' the Sun wrote, 'because he knows they are right.' Stimmt. The stock market may not have the same access to disgruntled policymakers as the FT, but it keeps abreast of the Sun. As this line of thinking sank in during the week, the market sagged. The FT-SE 100 index closed at 2549.7, down 51.3 on the week. It is now 11 per cent above its pre-devaluation intra-day low of 2,291.3; perhaps more significantly, it is roughly half-way between this year's high of over 2,700 in May and the 2,300 or so at which the index was trading in early September before the currency crisis. That mid-point reflects a neat balance of hopes and fears: hopes that the devaluation has freed the corporate sector from the slide into depression that continued membership of the ERM seemed to imply; fears that even so, the domestic and international economic climate is so unfavourable that the recovery implicit in the May level of the index is still far off. One side-effect of the government's failed attempt to prop up the pound could help move the market out of that range, argues Paul Walton, strategist at James Capel. The government's heavy international borrowing, part of its sterling support operations, has raised much of the money it would otherwise have had to get from the gilt market. Institutional investors, who had previously earmarked a big chunk of their next six months' Pounds 16bn or so of cash flow for gilts, will find themselves free to put most of it into equities. With stronger economic growth next year, a slightly higher yield ratio, and a greater likelihood that wavering finance directors will now hold their dividends, that means that the market could move to a prospective dividend yield of just over 4 per cent from its current level of 5 per cent - which implies a 30 per cent rise in share prices. Before you rejoice, consider the other case: sterling continues to weaken, the government is forced to keep interest rates relatively high, consumer confidence is unsettled by the currency crisis, companies keep on sacking workers, profits stay weak, the world economic outlook darkens. Even if investors give only a minority weighting to this possibility, it will help keep their headier expectations under control. A similar air of reined-in expectations was evident in the market's reaction to Hongkong Land's purchase of 15 per cent of Trafalgar House in a dawn raid on Thursday. At first, the shares jumped 29p to close at 89 1/2 p. By Friday, though, investors had had a chance to digest the fact that Hongkong Land's announced intention to go to just under 30 per cent and stick there would prevent it, under Takeover Panel rules, from launching a full bid for a year. The shares fell back, closing on Friday at 85 1/2 p - 51 per cent higher than they were a week ago, but still well below the 160p of May. As the chart shows, the performance of Trafalgar shares stands in marked contrast with that of P&amp;O shares. Hongkong Land clearly feels there is scope for recouping some of the Pounds 2bn value the stock market attributed to the company as recently as 1989; it may find itself needing Oriental supplies of patience to achieve them.</p>

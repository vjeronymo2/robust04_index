The Uruguay Round formally concluded on the scheduled date  of  December 15, 1993. The flurry of negotiations towards the end  mainly involved the two major trading partners, the United  States and the EC and, to a limited extent, Japan, India and the  other developing countries were on the periphery of the  negotiations throughout. For them the final package remained  almost the same as assembled by Mr. Arthur Dunkel, the former  Director-General of GATT, in his celebrated text.    Since the adoption of the text, in order to defend its  position the Government of India seems to have mounted a  publicity blitzkrieg in which no holds are barred, and no  argument or interpretation, however flimsy or far-fetched, is to  be discarded. From all this one very nearly gets the impression  that the final outcome of the Uruguay Round is tailor-made to  suit India's interest.    It is claimed that our exports will go up by an additional  $1.5 to 2 billions annually, that there will be a real spurt in  our agricultural exports, that the IPR regime will bring us a  lot of benefits, that our policies and practices in the vital  areas of investment, food security, farmers' right to reuse and  sell patented seed varieties, and obligation to grant minimum  access, for agricultural imports, will remain intact. It is also  claimed that with the adoption of the Uruguay Round we have  emerged from the twilight of the old jaded GATT trading system  to a new liberal "orderly multilateral trading system."    In defending the Dunkel Text the Government and its  supporters are mixing up two entirely different sets of  arguments. At one level, they are defensive and are arguing that  India had no alternative but to accept the Dunkel Text because  we were isolated and because we cannot keep out of the  multilateral trading system. This implies that there is  something intrinsically wrong with the Text, but we can neither  avoid it nor do without it. At the other level, they go on the  offensive and interpret the specific provisions of the Text to  bring out how they serve India's interest. There is definitely a  contradiction in these two sets of arguments.    On both the issues of India's isolation and the perils of  India remaining outside the multilateral trading system, a  number of related questions arise which have never been  answered. Why did India allow itself to be isolated? When did  the isolation occur and who were responsible for it? Were there  any objective factors, internal or external, accounting for this  isolation? Similarly, why did we allow ourselves to be led like  a sacrificial lamb to the altar of the multilateral trading  system? Did we really have no leverages at all? How about the  size of our economy, and market, our infrastructural base and  our trained manpower, of which we are never tired of boasting in  other contexts? How about the bargaining value of the massive  liberalisation that we have undertaken as a part of our  structural adjustment programme? Were we able to take advantage  of them? And if we were not then what were the reasons? Some day  the Government will have to come out clean on these points.    Keeping these arguments of tactics and strategy aside for  the  time being, let us examine what we have lost and gained in  certain key areas. In most of these areas, the Government's  argument runs on the following lines. "We have been given a  transitional period of 5 to 10 years. We can maintain our  present regime for the time being. No changes need be made in  our present policies." This is good as far as it goes. But  should we not pay greater attention to the new international  regimes that have been established or would emerge and see how  we are going to fare under them rather than harping on the  temporary relief or reprieve that we have been given?    The most dismal part of the score card is TRIPS. Here we  have  gained nothing and lost everything that we could have. In 5-10  years time, India will no longer be able to manufacture  life-saving drugs based on process-patent. All these drugs will  have to be imported. Statistical figures relating to some 30  drugs in the category show that today the United States prices  are 2.63 times to 71.29 times costlier than those prevailing in  India and the U.K. prices are 2.45 times to 47.88 times  costlier. On what basis can then the Government say that the  price increase will be only by 20 to 60 per cent.    Apparently, they are quoting the average figure, taking into  account all drugs--life-saving or otherwise, and patented as  well as unpatented. The measures the Government is talking about  for keeping the prices at a reasonable level are in the nature  of bravado. The Drug Control Rules will not help because there  is no way the importers can be forced to sell the drugs they  import at a price 5-10 times lower than what they paid. Of  course, the Government can subsidise; but this will be at the  cost of the exchequer. The Government will also find itself  helpless in getting the drugs manufactured in the country  because, according to the Dunkel Text on TRIPS, for the  application of the patent "importation" is as good as "local  production." Moreover, it will be extremely difficult, if not  impossible, for the Government to ensure the working of the  patent. There is no provision in the Dunkel Text on "compulsory  licensing" of the kind provided in the Indian Patent Act of  1970. The provision for "other use without the authorisation of  the right holder" contains so many safeguards--such as offer of  "reasonable terms and conditions," payment of "adequate  remuneration," and all these--that it will be well nigh  impossible to oblige the patent holder to work the patent in the  country. Thus, we will remain perpetually dependent on the  import of patented drugs. The much-touted argument that  consumers can switch over from the more expensive on-patent  drugs to less expensive off-patent drugs is misplaced. There is  no consumers' sovereignty in the market of life-saving drugs.  The patient goes by the doctor's prescription and the doctor  prescribes under the influence, both direct and indirect, of the  sales drive of the drug companies. Thus the consumers in India  must brace for paying 3-4 times more, and in many cases, even  high prices, for this category of drugs.    The new IPR regime will have a debilitating effect on our  technological development which is a critical factor for  economic growth. All scientific and technological activities  based on process patenting will have to be wound up in 5-10  years. An important source of obtaining technology, i.e., by the  compulsory working of patents, will no longer be available.    It is claimed that the provisions in the Dunkel Text on  agriculture will give a great fillip to our agricultural  exports. This claim is highly exaggerated because our  agricultural exports depend on a variety of factors many of  which have nothing to do with the Dunkel Text. In the exports of  high-value agricultural products, such as fruits, vegetables,  plants and flowers, the price factor is not all that important.  The two factors that are important are micro-management, and  availability of adequate infrastructural facilities. We have to  have much improved transportation system, refrigeration  facilities, we have to maintain quality, ensure timely delivery  and apply very high sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards laid  down in the Dunkel Text. All this is not going to be an easy  task. Besides, it should be remembered that the reduction in the  barriers to trade in agriculture is not going to exceed 30 per  cent on an average. It is doubtful if a 30 per cent increase in  prices will be enough for us to break into the international  market. Besides, this is going to be available to our  competitors also who are all lower cost producers of  agricultural products.    Finally, we should not dismiss the far-reaching consequences  of our accepting the obligation of importing a minimum of 3.3  per cent of our total consumption of agricultural product. This  is bound to affect the entire pattern of our agricultural  economy--our food security, our agricultural price system, our  crop pattern, our subsidisation system, etc. The fact that we  are not obliged to provide minimum access now because we are  applying import restrictions on balance-of-payments ground is  not much of a comfort. As already stated, we should think of the  regime that is being put in place and not the temporary relief  we can get. Besides, we have today accumulated a reserve of  about $8 billions. It is now open to the IMF to certify any day  that India is no longer facing balance-of-payment difficulty and  the new regime should apply to it. How long shall we be allowed  to go on invoking the GATT balance-of-payment clause? We should  not forget that negotiators from the developed countries have  always said that this clause provides free-ride for the  developing countries and that one of their objectives is to  eliminate the free-riding privilege.</p>

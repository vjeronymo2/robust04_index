			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares rally following good company results - Market report The setback to base rate optimism continued to overhang equities in London yesterday, but shares rallied from a potentially testing level to close well above the worst in spite of losses in other European bourses. London also brushed off a weak opening to the new Wall Street session as Federal bonds declined following the latest data on US retail sales. 'There was no question of heavy selling in London,' was the comment from the dealing room of a leading international house. At the market opening, UK stocks gained more than 11 points on the Footsie after an unexpectedly stable performance in New York overnight encouraged bargain hunters. However, gains were quickly wiped out on signs that US houses were sellers of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of the UK blue chips. The gain on the Footsie was soon turned into a fall which ranged to just over 15 points. This brought the index to 3,356.9, focusing attention on the 3,350 mark, which has been identified as the nearest defence line. Consequently, traders were heartened when, with the session still barely under way, shares began to rally. The market was helped by good trading figures from TSB bank and from Rank Organisation, the leisure industry group. Losses were almost halved, until Wall Street opened lower. By the close of business in London, the Dow Industrial Average was down by 11 points. The final reading on the FT-SE Index of 3,360, down 12 points, was regarded as a good performance in view of the sharp setbacks in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Some strategists have warned that the flow of US investment cash towards European markets may be slackening as global funds take a more positive view of Japan. The rally in the blue chip stocks was accompanied by a strong resumption of support across the market's second line issues. At its closing reading of 3,882.1, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index showed a gain of 17.5. Non-Footsie business remained high, making up some 60 per cent of the day's total of 899.1m shares. On Wednesday, Seaq volume of 807.6m brought Pounds 1.8bn in retail worth, fully maintaining the market's run of profitable trading levels. The profits and dividend news from TSB was warmly received in the stock market, providing a convincing opening to the final 1993 results season which is eagerly awaited for signs that economic recovery is showing through at the bottom line on corporate trading accounts. The same was true of the trading statement from Rank Organisation, and both announcements were followed by a crop of favourable sector forecasts from market analysts. Today brings the end of a two week trading account in UK equities which has seen share prices in London and across Europe give back some of the more exuberant gains chalked up over the Christmas period. A technical bout of profit-taking was expected in London and traders are not yet convinced that the postponement of base rate hopes has raised any more serious threat. Equity analysts are prepared to wait until spring for any base rate move, and some pointed out yesterday that sterling's strength against the DM could provide a further reason for trimming UK interest rates.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Puerto Ricans ponder future: Governor who got it wrong will step down MR Rafael Hernandez Colon, the governor of Puerto Rico, has decided against seeking another term in elections this year, after misreading the mood of the 3.3m people of the island about their political future. The decision of the governor, who has been in office since 1984 and served an earlier term between 1972 and 1976, has coincided with increasing concern over the economic future of the US Caribbean possession, and over whether tax preferences which have contributed to its economic health will be continued. Mr Hernandez Colon has been losing popularity, not only among Puerto Ricans in general, but in his own Partido Popular Democratico (PPD), where he was being challenged for the candidacy in this year's gubernatorial elections by the popular Mrs Victoria Munoz Mendoza. The governor's decision to step aside will spare the PPD a damaging battle over the candidacy, at a time when it could least afford one. Mr Hernandez Colon's decision also means a PPD united under Mrs Munoz Mendoza will present a stronger challenge to the opposition Partido Nuevo Progresista, led by Mr Pedro Rosello, which has been gaining in popular support from public disfavour with Mr Hernandez Colon. Mr Hernandez Colon committed a seemingly grave error of judgment last month, leading the PPD to a setback in a referendum which it lost by a wide margin. Puerto Ricans were asked to say whether they supported his proposals for a package of 'democratic rights'. These included a guarantee of continued US citizenship for Puerto Ricans regardless of any future changes in the island's political status, maintaining Spanish as the territory's official language, and protection for Puerto Rico's 'cultural identity'. The referendum was a clear effort by Mr Hernandez Colon and his party to influence Puerto Ricans, and Washington, over the island's political status. Puerto Ricans have been contemplating their political future, and a plebiscite will give them a chance to decide whether they want to continue the current 'commonwealth 'relationship with the US, become a state of the union, or be politically independent. Puerto Ricans are US citizens, but cannot vote for a president. The island is represented in Washington by a commissioner who has no vote to influence legislation. Mr Hernandez Colon's PPD supports an enhancement of the current quasi-colonial 'commonwealth' relationship with the US, while the opposition PNP, led by Mr Rosello, advocates a move to statehood. Support for the government's proposals would have damaged the island's chances of becoming a state: Washington is unlikely to look kindly at having a Spanish-speaking state in the union. And islanders showed little enthusiasm for independence, relegating the Partido Independentista Puertoriqueno (PIP) to a distant third place in recent elections. When the referendum on statehood is held, the decision is likely to turn on economic issues. As a 'commonwealth', Puerto Rico benefits significantly from transfers of federal funds and its economy rests on a section of the US Revenue Code which gives tax breaks to mainland companies investing in the island. Federal transfers reached Dollars 7.7bn (Pounds 4.2bn) in 1990, the highest ever received by the island, with half going to welfare programmes and the rest to government expenditure. On a per capita basis, however, this was less than was received by the poorer US states. Even supporters of statehood in Puerto Rico agree that changes which would have to be made if the island became a state could see a reduction in the flow of federal funds. The Puerto Rican administration committed itself to providing Dollars 100m a year for lending to Caribbean and Central American states. Loans totalling about Dollars 700m have been approved for a range of ventures, mainly in Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Costa Rica. Caribbean states which have gained from Mr Hernandez Colon's programme will be keen to determine whether Mrs Munoz Mendoza, if elected, will continue the facility. It is unlikely that a PNP administration, should Mr Rosello win, will find the financing facility compatible with its desire for the island to become a state.</p>

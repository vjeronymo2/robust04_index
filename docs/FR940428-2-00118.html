			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date and Place_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> July 1, 1993; Mountainside Hospital; Montclair, New Jersey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nature and Probable Consequences <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _On December 1, 1993, during a routine inspection, NRC identified a therapeutic misadministration involving a high-dose-rate (HDR) remote afterloader, which occurred at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, New Jersey, on July 1, 1993. NRC identified the misadministration while reviewing the licensee's Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) meeting minutes for 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 1, 1993, a patient was scheduled to receive the last of three brachytherapy treatments to the right mainstem bronchus. Each fraction was to deliver 750 centigray (cGy) (750 rad) to the target using a Nucletron Mitro-Selectron HDR remote afterloader and an intrabronchial catheter. During the July 1, 1993 treatment, the radiation oncologist mistakenly connected the catheter to the HDR afterloader with a 750 mm (29.5 inch) transfer tube instead of a short connector. This prevented the source from entering the intrabronchial catheter, and while delivering a negligible dose to the tumor, the face, the lenses of the eyes, the thyroid, and the whole body of the patient received unscheduled exposure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The source strength at the time of the incident was 161,000 megabecquerel (4.35 curie) of iridium-192 and the exposure time was 445.5 seconds. Following the reconstruction of the incident by the licensee, the surface does to the lens of the left eye was determined by the licensee to be 1.97 cGy (1.97 rad), the does to the chin (the closest surface of the body) was 4.56 cGy (4.56 rad), and the dose to the thyroid was 3.07 cGy (3.07 rad). The physician identified the error upon termination of the treatment and wrote a memorandum about the incident to the hospital's physicist and radiation safety officer (RSO). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The physician mistakenly determined that the incident was not a misadministration, and so advised the RSO. The RSO, relying on the physician's judgment, did not notify NRC and filed the report in the RSC minutes folder. The radiation oncologist decided against making up the missed third fraction of therapy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 3, 1993, NRC notified the licensee by telephone that the event constituted a misadministration and the licensee notified the NRC Operations Center the same day. The licensee's written report of the misadministration, dated December 13, 1993, was received in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC Region I office on December 17, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After review of the report, Region I called the licensee to determine if the referring physician and the patient were notified of the misadministration. The licensee forwarded a copy of a letter dated December 20, 1993, from the radiation oncologist to the referring physician confirming a December 6, 1993, telephone conversation in which the referring physician was informed of the misadministration. The letter indicated that the referring physician did not feel it would be in the patient's best interest to be notified of the misadministration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC contracted a medical consultant to determine the significance of the misadministration to the patient. The medical consultant's report was received by Region I on February 3, 1994. The consultant's calculations of doses to the lens of the left eye, the chin, and the thyroid of the patient agreed with the licensee's estimates, based on the strength of the source, the time of exposure and the distances of the source from the patient. The consultant concluded that the patient would not suffer any adverse effects from the misadministration. The medical consultant also determined that the oncologist failed to notify the patient of the misadministration because he did not fully understand the requirements of 10 CFR 35.33(a)(3). After discussions with the consultant, the referring physician agreed to inform the patient of the misadministration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cause or Causes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _An error by the attending physician in connecting the catheter to the HDR remote afterloader, and the failure of the console operator to recognize the faulty connection were the direct causes of the event. Both individuals relied on the treatment computer to indicate any problems with the therapy setup. The computer on a Nucletron HDR is not designed to alert the user to an incorrect connection of a longer transfer tube. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the medical consultant's report indicates that the second individual observing the transfer tube connection during each treatment setup was a different console operator. Since the console operator in attendance during the third treatment had not been present during the prior treatments, he/she was unaware of the intended setup. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Actions Taken to Prevent Occurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Licensee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The licensee arranged for additional training by Nucletron on July 30, 1993. The training was attended by both HDR remote afterloader units authorized users and by three technologist-console operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _NRC is reviewing the licensee's December 17, 1993 misadministration report and the findings of the December 1, 1993 NRC inspection. An NRC medical consultant was retained to review the misadministration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The medical consultant's report dated February 1, 1994, was received by the NRC Region I office on February 3, 1994. (The medical consultant's report will be placed in the file for Docket No. 03&hyph;02470 located in the Region I Materials License Docket Room. An inspection report will be issued to the licensee by February 18, 1994, and will be available in the PDR.) In addition to the comment made in the above sections, the consultant indicated that if the licensee had required a medical physicist to be present during every setup and treatment as recommended in NRC Bulletin 93&hyph;01, it is likely that this misadministration would not have occurred. In the consultant's opinion, a medical physicist would have been more likely to have noticed the human error in the setup of the third HDR treatment. An enforcement conference has been scheduled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 94&hyph;14&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Exposure to a Nursing Infant at Queen's Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a moderate exposure to, or release of, radioactive material licensed by or otherwise regulated by the Commission can be considered an abnormal occurrence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date and Place <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _December 2, 1991; Queen's Medical Center; Honolulu, Hawaii. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nature and Probable Consequences_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 25, 1993, during a routine safety inspection, a Region V inspector discovered an unreported unscheduled exposure to the thyroid of a 9-month-old nursing infant. On December 2, 1991, a patient was administered 0.56 megabecquerel (15 microcuries) of iodine-131 for a diagnostic scan. Although the patient noted on a hospital form that she was breastfeeding, the technologist failed to notice this notation until the patient returned for a scan the following day. The patient was informed of the oversight by the licensee and was instructed to stop breastfeeding. The authorized user and the referring physician were also notified on December 3, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee's Radiation Safety Officer calculated the infant's absorbed thyroid dose to be approximately 250 millisievert (mSv) (25 rem) based on information obtained during the uptake scan of the mother 6 hours after the administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC retained a medical consultant to evaluate the circumstances of this misadministration. The consultant estimated the dose to the infant's thyroid to be between 160 to 650 mSv (16 to 65 rem). The medical consultant concluded that the infant is not likely to experience any adverse effects as a result of this misadministration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cause or Causes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Failure of a supervised technologist to adequately review the hospital form used to inform the hospital staff that a patient is pregnant or breastfeeding as he/she was instructed by the authorized user. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Licensee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The screening procedure used to inform the hospital staff that a patient is pregnant or breastfeeding was incorporated into the clinical procedure manual.

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Jim Hill, said to be the highest paid local sportscaster, has had his duties  cut at KABC-TV Channel 7. Beginning July 10, Hill, who has nearly two years  left on his reported $800,000-a-year contract, will no longer report sports on  the station's 11 p.m. newscasts. Todd Donoho, formerly a sports personality on  the FNN/Score cable network and currently a sports announcer for the ABC-owned  radio station KLOS-FM, will assume Hill's late-night duties. Hill, who spent 12  years reporting sports for KCBS-TV Channel 2 before moving to KABC two years  ago, will continue to anchor sports on the station's early newscasts and its  Sunday night "Sportscene." Meanwhile, KABC has hired former KCBS and KNBC  weatherman Kevin O'Connell to handle the weather reports on its weekend  newscasts.ALEENE MACMINN  </P></p>

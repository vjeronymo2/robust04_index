			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Abbey National cuts home loan rate ABBEY National yesterday announced a cut in its mortgage interest rate which will postpone until December the benefit of the recent fall in base rates for most of its customers. But it will earn Abbey Pounds 19.5m in extra income. At the same time, it has postponed the earlier cut in its rates which was due to take effect on November 1, along with those of most other mortgage lenders. Abbey National said yesterday that it would cut its standard variable mortgage interest rate by 0.35 percentage points from December 1, bringing the interest charged on a mortgage of less than Pounds 60,000 from the rate of 9.95 per cent due to apply on November 1 down to 9.6 per cent. The new rate applies immediately for new borrowers. Most other lenders are charging 9.95 per cent or 9.99 per cent from November 1, while new customers benefit immediately. Other lenders pointed out that the Abbey move appeared to be based on the assumption that base rates would be cut by 0.5 percentage points by December. 'This means that if there is a 0.5 per cent cut, Abbey National will actually have widened its margins and not passed the benefit on in full to its borrowers,' said one. Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, expressed surprise at the decision not to apply the latest interest rate cut until December. He said it would mean that the society would earn Pounds 19.5m in extra income between now and December 1 by keeping its rates at their levels of before base rates fell to 9 per cent. The cut is so small that other lenders believe it will not make much difference to the housing market. They believe that it is no longer interest rates, but uncertainty about the economy that is now holding back a recovery in the housing market.</p>

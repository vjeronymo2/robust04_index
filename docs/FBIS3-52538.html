			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>   [Text] The suspension of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads'  murderous attacks, designed to enable the deportees to return  home without delay, ended on Wednesday [22 December] morning.  Me'ir Mendelovich, 32, a father of eight children, and Eliyahu  Levin, 25, both from Bene Beraq, were murdered while driving  through Baytuniya, a town near Ramallah. They were giving the  deportees a unique welcoming reception, saturated with Jewish  blood.    The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam murder squads -- the military arm  of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] -- left a leaflet on the  scene of the murder. "This was in revenge for the killing of  'Imad 'Aqil, the Hamas commander of Gaza, and for the killing of  three Tarqumiyah residents by Jews." Brigadier General Sha'ul  Mufaz, the military commander of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza,  required no explanations. "I see no particular daring in the  murders. They want to harm Jews. They lie in wait in places  where they expect to find easy prey, they spot Jews, and they  shoot."    Twenty four of the deportees, who over the past year turned  out to be members of the Hamas military apparatus, preferred to  remain in Lebanon. They will presumably find their niches  either in Hizballah operations or in the military apparatuses of  Hamas. Defense figures believe that many of those who did return  had been instructed and trained at the terrorist academy of  Hizballah.    "Hamas remains the same Hamas. We return stronger, with  greater support and sympathy among the residents of the  territories." This observation was made by Dr. 'Aziz Duwayk,  dean of the geography studies at the Hebron University, one of  the 197 deportees who were allowed to return to the territories  last week. Of these, 65 remained in prison -- some for  interrogation about ties with Hizballah, others for  Hamas-related activities prior to the deportation. About 10  have received administrative detention orders.    Fatah personnel members walked around with long faces this  week. They had hoped that Israel would release a few hundred  security prisoners, in order to offset the joy of their  opposition and to try to stop the erosion of the support for the  peace process. (A survey by the Palestinian Center for Research  in Nabulus, which was published this week, showed that only 41  percent of the territories residents support the peace  agreement, versus 65 percent in September; 38 percent are  opposed to the agreement, versus 28 percent in September.)  Hamas and their opposition partners are now seeking to take  advantage of the deportees' return to create a new momentum for  oppositionist activities.    The 17 December 1992 deportation was carried out at the peak  of the violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah, but the  attitude of the deportees who returned this week was  conciliatory toward Fatah, despite the new political reality  which followed the Rabin-'Arafat handshake.    "We are opposed to this agreement, but we will express our  objection in democratic ways only," Dr. Duwayk stresses. "We  will make sure that not a single drop of Palestinian blood is  spilled in this struggle. Fraternal infighting goes against our  faith, Islam." Referring to press headlines about an  elimination list with names of Fatah members, which was  allegedly brought back by the deportees, Dr. Duwayk says:  "Nonsense. This is not our way."    But violence against Israel will not cease, he adds. Its  causes have not changed. "Rabin wants to give us autonomy. We  want sovereignty. Therefore, I say thank you to autonomy.  Anyway, Rabin wants 'Arafat to be a dictator, because that will  ease the way to his goals. A majority of our nation are against  the agreement. Therefore, you should remember that Rabin signed  an agreement with only one organization out of all the  Palestinian organizations. Were I to record history, I would say  Israel signed an agreement with one man only -- with 'Arafat."    Dr. 'Aziz Duwayk, 45, has seven children. The oldest,  Muhammad, is 15, and the youngest, a four-month-old baby girl,  was born while he was in exile. He named her "Di'ah" -- prayer.  In the Marj al-Zuhur camp, Duwayk was one of the deportee  spokesmen.    It was an extraordinary camp: There were 88 university  students, 30 professors and tutors from territories  universities, 11 doctors, 10 engineers, 18 senior religious  clerics, 10 liberal arts university graduates. Dr. Salamah,  acting president of the Gaza University, was also there. A  distinguished human composition, far beyond the average level of  the Palestinian street. It is, more or less, the human  composition of Hamas.    The camp consisted of several dozen tents. Some were  populated by five or six men, while others housed one man only.  In the center of the camp, a large tent -- 10 by 20 meters --  was set up to serve as a mosque. Its floor was covered with  mats, and a mahrab indicating the direction of prayer, as well  as a small podium for the preacher -- a different one every week  -- were built. "Thank God, we had quite enough preachers,"  Duwayk says, laughing heartily.    Education is one of the most important Hamas values, and  most  of the deportees' days at Marj al-Zuhur were therefore spent in  study. A few days after the deportation, two large tents were  set up for that purpose. A large sign over the entrance to one  of them proclaimed: "The ink in the pen is stronger than the  bullet in the gun."    They had teachers for every subject, plenty of time, and few  students in every classroom. It was a university in every  respect, and the studies conducted there have gained the  recognition of the universities in the territories. Ibrahim  Abu-Salim from Ramallah, for instance, completed his Phd  dissertation in Marj al-Zuhur. The research, which dealt with  the philosophical trends of Islam, was sent to the Sudanese 'Umm  Durman University for approval and earned Abu-Salim a Phd.    They studied biology, geography, education, and Islam at the  Marj al-Zuhur university. The students had a large library at  their disposal, after over 2,000 books were donated by Islamic  universities. The library was arranged in a tent with  carpet-covered flaps and with a large photograph of 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam in the center.    Dr. Duwayk taught geography. "I specifically taught the  geography of southern Lebanon, so that the deportees would know  on which part of the map they were situated. Later I talked  about the geographical conditions of the place. I also taught  them topographical orientation and air currents, to help them  find the direction of the prayer."    Various other lessons were arranged for nonacademic  deportees. Language courses were the most popular. They studied  French, English, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and some even took  an extended, three-level Hebrew course for beginners, mid-level,  and advanced students.    Special professional courses were also launched, teaching  electricity, first aid, and even bee breeding. A course taken  by all the deportees taught Koran reading and comprehension.  Some 350 course and professional training students received  graduation diplomas during the one-year deportation at Marj  al-Zuhur.    A nine-member supreme committee, chosen in democratic  elections by all the deportees, ran the camp's everyday life.  In the last weeks, the deportees elected Mahmud Hasan Sham'a  from Gaza as camp committee chairman -- a honorary appointment  given to the oldest deportee. The camp committee had two tents  -- one for an office and another for gatherings and conferences.    Eleven deported doctors received fellow deportees in two  tents -- a clinic and a hospital. A few weeks after the  deportation, local Lebanese villagers also began frequenting the  clinic. Medicines were received by special order through the  Red Cross.    There was no food shortages. Most was bought in neighboring  Lebanese villages, and in addition, the deportees received  donations from relief and welfare organizations and Palestinian  groups. "Even Fatah people supplied us with food, and there are  many Fatah factions in Lebanon. We received donations from  everyone, even from 'Arafat's people," Duwayk says. "Hizballah  gave us food, too. We were not fussy about the source of  assistance."    [Shaqed] What did you eat?    [Duwayk] Rice, macaroni, meat, chicken, vegetables. All  kinds of cooked food. Occasionally fruit too.    [Shaqed] Who did the cooking?    [Duwayk] Each in his turn cooked and did chores. I, for  instance, cooked majadara, soups, meat, and rice.    The deportees returned with large suitcases filled with  clothing items -- mainly sports clothes. In the first days of  the deportation, they received every conceivable kind of  clothing. Summer clothes were sent with the advent of spring.  The Red Cross supplied blankets.    Their daily activities were arranged around prayer hours.  Even on snowy days, they woke up at 0330 for early morning  prayers. "When we washed to purify our bodies for prayer, water  would freeze on our hands," Duwayk reveals. "But, thank God, we  did it out of love. After the morning prayer, we would gather  for special worship, including personal prayers. We prayed to  God, calling out loud: God, take us back to our homes. God,  please soften Rabin's heart of stone."    After prayers, about one hour was devoted to gymnastics and  sports -- judo, karate, yoga, jogging, and ball games. The  Lebanese donated a few table tennis sets, and a volleyball court  was arranged in the camp.    After breakfast, time was set aside was cleaning and  tidying.  University and other studies began at 0800. They went on, with  brief recesses, till the midday prayer, which was followed by a  meal. Studies were then resumed till 1600, "after which there  was more sports, personal things to attend to, dinner, and then  everyone would sit around the TV set and watch the Israeli  television newsreel. We saw footage on Hebron and Gaza on the  news every day, and the little screen helped us to remain in  touch with home. After that, there were gatherings, meetings,  conversations, and a night prayer."    Television was not their only link with the world. There  were also many radio sets. In addition, they had three cellular  phones and a fax machine. "Each morning, we received faxed news  from news agencies, as well as a translation of YEDI'OT  AHARONOT," Duwayk says.    One cellular telephone was used exclusively by the  spokesman,  Dr. 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Rantisi, against whom the authorities have  just issued a six-month administrative detention order. The  dialing was done through a U.S. switchboard. The two other  cellular phones were reserved for conversations with relatives.  The phones belonged to local villagers, who charged $1.5 per  minute.    A news conference was held every afternoon. Telephone  interviews were carried out with reporters throughout the world.    "We had parties on religious holidays. Deportees from the  Hebron area would prepare knafa (a baked sweet cheese dish), and  we would buy sweet foods, particularly pastries, such as  baklava. We had a debka [oriental dance] troupe made up of the  youngest deportees, which danced at parties. We also had a  drama group. In Marj al-Zuhur, we wrote and put up a play  called `Deportation.' The play depicted the first 50 hours of  our deportation, which were all agony. We sat opposite the  actors and cried."    Have you learned a lesson from the deportation? I asked Dr.  Duwayk. He smiled, laughed aloud, and then said: "Hamas is an  Islamic movement whose sole purpose is to implement the dictates  of Islam. There is no reason for the Hamas stand to change,  because the Islam will not change. In Marj al-Zuhur we  practiced the `sabir', patience and forbearance preached by the  Islam. And most importantly, the extensive media coverage  brought Hamas into every Palestinian house in the territories."</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A BUSY NIGHT SHAPING UP FOR GRANT ALL-STAR LEWIS  </P> <P> Marlowe Lewis will start at wide receiver for the first time in his high school  career in the Glendale-Burbank All-Star Football Game at La Canada High tonight  at 7:30.  </P> <P> But don't expect the Grant High standout to stay there too long.  </P> <P> Lewis, who will attend the University of Hawaii in the fall, also is expected  to see action at quarterback, tailback and possibly defensive back.  </P> <P> "We'll play him wherever he can get involved," said Grant Coach Bill Foster,  who will guide the Burbank team. "That's what you do with a kid that can do it  all."  </P> <P> Lewis will be among 72 graduating seniors from 26 area high schools. Nic Larez  of La Canada High will coach the Glendale squad.  </P> <P> Lewis, playing quarterback and defensive back, helped lead the Lancers (9-2) to  the East Valley League title last fall. The 5-foot-10, 165-pound Lewis, a Times  All-Valley first-team choice, completed 48 of 112 passes for 805 yards and  rushed for 759 more. He was selected to the All-City Section 3-A Division first  team at defensive back.  </P> <P> Lewis will be joined by four of his Grant teammates, including tailback Shawn  Booker, who rushed for 815 yards.  </P> <P> "I thought it would be fun to play in one more game with Coach (Foster) and my  teammates," said Lewis, who doesn't know which position he will play at Hawaii.  "(Offense is) a lot of fun, but eventually I think my future will be at  defensive back."  </P> <P> Notre Dame also will be represented by five players on the Burbank team,  including quarterback Greg Andrachick and place-kicker Chris Afarian.  </P> <P> Defensive back Greg Cole, who helped Montclair Prep limit opponents to an  average of 144.2 yards per game, is on the Burbank roster with Mountie  linebacker Greg Jones, who will play running back.  </P> <P> Bolstered by the throwing of Santiago Alvarez of Franklin and Chris Bisgaard of  Flintridge Prep, Glendale likely will go to the air.  </P> <P> Alvarez, the City Section 3-A Division Player of the Year, set state passing  marks for yardage (4,019) and touchdowns (52) last season. Bisgaard will be  throwing to Flintridge Prep teammate David Swayne.  </P></p>

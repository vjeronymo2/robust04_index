			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (35): Bank enhances service to clients - Account relationships are easily reviewed / Bespoke Financial Application THE United Bank of Kuwait undertook its database marketing project 'to enhance relationship-banking.' A British-based consortium employing 275 people, the bank is split into two parts, dealing with investments, and a Gulf customer-base, 95 per cent of which is Kuwaiti, writes Claire Gooding. According to marketing officer Michelle Lamb, there was a need for improved internal marketing information with a view to improving the service to clients. 'When you're speaking to somebody, it is necessary to know the entire relationship with that person, which might involve different requirements in such areas as foreign exchange, fund management, and other departments,' she says. The previous database, running the Focus fourth generation language and database, simply could not cope with the organic growth of information. The bank carried out a full study of mainframe and PC based products, looking at internal and external resources. It quickly decided on a bespoke application, and a series of careful specifications and functional reviews narrowed the field. The information had to be accessible to computer novices, so ease of use was one criterion. With 200 private clients and 350 institutional clients, each of which would relate to an enormous amount of detailed information, speed was another consideration. The bank chose the Superbase 4 language for its flexibility, ease-of-use, and particularly the Windows-based interface. Once it had chosen the software vehicle, it invited bids from three consultancies, Swift, Database Management Services, and Softa. Although its price was not the lowest, Softa won on cost and time-scales, and worked to implement a Pounds 30,000 system on a DEC Vax minicomputer, supporting 35 workstations. The system, called Info, includes all details of contacts, connections and relationships, along with funds, products bought, competitor activity and other account information. All of these financial details are drawn upon for mailshots. Because the project was bespoke, in-house staff wrote their own manual, but all found the system very easy to use. Michelle Lamb's advice is that the important element is getting the data right - and that needs involvement from all levels: 'It's hopeless unless you've got full support and it's being driven by senior management. In the end, no-one will use it, not even the enthusiasts, if the data is not right. The impetus has to come from the top: 'ownership' is vital, and especially input from the marketing department.' Confidence in the data, and its reliable, up-to-date integrity, are among the system's benefits to Ms Lamb - 'now we're able to see the complete account relationship, the next stage is to use it pro-actively.'</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: BBV drops 19.9% to Pta81.1bn BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's biggest private bank, yesterday reported a 19.9 per cent drop in net profits for 1992 but will increase its dividend because of an improvement in its core banking business. BBV blamed the lowered profits of Pta81.1bn (Dollars 71m), against Pta101.2bn in 1991, on a 42 per cent drop in extraordinary income. The bank earned Pta70.4bn through non-banking business in 1991, chiefly through the disposal of two subsidiaries. However, this fell to Pta40.2bn last year. Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, justified a Pta6 increase in the dividend to Pt169 per share on account of 'a tremendous improvement' in the bank's operating profit, which rose 11.1 per cent to Pta136bn, and its ordinary profit, up 8.6 per cent to Pta74.2bn. BBV raised its provisions for writedowns and bad debts by 47.6 per cent to Pta55.8bn. He said the bank had put behind it the problems of its foundation merger in 1988 between Banco Bilbao and Banco Vizcaya and said it was on line for sustained growth. Last year, the BBV group increased its share of the banking sector's deposits and other borrowed funds by 1.25 per cent to 14.29 per cent. Bad debts grew 15.7 per cent against an average of 50 per cent in doubtful loans for the Spanish financial sector as a whole. Operating expenses declined by 2.3 per cent.</p>

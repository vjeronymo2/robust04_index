			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: 'Apocalypse soon' warning - Europe's culture industry seeks opt-out from Uruguay Round AN APOCALYPTIC future for European culture was painted by EC film producers yesterday, if the cinema and audiovisual sectors are included in the Uruguay Round of Gatt. Figures from Europe's cinema industry lobbied the European Commission yesterday to get the sector taken out of the Round, warning that unless it is 'Europe will become a Third World continent,' in the words of Mr Wim Wenders, the German film director. The Commission wants film and broadcasting to have the shield of Gatt rules, and says it is fighting for 'cultural specificity' for the sector, allowing some protection and continuing subsidy. France, with backing from other member states such as Spain wants a 'cultural exception' exempting cinema altogether. A range of mostly French industry groups argued yesterday that Europe would be swamped by Hollywood in a Gatt-regulated open 'culture market.' They pointed out that US film export revenues rose from Dollars 750m (Pounds 490m) in 1980 to Dollars 5.5bn last year, and that Dollars 3.7bn of 1992 sales were in Europe. EC attempts to reserve a majority of screening time on television to European work has not blunted US penetration of the EC market, they said. Mr Wenders said the audiovisual industry would be the biggest on the planet in the next century. Europe had to decide whether its modest share would continue to exist or not, before the Uruguay Round mid-December deadline. 'There is a war going on, and the most powerful weapons are images and sound,' he said. 'To have a market dominated by American imagery means not only domination by American values and American ideas, but that other (EC-made) products would disappear,' because of concomitant US domination of advertising. Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator, was expected to discuss the issue with US trade representative Mickey Kantor at a new round of Gatt talks in Brussels yesterday. US officials say they are relatively relaxed about subsidies for EC film-makers, but would not agree to quotas or other impediments to US audiovisual products entering the EC. When the controversy was aired by EC foreign ministers last week, Sir Leon insisted that leaving the sector outside Gatt would leave it vulnerable to US trade reprisals - although Europe's film and TV industry earned US revenues of only some Dollars 250m last year. He picked up a reference from Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, to Francophone Quebec securing a 'cultural exception' inside the US-Canada free trade agreement, due to be carried over into the North American Free Trade Agreement embracing Mexico. Sir Leon said this still left the Canadians vulnerable to US '301' trade legislation.</p>

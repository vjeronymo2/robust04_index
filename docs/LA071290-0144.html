			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCKEON MAKES ROOM FOR RIDDOCH;  </P> <P> PADRES: MOMENTS AFTER HE HAD TURNED OVER THE MANAGER'S JOB TO GREG RIDDOCH,  TRADER JACK WAS ON THE PHONE IN HIS OTHER JOB SWINGING A DEAL AND PROMISING  MORE TO COME.  </P> <P> The Padre press conference -- announcing that coach Greg Riddoch was replacing  Jack McKeon immediately as manager -- had barely concluded Wednesday when  McKeon quietly disappeared through a side door.  </P> <P> Surely, he was looking for a place to be alone, right? Perhaps in this  emotional time he was leaving to be with his wife, Carol. Maybe he was calling  his family.  </P> <P> So much for sentiment.  </P> <P> Just 15 minutes later, McKeon was sitting behind his desk as vice  president/baseball operations, holding a cigar with one hand and a telephone  receiver with the other, talking trade with any general manager who would  listen.  </P> <P> It took less than an hour for him to make his first deal since returning  upstairs -- sending triple-A center fielder Alex Cole to Cleveland for  left-handed hitting catcher Tom Lampkin -- and he promised at least one major  trade before his cigar box runs empty.  </P> <P> And he never wants to put on another uniform as long as he lives.  </P> <P> "This is where I belong, this is where I always wanted to be," McKeon said.  "This is where I can best help the team. I'm sorry I had to go out with the  record (37-43) we did, but we just didn't produce, and I don't know why. I beat  my head up against the wall night after night wondering why.  </P> <P> "But I take full blame. I take full responsibility. I'm not going to hide. We  just didn't play like I thought we would, and I'm responsible for that.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to apologize for anything, but I never wanted to be a long-term  manager. I just wanted to bring continuity to the team. But I was worn out,  believe me. I was cheating myself, and I was cheating the organization.  </P> <P> "Maybe a change like this will shake things up."  </P> <P> Said Carol, his wife of 36 years: "It's still hard for me to believe. I was in  shock when he called last night, and I'm still in shock. I was at one of those  stop-smoking places when he called the house, and as soon as I heard the news,  what do I do, I picked up a cigarette and started smoking again. . . .  </P> <P> "You know, we never wanted him to go down (to manage) in the first place, but  once he did, I think we all wanted him to go out winning a pennant. That's  where I'm disappointed."  </P> <P> McKeon became manager May 28, 1988, after firing Larry Bowa. He was 193-164  during his two-plus seasons, a .541 winning percentage, the best in Padre  history. Managing in parts of eight major league seasons in Kansas City,  Oakland and San Diego, he was 479-474 and never won a division title.  </P> <P> Padre chairman Tom Werner, who began contemplating a change this past weekend,  telephoned McKeon on Monday and asked who should be his successor. McKeon  didn't hesitate, telling him Riddoch was the best candidate on his staff.  </P> <P> Werner telephoned Riddoch at his Greeley, Colo., home, where he was spending  the All-Star break, and asked him to fly to his Los Angeles home for dinner.  Riddoch was interviewed during dinner and returned to Greeley that night.  </P> <P> Tuesday morning, Werner decided Riddoch was the man. He arranged for Riddoch to  fly into Los Angeles again and this time requested the presence of McKeon, who  skipped the All-Star Game and took a 4 p.m. flight from Chicago. The job was  offered, and Riddoch, who had not managed since 1981 and never at a higher  level than the Class A Northwest League, became the 13th manager in Padre  history.  </P> <P> Riddoch, 44, was provided a new contract for the remainder of the season, and  the Padres have an option for him in 1991. He was earning about $60,000 as a  coach but will receive a raise of about $100,000, sources said. Although the  job is not on an interim basis, it was made clear to Riddoch that he will be  evaluated at the end of the season.  </P> <P> "I'm the manager, not the interim manager," Riddoch said, "and I'm going to  make it as hard on these people as conceivably can be for them to get rid of  me."  </P> <P> Riddoch, a popular choice among the players, made it clear in his first minutes  on the job that it would be his team. He fired hitting coach Amos Otis and  replaced him with Jack Maloof, the Padres' minor league hitting instructor. He  also hired Rob Picciolo, their minor league fielding instructor, to replace  himself on the coaching staff at first.  </P> <P> "I think this was a good move," right fielder Tony Gwynn said. "I think  everybody knows what he's done for me, and he's done a whole lot for a lot of  guys in here. I respect the man."  </P> <P> Although the Padres' disappointing first half certainly helped trigger the  move, it was McKeon's feelings, more than anything else, that led Werner to the  decision.  </P> <P> McKeon, in a private July 2 meeting with Werner, requested that he leave the  field as quickly as possible and assume the sole role of general manager.  Werner said he would take the request under advisement but did not plan an  immediate change.  </P> <P> But when McKeon's request was reported in a story in The Times on July 3, it  accelerated the process. McKeon addressed his team in a meeting before that  day's home game against Pittsburgh to squelch the report, telling the players  he would remain the rest of the season. But it was too late. The damage had  been done. Werner had to make a move.  </P> <P> "From the standpoint on what was happening in the clubhouse, everybody was  expecting a change," said Pat Dobson, Padre pitching coach. "And when that  didn't happen right away -- I'm not saying it was a disappointment, but it left  everybody in limbo."  </P> <P> The Padres kept losing, dropping nine of 11 games before the All-Star break,  and more and more players were expressing their dissatisfaction by the day.  </P> <P> "We had to make a change," one player said, "because we weren't going anywhere  under Jack. It was a circus, an absolute circus. It was a country club  atmosphere. Guys didn't even care any more.  </P> <P> "Our batting practice was a joke. And infield, whenever we took it, was a  joke."  </P> <P> But the player demanded anonymity, saying, "They don't call him Trader Jack for  nothing. He may not be down here any more, but that doesn't stop him from  trading us."  </P> <P> Several players, also expressing an anonymous viewpoint for the same reason,  said problems were also caused by a June, 1989, team meeting, at which McKeon  publicly chastised catcher Benito Santiago, and Santiago responded angrily and  obscenely.  </P> <P> "We just kept sitting there, waiting for Jack to do something, but he didn't do  a thing," one player said. "We couldn't believe Benny could say that to a  manager and get away with it. I mean, he wasn't even benched. Nothing.  </P> <P> "After that happened, I think a lot of guys around here knew they could get  away with whatever they wished, and believe me, a few guys did."  </P> <P> McKeon -- who did not receive a contract extension but will continue being paid  $400,000 this season and $400,000 through the 1991 season -- was well aware of  this constant criticism that he was too lenient. He said he didn't understand  this need for motivating $3-million players, that being in a major league  uniform should be enough inducement.  </P> <P> Riddoch, a former psychology teacher who also has a master's degree in  education administration, is not promising miracles but says he does understand  the wants and needs of today's major league players.  </P> <P> "Today's player wants to know the advantage of doing it your way, or the way  you are suggesting," Riddoch said. "You better be able to sell them. . . . We  need to play baseball like we did as kids, for the love of the game."  </P> <P> Riddoch was the only man interviewed for the job, Werner said, although Dobson  also was considered a viable candidate. But Dobson has a close relationship  with Riddoch, and showed no bitterness.  </P> <P> "No, I'm not disappointed," Dobson said. "It's obvious a change had to be made,  and when you've been through the wars like Greg, he's very qualified to do the  job. I told Greg all along that I thought he'd get the job before I did. It's a  lot more sensible for him to do the job than for me to do it and also try to  handle my pitching staff."  </P> <P> Dobson, 48, still would like to be a major league manager and will continue to  manage once again in the Senior League this winter. He secretly signed a  contract extension in December, according to sources in the Major League  Players Assn., that will pay him $75,000 in 1990 and 1991.  </P> <P> Otis, meanwhile, said that he immediately will begin looking for a job in  another organization. He has been the Padres' batting coach the past three  seasons and said that his dismissal was not a surprise.  </P> <P> "When guys start bringing in their old batting coaches to help them," Otis  said, referring to Joe Carter summoning Bobby Bonds for help, "you know  something's up. I'm not bitter. This is part of business. A new manager wants  his own people, and I'm an easy target."  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> The Padres will purchase the contract of third baseman Eddie Williams today  from triple-A Las Vegas and are expected to make room for him by optioning  backup catcher Ronn Reynolds to triple-A Las Vegas. The Padres acquired catcher  Tom Lampkin from the Cleveland Indians' triple-A roster Wednesday afternoon,  and he's expected to be Mark Parent's backup while All-Star Benito Santiago  recovers from his broken left arm. Utility infielder Joey Cora was optioned to  Las Vegas to make room for Lampkin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE NEW PADRE COACHES  </P> <P> Jack Maloof, hitting -- He moves up from minor league hitting instructor to  replace Amos Otis, who was fired Wednesday. Maloof was in his fifth year  helping hitters throughout the minor league system. Before that, he managed as  high as the double-A level for the Padres and won a Texas League championship  with Wichita in 1983. He never played in the majors despite a lifetime  professional average of .302. After being drafted out of LaVerne College in  1971, he batted .402 with Auburn of the New York-Penn League and was named  Topps minor league player of the year. He finished his playing career with the  Seibu Lions in Japan in 1979.  </P> <P> Rob Picciolo, first base -- Was in his third year as minor league fielding  instructor after two seasons as manager of the Padres' Spokane affiliate. In  his second year at Spokane, he was named Northwest League manager of the year  after the Indians won the championship with a 54-22 record. His major league  playing career spanned nine seasons, including a full rookie year of 148 games  at shortstop for Oakland in 1977. He also played for Milwaukee and California,  then returned to Oakland for the 1985 season before retiring. Picciolo is a  graduate of Pepperdine.  </P></p>

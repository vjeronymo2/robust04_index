			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Ratners reaps rewards of honesty - London Markets 'TOTAL CRAP' was how Gerald Ratner described his jewellery chain's products in a speech on Tuesday. His address captured the next day's headlines. Indeed, he achieved what may well be a unique feat: getting the conference of the Institute of Directors on to the front page of the Sun newspaper. Ratners' shares rose 10 per cent on the week, a striking testimony to the power of truth in advertising. The rise - from 170p a week ago to 187p at yesterday's close - was all the more marked because it came against a gently falling market. (The FT-SE 100 index, which had closed the previous Friday at 2520.1, ended yesterday at 2471.3.) Perhaps we might expect to see other captains of industry offering similar exaggerated honesty? Sir Allen Shepherd could come clean about the taste of Burger King hamburgers, Rupert Murdoch about the contents of his newspapers, and so on. Alas, no such outburst of corporate self-deprecation seems likely - not least because Ratners' shares moved despite, rather than because of, Gerald Ratner's comments. Since their peak in the summer of 1987, Ratners' shares had lost 70 per cent of their value by January 1991, as doubts grew about the company's aggressive expansion by acquisition, capped by the purchase last year of Kay Jewelers, a big US rival. More recently, the market has decided that Ratners has survived the retail crunch in the UK and the US. After this week's excitement - which included some lacklustre annual results - its shares have risen 64 per cent since the middle of January, outperforming the sector by four fifths. They are still half their 1987 value, however. There is likely to be more excitement to come. UK retailing analysts are off on Tuesday to see Ratners' US operations. Their views on whether Ratner can achieve the same dominance in the US as in the UK will have a more marked influence on the share price than any number of jokes from the chairman. For investors with a wider horizon, the week's highlight came in the foreign exchange market, where there was a further rapid strengthening in the dollar's value against sterling. Since the middle of March the FT-SE index has lost about 1 per cent, but the dollar has risen 10 1/2 per cent against sterling. For the past month at any rate, a bundle of crumpled greenbacks have outperformed the most carefully chosen portfolio of blue chips. Insecure fund managers could take solace from the thought that the pound's devaluation against the dollar would ease the strains of its inability to devalue much against the D-Mark inside the ERM. Such reassuring economic reflections were otherwise in short supply. ICI, with heavy exposure both to the dollar and the D-Mark, produced results on Thursday that reinforced the market's growing sense that the expected recovery has not yet arrived. The figures themselves were better than expected - a 52 per cent fall in pre-tax profits on a 12 per cent drop in turnover - but the company said there might still be some way to go before the bottom of the recession was seen in two of its most cyclically sensitive businesses, petrochemicals and plastics. ICI shares closed the week at 1060p, down 41p from the previous Friday. There was a brief flurry of economic enthusiasm on Tuesday, after Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, held out hopes for a rapid fall in inflation (in a speech to the Institute of Directors that was not reported on the front page of the Sun). The FT-SE index briefly rose back above 2,500 on the news, since optimists felt that this might prove a harbinger of lower interest rates. But the enthusiasm did not last; all the signs continued to point, as they have done for some weeks, towards a plateau in interest rates for the moment. The market's pessimism on this point was unmoved by US president George Bush's heartfelt plea for lower world interest rates, made on television on Thursday. It was also unaffected by the prospect that, at a series of G7, IMF and World Bank meetings starting this weekend, the people responsible for setting world interest rates would all be together in the same room, thus available to be struck by a simultaneous craving for monetary easing. Such cases of mass hysteria are not unknown, of course. Take the crazed enthusiasm for making and accepting rights issues displayed by otherwise entirely sober finance directors and investors. So far this year, there have been Pounds 3.1bn worth of rights issues. In April alone, rights issues have totalled just over Pounds 1bn, gobbling up cash at the rate of Pounds 50m a day. They seemed - until the last few days, at any rate - to have little effect on the market. As the chart shows, the biggest rights issues of February and March left the companies concerned performing nicely against their sectors in the weeks that followed. Still, there were signs this week that, for fund managers anyway, the game is less amusing. Taylor Woodrow's Pounds 162m rights issue on Tuesday caused a wave of froideur. Institutional investors murmured that if the company had really needed the money, it would have made the announcement six weeks before, at the time of its results. The company's shares did not reflect this view, ending the week at 246p, only 8p down. Later in the week, though, rights issues from Y J Lovell and Alfred MacAlpine got rather worse receptions. Finance directors, with the giddy insouciance typical of their breed, still seemed determined to go on with the party. At this point in a four-year-old's birthday celebration the wise parent starts putting the glassware away for safety and moving the chair with the wobbly leg behind the sofa. Since the stock market has many of the characteristics of such occasions - including an exasperating credulity about magic tricks performed with flags of all nations - wise investors might soon be following suit.</p>

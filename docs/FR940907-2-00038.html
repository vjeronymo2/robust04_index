Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;740&hyph;000, a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.212(b) of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization to install additional measuring and appurtenant facilities for Western Resources, Inc. (WRI) in Johnson and Wyandotte Counties, Kansas and for Missouri Gas Energy (MGE) in Johnson County, Kansas under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;479&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WNG states that as a result of WRI selling its Missouri distribution assets to MGE, effective January 31, 1994, it is necessary for WNG to reconfigure its measurement facilities to more accurately determine the volumes delivered to WRI and MGE. WNG asserts that the gas delivered through the new facilities is not additional volume, but rather individual measurement of existing volumes, which will not exceed the total volume authorized prior to this request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WNG proposes (1) to install measurement and appurtenant facilities at a new site in Johnson County, Kansas for WRI/Roe, and at a new site in Wyandotte County, Kansas for WRI/Fairfax; (2) to replace measurement and appurtenant facilities size for size in Johnson County, Kansas for WRI/Metcalf; (3) to replace measurement and appurtenant facilities with larger facilities in Johnson County, Kansas for WRI/Antioch; and (4) to install new measurement and appurtenant facilities in Johnson County, Kansas for MGE/Stateline. WNG indicates that MGE/Stateline and WRI/Roe will share the new site. WNG estimates that the total cost to construct these facilities will be approximately $1,303,600, to be paid with available funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WNG states that inasmuch as this is a request to install measuring and appurtenant facilities for existing customers at new locations in order to more accurately measure volumes of transportation gas delivered, these changes are not prohibited by an existing tariff, and it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries specified without detriment or disadvantage to WNG's other customers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefore, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lois D.

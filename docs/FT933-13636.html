			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Books: How the lords survived MAKING ARISTOCRACY WORK: THE PEERAGE AND THE POLITICAL SYSTEM 1884-1914 by Andrew Adonis Oxford Pounds 35, 311 pages THIS IS a very important and salutary book. It is obviously an expanded Ph. D. thesis, intent on nailing every generalisation to hard objective proof. Although weighed down by tables, it is written with elegance and clarity. I have argued for years that the right question to ask about the aristocracy in the 19th century is not why it declined, but how did it survive. Bruised it may have been by the extension of the franchise in 1867 and by the fall in the value of land in the 1870s. Reform - the long, slow tentative adoption of limited democracy throughout the century - may have acted more like the death watch beetle attacking age-old oak than dry-rot racing through the structures of British government. As Adonis makes clear, the phantoms that horrified the peerage in the early 1880s were largely imaginary. The power of the peerage remained great but they lacked political will. They hated attending the House of Lords. It rarely met for more than two or three hours in the late afternoon and rose before dinner. In crises that threatened their powers they poured into London and filled their Chamber, but these were very rare. More important than the House of Lords was the aristocratic domination of the Commons, the Cabinet and the vast and growing patronage of imperial as well as local government. The aristocracy and its smaller element, the peerage, dominated the institutions of government, great or small. And it was Salisbury who gave the necessary leadership to these powerful political and social forces. Its mass base was created by the Primrose League, an astonishingly effective political machine. That and 'platform speaking'. Addressing mass political rallies was a novelty of the late 19th century. Salisbury (who loathed them) went regularly to political rallies, so did Rosebery and the other 19 members or relations of the peerage who made up his 1895 Cabinet. They were not only peers - they were full-time professional politicians, superbly good in their professional skills and as hard working as any cabinet minister today. Adonis makes his case over and over again that the end of the 19th century showed a resurgence of the aristocracy, particularly the peerage, whose power was greater perhaps that that enjoyed in the early part of the century. I hope his book puts an end to the Guttsman thesis that the aristocracy began its demise with the Great Reform Bill and went downhill until the present day. However, there was a worrying institutional problem in the House of Lords itself. Except in dealing with private bills, it was extremely inefficient. Attendance was poor and interest not great. It was happy to leave matters to the men of business so long as they did not rock the boat by hints of reform. They filled the House every year to debate whether a man might marry his deceased wife's sister - but rarely for anything else. Salisbury and Rosebery saw the problem. What they wanted was a hard working House of Lords, which is why they both toyed with the idea of life peerages. The idea was, of course, rejected. The Lords were more concerned with immediate self interest and power rather than the long term, and they paid for it in 1911. Yet they still survived and, to some extent, they revived when life peerages became a reality. The effects of the survival of hereditary power on society, on culture and on the nature of our institutions still needs work before we can talk about the fall of the aristocracy. It is still with us, it still permeates British life: John Major's classless society is almost as remote as the stars.</p>

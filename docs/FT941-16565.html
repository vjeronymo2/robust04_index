			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Ciampi's fate in the hands of parliament: No-confidence debate will prove decisive either way For experienced watchers of Italian politics, the coalition government's closing weeks show all the signs of Roman politics at their most introspective. Rather than mirroring the mood of change supposedly sweeping the country, the talks held last week by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, and party leaders ahead of Wednesday's crucial no-confidence vote were more reminiscent of the sort of back-room dealing which has been a hallmark of Italian politics since the second world war. But whatever the manoeuvrings before the parliamentary motion, the debate itself is expected to prove decisive for Mr Ciampi's future and the timing of general elections. Although the prime minister has been sibylline about his tactics, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, with whom Mr Ciampi has co-operated closely, is widely expected to dissolve parliament immediately after the debate, irrespective of its outcome. In early December, most Italians had expected President Scalfaro to announce the election date in his year-end address. Almost two years of political corruption investigations have cut a swathe through the political establishment and mid-March appeared most likely. Shortly before the address, however, Mr Marco Panella, leader of the small Radical party, persuaded many deputies to table a no-confidence motion. In the circumstances, Mr Scalfaro, a firm believer in parliamentary rights, decided to delay an announcement until the legislature had expressed itself on the Ciampi government. The Christmas break and Mr Ciampi's commitments at this week's Nato summit in Brussels have postponed the debate until Wednesday. In the interim, the prime minister has sounded out party leaders on the timing of elections. Party attitude to the polls fall into three camps. The clearest is that of the Democratic Party of the Left, the Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI. All three, though light years apart ideologically, expect to perform well and therefore want an early vote. By contrast, a large number of deputies, predominantly from the coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists and two smaller parties which technically support Mr Ciampi, want it put off for as long as possible. Their motive is self-interest. Dozens of deputies caught up in the corruption scandals have managed to avoid interrogation - and possible incarceration - thanks to their parliamentary immunity. Should they lose their seats, their immediate prospects are not rosy. The third camp also comprises members of the four-party coalition. They, too, would like polling postponed, ideally to June, when they could be combined with European parliamentary elections. However, their motives are substantially different from those of their colleagues fearing prosecution. Headed by Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, the third group sees postponement as offering an opportunity to regroup the tattered centre of Italian politics. Mr Martinazzoli's DCs, traditionally an umbrella party bringing together widely different schools of thought, are most exposed. Once Italy's biggest grouping, the party is set to suffer badly at the ballot box. Some right-wing members have already defected to Mr Mario Segni, the popular former Christian Democrat, whose popular referendum movement has been the catalyst for many of the most important political reforms of the past two years. The Christian Democrats are also fraying on the left. Deputies from the Veneto region have called for the immediate creation of a party to replace its discredited forerunner. Last week another splinter group, dubbed the 'neo-centrists', attacked Mr Martinazzoli's leadership with calls for deeper reforms. The pressures within the Christian Democrats have been clearly communicated to President Scalfaro, himself a former DC minister, and Mr Ciampi, whose coalition is largely based on the party's support. So far, both men have resisted the pressures. Mr Ciampi is a former central bank governor who has made much of his current role as leader of an 'institutional' government of technocrats largely independent from party politics. Mr Scalfaro, who is required to put aside his former political allegiances as head of state, has shown admirable impartiality. The latest twist in the political corruption scandal, with the extradition last week from Monaco of Mr Maurizio Broccoletti, has raised the pressures further on both men. However, Mr Broccoletti's allegations, far from intimidating the president and prime minister, may only stiffen Mr Scalfaro's resolve to call elections as soon as possible.</p>

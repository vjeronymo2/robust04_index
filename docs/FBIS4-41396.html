			<p>BFN     [Text] The decree on fighting organized crime, signed by  President Yeltsin last week, is in the center of the media's  attention and provokes tough discussions between the supporters  and opponents of the tough measures stated by Yeltsin. Today  Mikhail Yegorov, deputy interior minister and head of the  department for fighting organized crime, met journalists.  Andrey Zenkov reports:    [Zenkov] The existence of organized crime in Russia was  recognized officially by the top militia authorities relatively  recently. Having recognized it, they started to actively show  journalists documentaries of chases and exchanges of fire that  ended happily bandits being detained, just as in American  gangster movies. The fact that over half of these bandits are  released after 48 hours and godfathers do not even figure in  cases is not the fault of militia, but of out-of-date  legislation.    [Begin Yegorov recording] We keep on repeating again and  again: Give us the opportunity to make examinations prior to  instituting proceedings and to carry out checks of documents.  Let us work with those detained. We need to stop releasing the  leaders of organized criminal groups and their members on bail,  since they have lots of money. Incidentally, we need to gather  evidence. It is difficult to gather evidence in two days. The  posession of weapons, be it a nuclear bomb or a pistol -- our  law is far from being perfect in this respect -- attracts  roughly the same punishment. Nineteen and a half percent of  those detained under Articles 218-219 are sentenced to  imprisonment. The rest leave to re-commit crimes. [end recording]    Mikhail Yegorov, one of the authors of Yeltsin's famous  draft decree on fighting crime, stressed again that measures  that are tough from the point of view of human rights, including  the audit of accounts of the relatives of those under scrutiny,  will be used only when fighting organized crime, which is  responsible for up to 1,500 crimes committed in Russia daily.</p>

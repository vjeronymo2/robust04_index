			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Observer: Homes by mail Meanwhile a designer with a fair claim to having run the full gamut of his profession is France's Philippe Starck. His output ranges from the monumental in the shape of Osaka office complexes, to a user-friendly toothbrush. He is now moving into the middle with houses - not the expensively customised sort, but mass-market homes ordinary people can afford. The stubbly-chinned Starck's idea is to design a series of houses, and sell the blueprints through a mail-order catalogue. His customers would then present the designs to a building firm. But, for the sake of the catalogue buyers, it is to be hoped that he puts more thought into the houses than he has into some of his other products. He claims he once designed a chair in the time that it took an aircraft seatbelt-sign to switch from on to off.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> STIFFER NOISE PENALTY DEBATED BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> A proposal to stiffen the penalties for violating Brea's noise ordinance was  itself the cause of some noise among City Council members at their meeting last  week.  </P> <P> City officials had proposed changing the city's municipal code to make  violating the noise limits a misdemeanor, rather than the infraction it is  under current city law.  </P> <P> The change, officials said, would make enforcement of the noise ordinance  easier.  </P> <P> With the addition of a city prosecutor last year, Brea now has the mechanism  for enforcing the ordinance in court, staff members told the council.  </P> <P> But Councilman Ron Isles questioned the need for the stiffer charge if, as the  staff reported, 95% of the violations are handled effectively as infractions.  </P> <P> "Is there some way we can make (violating the ordinance) an infraction on the  first offense and a misdemeanor for second offenders?" Isles asked.  </P> <P> While City Manager Frank Benest assured the council that the city does give  plenty of warning to offenders before even citing them with an infraction, both  Isles and Mayor Carrey J. Nelson criticized the amendment and asked the staff  to research changing only the second offense to a misdemeanor.  </P> <P> The council will take the issue up again at its July 3 meeting.

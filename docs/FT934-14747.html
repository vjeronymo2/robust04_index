			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Clinton airs fears on UN operations: President cautious about American role in peacekeeping forces PRESIDENT Bill Clinton asserted yesterday that US experience in Somalia had made him 'more cautious' about dispatching American troops to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations, including any in Bosnia. He told a press conference that it would be vital to avoid 'any ambiguity about what the range of decisions were which could be made by a command other than an American command with direct accountability to the US here'. This is why, he said, 'I've made clear all along that any Bosnian operation would have to be operated through Nato', which had an American general as Supreme Allied Commander in Europe who 'talks every day to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and works in very clear co-operation with the other Nato forces.' Mr Clinton did not think the experience in Haiti, where US troops were prevented from landing this week, was relevant to the broader question of peacekeeping. This was because the planned 'lightly armed' US and Canadian mission there was not intended either to keep the peace or make it. The president continued to issue tough warnings to the military regime in Haiti, implying that the US might employ a naval blockade to enforce renewed UN sanctions. He was unable to use the word blockade, he said, because 'in international law it is associated with an act of war'. Speaking a few hours before reports of the assassination in Port-au-Prince of Haiti's Justice Minister Guy Malary, Mr Clinton said he was particularly concerned about the safety of Mr Robert Malval, the civilian prime minister, whom he called 'a stabilising figure'. It would be 'a grave error', he said, 'to underestimate the extent to which this country regards him as an important part of the ultimate solution.' He also dismissed reservations in the US about the democratic credentials of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted president, noting he had offered an explicit amnesty to Haiti's military and police leaders, who forced him into exile two years ago. 'All I know is that in our dealings with him he has done what he said he would do.' Mr Clinton was at his most loquacious not merely in defending his own foreign policy record but also in emphasising his belief that UN peacekeeping had an important role in the world, with US contributions under the right terms. He particularly commended the UN record in Cambodia, in which he observed there were no US peacekeepers, as the sort of model that might be applied to Somalia and elsewhere. The UN, he said, 'worked through the politics of Cambodia by creating a process in which the local people had to take responsibility for their own future.' He added that Bosnia was 'a whole different issue' at present. But the US on its own, though now the only superpower, was no more able to resolve long political disputes than it was 20 and 30 years ago, an apparent reference to US involvement in Vietnam. Reorganisation of the UN peacekeeping apparatus, whether or not it included US forces serving under US command, was vital, he said. Mr Clinton's insistence on retaining a clear US chain of military command conforms very much with domestic political wishes. However, he said US losses in the bloody firefight in Mogadishu early this month could not be ascribed to the fact that the overall UN commander in Somalia was a Turkish general. Senate leaders have agreed on a Somalia amendment that would support Mr Clinton's March 31 withdrawal date, Republican senators said yesterday. But even so, as Mr Clinton implicitly conceded, the prospects of the US contributing to any Bosnian peacekeeping operation, under virtually any terms of engagement, are currently next to nil.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS LEGISLATIVE RACES;  </P> <P> CALDERON IS FAVORED TO FILL OUT MONTOYA'S SENATE TERM  </P> <P> Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) paid a price for challenging  Speaker Willie Brown's leadership two years ago -- Brown removed Calderon as  majority whip, reduced the size of his staff, stripped him of his committee  posts, and consigned him to a cramped office.  </P> <P> But Brown apparently didn't interrupt Calderon's political advancement.  </P> <P> In one of three special legislative elections in Southern California on  Tuesday, Calderon is the heavy favorite to win a state Senate seat. As the only  Democratic candidate on the ballot, he benefits from the 2 to 1 voter  registration advantage his party enjoys in the 26th Senate District. And his  Republican foe, businessman Joe Aguilar Urquidi of Montebello, said he has all  but written off the special election in order to mount a stronger campaign this  fall when the office is up for a full four-year term.  </P> <P> The special election is for the eight months remaining on the term of Joseph B.  Montoya, who resigned from the Senate on Feb. 9, after being convicted on  political corruption charges. The district takes in a blue-collar, heavily  Latino section of the San Gabriel Valley that includes Alhambra, Baldwin Park,  El Monte, La Puente, Monterey Park and Montebello.  </P> <P> The outcome seems similarly assured in another of Tuesday's legislative races.  In the 31st Senate District, which stretches from West Covina in Los Angeles  County to Laguna Beach in Orange County, Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) is  expected to defeat Democrat Janice Graham to fill the two years left of the  term of former state Sen. William Campbell, who resigned his seat late last  year.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a single winner may not emerge in Tuesday's primary for San Diego's  78th Assembly District. The seat was vacated when Democrat Lucy Killea won  election to the state Senate last December. The primary's nine-candidate field  makes it unlikely that anyone will win more than 50% of the vote, meaning the  top vote-getter from each party will face-off in a June special election.  </P> <P> Calderon, 40, won statewide attention in 1988 as a member of the "Gang of Five"  -- a group of Assembly Democrats that launched an unprecedented attack on Brown  and his ironclad control of the chamber. The Gang of Five billed themselves as  advocates of legislative reform; critics charged that they were just grabbing  for power. As part of the rebellion, Calderon came within a few votes of  replacing Brown as Speaker.  </P> <P> Calderon insists that he has repaired his relationship with Brown. An aide to  Brown said the Speaker and Calderon "have a very good relationship. They have  patched things up."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Calderon said, he never has regained staff or office space. His  current committee assignments, he noted, carry no clout or prestige. And, as a  one-time rival for the speakership, he is sure his presence in the Assembly  brings Brown "no peace of mind." In fact, he said, Brown jokingly offered to be  his campaign manager if that would get him out of the Assembly and into the  Senate.  </P> <P> The gains from his political challenge to Brown, Calderon said, are that he  acquired a reputation for independence and learned that he can be effective in  the Legislature without holding a powerful position.  </P> <P> Even without major opposition, Calderon is sending out mailers, posting signs  and running phone banks in a full-scale campaign that he estimates will cost  nearly $100,000.  </P> <P> An attorney, Calderon grew up in Montebello, where he began his political  career by winning election to the school board. Considered a moderate Democrat,  he won the first of his four terms in the Assembly in 1982.  </P> <P> Urquidi, 63, Calderon's Republican foe, said professional political workers  have told him he cannot win the special election because he is not well-known,  but that if he keeps campaigning, he will have a better chance in November.  </P> <P> Urquidi said he is counting on his military service in World War II and Korea,  his membership in veterans' organizations, his anti-abortion views, and his  skeptical attitude toward government, to attract votes.  </P> <P> The third candidate on the ballot, Kim Goldsworthy, 33, of Rosemead, said he  expects to attract the customary 1% or 2% of the vote that Libertarians usually  get. He said he is running to espouse the Libertarian view that "taxation is  legalized theft."  </P> <P> Neither Urquidi nor Goldsworthy offered any criticism of Calderon. "I can't say  anything about Calderon," said Goldsworthy. "He comes across as a people person  . . . a very nice guy."  </P> <P> Richard S. Gonzales, a 38-year-old Democrat from Baldwin Park, has filed as a  write-in candidate after failing to submit enough signatures to qualify for the  ballot.  </P> <P> Just as the heavily Democratic makeup of the 26th Senate District is a major  factor in Calderon's favor, Republican Hill is the expected beneficiary of the  political composition of the 31st Senate District, where registered Republicans  outnumber Democrats 3 to 2.  </P> <P> Democrat Graham, of Laguna Hills, pinned her hopes of overcoming the  registration figures on two issues -- ethics and abortion.  </P> <P> Graham, 53, has consistently noted that Hill's Sacramento office was raided by  the FBI in August, 1988, as part of the agency's investigation of legislative  influence peddling that led to Montoya's conviction. Hill, however, has not  been charged and the ethics issue has not caught fire in the campaign.  </P> <P> Graham also has stressed her support for abortion rights, contrasting that with  Hill's opposition to most abortions. However, California abortion rights groups  declined to funnel time or money into Graham's race because they consider it  unwinnable.  </P> <P> The 36-year-old Hill, first elected to the Assembly in 1982, has predicted he  will spend about $1.2 million on his Senate campaign. Graham has reported  raising only about $28,000.  </P> <P> In the primary for San Diego's 78th Assembly District, election overkill and  the lack of divisive issues have conspired to produce a low-profile, rather  somnolent campaign.  </P> <P> Tuesday's contest is the third special legislative race in San Diego County in  the last six months, and some candidates and consultants predict that "voter  fatigue" will result in an especially low turnout. And while the two special  races late last year drew national attention as referendums on the volatile  abortion issue, no such issue has surfaced in the current race to heighten  public interest.  </P> <P> Nine names -- five Democrats, three Republicans and a Peace and Freedom Party  member -- are on the ballot, though three of the candidates have ceased  campaigning. Former San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch, a Democrat, is the  best-known candidate and the only one viewed as having a chance to garner more  than the 50% of the vote needed to win the Assembly seat outright. The only  active GOP candidate is Jeff Marston, a former aide to ex-U.S. Sen. S.I.  Hayakawa (R-Calif.).  </P> <P> Times staff writers Dave Lesher and Barry M. Horstman contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

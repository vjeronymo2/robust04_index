			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> TITANS PIN DOWN A NATIONAL TITLE . . . IN BOWLING  </P> <P> The neighborhood kids used to tell Jeff Carr that his favorite sport would  never get him anywhere or anything.  </P> <P> A job at the local lanes, perhaps.  </P> <P> Now it has secured a national championship -- although hardly of the National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. variety -- for Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Carr and five teammates went to Las Vegas last week and came home champions --  the National Collegiate Bowling champions. They're not exactly hanging banners  in Titan Gym or moving aside any NCAA baseball or softball trophies, but for  the team, it's a thrill just the same.  </P> <P> "We're all a bunch of weirdos, but we have fun," Carr joked.  </P> <P> He and teammates Jim Marcoly, Robert Magee, Glenn Wada, Anthony Salib and Mike  Goffinet practice -- for free -- at Titan Bowl, a campus facility in the  University Center.  </P> <P> It's not quite like being a big-time athlete.  </P> <P> For one thing, Carr had a little trouble convincing a professor that he needed  to postpone an exam because of a national bowling championship. It sounded like  a shady excuse, but the professor allowed it.  </P> <P> For another, eligibility rules are a bit less stringent than those that govern  NCAA athletes. Although the team is required to maintain a "C" average in at  least 12 hours of course work, rules are considerably loose concerning prize  winnings. Carr won an auto a couple of years ago and last week won $400 as a  guest in a professional tournament.  </P> <P> "You can accept money as long as you're not declared a professional," said  Carr, who might try to bowl professionally after college.  </P> <P> At Las Vegas, the team was led by Goffinet, whose average score in the  championships was 196. Fullerton edged Wichita State and Washington State to  win the 12-team tournament.  </P> <P> "A lot of people around here don't really know we have a team," Carr said.  </P> <P> Including that professor.  </P> <P> "Maybe now if I show him the trophy, he'll believe me."  </P> <P> Fullerton's Rex Peters was named a Big West player of the week after going  seven for 14 with three doubles, a home run and six runs batted in four games  last week.  </P> <P> In games against San Jose State Friday and Saturday, Peters reached base seven  consecutive times. In Saturday's game, he doubled home the winning run in the  eighth inning.  </P> <P> A first baseman and right fielder who played at Orange Coast College, Peters is  batting .351 with 16 doubles and five home runs. He leads the team in on-base  percentage (.477), walks (25), runs scored (48), is eight for eight on  stolen-base attempts and is the only Titan player who has started every game.  </P> <P> "Hate the candidates? Tired of frat lock?" began one campus campaign flyer for  student elections for Associated Students president. "Write in Cedric  Ceballos."  </P> <P> Two students who wish to remain anonymous circulated the flyer -- without  consulting Ceballos, who, by the way, received 27 votes in last week's  election.  </P> <P> Ceballos' qualifications, as listed by the flyer:  </P> <P>  -- Averaged 21.9 points per game and nine rebounds per game.  </P> <P>  -- Players choice, Big West Conference player of the year.  </P> <P>  -- Can dunk in traffic.  </P> <P> His fictional platform:  </P> <P> "Cedric Ceballos supports clean air, higher education, world peace, the whales  and the seals, homeless relief, a cure for cancer, health food and water  conservation. VOTE FOR CEDRIC."  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Three more high school wrestlers have signed letters to attend Fullerton --  Dwayne Buth (Spring Valley Mt. Miguel High School), Lyndon Campbell (Sante Fe  High) and Michael Grubbs (Oceanside El Camino High). Buth won the state  championship at 165 pounds and had a 42-1 record with 35 pins this season.  Campbell is a two-time state champion at 138 pounds in 1986 and 1987. Grubbs  has finished in the top five in the state championships three times at 105 or  112.  </P></p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Kinnock will urge participation in Maastricht social chapter Britain will come under increased pressure to participate in the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty from Mr Neil Kinnock, whose appointment as a British member of the European Commission was confirmed yesterday. The former Labour leader angered Tory MPs by immediately making known his intention to seek to overturn the opt-out secured by Mr John Major, the prime minister, from the regulations that can be imposed on employers from Brussels. Mr Kinnock's appointment to the Pounds 103,000-a-year post was welcomed by Mr Tony Blair, the new leader of the Labour party. Mr Blair said: 'He will be a great asset both to Britain and Europe and I wish him every success.' Mr Kinnock explained why he would back the demands that Britain should keep in line with the other member states of the European Union by accepting the social chapter. He said: 'It is a modest way of defining basic standards for workforces.' He emphasised that there were several countries and many employers in Europe who took strong exception to the possibility that, while free from the obligation to comply with the social chapter, Britain would become a place for 'social dumping'. Mr Kinnock said: 'My general disposition is to seek to ensure that none of the employers in the EU are disadvantaged in their relationships one with the other.' Sir Leon Brittan, the former Conservative cabinet minister, will continue as Britain's senior representative at the European Commission. The government is expected to exert strong pressure in Brussels to ensure that Mr Kinnock's role in the commission covers overseas development - a policy area in which he has always been closely interested. Mr Kinnock's wife, Glenys, became one of the Welsh Labour members of the European parliament in June. Mr Kinnock's departure from Westminster will necessitate a by-election in his Islwyn constituency, a Welsh Labour stronghold, which he has represented since 1983. He had a majority of 24,728 at the last election. Before that he represented the former Bedwellty constituency from 1970. Mr Kinnock led the Labour party for nine years, resigning in 1992 after the party's second general-election defeat under his leadership.</p>

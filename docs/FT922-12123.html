			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Arts: Charlemagne Sarah Miles' first play, Charlemagne, is a bold swipe at the issues surrounding transvestitism and transexuality. Beneath the shouts and the violence, she has written a fine, tense play about an unusual subject. If it lags conceptually, it is never emotionally or visually dull; and it is superbly acted. Miles has created an intriguing triangle. Harry writes, Clara rides; they live on a West Country farm, the Aga and the trust fund bubbling gently in the background. They are trying for a child. Before this becomes a New Yorker short story, Lillibet, friend and dolphin therapist from Los Angeles, arrives to discover that Harry is a transvestite who secretly dresses as Hattie. The plot follows Harry into Hattie through hormone therapy then surgery, and Clara through a course of compromises which allow her to keep loving him/her. Lillibet ends up happily pregnant with a dolphin man from Greenpeace. The 'wickedly naughty' atmosphere promised on the play's handbills takes the form of other sexual undertones. These emanate from the eponymous Charlemagne the stallion at stud 'pungent with sweat and supple leather', from hinted lesbian affairs at college ('cuddling in the ha ha'), and from world music fertility dances to set the hips gyrating. Sex and sexuality, however, are not everything, even if they seem so for Harry. He/she says, 'we're totally harmless, we just make others squirm.' The issues of nature-nurture, sexual identity and role-playing are present if not thoroughly worked out, so the play makes one feel voyeuristic and at times prurient; and there are genuinely shocking scenes. Miles wisely concentrates on the women's reaction as they watch Harry's 'imbalance' take over his life. Greg Hicks as Harry minces and convinces, playing this difficult role with great tact; Lindy Alexander as Lillibet ('I see the disappointment in your body language') is a fine LA psychobabbler. Sarah Miles herself is the plucky Clara, all confusion and jodhpurs. Lisa Forell directs meticulously, especially the confession and confrontation scenes. As Meredith said in Modern Love, 'then each applied to each that fatal knife, deep questioning, which probes to endless dole.' The Old Fire Station, Oxford, until 25 April (0865-794494).</p>

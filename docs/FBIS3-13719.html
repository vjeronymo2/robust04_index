			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Huda al-Husayni from London] </F>   [Excerpt] THE GUARDIAN today expects Iraq to launch a  surprise military strike. The British newspaper says: Iraqi  President Saddam Husayn, who has been quiet for a year, will  return very soon to his military strategy and deal a lightening  strike against Western forces inside and outside Iraq. The  newspaper says: The Iraqi president's patience is coming to an  end as a result of the embargo imposed by the United Nations  since his invasion of Kuwait and the exacerbating economic  situation. This, the paper adds, will prompt him to carry out a  new bloody adventure.    THE GUARDIAN adds that it has been expected recently that  this adventure will be in the form of a military strike or  threat against the State of Kuwait or Kurdistan and that this  strike will take place next week. THE GUARDIAN bases its  expectations on reports that Iraq is beefing up its Armed Forces  and deploying them in the North and the South. As a result of  this, the paper adds, Iraqis are storing food supplies and  drawing large amounts of money from banks. [passage omitted]</p>

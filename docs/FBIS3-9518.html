			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Leopold Moravcik: "A Signal for Slovakia"] </F>   [Text] In the message of congratulations addressed by U.S.  President Bill Clinton to Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik,  the following sentence attracted my attention: "In the spirit of  our recent successful meeting in Prague, I am looking forward to  cooperation with you in support of our common targets in shaping  a new, integrated Europe that is democratic, safe, prosperous,  and free." Though it is possible to glean a lot from the dry  words of a message of congratulations about the attitude of  another country's representative toward an up-and-coming  politician, it is not customary for the one who congratulates to  also assume a stand on domestic political developments and to  lean toward one side in the struggle between two opinions.    President Clinton did that.    We still remember well the words of former Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar, in which he called President Michal Kovac's  activity during the meeting with Bill Clinton in Prague a  "wasted opportunity," with reference, among other things, to  negative reactions of the U.S. side.    President Clinton did not have to use the expression  "successful meeting in Prague" in his congratulatory message.  Nonetheless, he did, thereby entering, apparently consciously,  into the Kovac-Meciar conflict. The course of action by the  Slovak delegation during this meeting was not necessarily  flawless, yet the President of the United States wants it to be  considered successful, which he made publicly known.    President Clinton thus sent a clear and easily  understandable  signal to Slovakia--a signal for the new government and also for  the opposition.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (9): Forecasting failure - Economic models need to be improved ECONOMIC models have won few awards, and plenty of wooden spoons, in Britain over the past few years. When it comes to predicting how economies work, few economists are happy unless they have at their finger tips a computerised model - sets of software which link economic variables such as inflation and manufacturing output. Unhappily, in recent years the models have left much to be desired, especially in Britain where most have had a dismal record in forecasting the longest recession for 50 years. But while one reaction is to ditch the models and rely on intuitive methods to project economic patterns, there is a strong interest in trying to improve on the models. In the UK, about 10 big economic institutions run their own models of how the economy is supposed to work. These include the Treasury, the Bank of England and other non-government organisations such as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London Business School. Copies or variants of these models are used in a large number of smaller forecasting groups, either in the City of London or in academic establishments. But economic models are essentially tools which must be supplemented by the skills and reasoning process of the economists in charge of them. Models usually comprise several hundred mathematical equations linking a few dozen specific economic factors according to statistical correlations applied previously or to economic theory. Using the links between all the equations in the model, an economist would hope to be able to infer how different combinations of economic events pushed demand or spending in specific directions, and thus trace the possible path of the economy as a whole. Most economic models are based on the mathematical relationships between such variables as consumer spending and interest rates that have been shown to apply in the past. They operate reasonably smoothly in economic conditions similar to those which have happened already. But Britain in the past few years has experienced a peculiar combination of circumstances. These have included the high costs of servicing the large debts run up by consumers and businesses in the late 1980s, entry into a fixed system of exchange rates, high European interest rates sparked by German unification and a slowing world economy. That partly explains why hardly any UK economist was able to give reasonable advance warning of the seriousness of the recession, even though by early 1991 a small group of City and academic groups had woken up sufficiently to what was happening to be predicting a lengthy period of decline. In this environment, many groups of economists are taking a hard look at the construction of their models and how they are used. Among the different initiatives are those to: Stop using models. Mr Peter Warburton, UK economist at investment bank Robert Fleming, says he realised three years ago that the monetary slowdown sparked by the high debts of late 1980s were making current models useless. Mr Warburton abandoned his economic model which he had worked on since the mid-1980s and relied instead on his own reasoning power and judgments. Perhaps because of this decision Mr Warburton has had more success than most in predicting the dire straits that the economy has fallen into. Plug holes in the existing models. Mr Leo Doyle, econometrician at Kleinwort Benson investment group used this approach in the late 1980s when reasoning that the Treasury model - a copy of which he was using - did not cover sufficiently areas such as the impact of debt on corporate balance sheets. He therefore introduced new equations into the model which Kleinwort Benson has subsequently used, taking into account the impact of debt by both consumers and businesses on levels of spending and demand. He also worked into the model the effect of falls in asset prices particularly houses on confidence patterns and consumption. As a result of these changes, Kleinwort Benson has been one of the leaders in the UK in predicting that the recession would be lengthy. Simplify equations in the existing software. One approach has been to use vector auto-regressive (VAR) models, which use fewer variables than most conventional models. They rely less on economic theory more on relatively straightforward statistical projections based on past data. The UK branch of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, is using VAR models. It reckons they are showing promise. Artificial intelligence. One relatively new idea is to match human intuition with the powers of computers. This boils down to extracting from top economists the kinds of rules and judgments they use when thinking about economic events and putting these in a form that a computer can understand. This computer is then linked to standard economic models to provide projections about economic events that are derived from the model's view of the economy mixed in with human skills. The Henley Centre and London Business School are among several research groups experimenting with this approach. Add more intuition. The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club , a forecasting group which uses the Treasury model, attempts to come up with a number of outside judgments derived from industry representatives when providing an opinion about the future. It starts with a description of the economy as mapped out by the model and adds opinions obtained from economists working in specific fields. Item's approach is a useful step towards formalising the interaction between the model and outside judgments which is a key part of any forecasting procedure.</p>

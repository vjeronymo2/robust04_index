During the debate on a draft resolution on the trilateral  statement by the Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian presidents, Deputy  Serhiy Holovatyy put forward an amendment to Paragraph 2, as  follows: "To this end (in order to exchange ratification  certificates), government activity should be stepped up to  conclude specific international agreements that follow from the  reservations in the Supreme Council's resolution on the  ratification of the START I Treaty [the resolution now in  question is that of 18 November 1993]."    This version of the resolution was approved by the Supreme  Council of Ukraine. In the official text of the resolution,  however, a different version of Paragraph 2 was presented.  Namely, the words "to this end" were excluded. Thus, the  contents of the Supreme Council's decision on this issue were  essentially altered. The text of Paragraph 2 in its amended  version makes provision for the following sequence of the  Ukrainian Government's actions relating to the START I Treaty:  First, concluding international agreements that proceed from  the Supreme Council resolution and, in particular on granting  Ukraine security guarantees, followed by an exchange of  ratification certificates.    Such a sequence does not exist in the falsified text and  this  is why Mr. Holovatyy considers that it was stated that Ukraine  lifted all reservations relating to the START I Treaty, also  including security guarantees. In fact, this does conform with  reality.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US steel companies seek talks with Bush on voluntary curbs US steel companies are positioning themselves for the March 31 expiration of the US 'voluntary' steel restraints (VRAs) if the date passes without a multilateral agreement to lower trade barriers and limit government intervention in the steel sector. Speciality steel producers last week announced their support for a three-year extension of the VRAs and threatened to file anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases if their protection expires without a multilateral agreement. The producers, along with the United Steel Workers of America union, requested an early meeting with President Bush. With speciality steel concentrated in a few key electoral states, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana, election-year politics could bring the president to their point of view, if a Multilateral Steel Accord (MSA) fails. In a letter to the president, they said they represent the industry's high-value and high-technology segment which must be not be lost. 'Our products have unique characteristics, which makes them critical to the economic and industrial well-being of the US. There are few sectors in the industrial economy that could function without specialty steels.' The American Iron and Steel Institute, whose members produce three-fourths of the US's raw steel, have reaffirmed their support of a 'strong' multilateral accord. The institute said the threat of subsidised and dumped imported steel would be 'very real' without an agreement by March 31. The trade restraints, begun in 1984, cover both speciality products such as stainless steel, and carbon steel products, which make up most of the market. Mr Bush extended them in 1989 for two and a half years but refused further extensions. He said he would negotiate an MSA to replace the VRAs. The talks, organised through Gatt with more than 25 nations, resume on March 16. Progress is being blocked by a disagreement over US dumping laws, Mr Gary Horlick, a lawyer for the American Institute for International Steel, said. 'The major block to the negotiation is that the US wants everyone to lower their tariffs while it maintains tilted anti-dumping laws,' he added. The speciality steel producers have a different explanation for the deadlock. The MSA negotiations, they say, 'have been characterised primarily by the efforts of other producing nations to exempt themselves from the reach of US trade laws and broaden the scope of permissible subsidy programmes.' A working paper for an MSA, presented last week in a negotiating session in Washington with Japan, Canada and the EC, prohibits use of steel subsidies, except for a worker adjustment programme, structural adjustment schemes in the case of permanent plant closing, and environmental programmes and research. Subsidies spent for development are still in dispute.</p>

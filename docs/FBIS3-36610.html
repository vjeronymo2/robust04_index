			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of the Government of the Republic of Georgia" -- </F> read by announcer]    [Text] It is more than two months since the world community  became actively involved in the process of conflict settlement  in Abkhazia. As a result of two rounds of UN-sponsored talks  held in Geneva through the good offices of the Russian  Federation and with the participation of the CSCE, a memorandum  of 1 December 1993 and a communique of 13 January 1994 were  signed. Both documents urge the conflicting sides to renounce  violence, mapping out ways for a peaceful settlement.    Nevertheless, Gudauta separatists are continuing to use  artillery to shell the population in the Kodori gorge, burn down  villages in Gali Rayon, and kill and attack civilians, women,  children, and the elderly. Facts have emerged of killings of  dozens of people, including prominent public figures. In  effect, the deliberate policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing  against the Georgian population in Abkhazia is continuing.    Details of the latest act of vandalism committed by Gudauta  separatists have emerged. With the use of heavy equipment, they  burned down six villages in Gali rayon - Priveli Gali,  Konstitutsia, Rechkhi, Pkhira, Namarkeli, and Ghumerishi.  Hundreds of innocent people were burned to death in the fires.    It is noteworthy that this latest act of barbarism occurred  ahead of two important dates mentioned in the Geneva Communique  of 13 January: 8 February, when a joint group of experts  working on Abkhazia's status meets in Moscow, and 10 February,  which is the beginning of the voluntary and peaceful  repatriation of refugees and displaced persons to Gali Rayon.  It is likely that the latest brutal act committed by the  separatists was aimed at wrecking the Geneva process.    The government of the Republic of Georgia states that it  remains a supporter of and participant in the peaceful  settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia but, at the same time, is  ready to take all measures to defend Georgia's citizens who  remain on the territory occupied by the separatists and their  hirelings. We are also saying this in order to bring it to the  attention of forces in Russia who by their opposition to the  treaty between Russia and Georgia have in fact incited the  Gudauta group to step up their barbarism.</p>

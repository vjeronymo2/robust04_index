			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Fears of rights issues return in force A SHARP turnround in share prices left the UK market looking weak in late dealings yesterday, when hints that a big rights issue was pending drove investors to the sidelines. The blue chip sectors were badly hit, with oil stocks encouraged by higher crude prices providing the only firm exception. The FT-SE 100 Index ran through most of what appears to have become its latest trading range, touching 2,852.5 in the morning and closing at 2,818, down a net 20.3 on the day. Traders will watch nervously this morning to see if the Footsie challenges the lower end of the range. Equities opened firmly, taking aboard disappointing news on bad debt provisions from National Westminster Banking without too much discomfort. But the 14.2 gain on the Footsie was abruptly reversed when the March future contract on the FT-SE turned down sharply. The slide continued throughout the session, gathering pace towards the close when the rights issue rumours circulated. Although Seaq trading volume increased to 597.8m shares from Monday's 553.2m, or Pounds 1.18bn in retail worth, selling pressure was not heavy yesterday. Investment attention turned back to the FT-SE listed stocks, and the percentage of non-Footsie business of total volume dipped to around 61 per cent. 'The market seems to lack clear direction at the moment,' commented Mr Nigel Little of Panmure Gordon. Activity was highly stock selective yesterday, with several blue chip names moving erratically. UK equities appear likely to remain unsettled until impending rights issues are out of the way. ICI was still considered the most likely candidate for a rights issue, perhaps ahead of Thursday's important announcement of trading results and the company's demerger plan. But some older favourites were suggested, including Glaxo and General Accident. The pharmaceutical sector remained unsettled in London as investors saw drug stocks under pressure across Europe from uncertainty over the industry's US prospects under the Clinton Administration. However, profits from SmithKline Beecham were in line with market expectations and the shares responded calmly to the announcement. The banking sector reacted badly to a further, albeit modest, increase in bad debt provisions at National Westminster, which contrasted with some of the more optimistic views expressed by sector analysts this week. The Footsie was also hit by a hefty fall in BAT Industries, in part because of Philip Morris stock had fallen in New York. The general weakness cut into share prices across the consumer and retail sectors, although expectations of a cut in UK interest rates in next month's Budget speech remained high. With Wall Street only 5 Dow points off in UK hours, the London market made little response to the disappointing fall in the latest US consumer confidence index. Oil shares responded strongly after Brent crude prices rose through a resistance barrier, and there were signs that UK funds, which have been anti-BP since the dividend was cut last year, might be changing stance on the shares in the blue chip oil group.</p>

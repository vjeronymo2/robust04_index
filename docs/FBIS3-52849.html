			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tzomet Knesset Member [MK] Eli'ezer Zandberg said he  has documents from the Defense Ministry and the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] stating that the evacuation of Army forces from  the Gaza Strip will begin on 22 February and take two days.  Zandberg asserted that it is now clear that all the  disagreements between Israel and the PLO were but a show that  was intended to conceal information from the public.    In reaction, Meretz Knesset faction chairman Ran Kohen said  that the documents disclosed by Zandberg were bogus. Kohen told  our correspondent Hayim Hecht that he had checked with the IDF  and the Defense Ministry and was informed that no date had been  set for the start of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, since  the timetable for the evacuation process depended on the results  of the negotiations with the Palestinians. This week a Knesset  plenum will discuss a motion on the agenda presented by MK  Zandberg on the issue of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.</p>

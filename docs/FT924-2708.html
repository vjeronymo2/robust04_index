			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Call for training system reform THE training system was yesterday condemned as a formula for national decline. Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics made the accusation as he called for an urgent training reform act. Professor Layard, director of the economic and social research council's centre for economic performance at the LSE, was delivering the council's third annual lecture in London. Two thirds of British workers, Professor Layard said, had no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only a quarter in Germany. He said: 'Britain has a Lumpenproletariat un-like any other advanced nation, and this shows not only in British factories but on football terraces around the world.' The priority should be the expansion of part-time education so that those at the lowest end of the skills spectrum could get a national vocational qualification (NVQ), at least at level two. 'If expanding full-time education is the top priority, Britain will conti-nue to produce a Lumpen-proletariat,' Professor Layard said. The main elements of his proposed changes to training - elements of which if adopted would add Pounds 2bn to government's expenditure on education and training - were: All the off-the-job vocational education and training leading to NVQs should be paid for by public funds, whether provided by public or private training institu-tions. All young people aged under 19 should be employed on a traineeship basis with clear obligations on the employer and appropriate levels of pay. No employer to employ anyone under 19 without ensuring they received at least one day a week off-the-job training. The introduction of external accreditation for NVQs.</p>

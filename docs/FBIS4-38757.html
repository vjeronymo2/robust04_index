			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Bessonova, deputy chief of the oblast </F> Directorate of Statistics: "More Deaths Than Births in  Novosibirsk"]    [Text] [Begin bold]The number of people in Novosibirsk has  increased throughout the post-war years. But now the  demographic situation in the city is characterized as critical.  Why?[end bold]    The population of Novosibirsk increased by 124,700 over the  decade 1979-1988. The city population increased by 12,500, on  average, each year. But just a few years ago the situation  began to change. In 1989 the number of people in Novosibirsk  increased by only 6,700, and in 1990, by only 3,500. In 1991 a  loss in population was noted for the first time (of 4,400  people). In 1992 the city population had decreased by 11,200,  and in 1993--by 12,500.    Of course there were contributing factors to the exodus of  people from Novosibirsk -- production decline and the reduced  need for outside manpower. The emigration of Novosibirsk  residents was also a factor of no small significance. In 1993,  1,400 inhabitants of Novosibirsk had departed for places abroad.  But on the whole, only 25 percent of the loss of population is  due to migratory outflow.    Last year more people died than were born in all rayons of  the city. As compared with 1992, the number of births decreased  by 2,100 (16 percent), amounting to 10,600. Twenty thousand  people died, 4,100 more than in 1992.    One of the objective factors contributing towards the  reduced  birth rate is the demographic echo of war. The fact of the  matter is that our 20-29 year-old women are those of the sparse  generations born at the end of the 60's-beginning of the 70's  (i.e., the daughters of people born during the war and post-war  years).    Also providing its contribution to the decline in birth  rate,  of course, is the present crisis situation in the country and  factors related to it--the drop in standard of living of the  populace and lack of confidence in what tomorrow will bring.    The number of registered marriages decreased by 119 in 1993,  although the number of divorces also decreased last year.    Unfavorable changes in population mortality are being  observed in the city. The mortality index increased over the  year from 11.0 to 14.1 deaths per thousand population. The main  causes of death in Novosibirsk remain diseases of the  circulatory system (54 percent), tumors (16 percent), accidents,  poisonings, and trauma (16 percent). The incidence of murder  increased 1.5-fold over the past year; suicides increased by 27  percent.    Thus, the demographic situation in Novosibirsk has indeed  reached crisis proportions. Everywhere we see a declining birth  rate and increased mortality rate, resulting in natural losses  of the city population. In addition, the migrational exodus has  reduced the number of inhabitants in all rayons of Novosibirsk.    The demographic situation of the city continues to  deteriorate this year as well. The number of deaths in  January-March was double the number of births.</p>

The  company agreed to be acquired by Consolidated Freightways for $7.75 a share.  Consolidated's shares fell 1 7/8 to 32 7/8.  </P> <P> Long Island Lighting gained 1 1/2 to 14 1/4.

The company reported higher  fourth-quarter earnings, increased its dividend and voted a two-for-one stock  split.  </P> <P> Champion Products, traded on the American Stock Exchange, jumped 12 1/8 to 75  3/4 on word of an agreement for Sara Lee Corp. to acquire it for $77 a share.  </P> <P> The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,884.333, down 0.484, or 0.02%,  from the previous day.  </P> <P> Large blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 2,983,  compared to 3,474 on Friday.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 0.14 to  164.15.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.13 to 337.39; its 500-stock  composite index was up 0.52 at 292.54.  </P> <P> The NASDAQ composite index dropped 1.10 to 401.27; the Amex index closed at  321.76, down 1.01.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, share prices fell Monday.

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): New chance to become a venture capitalist Kenneth Clarke established his credentials as the friend of capital-hungry growing businesses in the 1993 Budget, writes Richard Gourlay. This year, he went further to encourage private investment in unquoted companies. The latest measures may tempt even relatively risk-averse private investors to try becoming swashbuckling venture capitalists. For those who took their first tentative steps along this path by buying shares in July's flotation of 3i, there was good news in the Budget. Shares in 3i may now be put in general personal equity plans following changes to rules on what assets investment trusts may hold in order to qualify. The most interesting development, though, came with the announcement of rules for the new venture capital trusts (VCTs). These will issue shares like a conventional investment trust but will invest in unquoted companies. The VCT is likely to be the preferred option for those wanting to take a portfolio approach to their investment in private companies, and who do not want to take any management role in the businesses they back. Investors will be allowed to place up to Pounds 100,000 each year in the VCTs. Their managers will be able to put up to Pounds 1m in any company which has no more than Pounds 10m of assets. The scale of the tax incentives dangled by the chancellor suggests sponsors and venture capitalists will be queueing around the block to launch VCTs. First, he has allowed 20 per cent income tax relief to be taken at the time of investment and - in a move that surprised even the more optimistic venture capitalists - he also extended capital gains tax roll-over relief to investment in VCTs. Investors will be able to defer indefinitely paying CGT on gains made from the sale of almost any asset if those gains are re-invested in the VCTs. They can, therefore, get some form of tax break on up to 60 per cent of the initial investment. The initial reaction from venture capitalists has been positive. 3i says it is thinking of launching a trust. Even if it does not, it has said it would be interested in co-investing alongside other VCTs. Murray Johnstone is considering trying to co-invest with business angels. And with groups such as Gartmore and Electra also enthusiastic about the new incentives, all but those private equity investors who concentrate on large management buy-outs might consider launching trusts. None of these is likely to appear before the Finance Bill is published in the spring. At that point, investors will have to start sifting through the performance records of the management teams behind each trust. This will not be easy. Venture capitalists do not always use the same valuation methods for their portfolios. New teams may spring up with well-known managers but no experience of working together. And almost none of the management teams will have any track record in investing exclusively in the smallest companies that the chancellor wants the public to back.</p>

Greetings from Havana, Rey.    [Rodriguez] Greetings, Cavada. Well, the most important  thing  I can tell you now is that within a few hours, Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina will be received by Indonesian  President Suharto at Government Palace here in Jakarta, capital  of Indonesia, the fourth most heavily populated country in the  world, with 189 million [as heard] inhabitants.    I said that the meeting will be held within the next few  hours because it is now a little past 0100 in the morning. I  wish to remind you that there are approximately 12 hours'  difference. This Robaina-Suharto meeting has dual importance:  First, because the foreign minister will be received by the head  of the government of a country that is currently achieving a  very high economic growth rate; and second, because it has  strong commercial relations with highly developed nations such  as Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, among others.    But I can tell you more: Indonesia has great regional  influence not only in the economic area, but in the political  field as well. Indonesia has served as mediator in several  regional conflicts, as in the case of Cambodia, and today it is  a member of the nonaligned movement.    In a meeting with the local press, Robaina said that today  all members of the movement are satisfied with the work carried  out by this nation, and with its efforts to strengthen  South-South relations. In this regard, Indonesian Foreign  Minister Ali Alatas today said:    [Begin Alatas recording, in English, with simultaneous  translation into Spanish] We have talked about some of the  problems we are facing, and as members of the nonaligned  movement, and as individual countries, we both agree, as we have  always agreed among members of the movement, that now more than  ever we need to contribute and to continue playing the same  role, to keep participating in a world that is rapidly changing,  a world in transition. [end recording]    Today the Cuban delegation will also meet with the top  Indonesian Congress representative, then leave for Laos, second  leg of the Cuban foreign minister's tour of Asian countries.    [Cavada] Thank you very much, Rey, for this additional  report  for the many listeners of Radio Rebelde. This was a direct live  report by journalist Rey Rodriguez who is accompanying Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina on his tour of several Asian countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- [passage omitted] Police  said the intruders, who have barricaded a corridor leading to  the reception room, are members of the Taihikai right-wing  group. Police identified one of the men as Kuniyasu Uchiyama,  41, the group's deputy chairman.    Police said one of the men had fired a shot from a gun but  no  one was reported injured.    It was the second incident in five months at the  mass-circulation ASAHI SHIMBUN headquarters involving the  Taihikai. On 20 October, Shusuke Nomura, 58, the leader of the  group, entered the building and shot himself dead during a  meeting with the company's executives in protest over the use of  a cartoon parodying his group in a weekly magazine affiliated  with the company.    Police were negotiating with the rightists by telephone.  They said the two Taihikai members later released eight  hostages, but were still holding an executive in charge of the  company's public relations department, Kei Aragaki, and the head  of the secretarial department, Mikinori Yoshida.    They said the rightists were using potted plants to  barricade  the door to the room.    They identified the other rightist as Toshikazu Furusawa,  29.    On 12 November 1991, police arrested Uchiyama after he set  off a fire bomb in his own car outside the Tokyo residence of  former Liberal Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru.  Uchiyama was carrying a sword at the time of the arrest.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Palestinians stoned a bus carrying West German tourists through Bethlehem and  injured two of them, the Israeli army said. The attack on the tourists was the  second in two days by activists in the uprising in the occupied areas. Several  West Germans were slightly hurt Wednesday night when their bus was stoned in  Bethlehem. Tourists have become a target since Israeli troops disguised as  tourists shot and killed an activist in Bethlehem last month.  </P></p>

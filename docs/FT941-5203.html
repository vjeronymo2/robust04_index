			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Appeal dismissed in nail-gun fight - European Court The European Court of Justice has dismissed the final appeal by Hilti, a nail-gun and fastenings manufacturer, against an Ecu6m fine imposed by the European Commission in 1987 for abuse of its dominant position in the market. Upholding the Court of First Instance's judgment in favour of the Commission's decision, the ECJ rejected Hilti's claims that the CFI had not applied the correct legal tests in defining the relevant product market for the purpose of determining Hilti's dominant market position. The Court's decision confirms that the scope of an appeal from the CFI to the ECJ in competition cases is strictly limited to appeal on a point of law only. The ECJ said an appeal may rely only on grounds relating to the infringement of rules of law, to the exclusion of any appraisal of the facts. In the course of its judgment, the ECJ explained that the appraisal by the CFI of evidence put before it does not constitute (except where the clear sense of that evidence has been distorted) a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the ECJ. Hilti had appealed to the ECJ against the CFI's judgment of December 12 1991. The CFI dismissed Hilti's application for the annulment of the Commission's 1987 decision imposing a fine for abusing its dominant position by conduct intended to hinder entry or penetration of the market for Hilti-compatible nails by independent producers of nails for Hilti nail guns. Hilti manufactures a range of products used for fastening materials in place, and in particular nail guns, cartridge strips, cartridges and nails. These products are referred to collectively as 'powder-actuated fastening systems' (PAF systems). The main dispute between Hilti and the Commission concerned the definition of the relevant market in which Hilti operated. The Commission found there were three separate markets for nail guns, cartridge strips (and cartridges) and nails. Hilti claimed there was a single market comprising all the fastening systems which can be substituted for PAF systems. Since the three components of the PAF systems made up an indivisible whole, Hilti said, these competed in one market, which included drilling and screwing systems. The CFI held on the contrary that the relevant product market in relation to which Hilti's market position must be appraised was the market for nails designed for Hilti nail guns. In its appeal, Hilti challenged the grounds on which the CFI arrived at this definition of the market, enabling it to conclude Hilti was in a position of dominance. The ECJ rejected all the grounds relied on by Hilti, finding that the CFI had adequately dealt with issues such as the interchangeability of PAF systems with other fastening products. Hilti also challenged the appraisal of certain economic evidence and claimed that the CFI had failed to take into consideration all the evidence presented by Hilti. Since no claim was made that the CFI distorted the clear sense of that evidence, the ECJ said the submissions relating to the appraisal of facts were inadmissible. In dealing with Hilti's claims that certain reasoning relating to the discharge of the burden of proof by the Commission was defective in the CFI's judgment, the ECJ found that the Commission had based its reasoning in its decision on precise factual evidence, rather than supposition as alleged by Hilti. The ECJ said the CFI had not required any proof beyond that normally required of applicants in order to establish that their pleas in law were well founded by requiring Hilti to demonstrate its view was well founded. The Court also rejected a claim by an intervener, Bauco, that the ECJ increase the fine imposed on Hilti in view of the delay caused by Hilti's behaviour. Since Bauco had not brought a similar claim before the CFI, the ECJ said it was not open to an intervener to request a form of order from the ECJ different from that sought at first instance.

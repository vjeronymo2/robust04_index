Denktas said that by this attitude the United Nations had  paved the way for an endorsement of all the evil that this side  has done over the past 30 years to the Turkish Cypriots.    Denktas was addressing a conference in Kyrenia on Saturday  organized by the Turkish United Nations Association and entitled  "The United Nations and the Cyprus question."    Denktas said that the United Nations today was still an  organization that the larger countries saw as a platform for  promoting their own interests.    He added that these countries were trying to solve the  Cyprus  problem without having analyzed it properly, and were putting  forward proposals which had been prepared without sounding out  the actual parties to the dispute.    "(Former Cypriot President Archbishop) Makarios tried in  1963  to destroy the republic of Cyprus, which was based on a  partnership, by force of arms and to establish a Greek Republic.  The Turkish Cypriots never consented to the administration of  Makarios. This is the dispute," Denktas said.    He added that as long as the usurpation of the Presidency of  Cyprus by force of arms is not ended then a solution to the  problem of Cyprus could not be found, "because this problem had  been created in order for the Presidency to be occupied by  force."    Denktas said that the Greek Cypriots had hidden behind the  title of "the legitimate government of Cyprus" and repeated that  the Cyprus question was the result of this usurpation by the  Greek Cypriots.    "The moment you get rid of the usurper the Cyprus problem is  solved" he insisted.    The Turkish Cypriot President went on to add that the Greek  Cypriot side was making all its calculations on the assumption  that it would be accepted as a member of the European Union,  mainly in order to get rid of Turkey's right of guarantee over  the status of Cyprus.    If such membership is granted the Greek Cypriots, he went on  to say, this would tip the balance on the island.    Providing an example for the attitude of large countries,  Denktas cited the case of the United States, and pointed out  that in the bimonthly report presented by President Bill Clinton  to Congress the Greek Cypriot leader was always referred to as  the President of Cyprus.    Denktas said that they had always objected to this. He added  that when he had brought the matter up with the U.S. ambassador  in Nicosia the previous day the ambassador, "in a very honest  and friendly manner," had said, "I do not want to mislead you  on this. This is the way matters stand and this is the way they  will remain. There exist neither the means for the conditions to  change this."    Denktas declared: "It becomes clear in this manner how U.N.  principles are implemented and where they want to take us. We  never mentioned this before but we are in a position to oppose  if from now on."    Referring to the package of confidence building measures put  forward by the United Nations, Denktas said that this also  revealed an attempt to deprive the Turkish side of its basic  rights.    "They are doing everything in their power to implement the  scenario in their own minds and to pressurize us, as if the  things we are saying are not important," Denktas said.    He went on to underline that a solution for the Cyprus  problem was something that was necessary for the Turkish side in  the first instance, because it was the side that was faced with  an embargo whereas the Greek side was availing itself of all the  advantages of the world.    "For the Cyprus problem to be solved means for the Greek  Cypriots to step down from the claim of legitimate government,"  Denktas added.</p>

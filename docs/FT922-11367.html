			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / A little left of the right policies: John Willman comes upon a puzzling preview of the Queen's Speech Leaked documents all too rarely find their way to the FT's headquarters at No. 1 Southwark Bridge, so I was intrigued to find a plain buff envelope in my in-tray this week. Inside was what appears to be a draft of the Queen's Speech for the state opening of Parliament on May 6. It bears all the hallmarks of the real thing, although the authorship is in doubt, and it appears to have been drafted a few days before the general election. My Lords and Members of the House of Commons. I look forward to visiting Strasbourg and Malta later this month, France in June and Germany in October, but not Australia. My government believes that the conclusive election result has brought confidence back to the markets. Business can now plan for the future without fear of the irresponsible economic and industrial policies espoused by my Loyal Opposition. Unfortunately, recovery is likely to be slower than my government was recently suggesting might be possible. Because my government declines absolutely and completely even to discuss the possibility of a re-alignment of sterling within the exchange rate mechanism, real interest rates and the exchange rate of the pound will remain intolerably high. Unemployment will therefore carry on rising until at least the end of 1993. Members of the House of Commons, this will be a tough spending round. It is already clear that the budget forecast of a PSBR for the year of Pounds 28bn will be exceeded. My chief secretary - whose hawkish reputation on public expenditure is well known to you all - will be seeking cuts in departmental expenditure across the board. There is no likelihood of any additional funding for public services over the lifetime of this parliament unless growth exceeds the generous forecasts in this year's Red Book. My Lords and Members of the Commons, this parliament will run until autumn 1993, a lengthy session doubtless much-needed by my Loyal Opposition to resolve its internal difficulties. My government believes that there has been enough radical legislation over the last 13 years. There will be only one major measure in the coming session - a short three-clause bill entitled the European Union (Abolition of Parliamentary Sovereignty) Bill. Instead, my ministers will get down to the hard graft of implementing the changes already introduced. My secretary of state for education will send his children to a state school. In another departure from his predecessor's practice, he will also be visiting schools to see what goes on in them. With the conclusion of the election campaign, there is no longer any need to raise the threat of increased immigration. My government therefore will not reintroduce the Asylum Bill. A white paper will be issued in the new year setting out possible plans for the privatisation of British Railways (NB check whether the wording of last year's speech was sufficiently vague). My government will introduce Citizen's Charters will be brought forward for dog-owners, for noisy neighbours and to abolish the menace of portable telephones. A bill will be introduced to compel newspaper publishers to use ink which does not transfer to reader's hands. A bill will be introduced to permit the use of redundant churches as brothels provided they are managed by the Mothers' Union. A bill will be introduced to ban the wearing of horse-hair wigs in my courts. The Loyal Opposition's manifesto promised a 'Hedgerow Incentive Scheme to help preserve hedgerows of particular historic, landscape or wildlife importance'. In a spirit of reconciliation, my government will introduce a bill to implement this commendable proposal. My government attaches the highest importance to maintaining our security, but we've got to scrounge cash from somewhere (NB this needs rephrasing - something about 'peace dividend', welcome developments in the Soviet Union etc)The defence of the realm will therefore be contracted out to a private security firm. Other measures will be laid before you. My lords and members of the House of Commons, I pray that the blessing of almighty God may rest upon your counsels. And that's it - apart from a pencilled note at the end of the draft. Mysteriously, it says 'Will this do, Roy? Neil'. Dominic Lawson is on holiday.</p>

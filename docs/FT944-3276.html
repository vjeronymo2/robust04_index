			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Arts: A northern nether-world of oddballs - Television These days there is so much television that entire series can come and go without the critic managing to mention them. Even if you resist the blandishments of cable and satellite, as most people do, and stick to the four terrestrial channels, there is still a vast amount of material on offer. BBC2 usually closes down from about 1.00 am until 7.00, BBC1 is off the air between 1.00 and 6.00, Channel 4 rests for about three hours most nights, and ITV broadcasts round the clock. This means that most weeks there are around 575 hours of programming available. Consequently some series receive less notice here than they should, and the time has come to catch up. We are most of the way through two drama serials which form an extraordinary pair. Both are transmitted on Thursday nights, indeed they clash for half of their 60-minute duration. Both are based in Newcastle. Each is involved in a nether-world inhabited by oddballs. Each has used a big funeral as one of its central scenes . . . but then, which British television serial has not? Melanie Hill appears in both, as does Christopher Fairbank. So does that blasted bridge which must be the only architectural feature of note in the entire city, judging from the obsessive way that cameramen wheedle it into so many shots. You can see the sixth of BBC1's seven-part series, Crocodile Shoes, tomorrow, and the fifth in the six-part ITV series, Finney. Finney is that unusual phenomenon, a television series inspired by a movie. It can work: those of us who predicted that television could never sustain the acid tragicomedy of MASH the movie were forced to admit our error, but such successes are unusual. So at first a series inspired by the 1987 film Stormy Monday, in which pop star Sting played Finney, owner of a Newcastle jazz club, seemed unpromising. Furthermore the plot was awfully familiar from westerns: one member of a family tries to remain uninvolved while everyone else feuds violently with another family. Crocodile Shoes seemed more enticing. Not only was the lead role of Jed being taken by Jimmy Nail  - the lugubrious Geordie who proved the most popular of the fly-by-night brickies in Auf Weidersehn Pet and then went on to write and star in Spender  - this time he was writing, producing, starring and even singing his own country songs. In the central role he plays a Newcastle lathe operator whose sister (Melanie Hill) sends off a cassette of his amateur singing efforts and gets him a contract with a London manager. In the event, however, Finney has proved to have more strengths and Crocodile Shoes more weaknesses than anticipated. In Finney the paterfamilias having been killed in the opening moments of Episode 1, Lena, played by Melanie Hill, becomes the leader of the Finneys in their war with the Simpsons. It is a pity that director David Hayman, who also plays villain McDade, requires her to wear dark glasses so often, this being such a hard-nut cliche and Lena being the sort of character who would never hide behind anything. Despite this, Lena turns out to be television's most convincing female crook since Ann Mitchell played Dolly in the 1983 Widows. It is also a little hackneyed to have the supposed humanity of Finney himself (David Morrissey) symbolised by his passion for jazz. The idea of inverting the old cliche and changing jazz from a paradigm of lowlife and sin into the essence of cool karma has, itself, become a right-on cliche since people such as Alan Plater began using it in the mid 1980s in series such as The Beiderbecke Affair. The fact remains that the old formula works. You do feel on Finney's side when he is reluctantly forced to buckle on his gunbelt and get back down among the hard men in order to defend Tom, his ne'er do well coward of a brother. The moment when Tom was forced by Bobo Simpson to act as assassin in order to square his gambling debts, and opened the left-luggage locker to find that the photograph of his target showed Bobo himself, was a good coup de theatre. If the slo-mo monochrome 'therapist' inserts showing us the brutality of the boys' upbringing look decidedly familiar, they are nonetheless effective. Most important, the sense of tension  - of violence scarcely held in check - is wholly persuasive. Crocodile Shoes, on the other hand, is turning out to be rather less than the sum of its parts. It wins points for not being about crime, and would win even more for not being set in London, New York or Los Angeles, were it not that Newcastle is rapidly joining that list. The scenes in the world of music publishing, where co-star James Wilby plays the self-seeking, Porsche driving, coke-sniffing Adrian, are as good as anything in this milieu on television since Rock Follies in 1976. The contrast between the effete hothouse atmosphere of the London music scene and the darkening factories of Newcastle might have provided a telling subtext if treated with a light enough touch, but sentimental object lessons about the canny lads and the dignity of the workers rather spoil that. The sad visit to the deserted factory in last week's episode was heavy handed enough without the close-up of the outline on the floor of the old position of Jed's lathe. The black humour (reminiscent of Bleasdale in Boys From The Blackstuff) concerning, for example, the chap who paints his head  - to look younger for job applications?  - prompting the comment 'He should have used non-drip', feels like a deliberately added ingredient rather than a natural element. As for the songs, they have a certain charm and, although Nail's voice is thin, it is easy on the ear. The title song is even quite catchy. The trouble is that the elements do not fit together well enough; Crocodile Shoes seems like a contrived assemblage, in which all the constituents  - northern recession, Nashville, London drugs scene - have been brought together and placed in juxtaposition in the hope that they will form a workable vehicle, rather than anyone working outwards from a coherent and unified design. That is not to suggest it is unenjoyable but, like Finney, and such an overwhelming proportion of television fiction today, it is to suggest that this is formula drama, albeit superior formula drama.</p>

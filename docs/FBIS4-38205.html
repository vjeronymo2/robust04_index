			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Caroline Faraj] </F>   [Text] Amman -- Dr. 'Abdallah Tuqan, head of the Jordanian  side in the Security and Border Committee of the  Jordanian-Israeli track, has asserted that a specialized team of  technical experts will begin its work to demarcate the  Jordanian-Israeli borders in the Wadi al-'Arabah area next July.    In an exclusive interview with AL-RA'Y, Dr. Tuqan added that  the primary duty of that team, which was formed in accordance  with Provision A of the subagenda approved on 7 June, is to  reach an agreement to prepare the necessary maps, including any  additional items, and to conduct joint surveys in order to  demarcate the borders between Jordan and Israel, except the line  separating the West Bank and the kingdom.    Dr. Tuqan asserted that discussion of Israel's pullout from  the occupied Jordanian territories would begin immediately after  the border maps were prepared. He also clarified that the  subagenda is based on Provision B and Points 5 and 7 of the  joint agenda of the Jordanian-Israeli track signed on 14  September.    He added: In light of Provision C of the joint agenda,  stipulating that after reaching a solution acceptable to both  sides regarding the elements of this agenda, this solution is  expected to be crowned with a peace treaty. This means that the  treaty will be concluded after the bilateral negotiations  succeed.    He pointed out that the solution will cover the  international  border, as stated in Provision 5 of Chapter B of the joint  agenda, stipulating a settlement of the issue of territories,  the establishment of agreed-on marks on the international border  between Jordan and Israel by using the mandate's border  definition without encroaching on any of the territories that  fell under the control of the Israeli military government in  1967, and the need for both sides to respect and abide by these  international borders.    Dr. Tuqan said that this text clearly refers to the West  Bank territory occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem. We in  Jordan do not recognize that Israel has anything to do with the  line dividing Jordan and the occupied Palestinian territory. He  said that Jordan will not agree that the Palestinian autonomous  territory be subject to negotiations on Israeli-Jordanian  international border.    Tuqan noted that the surveys and preparations undertaken by  the special subcommittee might in some cases need foreign  expertise because its work will be separated from and in  parallel with the other points on the agenda. Its work will be  connected with the other committees, particularly regarding the  projects that will be discussed after the withdrawal has been  completed and peace has been established.    Tuqan emphasized the need for international border  demarcation before any future project is broached, adding that  the proposed road connecting Jordan, Israel, and  Egypt--al-'Aqabah, Taba, Elat--cannot be established without  clear borders, crossing points, security and customs posts, and  other basic things. These have to be documented and fixed on  maps before being implemented on the ground.    Tuqan noted that the border subcommittee is a mechanism or  an  executive body to implement points in the fifth paragraph of  Chapter B of the joint agenda. The committee can also draw up a  timetable to implement the necessary measures concerning  everything agreed on between the two sides in terms of priority  and importance.    Tuqan stressed that issues of borders and future projects in  the peace era should be discussed and connections between them  should be dealt with in detail in the upcoming Jordanian-Israeli  negotiations. He also said that the drafting of the subagenda  was basically based on primary points contained in the joint  agenda; namely, realizing comprehensive, durable, and just peace  and stressing respect for the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of the states in the region.    Tuqan added: This leads us to international provisions;  namely, that the border areas of any state must be clearly  defined so that security arrangements can be based on  international borders.    He said that Jordan will not approve of the idea of  separating sovereignty from security because the two are  inseparable and they are two of the primary elements of  Jordanian national security.    Tuqan said: It is natural that this idea of security be  extended to include negotiations on the reduction of armaments  and regional security, thus forming a well-connected security  chain.    It is worth mentioning that the areas of the occupied  Jordanian territories are 380.084 square kilometers in the south  and 0.83 square kilometers in the north.</p>

A participant through interrogatories may require any other participant to identify each person whom the other participant expects to call as a witness at the hearing and to state the subject matter on which the witness is expected to testify. The participant serving the interrogatories shall file a copy thereof with the Secretary pursuant to &sect;3001.9 and shall serve a copy upon the Postal Service. Special requests for service by other participants shall be honored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Answers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in the manner prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section. The party responding to the interrogatories shall serve the answers on the party who served the interrogatories within 20 days of the service of the interrogatories or within such other period as may be fixed by the presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the hearing. The answers are to be signed by the person making them. If the person responding to the interrogatory is unavailable to sign the answer when filed, a signature page must be filed within ten days thereafter with the Commission, but need not be served on participants. Copies of the answers to interrogatories shall be filed with the Secretary pursuant to &sect;3001.9 and shall be served upon other participants who request them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Objections. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the interest of expedition, the bases for objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If objection is made to part of an interrogatory, the part shall be specified. A participant claiming privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary privilege asserted and state the reasons for its applicability. A participant claiming undue burden shall state with particularity the effort which would be required to answer the interrogatory, providing estimates of cost and work hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required, to the extent possible. An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable because an answer would involve an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the Commission or presiding officer may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until a prehearing conference or other later time. Objections are to be signed by the attorney making them. The party objecting to interrogatories shall serve the objections on the party who served the interrogatories within 10 days of the service of the interrogatories. Copies of objections to interrogatories shall be filed with the Secretary pursuant to &sect;3001.9 and shall be served upon the proponent of the interrogatory and the Postal Service. Special requests for service by other participants shall be honored. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb 20 -- India's efforts to master  ballistic missile technology has crossed a major milestone with  the successful test of the Agni missile on Saturday. This was  the third test of the two-stage missile. Agni was first  successfully tested in May 1989 and the second partially  successful test took place in April 1992.    Possessing a potential range of over 2,000 km, the Agni is  India's first Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM).  Described as a ``technology demonstrator,'' the missile can  deliver one tonne payload. This is twice the estimated weight of  nuclear warhead and the success means that India can deliver a  nuclear strike if it chooses to weaponise.    The focus of the launch was to guide better end more  accurately, a sophisticated re-entry vehicle or the warhead of  the missile. ``Other gains are incidental,'' says a highly  placed source at the Defence Research and Development  Organisation (DRDO).    But, Saturday's test is also expected to prove an extension  of the missile's range, though no confirmation on this count is  as yet available. Experts account the 19 tonne weight of the  missile, which is five tonnes more than the weapon tested in  1989, primarily due to the excess fuel it is carrying. This  would be translated to an extended range, it is presumed.    The 21-metre Agni tested on Saturday is also longer in  comparison to the weapon launched in 1989. The Agni on its  maiden flight had measured 19 metres.    While modifications on the warhead are possible, prelaunch  indications suggested that the re-entry vehicle is of a  manoeuvering type. Small fins were attached at the base to  facilitate the warhead's movement.  <H5>  Challenging Task </H5>   Controlling the flight path of the re-entry vehicle is a  particularly challenging task. The warhead which moves towards  the target at a rapid speed crosses the earth's atmosphere.  Making the warhead withstand the high temperatures (around 3000  degree Celsius) it encounters poses a major challenge to  scientists. Keeping the warhead stable during this phase is also  vital.    One of the unique features of the Agni re-entry vehicle is  its heat shield. A carbon-carbon composite heat shield enables  it to withstand temperatures 5,000 degree Celsius. In addition,  the heat shield is ablative. It melts and chars and its outer  layers peel off. It takes away the heat, layer by layer.    Guiding the warhead is also difficult because the vehicle  during its final phase can be jammed. However, DRDO scientists  have discounted this possibility.    Apparently Agni's re-entry vehicle resembles the Pershing II  warhead. The guidance technology on the Pershing II is so  accurate that the warhead lands within 45 metres of the target  area.  <H5>  Two-Stage Configuration </H5>   The Agni posses a unique two-stage configuration. While the  missile is hurled into space by a solid fuel booster, the liquid  fuelled second stage leads missile warhead to its predesignated  target.    With premium on accuracy, the choice of a liquid second  stage  was deliberate.    DRDO scientists, under whose overall supervision the missile  programme is being carried out, agree that the first stage  rocket is based on an indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle  (SLV-3) design. The liquid fuel stage is based on the Prithvi  design. But auxiliary propulsion is added to the missile to  enable it to fly higher.</p>

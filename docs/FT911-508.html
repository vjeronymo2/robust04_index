			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Playing with your life - The hard sums behind annuities ANNUITIES are not for the squeamish. This becomes clear as soon as the calculations behind the rates offered by different life insurance offices are examined - when you take out an annuity, you are effectively placing a bet with the life insurance office on how long you will live. An annuity is a contract to pay a given amount each year, while the annuity holder remains alive. The capital is eaten into, allowing for a particularly high income. However, in practice they will not appeal to those under 55, and become enticing once you have reached the age of 70. You will be in competition with inflation, which erodes the value of your annuity with each year that passes. The other disadvantage is that the life office will keep all the money you have deposited, even if you die very soon afterwards. You can opt to guarantee the product for a certain number of years, or to ensure that you at least receive back the capital, but this is not necessarily a product to endear you to your heirs. However, this could be viewed as an advantage. By the time you stop receiving your annuity, you will have been completely released from the problems of personal finance. As the accompanying list shows (see right), annuities come in a bewildering variety of packages. The law provides that you must buy an annuity with the bulk of the funds you receive from your pension scheme or plan when you retire. As the rates being offered vary substantially between different life offices, it is worth shopping around to find the best deal. When not bought as part of a pension arrangement your annuity will receive more favourable tax treatment. Annuity payments are classed as return of capital with some interest element, and you will only be taxed on the interest, making the package attractive to higher-rate tax payers. When taking out an annuity this way, you should be careful with timing, as well as with your choice of life office. Annuity values tend to fluctuate in line with UK government gilts, and it is worth locking in while interest rates are high. Temporary annuities pay a fixed income for a given period, or during the purthe shorter. The capital disappears on death and the rates are higher for older people. Such annuities thus convert capital into income, and have tax advantages. They can be used to pre-fund lumpy calls on income, such as school fees, although Michael Chadwick of Chase de Vere says better rates of return can be achieved with other products. Often temporary annuities are linked to other investments, such as a with profits endowment policy. Part of the income from the annuities is used to fund the premiums for the policy; the hope is that the endowment will grow sufficiently to replace the capital invested in the temporary annuity. Other deals aim to maintain your wealth, making them more useful for inheritance tax planning. THE ANNUITIES ON OFFER SEVERAL ANNUITIES are available. Your choice is as follows: Temporary Annuities. These have a fixed term, and thus offer larger returns than annuities which only terminate on death. A typical term would be ten years. The best rates available at present on a nine-year annuity for a 70 year old man paying Pounds 10,000 initially are Pounds 2069.79 from Generali, and Pounds 2,067.40 from Friends Provident, according to Baronworth Investment Services. Immediate Annuities. The basic and best-known form, which keeps paying you the same amount each year until your death. Best rates according to Baronworth, keeping assumptions constant from the previous example, are Pounds 1,647.00 from RNPF Nurses, and Pounds 1,604.64 from Sun Alliance. Compulsory Purchase Annuities. These are similar to immediate annuities, but the sum to fund them comes from the proceeds of a pension scheme. You are obliged by law to buy one out of the bulk of the proceeds of your matured pension plan, although you do not have to buy the annuity offered by your pension scheme or provider. Unlike immediate and temporary annuities these pension-type contracts are treated as income, without a capital content, and are taxed accordingly. Joint Life Annuities. These involve annuities on the lives of two people, and they keep paying out until both have died. There are attractions for married couples who feel that they are both in good health, but the amounts paid are much less than for annuities on a single life. For example, Baronworth quotes the following example: a 75-year-old man paying Pounds 10,000 can receive a Pounds 1,907.04 annuity for the rest of his life. If the same man spent the same amount on an annuity for himself and his 70-year-old wife, with the same company, the couple would receive Pounds 1,316.04 between them per year. Index-linked Annuities. These are a particular triumph of actuarial science. The life office agrees to increase the amount you receive each year by the rate of increase in the retail prices index. This means that your income is inflation-proofed, but it will start at a substantially lower level. Increasing Annuities. These are similar in some ways to index-linked annuities. However, in these cases the life insurance company will guarantee a fixed percentage increase in your annuity each year until you die. If you think inflation is going to be less than the rate of increase offered, then these may make sense - although bear in mind that you are pitting your wits against the actuaries and the financial markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Questions and answers between an unidentified announcer and </F> Vienna-based correspondent Cha Man-sun over telephone -- live]    [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will  discuss countermeasures this afternoon after analyzing North  Korea's real intention. Here is correspondent Cha Man-sun  reporting from the IAEA on current movements.    [Announcer] Correspondent Cha Man-sun.    [Cha Man-sun] Yes.    [Announcer] How is the IAEA viewing North Korea's  announcement of withdrawing its membership?    [Cha] The IAEA interprets North Korea's announcement of  withdrawing its membership as giving up its rights and duties as  a member state, and the refusal of inspections for assuring the  continuity of inspection as a rejection of all inspections in  accordance with the nuclear accord. The IAEA is greatly  concerned that the continuity of inspections might be broken in  North Korea.    IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that although the agency has  not received an official notice from North Korea, it will  discuss countermeasures this afternoon after analyzing North  Korea's real intention.    According to an IAEA source, the nuclear accord, which went  into effect in 1992, is effective as long as North Korea does  not withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT].  The source said it is of grave concern that North Korea might  stubbornly insist that as a non-member state, it is not obliged  to comply with the nuclear accord it signed with the IAEA.    The source said that while the NPT has 164 member states,  the  IAEA has only 122, and since many countries that are member  states of the NPT are not IAEA members, at present, withdrawal  from the NPT is more of a concern than IAEA membership to the  international community.    [Announcer] Is North Korea's NPT membership still effective?    [Cha] The IAEA thinks so. Before I go into further detail,  let me tell you about the official procedure of withdrawing IAEA  membership. When an IAEA member state intends to withdraw, it  has to notify the depository country, the United States. Then  the United States will notify the IAEA Secretariat, the Board of  Governors, and all member states.    Therefore, North Korea may withdraw from the IAEA  immediately  after an official notification to the United States. Paragraph  1, Article 3 of the NPT from which North Korea has withheld its  withdrawal, stipulates that NPT member states are obliged to  sign a nuclear accord with the IAEA. North Korea became an IAEA  member in September 1974, an NPT member in December 1985, and  signed a nuclear accord in December 1991. The IAEA believes  that the nuclear accord signed with North Korea is still  effective because Article 26 of the nuclear accord signed  between the IAEA and North Korea stipulates that the accord is  effective as long as the country concerned is a member of the  NPT. Therefore, North Korea is obliged to accept IAEA  inspection in accordance with the nuclear accord.    On the other hand, two inspectors, who have remained in  Yongbyon since 18 May, checked the refueling without any  restriction until 13 June. What measures North Korea will take  regarding the inspectors today is of great concern.</p>

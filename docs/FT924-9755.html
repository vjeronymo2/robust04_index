			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Miners drop case after pits pledge: Unions accept British Coal's out-of-court offer MINERS' UNIONS yesterday called off their High Court attempt to force British Coal to resume immediate production at 10 pits after receiving assurances that no pit would become unworkable during consultations. British Coal management had earlier told lawyers acting for the National Union of Mineworkers, the Nacods pit supervisors' union and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers that it would take every step necessary to prevent a deterioration of coal, faces, roadway, and equipment at pits where production has ceased in the past three weeks, and would make daily reports on their conditions available to the unions. Under the out-of-court agreement, British Coal has stated that it will not include the cost of resuming production at the pits in estimating their economic viability. British Coal has also agreed to give an undertaking that, in considering redundancies, it will not discriminate against miners opting to remain in employment during the 90-day consultation period. Mr Mark Stephens, a solicitor for the NUM, described yesterday's agreement as a 'major step forward' in union efforts to save the pits. 'We were preparing to go to court because we feared British Coal was adversely affecting the future economic viability of the pits,' he said. 'We have stopped British Coal from doing that. We believe these pits are now redeemable.' Nevertheless, yesterday's move was the second time in two weeks that the unions failed to win an assurance from British Coal that miners at the 10 pits would be kept in work. Union concerns about the future of the pits looked set to be refuelled yesterday after British Coal confirmed that it had sent out notice-of-redundancy forms to its 50 collieries in anticipation that hundreds of miners would apply for voluntary redundancy over the next few weeks. British Coal said it was complying with the terms of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Consolidation Act 1992, under which employers must give notice to the government and the unions if 100 or more employees are to be dismissed or made redundant over 90 days or less. Mr Ken Capstick, the NUM's vice-president said last night: 'The government and British Coal are deceiving the British people into believing there is going to be a period of consultation. But they are already in the process of closing the pits down.'</p>

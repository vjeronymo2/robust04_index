			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green issues to 'shape' energy industry ENVIRONMENTAL considerations are likely to have a decisive influence over the future of the energy industry, according to participants in the World Energy Congress which began here yesterday. It will shape the way energy companies operate, as well as the use to which customers put their products. In each case, the industry could be the loser through higher regulatory costs, or changing patterns of demand. The industry's anxieties about environmental issues were set out by Mr David Simon, the chief executive of BP, who said: 'There has been a change in the standards demanded by customers - although not necessarily in the amounts they are prepared to pay for them.' He argued that oil companies were more environmentally aware than usually given credit for. And by investing in new oil supplies they were contributing towards the economic growth that enabled the world to afford higher environmental standards. If the public did not like fossil fuels it could always stop using them. But that was unrealistic. So the public must expect prices to rise to pay for higher standards, or else the oil industry would not be able to attract investment money. Nor would a proposed carbon tax achieve desired environmental results, especially if it was merely added to the range of taxes which already distorted the energy market. Mr Simon's keynote speech to the congress, held once every three years, was accompanied by a forecast from the World Energy Commission that energy supplies will be plentiful well into the next century, and that ecological pressures could be the sharpest factor depressing energy demand. Mr Henrik Ager-Hanssen, senior vice-president of Statoil, said this scenario implied enormous increases in energy efficiency, particularly among former communist countries, and the third world. But he doubted whether sufficient quantities of technology and finance could be transferred to these countries to achieve the necessary efficiency gains. 'There is major uncertainty as to whether or not such a development will be given priority as compared to policy actions which are more energy-supply oriented,' he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Costs of Delivering Custom-Ordered Items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The proposed regulations provide that, notwithstanding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general requirement that costs incurred in transporting goods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a taxpayer's storage facility to its retail sales facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are required to be capitalized, costs incurred outside a storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility in delivering custom-ordered items to a retail sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility are not required to be capitalized. For this purpose,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations provide that any costs incurred on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loading dock are treated as incurred outside a storage facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble to the proposed regulations also states that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service is considering eliminating this exception altogether.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commentators contended that the custom-order exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be eliminated because these delivery costs are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately characterized as costs incurred to ship goods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly to a customer rather than as costs incurred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internally move inventory. In addition, commentators asserted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the custom-order exception should not be limited to costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred outside a storage facility in delivering custom-ordered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> items to a retail sales facility. These commentators believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all costs incurred in delivering custom-ordered items to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retail sales facility should be deductible, regardless of whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are incurred inside or outside a storage facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These final regulations retain the custom-order exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service and Treasury believe that limiting this exception to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs incurred outside a storage facility in delivering custom-ordered items to a retail sales facility provides for a better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matching of income and related expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Costs of Transporting Goods to a Related Person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The proposed regulations provide that distribution costs do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not include costs incurred by a taxpayer in delivering goods to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related person. The proposed regulations further provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when a taxpayer sells goods to a related person, the costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transporting the goods are included in determining the basis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the goods that are sold, and hence in determining the resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gain or loss from such sale, for all purposes of the Internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision, the proposed regulation states that persons are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related if they are described in section 267(b) or section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 707(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator argued that the requirement to capitalize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs incurred by a taxpayer in delivering goods to a related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person is contrary to the purported purpose of section 263A and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can result in the permanent disallowance of the capitalized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs. The commentator noted that if the capitalization of costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred in transporting property between related parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produces or increases a loss, the loss disallowance rules in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 267(a)(1) and 707(b)(1) may in some instances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanently disallow the loss. Thus, the commentator argued that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirement to capitalize costs incurred by a taxpayer in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivering goods to a related person is unfair because it results in harsher treatment than the treatment of internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation costs carried on within a single entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These final regulations retain the rule contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations. The Service and Treasury continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that the cost of transporting goods between related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties is properly treated as a capitalizable handling cost for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all purposes (i.e., not just for timing purposes, but also for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> character purposes). In addition, the very limited potential for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss disallowance under sections 267(a)(1) and 707(b)(1) could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result from any one of a number of properly capitalizable costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., storage costs, production costs, etc.) other than handling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs associated with transporting goods to a related party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the fact that sections 267(a)(1) and 707(b)(1) will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in loss disallowance only in unusual circumstances does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not justify the additional complexity that would result to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayers from the series of rules that would be necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate the treatment requested by the commentator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Transfers for Tax Avoidance Purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The proposed regulations provide that the District Director  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may require appropriate adjustments to valuations of inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other property subject to section 263A if the transfer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property is made to another person for a principal purpose of tax  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoidance. The example provided in the proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states that the District Director may require a taxpayer using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the simplified production method (as described in &sect;1.263A&hyph;2(b))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to apply that method to transferred inventories immediately prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a transfer under section 351 if a principal purpose of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer is tax avoidance. The Service and Treasury continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that the Secretary has the authority to prescribe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to prevent taxpayers from using related parties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass-thru entities, or intermediaries to avoid the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 263A. Therefore, the final regulations retain the anti-abuse rule contained in the proposed regulations with one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifying modification that substitutes ``a principal purpose to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid the application of section 263A'' for ``a principal purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of tax avoidance.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Effective Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> These final regulations are applicable to costs incurred in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993. In the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property that is inventory in the hands of the taxpayer, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations are effective for taxable years beginning after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 31, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Accounting Method Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> If a taxpayer must change its method of accounting as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of these regulations, the taxpayer generally must file a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commissioner in accordance with the requirements of &sect;1.446&hyph;1(e)(3)(i) and Rev. Proc. 92&hyph;20, 1992&hyph;1 C.B. 685. If, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a result of these regulations a taxpayer changes its method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting in its first taxable year beginning on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1994, then the change must be made pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rev. Proc. 94&hyph;49, 1994&hyph;30 I.R.B., dated July 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

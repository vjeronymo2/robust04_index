			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Manuel Alvarez Cedeno and Orlando Mendieta C.] </F>   [Text] Planning Minister Delia Cardenas has said the U.S.  State Department official who said Panama is not making enough  effort to fight drug trafficking and money laundering "does not  know the Panamanian situation or what the government has done"  to fight the scourge.    This week, Robert Gelbard, the State Department official in  charge of overseeing the antidrug fight, said Panama is doing  very little to fight money laundering. Cardenas said: "I think  he does not know the Panamanian situation or the efforts the  government has made to fight drug trafficking and money  laundering throughout the country.''    The U.S. official's statement was also rejected by Foreign  Minister Jose Mulino, who described it as "unacceptable and  irresponsible." Minister Cardenas said: "We have done our part,  but the United States still has one importance task to perform:  to approve the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT]." Panama  and the United States signed MLAT in 1991, and it has been  ratified by the Panamanian Legislative Assembly but not by the  U.S. Congress. Cardenas described the position of the U.S.  official as "unfortunate."    Gelbard said Panama "has not taken the necessary steps to  counteract the problem of the presence of millions of dollars  generated by drug trafficking." In a note sent by Foreign  Minister Mulino to U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton, the Foreign  Ministry lists twelve steps the administration of President  Guillermo Endara has taken to fight drug trafficking and money  laundering.    Gelbard's assertion came at a time when the Bill Clinton  administration has announced a new policy for fighting drug  trafficking. The new policy is based on the fight against the  consumption of drugs and foresees a drop in financial aid to  countries that do not make real efforts to fight the production  and trafficking of drugs.    Hinton, who yesterday concluded his work in Panama,  apologized to the Endara government for Gelbard's statement. "In  my opinion," he said, "Panama has done a lot to fight drug  trafficking and I can point to the efforts of organizations like  the Judicial Technical Police, the National Air Service, and the  National Maritime Service in this endeavor."    Meanwhile, Supreme Court President Arturo Hoyos affirmed  that  Panama "works seriously" to fight drug trafficking activities.  He described the statement by the U.S. official as "improper."  According to Hoyos, there is a "big difference" between this  government and the past regime in matters having to do with the  fight against drug trafficking because, in those days, drug  trafficking was backed by important state officials.    He noted that although the state has limited resources, the  government has done a lot to confront drug traffickers  throughout the country. The justice said: "We must remember that  this country has just signed and delivered documents ratifying  the Vienna Convention regarding the fight against the  trafficking of hallucinogenic and illegal drugs." Justice Hoyos  said Panama has signed the MLAT with the United States and  Colombia. He explained that although Panama has already ratified  MLAT, which was signed in the United States, the United States  has not ratified it.</p>

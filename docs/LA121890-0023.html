			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: JUDGE LIFTS BAN ON SALE OF ART WITH CAFE'S LOGO  </P> <P> A federal district judge in Los Angeles has lifted a temporary restraining  order barring Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc., an art retailer and  distributor based in Van Nuys, from delivering silk screen prints bearing the  Hard Rock Cafe logo.  </P> <P> Judge J. Spencer Letts said Hard Rock Cafe America, which sought an extension  of the order, failed to prove that buyers would think that the Hard Rock Cafe  issued the print or authorized Martin Lawrence to use its logo.  </P> <P> The temporary order was lifted Friday, a week after it was issued.  </P> <P> Hard Rock Cafe will appeal the ruling, said the company's attorney, Harry B.  Swerdlow. The company also will pursue its lawsuit against Martin Lawrence,  claiming that the serigraph print by Hiromichi Yamagata violates its trademark  rights, Swerdlow said. The suit also seeks unspecified damages.  </P> <P> The print shows a hot-air balloon in the shape of an upside-down teapot bearing  the Hard Rock Cafe logo. Martin Lawrence Chairman Martin S. Blinder said each  print in the 555-piece edition has a retail value of about $3,800. The company  began selling the prints earlier this month, he said.  </P> <P> Blinder said the company has not determined what effect, if any, the  restraining order had on fourth-quarter earnings.  </P></p>

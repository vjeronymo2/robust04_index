The Russian president stressed that the settlement of the  current crisis should correspond to UN resolutions, the INTERFAX  NEWS AGENCY reported.    However, the news reports did not give details of the  discussion, saying that the two leaders agreed to continue their  dialogue over the Bosnia situation.    In a related development, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergey Lavrov today accused the Western threats to bomb Serb  military positions of "illegitimate." [sentence as received]    "We are doing everything to prevent air strikes," Lavrov  said. "and we consider the NATO ultimatum illegitimate."    Russian officials have opposed NATO air strikes against the  Serbs, who have ethnic and religious ties to Russia. Yeltsin  told reporters Tuesday [15 February] after a meeting with  British Prime Minister John Major that Russia sought to resolve  the crisis by peaceful means.    "Russia will play an active role in the negotiating process  in order to resolve the Yugoslav conflict by peaceful means,"  said Yeltsin.    The decision on air strikes should be left to the United  Nations, the Russian president said, adding that air raids would  be justified only if UN peacekeepers were attacked.</p>

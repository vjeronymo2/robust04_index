			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BONN DENIES EXPECTING COLLAPSE OF ECONOMY IN EAST GERMANY  </P> <P> West Germany, pushing for monetary union and political unification with East  Germany, stirred up an embarrassing row today over its partner's economic  health.  </P> <P> The trouble started when a senior Bonn official raised the prospect of an  imminent East German economic collapse.  </P> <P> Insisting on anonymity, he told reporters: "There are signs that, in only a few  days, East Germany could become insolvent."  </P> <P> It was this prospect, he said, that prompted West Germany on Wednesday to  suggest immediate talks with East Germany on a plan to introduce the  Deutschmark in the East to shore up its economy.  </P> <P> But official spokesmen for West Germany and for the East German government, led  by Hans Modrow, quickly denied that Bonn believed an East German economic  collapse was imminent.  </P> <P> Said East Berlin government spokesman Wolfgang Mayer: "As long as the Modrow  government is in power, East Germany will not become unable to meet its payment  (obligations)."  </P></p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Sprangare - back to the woods? Not many business leaders are courageous enough to describe a strategic alliance they have masterminded as a 'complete failure,' writes Christopher Brown-Humes. Yet Bjorn Sprangare, announcing his resignation last week as the chief executive of Swedish insurer Trygg-Hansa, was being disarmingly frank about his performance. Yes, there had been mistakes, he admitted. Yes, the public had lost confidence in him. And, yes, his departure might make it easier for Trygg to get the banking licence it has long coveted. No one deal unseated Sprangare - rather it was a series of investments that unhappily coincided with the crisis in Sweden's financial sector and brought the company huge losses. But he had his successes, too; he steered Trygg through a difficult demutualisation. The good news for Sprangare's successor (yet to be chosen) is that Trygg's domestic insurance business is in good shape. The bad news is that the group's difficulties with its investment in the US insurer, Home, continue. After Home's initial public offering misfired last year, Trygg now has a bigger chunk of Home than it wanted. Action is urgent given the heavy losses which Home inflicted on Trygg's mid-term figures. In truth, Sprangare always looked slightly uncomfortable in the world of financial services, given that his previous career was in the pulp and paper sector. It will be interesting to see whether the call of the woods for this doctor of forest science, whose favourite hobby is retiring to the woods and chopping down trees, is strong enough to lure him back to forestry now.</p>

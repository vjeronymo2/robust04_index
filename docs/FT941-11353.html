			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at Ryan Group subsidiary Ryan Group, one of Britain's largest private mining companies, yesterday said it was calling in the receivers at its Belgian subsidiary following a bitter dispute with its main customer. The group claimed that Ryan Europe had been forced out of business by Electrabel, the national power company which last October cut the price it paid for coal by 30 per cent. Earlier this week, anger at the company's imminent collapse spilled over at its Charleroi plant when workers barricaded three managers and a company lawyer in their offices, preventing them from attending a receivership court hearing. Up to half the 75-strong workforce are thought to have taken part in the action, during which they warned that the executives would not be released until their January wages were paid. The confrontation was defused last night when the company gave assurances that all salaried staff would receive outstanding wage cheques. Mr David Peek, group finance director, said the managers would today attend a court hearing to ask for a receiver to be appointed.</p>

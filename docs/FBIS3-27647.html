Tang and Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- The European Union (EU)  supports Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT) and hopes to see a GATT membership for Taiwan  before the end of this year, an EU official said Thursday [24  February].    Hugo Paemen, a ranking EU official in charge of external  economic relations, said the EU may also consider establishing a  representative office in Taiwan after Taiwan becomes a GATT  member.    Paemen made the remarks after leading a 21-member EU  delegation to two days of trade consultations with an 18-member  Republic of China [ROC] delegation at EU headquarters. It was  the first such meeting between European Union and ROC officials.    Paemen said the consultations were generally satisfactory  and  progress was made on several issues including market opening.    The EU official commented that even though the EU has  maintained a low profile when working with Taiwan, it is willing  to establish a formal communication channel. "And that's why  this consultation was arranged here in the EU headquarters," he  said.    The ROC delegation, headed by Board of Foreign Trade  Director-General Huang Yen-chao, said it was agreed that Taiwan  will sign an agreement on hazardous waste transportation with  the EU before May 6.    During the meeting, the ROC negotiators also explained  Taiwan's strenuous efforts in wildlife conservation. They asked  the EU to help provide details of accusations by world  conservation groups that Taiwan allows trade in endangered  species products to help Taiwan authorities in future crackdowns.    As to scientific and technological cooperation, the EU  officials said the union has at present no plan to set up an EU  sci-tech center in Taiwan. However, it welcomes bilateral  sci-tech personnel exchanges and EU [as received] and looks  forward to detailed discussions on this concern.    The two sides also talked about Taiwan opening up its  insurance, stock and securities markets and improvement in  Taiwan's tariff system on imported tobacco and alcohol.    The next ROC-EU trade consultation will be held in Taipei,  they decided.</p>

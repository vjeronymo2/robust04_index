			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Brown defies 'pessimism' over Nafta THE Clinton administration yesterday admitted widespread US 'pessimism and defensiveness' about the North American Free Trade Agreement, but promised to fight for it and pledged its commitment to 'freer trade'. In a speech prepared for delivery to Mexican businessmen in Monterrey, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown warned 'worried and disillusioned workers' against searching for scapegoats. In such a climate 'foreign trade becomes an issue that may not be considered rationally'. The administration had made Nafta implementation one of the pillars of its economic programme. As he spoke, trade negotiators from the US, Canada and Mexico entered their second day of talks in Washington on Nafta side agreements, concerning labour rights, the environment and import surges, which will have to be settled if the pact is to win congressional approval. Mr Brown called on businessmen in all three countries to re-examine their operations and demonstrate their commitment to high environmental and labour standards. Some critics of Nafta were using those issues 'to hack away at the underpinning of support'. 'There are some who are trying to graft other agendas on top of a trade agreement, whether or not that agreement might be killed in the process,' he claimed. 'Be assured this is not the case with Bill Clinton or Ron Brown.' Meanwhile, a confidential report from the Texas attorney-general's office - and allegedly prepared for Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative - claims that Nafta will affect US state laws more than any previous international agreement. 'Once approved by Congress, the agreement will supersede all conflicting state and federal laws,' it says. This could include health and safety and environmental agreements that are more stringent than federal laws. To protect state laws, it recommends that the proposed side agreements state explicitly that non-discriminatory standards are not necessarily obstacles to trade.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Markets: Economic corrections are no occasion for panic  -Economic Eye The most damaging legacy of Keynesian economics has been the over-simplistic attitude to policy-making it engendered. The error - one that cannot be ascribed to the master himself - was the popular presumption that it is possible to steer economies, almost quarter-by-quarter, on a path of rapid non-inflationary growth combined with low unemployment. What makes the recessions that have afflicted the major industrial countries in the 1990s significant is that they demonstrate that such management is infeasible. Except in continental Europe, where German unification has been so important, the element of external surprise of the oil-shocks of the 1970s has been lacking. The most important industrial countries - the US and Japan, though also the UK - have suffered, instead, from a credit-driven business cycle previously unknown since the 1920s. In these economies - as also in Germany, if for different reasons - the recession has reflected a correction of past excesses. The US and UK went into recession, together, in the middle of 1990 (see chart). That these countries went into recession first was hardly surprising, since their debt-fuelled growth of the 1980s had been considerably stronger than that of continental Europe. Meanwhile, the economies of Japan, the fastest growing industrial country, Germany, France and Italy continued to expand until early 1992, whereupon they entered recession. Having sunk into recession first, the US and UK economies are now recovering, the main difference between the two having been the length of their recessions and the strength of their recoveries. The US has experienced the blip that Nigel Lawson, as chancellor of the exchequer, promised for the UK. The short US recession was merely enough to put Mr Clinton into power, so allowing the president to take undeserved credit for the recovery. By contrast with the US, UK gross domestic product is still below its pre-recession peak. It is surprising therefore, that UK short term interest rates are 2 percentage points higher than those of the US, especially when recent inflation performance of the two countries has been similar. That the majority of the chancellor's panel of economic forecasters advised caution over interest rate cuts last week demonstrates how deeply the policy establishment has been bitten by past failures over inflation. Kenneth Clarke has even boasted that the UK is the fastest growing major economy in Europe. So it should be, since by 1992 it had, unlike the US, lost all the ground it had made on the other three between 1982 and 1990. As for those others, the central part of their story has been the shock of German unification. This helped push the German economy into a period of exceptional growth that was not shared by France or Italy. The Bundesbank policies aimed at slowing German inflation then pushed the already sluggish French and Italian economies into recession. But the recession in Germany has been more severe than in the other two, partly because the level of German economic activity had also been pushed well above its longer run trend. This merely demonstrates that the German monetary correction, justified in itself, was inappropriate for France and Italy, just as it had been for the UK in the last months of its ERM membership. The question, increasingly, is whether German monetary policy is even appropriate for Germany. Last but not least, there is Japan, whose economy has been going sideways since early-1992. But this followed a period of extraordinarily rapid money-driven growth in the late-1980s, as was true, if more briefly, of Germany. In Japan too, correction has been unavoidable. The picture of these recessions is intriguing, but its significance can only be assessed in a longer term context. Here the chart is illuminating. First, everyone must wish they had the same problems as the Japanese. Second, over the entire cycle, Japan and the US have remained well ahead of the four Europeans, which have stayed close together. For the first time since the 1940s, the UK has kept up with its European peers. What a pity they were also slowcoaches. The third and most important point is how much GDP has risen over the last cycle, notwithstanding the recession. Over these 12 years, Japanese GDP has risen by 50 per cent, that of the US by almost 40 per cent, the UK's by 30 per cent, and even German, French and Italian GDP by about a quarter. To put this in perspective, the absolute increase in US GDP since 1982 has been larger than total US GDP in 1940. That absolute increase is also equal to the increment between 1940 and 1964 or again between 1964 and 1982. Similarly, UK GDP has increased by as much since 1982 as it had previously done between 1964 and 1982. Such are the miracles of compound interest. Given the levels of wealth already enjoyed by advanced industrial countries, this is rather a remarkable performance. The worry must be far more over the distribution of the gains from growth, along with high and rising unemployment in Europe, than over the size of increases in GDP. There could also be a worry if recovery were unlikely. But it is not. Massive structural changes will, no doubt, be required in future, as in the past, but there is no reason to doubt the ability of those countries that entered recession late to follow the US and UK out of it. They are probably beginning to do so. True, it would help if German and Japanese policy-makers were more effective. But there is no reason to panic even over their failures. Economic corrections happen. The recession is no depression and is most unlikely to become one. If this realisation is why the finance ministers and central bank governors of the group of seven leading industrial countries agreed to decide nothing in particular at their meeting in Germany this weekend, they showed considerable common sense.</p>

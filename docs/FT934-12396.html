			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Gloom forecast for finance sector A SHRINKING financial services industry in the south-east is leading to fewer jobs and changing working patterns for employees, says a report published yesterday. The study by Hull and Bristol universities warns that the industry could be facing a long-term decline after the shake-out in jobs and companies during the past two years. The report, published by the South East Economic Development Strategy, calls for local authorities to take more interest in the provision of financial services and for training and enterprise councils to develop training programmes geared to the needs of local financial services employers. Financial services was the key growth sector during the 1980s, says the report. While overall employment in the UK remained constant in the 1970s and 1980s, financial services doubled to nearly 2m people in the same period. Between 1990 and 1992 financial services employment fell by 11 per cent in the south-east as companies retrenched and changed employment practices under increased competitive pressures. 'At best, these changes will serve to restrict the growth of financial services employment. At worst, employment in the industry will experience a long-term decline,' says the report. The report says the introduction of more part-time working as companies reorganised has led to fewer opportunities for promotion among part-timers.

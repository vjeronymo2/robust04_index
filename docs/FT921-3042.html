			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Singapore opposes Asean move over Burma SINGAPORE'S prime minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, has ruled out any unified initiative by the Association of South East Asian Nations on Burma for that country's widespread repression of its Moslem minority. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Goh said developments in Burma could have a destabilising effect on the region but it was not Asean's style to seek a common position on a particular political problem. Several countries in Asean, which groups Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Brunei, have expressed concern about Burma's handling of its Moslem minority and the fate of thousands of Burmese Moslems who have recently crossed the border into Bangladesh. Mr Goh said each of these protests had been delivered individually. There was no common approach within Asean to Burma. Asked about the considerable arms build-up in south-east Asia recently, he said this was not a response to US withdrawal from the area. 'Countries in this region always have believed in what is called national resilience,' said Mr Goh. 'They must have the capacity to defend themselves.' Singapore has one of the best equipped military machines in south-east Asia and spends more on defence per capita than any other country in the region. 'I always imagine Singapore as a very small state that any adventurer can grab with one hand. If you want to prevent that happening you've got to take defence seriously,' he said. On domestic politics, Mr Goh said he would continue to try to offer Singaporeans more choices and a less regulated society. 'We are trying to widen the fairways,' he said. He was opposed to Singapore importing any more foreign workers to try to alleviate Singapore's serious labour shortage. The government says there are about 150,000 foreign workers in Singapore, but unofficial estimates put the figure at nearly double that. Most of them come from the Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka.</p>

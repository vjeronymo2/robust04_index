			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 17--Apprehending resumption of U.S.  military aid to Pakistan, members at today's meeting of the  Parliamentary Consultative Committee on External Affairs  criticised the proposal to amend the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act.    The meeting focussed on the current state of Indo-U.S.  relations and inquired into the reasons which led to  postponement of the G-15 summit.    In the absence of the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh  Singh, who was attending the Congress Parliamentary Party  meeting, the Consultative Committee meeting was jointly chaired  by the two Ministers of State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L.  Bhatia and Mr. Salman Khurshid.    Drawing attention to the proposed changes in the Foreign  Assistance Act, members felt the legislation will dilute the  restrictions on the passage of military and economic aid to  Pakistan, currently in force under the Pressler Amendment.    Targeted against Pakistan, the Pressler Amendment pins  military aid to Pakistan to a certification by the U.S.  President that Islamabad does not possess a nuclear weapon.    The new element in the proposed legislation is that in  exceptional circumstances, the U.S. President can exercise  discretionary powers to release military and economic aid even  to those countries whose non-proliferation record is suspect.    Referring to the proposal, members said that it made India  also a potential target of U.S. aid restrictions.    Responding to members' remarks on the nuclear issue, Mr.  Bhatia said there would be no change in India's position on  non-proliferation as it was based on "sound and fundamental  principles." Earlier, members said that though every effort  should be made to maintain good relations with the United  States, this should not deter India from "frankly" stating its  stand on issues including non-proliferation and human rights.    Focussing on the recent remarks of the U.S. official, Ms.  Robin Raphael, questioning Kashmir's accession to India, members  felt that there was a shift in U.S. policy on India. The change  was particularly pronounced on the Kashmir question, they felt.    Rejecting the U.S. position that Kashmir was a "disputed  territory," members emphasised that "the legal situation was  that the dispute on Kashmir related to Pakistan Occupied  Kashmir, which was Indian territory illegally occupied by  Pakistan."    Simla Accord relevant: Countering Ms. Raphael's  reference to Simla Accord as a "non-functional," Mr. Bhatia said  the relevance of the agreement was evident for it had been  instrumental in maintaining peace for more than 20 years. India  continued to stand by it, he asserted. Mr. Bhatia made these  remarks in the wake of the "surprise" expressed by members at  Ms. Raphael's statement.    Denying allegations of the Indian security forces poor  observance of human rights. Mr, Bhatia drew attention to the  Bill introduced in Parliament to form a Human Rights Commission.    Referring to Washington's decision not to declare Pakistan a  terrorist State, Mr. Bhatia said the United States had not taken  "the final step for its own reasons." All requisite evidence  that India possessed had been passed on to the United States, he  said.    Focussing on Pakistan's abetment of terrorism and admission  by Islamabad that it had a nuclear weapon programme, members  said they found it difficult to comprehend why despite the  admission the United States chose to impose pressure on India.    On the postponement of the G-15 summit on account of lack of  quorum, Mr. Salman Khurshid cited "unfortunate set of  coincidences, relating to domestic compulsions of different  kinds," which had kept a large number of heads away. Heads from  11 countries had confirmed participation till December 4, Mr.  Khurshid said.    According to a member, it was admitted that Rs. 6 crores had  been spent on the preparations for the summit. Citing changes in  the global environment, a member questioned the relevance of  G-15 in the wake of the emergence of trade blocs such as NAFTA  [North American Free Trade Agreement] and APEC [Asian-Pacific  Economic Cooperation] .</p>

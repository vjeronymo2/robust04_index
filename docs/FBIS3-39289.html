			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton, Eastward"] </F>   [Text] Bill Clinton's Far East policy has taken another  step in lifting the trade embargo which the United States kept  imposed on Vietnam, thus ending three decades of hostilities  with that Southeast Asian country. It is a decision consistent  with the lines of opening to the enormous markets of the Pacific  and Indian Ocean countries laid down by the Free Trade Treaty.    The fall of the Berlin Wall, the coming together of the two  Europes, the end of apartheid in South Africa, the understanding  between Jews and Christians in the Vatican and Jerusalem, and  the agreements between the Israelis and the PLO -- to cite the  most celebrated rapprochements -- have created a world  atmosphere of peace and the elimination of barriers which  separated people from each other for decades and even centuries.    Clinton has decided to end 30 years of confrontations  between  Hanoi and Washington. This will entail a high political cost  for him in view of the wounds which that war inflicted on U.S.  society, but he has paid more heed to the unanimous opinion of  his advisers, including the military, who had been advising him  to lift the embargo, and this shows his repeated concern to  serve the cause of peace.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Hammerson warns of 50% cut in payout HAMMERSON yesterday became the second big UK property group to signal a dividend cut when it announced plans to cut the total payout by more than 50 per cent from 20.5p to 10p. The company said depressed conditions in its main markets of the UK, Canada and Australia meant the interim dividend of 3.5p is maintained, but a final dividend of 6.5p instead of 17p would be recommended. Mr John Parry, managing director, said the cut took the dividend to a 'sustainable' level. Mr Sydney Mason, chairman, spoke of a recession 'both deeper and longer than any in living memory'. In August Slough Estates cut its interim dividend from 4.4p to 3.1p. Yesterday's proposed cut by Hammerson was expected by the stock market, which marked up the company's 'A' shares by 13p to 192p. Analysts were divided over whether other large UK property companies would also cut dividends when announcing results in coming weeks. Hammerson pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 31.1m to Pounds 23.3m in the six months to June 30. The fall was mainly due to higher finance costs: the company's development programme is nearly complete so less interest is being capitalised. Net rental and other income increased 3.9 per cent to Pounds 63.4m. Vacancy rates increased 1 per cent from a year ago to 8.5 per cent but remain low compared with the sector. Bad debts also remained low at less than 1 per cent of turnover and are likely to be below last year's Pounds 1.4m, the company said. Finance costs increased from Pounds 21m to Pounds 31.8m, as capitalised interest fell from Pounds 19.4m to Pounds 8.5m. Capitalised interest is likely to total Pounds 15m this year, and fall to almost zero next, as the development programme is completed. Net borrowings stood at just under Pounds 800m compared with Pounds 824m at the year-end, leaving a gearing percentage 'in the mid-70s', said Mr Parry. But this figure partly depends on property values, only valued at the year-end. There were no profits from property trading. An investment property in Fleet Street, London was sold for Pounds 12m, giving an extraordinary profit of Pounds 4.3m. Earnings per share fell from 12.9p to 10.8p. Lex, Page 20</p>

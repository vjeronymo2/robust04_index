			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan must ease its grip on  the financial markets to facilitate fund flows, particularly  with other Asian markets, an advisory panel to the finance and  trade ministers said Wednesday [8 June].    The committee on foreign exchange and other [as received]  also proposed a revision in Japan's statistics on international  balance of payments, mainly switching to yen-denominated figures  from the current U.S. dollar base. The statistics include  politically sensitive current account figures used to measure  trade imbalances.    The proposals in the annual report cited criticism at home  and abroad over the tight market rules in Japan, an increasing  role overseas of advanced financial derivatives and spreading  moves by Japanese companies to enter other Asian nations.    "The annual report focused on Asia this year...especially  with boosting direct investment by Japanese manufacturers and  increasing competition with Hong Kong and Singapore financial  markets," said Tomomitsu Oba, head of the committee's special  group that compiled the report.    Speaking at a news conference after a panel meeting, Oba  added that revising the balance of payment statistics is another  key part of the report, noting, "all major nations offer them  only in their own currencies."    A Finance Ministry official told the same news meeting that  the ministry wants to revise the figures by the end of fiscal  1997.    The panel said in the report, "further deregulatory steps  are  needed in our financial markets" to meet fund demand at home and  from abroad through diversified fund-raising means.    It particularly expressed "full expectations" on commissions  and taxes.    On financial derivatives such as options and swaps, the  panel  wants the government to "prepare acceptable products in our  financial markets while ensuring transparency and fairness of  transactions."    Strict rules over issuing bonds and stocks prevail in Japan  despite a global trend for deregulation, and obtaining  permission is especially difficult for financial derivatives  that are becoming the mainstay in deregulated markets.    Japanese banks and securities firms are, in fact,  increasingly moving to set up subsidiaries specializing in  derivatives in Hong Kong and other Asian nations where  regulations are far looser.    Focusing on such moves by financial institutions as well as  by manufacturers to enter other Asian nations, the panel said it  "expects our financial markets...to take a mutual complementary  role with the Asian markets."    The report noted that fund demand is on a sharp rise in  tandem with soaring entries by Japanese companies into the fast  growing Asian economies since the late 1980s to cope with the  yen's rise.    "But smooth procurement of long-term funds is still  difficult  there, excluding Hong Kong and Singapore," the panel said,  calling for improvement of Japan's markets as a fund-raising  vehicle for other Asian nations.    Meanwhile, the forum also suggested that some rules are  needed for financial derivatives as the report mentioned only  "acceptable products" and called for "transparency and fairness."    This apparently reflected heightening international concerns  led by the United States that advanced, off-the-book derivatives  may lead to unnecessary market volatility.    The panel said preparation of statistics for grasping the  conditions is "not catching up" with the quick development of  derivatives.    Along with such advanced financial transactions, service  trade is also "diversifying and increasing" to make data  currently included in the international balance of payments  insufficient, the report said.    Against this backdrop, the panel called on the Finance  Ministry to revamp the balance of payments statistics to improve  service trade and investment data in line with a manual prepared  last year by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>

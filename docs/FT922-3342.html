			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries becalmed ahead of economic data release FOR the second consecutive day, a reluctance to trade actively ahead of important economic figures left US Treasury markets becalmed yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  7/32 at 101 1/8 , yielding 7.895 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly weaker, down  1/32 at 100 1/16 , yielding 5.074 per cent. Treasury prices were actually firmer overnight in foreign markets, but as soon as New York opened they began to give ground. A prediction late on Tuesday by Mr Robert Black, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve, that the US economy could sustain a 3 per cent growth rate, contributed to yesterday's modest declines. The dominant trend in the market was an unwillingness to take large positions ahead of today's economic data. The consensus of forecasts is for a 0.3 per cent rise in May producer prices and a 0.7 per cent rise in May retail sales. If the inflation number is significantly better and the retail sales much worse than the consensus, then the chances of another Fed interest rate cut will improve. Few market participants, however, are expecting any surprises from the data. In the credit markets, the Fed arranged Dollars 2bn in customer repurchase agreements to add reserves to the system and push the Fed funds rate lower. At the time of the intervention Fed funds were trading at 3 5/8 per cent, and by midday remained stuck at that level, slightly below the Fed's target of 3 3/4 per cent. Analysts said the customer repos were not an attempt by the Fed to ease monetary policy. DOMESTIC buying interest helped to support the UK government bond market with long-dated issues closing about  1/8 of a point higher on the day. The gilt market traded in a narrow range, opening on a weak note but gaining strength from the firmness of the pound. The Liffe futures contract opened at 97.24, trading between 97.21-97.30 and ending the day at the top of its range. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 115 15/16 to 116 1/16 to yield 9.32 per cent. However, traders said gains at the far end of the maturity range were held in check by concerns about future supply. The Bank of England announced last week that it would sell stock in the 2007-2012 maturity range at its auction on June 24. Yesterday, dealers said the rise in the 9 per cent gilt due 2012 (which is considered a possible auction stock) was limited by concern about supply in this area, with the issue rising only  1/32 to 99 7/8 . The Bank is due to announce the auction stock next Tuesday. THE German government bond slipped back during the day following the weakness of the Deutschemark in the foreign exchange markets. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.37 and drifted down to a low of 88.16 before regaining some of its lost ground to end at around 88.30. Traders said they saw some profit-taking following the bund market's recent rally in the wake of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty. Last week's referendum result shook the European government bond markets and prompted investors and dealers to switch out of the higher-yielding bond markets into the D-Mark bloc. JAPANESE government bonds opened on a depressed note, due to the combination of a weaker yen and the overnight fall in the US Treasury market, but picked up to close slightly higher on the day. Dealers said buying interest was stronger for short-dated issues than for longer maturities. The benchmark No 129 issue traded in a narrow range, opening with a yield of 5.53 per cent and ending the day at 5.51 per cent. 'The market is sidelined, awaiting fresh factors,' said one trader, adding that many of the participants are awaiting the Bank of Japan's quarterly 'Tankan' report tomorrow.</p>

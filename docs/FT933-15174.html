			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / World News in Brief: Riddle of Romanov remains is solved British scientists said bones found in Yekaterinburg, Russia, were almost certainly those of the murdered Tsar Nicholas II and his family, thought to have been shot in 1918 after the Bolshevik revolution. Genetic fingerprinting tests showed 'almost a 99 per cent probability' that the bones were those of the Romanovs, the researchers said. The remains were brought to Britain by scientist Dr Pavel Ivanov, who also helped in the identification process.</p>

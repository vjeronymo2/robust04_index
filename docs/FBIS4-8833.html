			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mincho Minchev, chairman of the "Marxist </F> Platform" Ideological Union in the Bulgarian Socialist Party, by  Magdalina Andonova; place and date not given: "We Oppose the  Uncritical Acceptance of Social Democracy"]    [Excerpts] [Andonova] On the basis of its contents, the  draft program of your ideological union is described as the most  leftist one in comparison with the other draft programs. Do you  oppose the draft program of the Strategic Center led by  Aleksandur Lilov?    [Minchev] It is true that our draft of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] program could be described as the most  leftist one of all those submitted. However, this does not mean  that it is supported only by the leftist periphery of the party.  On the contrary, we are convinced that it is closest to the  understandings of the majority of Socialists.    Nevertheless, we think that the document of the Strategic  Center is the basic one. With its openness to most different  ideas it could unite the party at present and preserve it as a  whole. Our draft is not an alternative but rather a correction  to the "Lilov" draft. [passage omitted]    [Andonova] Are you trying to save Marxism from oblivion, or  have you discovered new elements of this teaching?    [Minchev] Marxism does not need to be saved. It has not  been forgotten by any serious political scientist in the West.  Without the Marxist methodology it is impossible to analyze the  contemporary social processes or forecast the future.    [Andonova] Very briefly, what are the basic tenets of your  draft program for the BSP?    [Minchev] First -- overcoming the social crisis and ensuring  a new national upsurge in Bulgaria are unthinkable without  restoring socialism.    Second -- For this we do not merely need an alliance of the  left and center parties, but rather to win the support of a  great part of the working people in Bulgaria.    Third -- We must turn the BSP into a modern Marxist party,  which takes into consideration the changes that have taken place  in the world and the new social realities, without relinquishing  the basic goal -- implementing the civilized socialist plan of  social development.    [Andonova] To what will you never agree regarding the  positions of your opponents in the party?    [Minchev] Those are the people who propose to turn the BSP  into a typical social democratic party with all its attributes  (which have been rejected by the time). The changes that took  place in Europe and the world after 1989 were an expression not  only of the crisis of the Communist Parties, but also of the  crisis of the social democratic parties. I find it strange that  there are people in the BSP who think that since "the fall of  communism" the parties of the social democratic type have  triumphed. This is not true! Those parties are also in the  middle of a great crisis!    We oppose the uncritical and total acceptance of the parties  of the social democratic type as a model for the change in the  BSP simply because parties of this type are frozen in their  development at the 1951 level, when the Stockholm Declaration of  the Socialist International was adopted.    Since then the world has changed beyond recognition. During  this period there was real socialism in the East European  countries and it is political infantilism to ignore this fact.    Something new must be sought. We could find it only if we  move forward and continue our struggle.</p>

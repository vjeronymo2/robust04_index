			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Compaq to boost spending by Pounds 10m Compaq, the US computer company whose European sales recently overtook those of International Business Machines, is to spend a further Pounds 10m expanding its manufacturing plant at Erskine near Glasgow. This will create 300 jobs by the end of the year. The decision follows the announcement in January of a Pounds 7m investment involving 250 new jobs at Erskine. The company will install five production lines for the assembly of printed circuit boards, the basic component of a personal computer. The first two lines will come into operation in July and the remainder by the end of the year. The expansion will take the plant's workforce from 800 to 1,350. The latest investment decision will give the Erskine plant greater flexibility and make it more vertically integrated. It previously assembled desktop and laptop personal computers, importing printed circuit boards from Compaq's plants in Houston, Texas, and in Singapore, and from third-party suppliers. Compaq said yesterday that the convenience of having much of its printed circuit board assembly in the Erskine plant would outweigh any price advantage of importing from the Far East. The market research company Dataquest said this week that Compaq's share of the European personal computer market in the first quarter of this year was 11.8 per cent, compared with IBM's 11.0 per cent. This compares with the first quarter of 1993 when IBM's share was 12.8 per cent and Compaq's 10.8 per cent. The Erskine plant is about 20 miles from IBM's European personal computer plant at Greenock. Electronics was the fastest growing component of Scotland's manufacturing output in the first quarter.</p>

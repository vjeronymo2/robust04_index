			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ANGELS SIGN PITCHER LANGSTON TO 5-YEAR, $16-MILLION CONTRACT  </P> <P> In a bold move sure to send the skyrocketing price of baseball free agents even  higher, the Angels today signed Mark Langston to a five-year contract worth $16  million, making the 29-year-old left-hander the game's highest paid player.  (Details, Page P10)  </P> <P> Langston, who had a combined 16-14 record with the Mariners and Expos last  season, got the longest contract awarded a player since the mid-1980s. Only  Tuesday, Rickey Henderson broke the $3-million contract barrier when he  re-signed with the World Champion Oakland A's for $12 million over four years.  That was the first contract of that length since October, 1985, when Ken  Oberkfell signed a four-year, $3-million agreement with the Atlanta Braves.  </P> <P> This off-season, which promises to be the busiest free-agent market ever, has  seen Bryn Smith leave Montreal to sign a $6-million, three-year deal with the  St. Louis Cardinals, Kirby Puckett re-sign with the Minnesota Twins for $9  million over three years and Pascual Perez sign with the New York Yankees for  $5.7 million for three years.  </P> <P> Langston, a native of San Diego, had held discussions with the Dodgers and  Yankees before signing with the already pitching-rich Angels. The staff last  season had a collective earned-run average of 3.28, second-best in the American  League.  </P></p>

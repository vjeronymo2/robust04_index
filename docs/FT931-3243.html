			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hurricane claims cost GIO at least Dollars 15bn GIO Australia, the privatised Australian insurance group, yesterday blamed disappointing investment returns, hurricane claims and rationalisation costs for a disappointing net profit of ADollars 43m (USDollars 30.7m) for the six months to December. GIO, which was floated by the New South Wales state government in July, said it made an operating profit of ADollars 73m on turnover of ADollars 990m. The group declared an initial interim dividend of 7 cents, fully-franked. The group gave no comparative figures for last year's first half, when it was in government ownership. It re-ported a ADollars 117m net profit for the 12 months to June, up 23 per cent on the previous year. Mr Bill Jocelyn, managing director, said losses from Hurricane Andrew, which hit Florida last year, were estimated at between USDollars 15bn and USDollars 18bn, compared with an earlier estimate of USDollars 8bn. The result includes a loss of ADollars 7m caused by hurricane-related claims against SIO, the Victorian state insurance office, which was acquired by GIO last year. GIO said the full cost of integrating SIO during the half was ADollars 10.3m. Jennings, the Australian homebuilder, said its bankers would convert ADollars 27m of bank debt into equity, on top of the ADollars 63m converted into a 39 per cent equity stake last August, Reuter reports from Melbourne. Jennings, 43 per cent owned by Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand forestry and energy group, said the bankers would receive non-voting preference shares on the additional ADollars 27m. The company earlier reported attributable losses of ADollars 23.05m for the six months to December 31, compared with losses of ADollars 27.96m a year earlier. Net operating profits totalled ADollars 181,000, down from ADollars 3.73m. The company again paid no dividend.</p>

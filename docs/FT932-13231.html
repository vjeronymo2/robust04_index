			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Bank of France shaves its interest rates THE Bank of France yesterday shaved 0.25 of a percentage point off both its official interest rates, bringing its intervention rate down to 8.50 per cent and its 5-10 day 'repurchase' lending rate down to 9.50 per cent. Virtually all the country's big commercial banks responded swiftly by cutting their base rates from 9.75 per cent to 9.50. Earlier, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, discussed with employers and union leaders the tough fiscal measures he plans next month. But the day-long talks were inconclusive, with the prime minister seeking and getting no more than the acquiescence of the two sides of French industry that serious measures were needed to save the country's social security and pension schemes from bankruptcy. The French central bank acknowledged yesterday that it had taken part in the general move to support the beleaguered Spanish currency by buying an undisclosed quantity of pesetas against francs. Despite such intervention and yesterday's interest rate cuts, the franc held steady. Meanwhile, farmers in south west France and fishermen in Brittany yesterday said they would resume their protests this weekend, or next, against sliding prices of fruit and vegetables and cheap fish imports. Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm adds: The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, lowered its marginal rate by 0.25 of a percentage point from 9.75 to 9.5 per cent. Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, also cut its key overnight lending rate 0.25 of a point, from 8.25 to 8.0 per cent.</p>

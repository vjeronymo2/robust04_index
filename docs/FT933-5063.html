			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Bury voters want alternative to cuts in services: FT writers report on the controversy over the November Budget and gauge the views of voters and industry MS KAREN Sinacola, who works at the black pudding stall in Bury, Greater Manchester, hopes that the government will neither raise taxes nor cut services. 'Isn't there something in between they can do?' she asked. She did not vote in last year's general election, but intends to vote Labour next time. 'They may tax us more, but I don't suppose they can do worse,' she said. Ms Nicola Bailey, assisting on the black pudding stall, was not old enough to vote last year. As for the next election: 'I don't know what I'll do yet, but I'll probably vote Conservative.' Politicians pay close attention to voters in Bury. They remain prime Labour targets in a north-west England cluster of 10 marginals which will be essential to any Labour victory. Mr Norman Diggle retired last Wednesday as Bury's town centre postman. He and his wife Audrey will have to live on just under Pounds 100 a week of state pension and a small sum from his 11 years with the Post Office. 'Now I'm a pensioner, I certainly do not want more taxes,' he said, as the couple did their weekend shopping in Bury market. 'Lower taxes are what we voted for. But services have been cut enough. It's a tricky situation.' Mr Brian Nolan, a payroll manager who was made redundant twice in the 1980s, had a clearer view: 'Whether I'm in favour of higher taxes depends on who they are going to tax. They usually tax the ordinary people. Thatcher doubled VAT and Major put it up to 17 1/2 per cent. 'This hit everybody, especially the poor. My wife is a social worker and she sees the effect of it all on people. I want no more cuts. I would rather they put any tax increase on PAYE, then only the people who are earning would be paying.' Mr James Wallace, who has sold eggs in the market for 29 years, expects to have to pay more. 'Whether I'm in favour depends on the alternative. If it will avoid more cuts, I suppose tax increases are inevitable. But they should be overall because that would be fairer.' A young father with his infant son in a pushchair was similarly resigned, but wanted high earners hit hardest. 'I'm not giving my name because I'm worried about being sacked for speaking out. I work for one of the privatised utilities and they don't like employees speaking to the media,' he said. 'What has really upset me has been the wage rises the bosses have given themselves. I think there is much more bad feeling about directors' pay than there would be over tax rises. If the basic rate of tax went up 1 per cent or 2 per cent, but went to the National Health Service, I wouldn't be worried,' he added. More important for the government, however, is that both Mr Wallace and the young father voted Conservative last year. So did Mr and Mrs Diggle. Mr Nolan voted for Mrs Thatcher in 1979 but has since floated between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. He said he would vote Labour next time. The good news ends there for Labour, however. It was impossible to find anyone - even among the party's supporters - who believed it was going to win the next election. Mr Wallace said as he sold another carton of large eggs: 'I think the Liberal Democrats will do better next time, but I don't think Labour will win.' This was also the view of the young father. He expects a hung parliament. His wife, however, was adamant: 'I won't vote Labour. I'm not a socialist and I don't believe in socialism. But I don't believe in all this privatisation either.' She added: 'They have invited private-sector bids for parts of the social security department and the Inland Revenue. It's wrong. How do you guarantee confidentiality about individuals' tax and benefits if you put the records into private hands?'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin confirmed today that he had proposed a one-day  summit meeting with leaders of four big NATO nations to "put a  full end" to the conflicts in former Yugoslavia.    Yeltsin said he believes it is possible to sign a joint  agreement between leaders of Russia, the United States, Britain,  France and Germany on "ending the bloodshed" in former  Yugoslavia.    After laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at  the Kremlin wall on the occasion of the day of motherland  defenders, Yeltsin said he had proposed that the leaders of  Russia and the four major NATO member states meet in Moscow,  Geneva or some other capital city for a day of talks and signing  of "a document of historic significance."    He stressed that Russia must take part in resolving any  major  international issues and accused the west of attempting to  deprive Moscow of any role in finding solutions to these issues.    "Attempts of certain leaders (of NATO) to keep Russia away  from solving international security issues is a discrimination.  Russia has to and will participate in all major international  events as a permanent member of the UN Security council," the  Russian president pointed out.    Yeltsin said Russia was outraged by the NATO ultimatum to  Bosnian Serbs.    NATO's decision, he said, "without asking Russia, to bomb  the  Sarajevo region had made not only Russian diplomats but all  Russian citizens indignant."    Yeltsin reiterated that Russia's efforts, including the trip  of his special envoy Vitaliy Churkin to Bosnia-Herzegovina,  averted the catastrophe.    Churkin negotiated a deal with Bosnian Serb leaders, under  which the Serbs began pulling back their heavy weapons from  around Sarajevo before the NATO deadline expired on February 20  and Russia's 400 peacekeepers moved from Croatia to the besieged  city to contribute to a peacekeeping force there.</p>

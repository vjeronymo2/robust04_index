Zou made the remarks at a symposium on economic planning of  the coastal area of the Bohai Sea, which was held in Tangshan  city of Hebei Province from January 17 to 19.    This was the country's fourth symposium on regional economic  planning. In 1992 and 1993, symposiums on economic planning of  the region covering southwest China and part of south China, the  Chang Jiang river delta and the riparian region and the  northwest-China region were held.    Vice-Premier Zou pointed out that as a focal point of the  northeast Asian economic sphere and an outlet of north China,  northeast China and northwest China towards the Pacific Ocean,  the region around the Bohai Sea has many advantages.    He said that the region ranks first in research forces. The  number of higher education establishments and research and  technical personnel in the region accounts for one third of the  national total.    Besides, the output of coal, crude oil and iron and steel of  the region all account for 40 percent of the national total  respectively. The region is both China's political and economic  center. To accelerate the economic development of the region  has a strategic significance for the development of the national  economy.    Zou listed the following focal points of the program for the  development of the region:    -- To build a network of telecommunications covering all  parts of China, with Beijing as the center, and a network of  communications concentrating on transport of coal and  commodities for export;    -- To cooperate to open up more natural resources in the  region and develop the industry of raw materials;    -- To establish a unified regional and open market to make  better use of natural resources;    -- To make efforts to solve the problem of water shortages  in  the region through quickening construction of the projects aimed  at diverting water from the southern part of the country to the  region;    -- To support poor people in the rural area and help  industrial enterprises to make up for deficits and increase  profits so as to allow the region's economy to develop in a  sustained, quick and healthy way.    Participating in the symposium were representatives from the  provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong and Shanxi, as well as  the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin. Officials from the  ministries of railways, communications, power, coal, metallurgy,  chemicals and agriculture also attended the symposium.</p>

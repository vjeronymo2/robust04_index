Macaspac] </F>   [Text] The Central Police District Command (CPDC) has  created a drug enforcement team which will conduct police  operations in a national level.    CPDC Director Chief Superintendent Diony Alvaro Ventura  bared  this during their weekly command conference wherein he directed  his 11 station commanders to turn over all cases involving  illegal drugs to newly-activated Drug Enforcement Task Force  (DETF).    According to Ventura, the DETF will be the sole authority in  the command level to conduct intelligence and investigation on  suspected drug traffickers not only in Quezon City but also  nationwide.    "Not only that, but DETF will also be responsible in filing  drug cases which was the normal practice in CPDC before. DETF  was born by a unified effort not only to sting the street but  the national level as well," Ventura explained.    He said, only two commands -- the CPDC and the Western  Police  District Command (WPDC) -- under Senior Supt. Hermogenes Ebdane  were tasked by Chief Superintendent Recaredo Sarmiento III,  National Capital Region Command (NCRC) director, to create their  own "centralized" drug enforcement office.    He said the two command's task forces will be headed by  Supt.  Dominador Resos.    The PNP-Narcom [Philippine National Police-Narcotics  Command]  has provided the personnel, the PNP General Headquarters will  render legal assistance, and the PNP Crime Laboratory will  conduct lab testing on seized illegal drugs.</p>

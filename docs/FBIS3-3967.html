			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Chen Jinhua, minister  in charge of China's State Planning Commission, said here today  that China is giving priority to the development of energy  industry in drafting its next five-year plan -- the ninth -- and  a long-term industrial policy.    Speaking today at a China petroleum investment conference  being held here, he said that in the medium to long-term plan,  China will "take coal as the basis and electric power the focus  in developing energy resources."    At the same time, he said, it is necessary to make great  efforts to develop fine quality, relatively clean energy sources  such as oil and natural gas.    More than 300 world oil leaders, senior executives, bankers  and experts attended the two-day conference, the highest ranking  of its kind so far held in China.    Chen said that in order to ensure an average annual growth  rate of 8-9 percent for China's national economy in the 1990s,  developing and conserving energy should be equally stressed.    By maintaining the energy saving rate at the average annual  level of 3.6 percent during the 1980s, China's annual energy  consumption increase in the coming years will be kept below 4  percent, he added.    The minister said that by the year 2000, China is expected  to  produce 160-170 million tons of oil and some 30 billion cubic  meters of natural gas. Last year the production of oil was 150  million tons and that of natural gas was 16 billion cubic meters.    Meanwhile, Chen said, China's electric power output is  continuing to grow at an average annual rate of more than 8  percent in the 1990s, with power generating capacity increasing  by about 15 million kilowatts each year.    He pledged that the government will help create a more  favorable climate for the development of the energy industry  through deepened reforms and greater openness.    China has lifted controls over coal pricing and is adjusting  the prices of electric power to ensure a reasonable return for  investors. The prices of oil and natural gas will be gradually  brought in line with those on the international markets.    Chen said that state-owned large and medium-sized energy  enterprises, the main body of China's energy industry, should be  introduced to the modern corporate system through a change-over  of the management mechanism, in order to develop even better in  a market economy.    He said that state development banks will grant preferential  loans to accelerate the construction of the energy industry. In  addition, he said, initiatives should be taken to attract local  funds and socially idle funds to energy investment, by forming  joint ventures and share-holding companies.    He said that the Chinese Government will continue to  encourage and support the energy industry to open wider to the  outside world and welcomes international investors to enter  fields such as onshore oil, offshore oil, petrochemicals,  electric power and coal.    The participants discussed issues concerning joint and  cooperative exploration of China's oil and natural gas resources  and voiced their views at the forum aimed to increase  understanding and exchange information.    The conference, sponsored by the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and  China's four oil and petrochemical giants, ended here today.</p>

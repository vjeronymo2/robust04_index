			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Mexico's Financial Crisis: Latin America faces difficult year ahead Just as prospects for a breakthrough in growth were beginning to emerge in many parts of Latin America, the financial crisis in Mexico has called into question the sustainability of even the modest growth seen over the past few years. Growth in the region through the 1980s was impeded by an inability to run current account deficits because of a lack of access to foreign finance, following the debt crisis which struck Mexico in 1982. The question for 1995 is whether an investors' strike following the heavy losses suffered as a result of the Mexican devaluation, and the losses which Latin American bond markets suffered after the US began increasing interest rates in February, will once more isolate the region from private finance. To the extent that it does, growth will be hindered and recession may threaten some economies. Private economists had begun to scale up their forecasts for growth next year. Average forecasts for Latin America for 1995, compiled by the London-based Consensus Economics consultancy, suggested growth would exceed 4 per cent next year compared with 3.8 per cent this. In the fashion of the Grand Old Duke of York, economists will be marching their forecasts back down again. Many economists say that on a fundamental basis Mexico's problems should not spill over elsewhere in the region. 'This is more like the European exchange rate crisis of 1992 than the Mexican and Chilean crises of the early 1980s,' said Mr Sebastian Edwards, chief Latin American economist at the World Bank in Washington. He said fiscal policy in Mexico was under control, unlike in 1982, and the productivity gains that have occurred in the past few years have provided a basis - even at the old exchange rate - for expanding exports. The Mexican panic will nevertheless cut deep. Investors who hold Mexican assets have lost billions of dollars in a couple of days, as big currency losses have compounded market downturns. Devaluation will also hammer many Mexican companies and, perhaps more worryingly, banks - some of which already have weak loan portfolios - because of their large unhedged exposure in dollars. They will have to recognise these losses in their 1994 income statements - losses that will grow with the size of the devaluation. At 5 pesos to the dollar Mr Edwards said - the rate at which the Mexican currency opened in very thin trading yesterday in Mexico City - many Mexicans would now be buying their local currency and it would recover. The improvement in economic management in Mexico, however, has done little to address the Achilles heel of its programme: low savings. That weakness, which entails dependence on foreign capital to spur investment and growth, is reflected elsewhere in Latin America. The main comparison being made yesterday by investors was with Argentina. The government there also has been using the exchange rate as an anchor in the battle against inflation, and a possible currency overvaluation, and is running a current account deficit. However, Argentina's problem appears much less acute than Mexico's. The current account deficit is smaller (around 4 per cent of GDP, half that of Mexico), the currency is fixed against the dollar under a currency board arrangement by law - arguably a more credible arrangement than Mexico's - and Argentine inflation is less than 4 per cent. The extent of any overvaluation will have been mitigated this year. Unlike Mexico, which conducts around three-quarters of its trade with the US, Argentina's trading relationships are more balanced and the dollar is a much less important component of its trading basket. The dollar and therefore the peso has depreciated against European currencies this year and Europe accounts for around a quarter of its trade. Two other important Argentine trading partners - Brazil and Chile - have also revalued their currencies significantly in the past six months. According to Mr Edwards, the other important Latin American economies should be relatively well insulated from the shock. Chile is the one Latin economy that - partly thanks to a successful pension fund reform  - has boosted savings and does not depend on capital inflows. Colombia and Peru should not be hugely affected, and Venezuela, suffering a banking crisis, is running a current account surplus. Brazil also embarked this year on an anti-inflation package that has, as an important element, a currency anchor against the dollar. But it has Dollars 43bn in reserves and was running a trade surplus until November. Reduced access to foreign capital may hinder the country's anti-inflation plan and slow growth but should not imply disaster. The consensus among those economists, with the luxury of standing back from the markets, is that this crisis will prove to be a step backwards but not a fatal blow for Mexico in the uneven process of developing a competitive economy. Nonetheless, the markets are volatile and some investors spooked. If they do not recover their peace of mind, 1995 could be a difficult year for Latin America.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Hafnia A week is a long time in Scandinavian insurance politics. Even three or four days ago it still seemed that Denmark's Hafnia was destined to be swallowed up by Sweden's Skandia in what had the makings of a new and powerful Nordic alliance. Yesterday, however, institutional rumblings turned into shareholder revolt, with the result that Hafnia's board has now backed a rival DK1.5bn (Pounds 130m) reconstruction plan which seemingly re-establishes its independence. Notwithstanding Hafnia's parlous financial condition, Skandia's offer was certainly niggardly enough to justify unrest. The more intriguing question, though, is whether the hand of the French insurance giant UAP is at work. There has long been speculation UAP might like to get hold of Hafnia's 33 per cent stake in its Danish rival Baltica, which it would then deliver to France's Groupe Victoire in return for control of Colonia of Germany. UAP has remained out of sight so far, but it would be no surprise if it popped up with a larger stake in Hafnia once the capital raising is complete. Whatever the answer, Hafnia's volte face creates fresh problems elsewhere. Its erstwhile Norwegian ally Uni Storebrand - with whom it built a combined 48 per cent Skandia stake - can ill afford to hang on to these shares, which would have been cancelled as part of the Swedish offer for Hafnia. Skandia, whose shares have tumbled from SK140 just after the bid to SK118 yesterday, now looks to be stuck with two unhappy investors.</p>

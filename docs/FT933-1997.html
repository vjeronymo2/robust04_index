			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Row looms over US accounts rules THE accounting profession yesterday fired the opening shots in what it likely to become a contentious battle to force US companies to disclose more information about their operations. Its proposals were immediately attacked by financial executives, who said they could leave another layer of costly regulation, and force companies to give away sensitive information. After two years of study into what investors, creditors and others want from financial reports, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants says there should be greater segmental reporting by companies. They want them to break their figures down along product and geographical lines. In the past this has proved one of the most contentious areas of debate between accountants and companies, many of which fear greater disclosure would give valuable information to competitors. The US's leading professional accounting body also suggested companies should give readers of financial statements more information to assess a company's prospects, such as the market share of its main products and its strategy. Auditors would have to produce reports assessing the quality of earnings. 'We were concerned that financial reports are becoming a smaller and smaller part of the information used to assess companies,' said Mr Edmund Jenkins, chairman of the AICPA special committee on financial reporting. The Financial Executives Institute, however, said the requirements could force companies to release sensitive information. Mr Norman Roy, president, said he was concerned the accounting profession had gone public with its plans without talking to company representatives. As part of the move to force directors and auditors to give broader information and assessments of earnings, the committee will recommend a reform of liability law, said Mr Jenkins, a partner in the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. This would produce a 'safe harbour', or immunity from legal action, for directors and auditors who conformed with certain standards.</p>

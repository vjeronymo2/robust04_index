"We are not demanding compensation, but effective  international protection," the official news agency said.    The offer was "an admission of complicity" on the part of  Israeli officials in the February 25 massacre, in which a Jewish  settler gunned down dozens of Arab worshippers in a mosque, the  agency said.    However, the PLO did not reject the compensation outright.    Israeli officials said Monday the victims of the Hebron  mosque massacre or their relatives would receive up to 70,000  dollars in compensation.    The military administration would make the payments based on  a sliding scale worked out by the Finance Ministry, starting at  8,500 dollars for a lightly wounded bachelor.    Relatives of the 30 Palestinians killed, according to the  army's toll, would receive the same amount as survivors who were  seriously hurt in the attack.    "The financial compensation...cannot settle the matter,"  WAFA  said, adding that money "can never, no matter how large the  amount, wipe away the blood, heal the wounds or conceal the  tragedy."    PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat returned to the PLO's Tunis  headquarters from Cairo Monday, following talks with Egyptian  officials and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's political  advisor Jacques Neriya.    Israeli diplomats in Cairo said Neria presented proposals  aimed at clearing the way for resuming talks on implementing the  September 13 accord on Palestinian self-rule.    The PLO suspended the talks after the Hebron massacre.    Palestinian sources in Tunis said 'Arafat was due to call a  continuous session of his main Fatah faction to discuss progress  made in the PLO's drive to secure international protection for  the Palestinians in the occupied territories.    The PLO has also demanded the disarming of Jewish settlers  and the dismantling of certain settlements.    'Arafat said Monday that negotiations could only resume once  the UN Security Council had passed a resolution stipulating  international protection for the Palestinians and the disarming  of settlers.</p>

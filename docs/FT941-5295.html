			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Central banks rule out move to curb hedge funds Central bank governors yesterday decided against any immediate move to curb the activities either of hedge funds or of banks that use their own capital to trade on international financial markets. Bank governors from the Group of Ten countries agreed at their monthly meeting in Basle that markets had corrected themselves and there was no reason to anticipate further turbulence. Most European bond and equity markets made healthy gains yesterday as hopes rose that the German engineering pay settlement at the weekend could give the Bundesbank room to cut interest rates and open the way to lower rates elsewhere. There has been concern that US hedge funds, which are estimated to trade with at least Dollars 50bn (Pounds 34.2bn) of capital, have increased volatility in the past two weeks by selling bonds and trading financial derivatives. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank and chairman of the G10 governors, said they had taken 'a relatively relaxed view' of recent price falls. 'It was seen to some extent as a correction of a development before, and the view was that the fundamentals are more or less sound. That means there is no reason for further turbulence.' Mr Tietmeyer said central banks would examine further the activities of 'hedging institutions', including hedge funds. 'We are willing to examine closely what is going on with these new techniques, but we do not think that there is for the time being any need for specific regulations,' he said. Although some central bankers previously had expressed concern about the rapid growth of trading of derivatives such as interest rate and currency swaps, Mr Tietmeyer said the governors had not reached a final decision. 'We think we have got to live with these new techniques, but we will follow closely what is going on,' he said. There have been worries over the activities both of hedge funds - limited partnerships mostly managed from the US, which attempt to make big short-term gains on financial markets through leveraged and high-risk investments - and the proprietary trading activities of banks and investment banks. The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve have been taking soundings among the banks they supervise to assess their exposure to hedge funds. The funds themselves are largely based offshore and fall outside the direct control of banking and securities regulators. Mr Tietmeyer also said a big jump in the German M3 money supply in January - growth at an annualised rate of 20.6 per cent - would not affect the Bundesbank's long-term monetary targets. The M3 figure led to a sharp fall in bond prices when it was disclosed last Wednesday. He said there was 'no reason' for financial markets to remain concerned. 'The M3 figures are to some extent due to special factors, and of course we hope their influence will disappear over time, and our monetary policy is targeted to a whole year,' he said. On the bourses yesterday, Frankfurt rose 2.4 per cent, while Paris advanced 1.9 per cent and Amsterdam put on 2.5 per cent. London rose by less than 1 per cent but the FT-SE 100 index regained the 3,300 level lost during the recent shakeout. It rose 27.9 to close at 3,305.9. Wall Street also edged higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 23.92 up at 3,856.22. Bond fund managers heave sigh of relief, Page 31 Bond markets, Page 33 World stocks, Page 41 London shares, Page 44</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Angola rivals initial accord The Angolan government and Unita rebels initialled a peace accord yesterday to end almost two decades of civil war. The agreement caps a year of UN-sponsored negotiations in the Zambian capital aimed at ending a conflict that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and left millions homeless. Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita leader, are expected to sign the accord in Lusaka later this month. A peace agreement in 1991 led to elections the following year. They were won by Mr dos Santos and his MPLA party, but Mr Savimbi rejected the results as fraudulent. Fighting erupted again, continuing throughout the peace talks and intensifying in recent weeks. Under the accord, Unita fighters are to be demobilised eventually and either sent home or incorporated into the national army. Unita will get some government posts, specifically at provincial and municipal levels. A commission representing the government, Unita and the UN will oversee implementation of the accord.</p>

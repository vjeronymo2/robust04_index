			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The House of Councillors'  special committee on political reform resumed debates Wednesday  [5 January] morning on four government-proposed political reform  bills with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  boycotting the session. In a meeting of committee managers  earlier in the day the LDP demanded that the resumption of  debates be postponed until Thursday, parliamentary sources said.  The ruling seven-party coalition rejected the LDP's request and  started debates at 11:40 A.M.    The special committee entered a year-end and New Year recess  on December 28. The ruling coalition decided Tuesday to  complete debate on political reform at the special committee by  January 14 even if the LDP boycotts the session. The government  reform package was passed by the House of Representatives on  November 18 but deliberations in the upper house stalled for  over a month through late December due partly to the resistance  of the LDP.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political  future on enactment of the reform package in the current Diet  session, which ends January 29.    Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, a chief coalition strategist, told  a  meeting of the executives of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], of  which he is co-leader, that the coalition should seek to push  the package through the upper house "by January 20, even if its  passage were delayed."    "If parliamentary proceedings went without hindrance, we  would be able to secure its passage through the House of  Councillors plenary session on January 17," he said.    "The most serious point would come on the 20th if its  passage  were delayed," said Ozawa, who is widely regarded as the most  powerful behind-the-scenes figure in Hosokawa's coalition  government. Ozawa also said the coalition would have no  alternative but to table yet another pump-priming supplementary  budget bill to a regular Diet session that will convene on  January 31.    "We should place priority on pushing the political reform  bills through the Diet," he said. "If we were left with one  week's time after the prospective passage, it might be  physically sufficient to hold parliamentary deliberations for  passing the supplementary budget bill," he said.    Ozawa hinted, however, it might take more than a week to  hammer out necessary political compromises with the LDP over the  budgetary bill, saying it would be difficult to pass it in a  week, from a commonsense point of view.</p>

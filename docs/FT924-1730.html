			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Observer: Dispatched One of the most emotive issues in Germany at the moment is whether or not its troops can be sent abroad on UN peace-keeping missions without violating the country's constitution. The government is anxious to send medics and engineers to Somalia but the opposition Social Democratic party seems to be firmly against sending German troops without amending the constitution. Hence it comes as something of a surprise to learn that German troops, albeit only a few of them, were secretly dispatched last year to the Middle East during Operation Desert Storm. It is understood that former east German Nationale Volksarmee officers, who had just been integrated into the west German Bundeswehr, were sent to the desert to give the Americans the low-down on the Iraqis' Scuds. Their former employer had after all been one of the biggest users of the Soviet missiles. If German soldiers can help beat the Iraqis, surely they should be allowed to help save the Somalis.</p>

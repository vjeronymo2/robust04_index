			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> PROBLEMS OF GROWTH TARGETED BY MAYOR  </P> <P> Working with surrounding cities to manage growth and coping with a declining  sales tax base will be the key issues facing Los Alamitos in the year ahead,  according to Mayor Robert P. Wahlstrom.  </P> <P> While little undeveloped land remains in the city, problems associated with  growth such as traffic and air quality are the key concerns as 1990 begins,  according to Wahlstrom.  </P> <P> "It is more of a regional thing than a local thing," he said. "We have to work  with the various communities around us to solve these problems. We can't combat  traffic and pollution alone."  </P> <P> Los Alamitos has a formal agreement with neighboring Cypress that it be  notified when any major development -- defined as anything of one acre or more  -- is planned. Wahlstrom said he would like to see more such cooperative  efforts.  </P> <P> Congestion on Katella and Cerritos avenues and Los Alamitos Boulevard will  continue to be a concern in 1990, he said.  </P> <P> To that end, the city will continue to work closely with the county in its  plans to turn Katella Avenue into a "super street," according to Wahlstrom. It  will be upgraded in the coming years with synchronized signals, bus turnouts,  dual left-turn lane pockets, fewer driveways and possibly no on-street parking.  </P> <P> The decrease in sales tax revenue, a major source of money for the city, this  past year also has the city casting a wary eye toward the future, he said.  </P> <P> "It slipped last year, and of course the cost of maintaining the city is always  increasing," he said. "We still have a balanced budget, but this is something  we definitely will be watching."  </P> <P> If money is available come the midyear budget review sessions in January, there  are three specific projects "on the council's wish list," Wahlstrom said. They  are the installation of a traffic signal in front of Los Alamitos High School,  building restrooms at Little Cottonwood Park and remodeling the youth  center.KATHIE BOZANICH  </P></p>

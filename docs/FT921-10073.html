			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Curbs on direct power sales by generators are eased THE UK's largest generating companies are to be allowed to sell more electricity directly to big industrial consumers rather than through regional distributors. The move, announced yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, is intended to sharpen competition among suppliers and help ease recessionary pressures on industry. It is part of Prof Littlechild's longer-term plans to reduce regulatory barriers in the power market. The move comes only days after some of the UK's largest companies threatened to withhold payment of the Fossil Fuel Levy in protest at recent electricity price rises. The levy, which is added to bills, goes to subsidise the nuclear industry in England and Wales. Prof Littlechild said yesterday: 'There is no doubt that the present recession, combined with the recent and prospective increases in electricity prices, have hit many large customers very hard indeed. The need to purchase electricity on the most competitive terms possible is more important than ever.' At present there are limits on how much electricity the generators can sell direct. In most of the 12 regions in England and Wales this is 7 per cent of the electricity sold, though in some industrial areas it is up to 12.5 per cent. Prof Littlechild said yesterday that he was raising the limit to 9 per cent in most areas, and up to 17.5 per cent in the industrial areas, from April 1. The limits will be removed from April next year. Initially the new limits apply only to National Power, which represents 40 per cent of the generating market, but they are expected to be extended soon to PowerGen, which accounts for a further 30 per cent. The rule allowing generators to sell electricity only to companies whose maximum demand is more than 1MW will remain. Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users Council and Conservative MP for Erewash, welcomed the move but said many of his members were still worried that this year's electricity supply contracts would contain large price increases. Some of them might go ahead with the boycott of the Fossil Fuel Levy. National Power also welcomed the change. It said an outbreak of aggressive selling was unlikely because negotiations on many of this year's contracts were already nearly complete. But the company was up against its limits in many of the regions, and the change would 'ease the position', it said.</p>

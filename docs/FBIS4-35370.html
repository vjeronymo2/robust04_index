			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Damascus, 28 May (SANA) -- Well-informed  Palestinian sources in Tunis have revealed that the Fatah  Central Committee has discussed the subject of Brigadier General  Misbah Hanafi Saqr, who was appointed by PLO Executive Committee  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat as head of the Preventive Security Agency  in Gaza despite evidence that Saqr had connections with the  Israeli intelligence service.    The sources told TISHRIN that Saqr, who went missing in  1967,  reportedly drowned in the River Jordan and was considered dead,  had cooperated with the Israeli Army after the 1967 aggression  and used to travel frequently to Egypt and Jordan under the name  of 'Isa [last name indistinct] to bring back information to the  Israeli intelligence service. When the Oslo agreement was  signed, the Israelis insisted that 'Arafat should employ him, as  well as Brigadier General 'Atallah 'Atallah, alias Abu-al-Za'im.  The Israelis [words indistinct] insisted that one of them  should assume a prominent and important position in the  Palestinian police force in the self-rule area. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian supply worries push metals prices higher NERVOUSNESS ABOUT Russian political instability spilled over into the metals markets yesterday. Prices of aluminium, gold, nickel and platinum all rose sharply, reflecting the prominent role Russia plays as a supplier of these metals. Dealers pointed out that, if disruption in Russia became widespread, metal shipments might be curtailed and this would be a welcome relief for western world producers who have seen prices decimated in the past two years by huge rises in Russian exports. Nickel for delivery in three months at one point yesterday gained nearly 4 per cent from Friday's close on the London Metal Exchange to touch Dollars 6,245 a tonne. However, profit-taking emerged and nickel closed at Dollars 6,125, up Dollars 107.50 a tonne. Three-month aluminium prices rose by nearly 2 per cent to Dollars 1,193 a tonne, not only because of concerns about Russian politics but also on reports of an explosion at the Bratsk smelter, the largest in the world. The Reuter news agency later reported the impact on Bratsk's output was not as serious as first feared and the LME aluminium price subsided to close at Dollars 1,184.50 a tonne, up Dollars 12.75. Russia is the world's second-largest producer of platinum, after South Africa, and in London last night platinum prices closed Dollars 5.75 a troy ounce, or 1.6 per cent, ahead at Dollars 356. Earlier, Mr Nickolai Menjshikov, an official from Russia's platinum group metals exporting agency, Almazshikov, on a visit to Tokyo told Reuter that his country's shipments would be limited this year because of falling demand. Analysts suggested that if cuts were made it would have more to do with production problems than with Russia's willingness to support prices with supply reductions. Meanwhile, gold closed in London at its highest level in US dollar terms this year - at Dollars 332.15 an ounce, up 70 cents. Dealers said there was no selling by producers, who frequently take advantage of price rises to hedge their output. One analyst suggested this probably reflected the fact that the contango (premium for metal for future delivery) was a 'very lean' Dollars 9 an ounce a year compared with nearly Dollars 40 at the peak.</p>

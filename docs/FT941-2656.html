			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Weary, wiser, but the fight goes on / Testing the depth of the IRA's commitment to its campaign of violence and asks when it might end As former IRA volunteers, Shane O'Doherty and Tommy McKearney were ready to kill for their cause and were incarcerated for their crimes. Now, they are united in wanting an end to armed struggle but ada mant that the British and Irish governments' Christmas peace initiative will not deliver it. Both men, each leavened by long spells in jail, are thoughtful, articulate and confound the caricature of block-headed warmongers painted by their opponents. Though they have left the IRA, their republican sympathies and some of their contacts survive. They dismiss as fanciful suggestions that 200 years of physical force against British 'occupation' is about to end. Neither believes the political initiative launched by London and Dublin  - in spite of high expectations of a historic breakthrough and the peace overtures of republican party Sinn Fein - has shifted the mindset of a paramilitary organisation hell-bent on a united Ireland. Mr O'Doherty was the IRA's chief bomb maker in Londonderry in the early 1970s before mounting a letter bomb campaign in 1973. His one-man war maimed and injured 12 people - Mr Reginald Maudling, then home secretary among them. Though he killed nobody he knew he might. He received 30 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1976 and was freed in 1989. He is now, at 39, a pacifist, and has accused the IRA of dishonour and cowardice. Last year, he completed an English degree at Dublin University and lives in the city, regularly returning to the north to see his mother. He deeply regrets a past which provides him with a special insight into the present state of mind of hard-line republicans and into what might lie ahead. 'It was clear from the day it was published that the Downing Street declaration was going nowhere.' The declaration, signed by Mr John Major and Irish prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds, tried to square the aspirations of Northern Ireland's two main communities by offering rights of self-determination but guaranteeing Unionists that Northern Ireland would remain part ot the UK as long as they wished. 'We've put sticking plasters over Irish politics for centuries and once again the fundamental issues are being ducked. You cannot have two governments without proper constituencies in the north dictating solutions to a hardened, embittered double minority,' says Mr O'Doherty. So why should the IRA be able to? He concedes some IRA men have now reluctantly concluded - heresy until recently - that there will eventually have to be talks with the enemy. 'But many others still don't see the British deserving talks, they see them deserving bombs, no-warning bombs.' The impact of recent attacks on the mainland suggests, 'the probability is that a greater part of the campaign will move to Britain'. Mr McKearney, whose three brothers have died in terrorist violence, is no more optimistic about an end to IRA violence. He came out of jail in 1993 after serving 15 years for the murder of a part-time soldier in the Ulster Defence Regiment, part of the UK army. Now he is home again, living with his welcoming, elderly parents in a neat bungalow on a hillside in South Tyrone. He says the Downing Street declaration - the very title calculated, he says, to make republicans wince  -has altered nothing. 'This is not a sea-change. This is exactly where we were before. It is the status quo and I resent both governments suggesting anyone who rejects it must be some form of lunatic.' He adds: 'The Downing Street document was a fait accompli guaranteeing the union for ever and a day. Forty per cent of those in the north are annexed into a state against their will and don't want a UK connection while 50 per cent reject Dublin. We need new thinking to produce a mutually acceptable compromise.' But if new thinking is what is needed, more violence may be all that is on offer: 'The question the IRA asks itself is how does it keep the issue in front of the British until proper negotiations take place? Bombs and bullets will not resolve the conflict but have kept the organisation in the picture.' Both men quickly expose the yawning gap in understanding between republicans and British governments of all persuasions which has fuelled the fight and in 25 years prematurely terminated 3,000 lives. London and Dublin win almost universal domestic and international support for insisting upon a permanent cessation of violence before talks. 'The IRA is expected to trust perfidious Albion? It is, in any case, arrogant to suggest the violence and terrorism is one-sided, that the IRA is the offender and the British are peacemakers,' says Mr O'Doherty, who joined the IRA in protest at the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings, when 13 civilians were shot dead by British troops. 'Britain tries to hijack the moral high ground as though it has nothing to answer for. It has injured people on the streets, immunised its own murderers from prosecution and committed terrible injustices. 'There are three armed struggles in Northern Ireland involving the IRA, the loyalist paramilitaries and the British. We are all covered in blood and all carry the responsibility for the mess and for clearing it up. The IRA will not lay down its weaponry and put a question-mark over the moral value of its struggle and the sacrifices of its volunteers on the basis of the deal on offer.' Both men believe the British government will swing on the hook of hypocrisy in its refusal to talk. 'They talked to the IRA during two ceasefires in 1972 and 1974, they have been talking again in the last three years and they talked during and after the Warrington bombs,' says Mr O'Doherty. 'We all know lines of communication have been open since the hunger strikes. Which is the principle at stake that has not already been breached?' asks Mr McKearney. So what must happen, in the eyes of hardline republicans, if the anguish is ever to end? The British government will first, says Mr O'Doherty, be expected to show some humility in a declaration repenting for 'centuries of injustice'. At the same time, he believes, the IRA will not countenance an end to armed struggle without the repatriation and eventual release of prisoners to whom it is unswervingly loyal. The British government has insisted there can be no amnesty for people who are not political prisoners but simply guilty of vicious crimes. According to Mr O'Doherty: 'The IRA will not have the British talk about a peace which entails the continuing retention of IRA prisoners. If the provisionals held hostages in return, would the British claim the conditions existed for a settlement?' Both men agree that the big failure in republican thinking is to see the British government as the only key to peace. A million unionists, acknowledges Mr O'Doherty, will not be suppressed, and they will have to be courted in the same way the British government must deal with the IRA. Unionists have to be reassured that, in any new arrangement, their constitutional rights are guaranteed, says Mr McKearney. He suggests 'something like a confederation or a unitary state or a canton which breaks the connection with the UK but does not necessarily involve parting'. Mr O'Doherty has in mind Britain and Ireland sharing sovereignty and responsibility for the north. Such language renders unionists apoplectic and London and Dublin unmoved. The governments insist on a ceasefire, underwrite the democratic will of the majority and restate their commitment to a peace initiative which, in trying to be all things to all people, threatens to satisfy none. The history of Northern Ireland, however, is replete with surprising ironies as well as tragedy. Both Mr McKearney and Mr O'Doherty spent several years in the same jail as the loyalist paramilitaries they were pledged to kill. They talked and mixed and came to see other side's point of view. They even struck up friendships. The trick is to repeat it in the world outside.</p>

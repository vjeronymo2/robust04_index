			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Visiting time for TECs Britain's Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) should drop across-the-board schemes of business support and concentrate on business sectors where growth prospects are best. They must also become more active in visiting small business owners at their premises instead of waiting for them to contact the TEC. These are the two main recommendations to emerge from a study* of the TECs by Kingston University. A nationwide network of TECs was set up in 1990-91 to provide training and support for small businesses locally. But a number of surveys have shown that TECs are failing to reach many of the small businesses in their areas. Some businesses confuse the title with 'tech', for technical college, while many TECs cover large geographical areas with a mix of different local economies and communities. Business representatives on TEC boards are drawn mainly from large companies; many owners of small businesses cannot devote the time required. A further problem is that TECs inherited many 'pre-packaged' government support schemes such as the enterprise allowance scheme and business growth training, which are seen as irrelevant by many businesses. Most TECs subcontract the actual provision of services to organisations such as enterprise agencies and management consultants. 'The problem here is that neither has proved popular with small business owners in the past,' says the study. Closer links might be established with industry training organisations and trade associations, the study suggests. Visiting companies is expensive and time consuming but the best way of reaching small firms, it notes. *TECs and Small Firms. Can TECs Reach the Small Firms Other Strategies Have Failed to Reach?

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Arts: Elvira 40 - Chichester Festival Louis Jouvet (1887-1951) was one of France's finest actors and directors. In 1936 Jouvet became an advisor to the Comedie-Francaise, and a director in 1940. The play Elvira 40 at the Minerva Studio Theatre, Chichester, is the story of one theatre class given by Jouvet in Paris between February and September 1940. Brigitte Jaques' 1986 play (translated by David Edney) has never been performed in English. It is a strange, difficult, cerebral and rewarding chamber piece. It was drawn from shorthand notes made by Jouvet's secretary. Jouvet annotated the transcripts as a teaching record, and they were published in the 1960s. The text of Elvira 40 stays close to Jouvet's own words. Jouvet stays on stage or roams through the audience as he conducts six lessons instructing the student actor Claudia on one scene from Moliere's aptly subtitled Don Juan: ou le festin de pierre (1665). The seduced and abandoned Donna Elvira returns to the Don to warn him of imminent torments and to urge him to repent. Mozart does it in four lines flat; Moliere draws it out; and Jouvet interprets magnificently. Elvira 40 is a treasure chest of advice for actors and spectators. Jouvet thought the audience always felt what the actor felt. He rails against the timidities, modesties or embarrassments which prevent an actor from conveying true feeling. He urges: 'with every word you say the feeling must rise up in you. You must be flooded by what the word means .. The feeling must force you to say the text. That's the actor's art .. awakening your sensibilities within yourself.' The great success of Patrick Garland's direction is that it makes theatre the hero and gives you new ways of thinking about theatre; it makes you a better spectator, pricking the mind with questions. Jouvet's legendary restlessness conveys itself in a barrage of questions 'what did you think of that? was it convincing? why?' and in broadsides of opinion: 'ignore the full stops. Breathe in the middle of the sentence' What Jouvet values in acting was authority, authenticity and gesture. Here, the actors deliver. As Jouvet and Claudia, Keith Baxter and Debra Beaumont negotiate a difficult task. Imagine musicians playing a Paul Tortelier masterclass on the Cello Suites; they have to play Bach wrongly at first in order to show how much they improve. Baxter and Beaumont play actors playing actors presenting a scene. The Minerva Theatre suits the project. Baxter finds a psychological progress through the scenes; he gradually discards his hat, scarf, overcoat and appears in shirtsleeves with loosened tie as summer ripens, but also as he reveals more of his character. He carries Jouvet's intellectual delight in Moliere and Shakespeare; he also represents Jouvet's rare ability to separate the personalities from the issues. Opposite him, Debra Beaumont has a harder job, but manages to improve her performance of Elvira by following exactly the advice she receives. Minerva Theatre, Chichester Festival (0243 781312) until 11 September</p>

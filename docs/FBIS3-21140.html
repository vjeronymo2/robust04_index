			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Ishikawa-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (IHI) has  established the possibility of developing system control  technology for a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) plant  scheduled to be built in FY97, four years from now. This is  because of their success in establishing design technology and  obtaining basic data for simulations for a 1,000kW class plant  based on start-up and stopping, load change, emergency stoppage  and other tests using an 100kW class system control test  facility, which is a step toward moving up to the 1,000kW class.  Along with the fact that control of interpolar pressure  differences in the fuel cell itself are important in this,  reduction in the start-up time and reduction of high-temperature  valves, which are expensive and are a source of thermal  dispersion are necessary, since the fuel cell operating  temperature is approximately 650C.    IHI began developing MCFC fuel cells in 1983, and since 1987  it has participated in the MCFC Research Association and has  been working on the development of system and control technology.    Since 1991, when the 100kW class system control test  facility  (with a mock fuel cell) was set up at the MCFC Research  Association's comprehensive laboratory in Akagi, data that will  affect the design, construction and operation of a future  1,000kW class pilot plant has been acquired. This research is  being carried out as part of a research consignment to the MCFC  Research Association from the New Energy Development  Organization (NEDO) as a part of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry (MITI), Agency of Industrial Science and  Technology (AIST) Moonshine Project.    ``Load change rate,'' ``fuel cell interpole pressure  differences,'' ``start-up time,'' ``operating time'' and  ``NO[.sup]X[/]'' value were brought up as results of this  research.    The test facility has sufficient capacity for the 100kW  class  and the 1,000kW class, and the basic configuration is the same.  Since at the time the facility was set up, the fuel cell was  still being developed, a mock fuel cell was used. This is made  up of anode (fuel pole) and cathode (air pole) heaters that  simulate the heat generated and a fuel cell receptacle that  gives the reference pressure for interpole pressure control. The  voltage and output for fuel cell performance are computed in  real time through incorporation of an equation in the controller  and measurement of inlet gas formation and flow.    The results of the tests were that there is a necessity for  considering a layout that greatly reduces the radiant heat loss  from the distribution pipes, temperature maintenance and pipe  support system for reduction of the time from the ignition of  the reformer to the start of reformation and changing the  operating temperature of the anode gas blower that circulates  the N[.sup]2[/] gas for heating to a high-temperature  specification.    It was confirmed that increasing the amount of fuel, taking  the output and using the heat generated in the fuel cell, while  continuing to raise the temperature of the fuel cell, was  effective for decreasing the time from fuel cell intrusion to  100% output.    Since the MCFC is normally in a molten state, there is a  necessity for maintaining the interpole pressure on the  electrolyte at several kilopascals or less in order to prevent  electrolyte loss. The results of the tests confirmed that there  was sufficient margin for the limit values during ordinary  operation. In order to keep the interpole pressure difference  during emergency stoppages for problems within the target of  eight kilopascals, construction of a system for simultaneously  shutting down the cut-off valves before and after the fuel cell  was necessary.    Besides this, in minimum load tests, it was made clear that  stable operation down to 15% was possible with the planned  control method, for the target value of 30%.    At IHI, this control data will be supplied as effective data  for design of the 1,000kW class MCFC pilot plant that is  scheduled to be constructed by the end of FY97.</p>

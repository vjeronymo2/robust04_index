			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Observer: Slow coaches The six Kassbohrers who hold stakes in the century-old family bus maker have little to celebrate over the company's impending sale to Mercedes. They missed a fat chance in 1988 when Canada's Bombardier offered DM100m for 25 per cent of the enterprise and an option on the rest. Since the business was having one of its better years, they refused the bait, despite urgings from the chairman Heinz Ahrens. Rich in tradition, Kassbohrer has long been racked by family feuds and general interference. Now it has finally come to a sale, the family members must await their turn behind 30 odd banks owed a tidy DM700m. The company ran up against the crash barrier at the beginning of this year, as executives returned to the lenders, yet another begging bowl in hand. After years of trying to shift the family's implacable opposition to takeover, Ahrens had been stung by seeing his own job advertised last November and was already making for the emergency exit. At the same time, a works assembly in Ulm treated the family to a public roasting, and made clear they wanted the family out and a rescuer in. And so, it emerged, did the banks. Led by Bayerische Hypo, they agreed to new credits to help the company over the hump, on condition the family ceded control. Trustees held their stakes while the manoeuvring got under way. Now Mercedes is meeting the banks, leaving the family hovering in the station waiting room.</p>

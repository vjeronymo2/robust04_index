			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK agrees wide-screen TV plan for Europe BRITAIN yesterday cleared the way for a four-year Ecu228m (Pounds 180m) plan to promote wide-screen television services in the European Community. The UK dropped its previous veto of the project at a meeting of EC telecommunications ministers yesterday after more than a year of heated political argument. EC electronics manufacturers and retailers hope the subsidies included in the plan, which will be available only to broadcasters and programme producers, will encourage transmission of wide-screen programmes and kick-start a lucrative market for wide-format television sets. The deal could also lead to the development of cinema-quality, high-definition television (HDTV) in Europe, possibly sharing elements of the advanced digital television technology being developed by US companies and European companies in the US. Advocates of HDTV, including the European Commission and the French and Dutch govern-ments, gave the deal a muted welcome, reflecting the fact that the latest plan is a shadow of the five-year Ecu850m programme proposed by Brussels in April last year. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the new UK junior trade minister, justified the British decision on the grounds that funding had been extended from 3 1/2 to four years. He said the UK had also won guarantees that Japanese television manufacturers based in Britain - such as Sony - are not excluded from future HDTV research projects and standardisation discussions. But the Commission said the additional clause would make no difference to existing EC practice. Last month, Mr Edward Leigh, Mr McLoughlin's predecessor, said that Britain would not support a plan worth more than Ecu150m. The EC could start disbursing funds in the second half of the year. Until June 30 1997, Ecu160m will be made available to broadcasters and programme-makers to help upgrade equipment to wide-screen technology, convert existing programmes and produce programmes in the new format. Industry or public institutions will have to match the EC funding. A further Ecu68m will then be made available after January 1 1995, for those smaller countries which have less well-developed audiovisual industries, and that sum will have to be matched by Ecu17m from other sources.

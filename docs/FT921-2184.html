			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Davis Service falls to Pounds 16.7m DAVIS SERVICE Group, the business services company formerly known as Godfrey Davis, yesterday announced a 25 per cent fall in annual profits. The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 22.3m) for 1991 as most divisions were hit by reduced demand and lower margins. Earnings dropped to 13.24p (17.57p) per share but the final dividend is held at 5.25p for an unchanged total of 7.98p. Turnover fell to Pounds 309m (Pounds 353m), partly reflecting the sale of three of its four Ford dealerships last May. The remaining dealership in St Albans recorded lower profits due to reduced new car sales. Profits from textile maintenance fell to Pounds 12m (Pounds 14.1m). Recession and the Gulf war affected hotels and rising unemployment meant lower garment rentals. The site services division was affected by local authority spending constraints and recession among builders. The rental business held up better due to lower prices. Support services, which covers cleaning and catering, increased operating profits to Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 1.81m) as a number of contracts won in 1990 contributed for the first time. Contract hire was hit by clients reducing their fleets and weak second hand car prices. Interest charges, mainly related to the contract hire business, increased to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 9.79m). Excluding contract hire borrowings, gearing fell to 15 per cent from 18 per cent. COMMENT Davis managed to keep up its volumes through aggressive price discounting in its garment and site services division. Assuming demand returns, so should margins. The site service side is theoretically an early beneficiary of economic upturn, but exposure to the construction industry complicates matters somewhat. The support services division performed well, but again there is a question mark because 20 per cent of turnover stems from competitive tendering in the health service, which is at risk if Labour wins the election. Forecast pre-tax profits this year are Pounds 18m putting the shares on a multiple of 12 and ranks them as no more than a hold.</p>

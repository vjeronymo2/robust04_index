			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Charlton set for a seat in the stands Ireland's soccer association announced it would not appeal the decision to ban coach Jack Charlton from tomorrow's make-or-break Group E clash with Norway. Charlton has battled officialdom for most of his career, but has always had a reputation for fairness. But Fifa, soccer's governing body, was becoming more and more irritated by his whingeing and his behaviour at the World Cup. Result: banishment from tomorrow's game - Charlton is free to watch it from the stands - for shouting at officials. He was also fined 20,000 Swiss Francs (nearly Pounds 10,000) as was the Irish FA. Ireland player John Aldridge was fined 2,500 Swiss Francs for what Fifa called 'ill-mannered behaviour' during last Friday's 2-1 defeat by Mexico in Orlando.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Books: A study of identity that reads like a dream - Fiction EGON by Carey Harrison Heinemann Pounds 14.99 309 pages SHEAR by Tim Parks Heinemann Pounds 13.99 214 pages THE POSSESSION OF DELIA SUTHERLAD by Barbara Neil Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 247 pages ON THE strength of Egon, the third novel in a quartet entitled To Liskeard, Carey Harrison's examination of post-war European consciousness looks set to become essential reading. (The first two volumes, Richard's Feet and Cley are available in Minerva paperback.) It is useful to remember that Harrison, who has written more than 60 television plays, was responsible for BBC2's six-part dramatisation of the life of Sigmund Freud. Egon opens with a rather odd story, in which an amnesiac in post-war England is trying to recall the events leading up to a car crash. Only on page 67 is it revealed that this was a passage of dreams belonging to a headmaster by the name of Hanbury, who now takes over the narration. As we get to know Hanbury we see how his experiences were converted by dream-work into the earlier configurations. This puzzle-solving is intriguing in itself, but is only a by-product of Hanbury's real concern: the 'wolf child', Egon, who was discovered in the forests of East Germany aged about eight, where he had lived alone since his parents' disappearance three years before. Egon is believed to be the son of an aristocratic Anglophile, Peter von Lutzow-Bruel and his English wife, both of whom were killed after the 1944 assassination plot against Adolf Hitler. He is rescued by an English uncle, who works in the pornography trade in Hamburg, and his upbringing is entrusted to a more conventional family member, a Cornish MP, who sends him, eventually, to Hanbury's school. The Reverend Dr Hanbury is a decent, self-deprecating Englishman with a lively sense of humour. He comes to love Egon like a son and their story is both funny and tragic. Hanbury spends a hilarious Christmas in Hamburg's red light district looking for Egon's uncle (whom he knew during the war) and eventually takes Egon back to East Germany where he finds the tree house that he used to live in. As Egon's psychological problems start to emerge the novel reads like one of Freud's case histories. But here the mix is even richer. Identity is a key theme, and seldom has it been examined with such intelligence, compassion and wit. Shear is a thriller of the more intellectual kind which uses its complicated plot to consider deep existential questions. Peter Nicholson, a 40-year-old geologist, has taken his 'mistress' with him on a working trip to a Mediterranean island. He is tempted to leave his wife, but his 23-year-old girlfriend does not want to get tied down. Nicholson is an obsessive geologist who tends to see his mid life crisis in geological terms, an oddly effective analogy that rescues his tired old dilemma from total banality. Nicholson is rather naive and easily seduced by Thea, his beautiful but mysterious interpreter. Things turn nasty when he discovers evidence of a cover-up at the quarry, which has already led to one man's death. The plot is absorbing, and the technicalities involved are explained very clearly. At the same time Tim Parks manages to create a strange, almost poetic fusion between the real world of stone and the process of Tim's breakdown. The fine writing is actually more interesting than the character it is describing. Nicholson is such a self centred prig that his sticky end seemed richly deserved. If you are interested in the sort of woman who calls her labradors Bung and Ho and refes to sex as 'stuffingtons' then The Possession of Delia Sutherland will suit. Unfortunately this is not a comedy, but a deeply serious romance. Delia, who farms Sleet, a 3,000 acre estate in the north of England, marries an extremely wealthy white Bahamian, Francis. The marriage soon founders due to his philandering and Delia's lack of social graces, and they live mostly apart for some 20 years. Because the dogs ate a rather important letter (I repeat, this is not a comedy) which Francis wrote to her after a particularly tedious row, and when Francis dies in an accident, Delia is unaware of a codicil to his original will in which he leaves Sleet to Leon Kennedy, his love child by a black Bahamian. Leon turns out to be a charming young man who delights the old retainers and is soon having a steamy affair with Delia which is, of course, bound to end in tears. The whole is recalled from a cafe table in Marseille whither Delia has fled to lick her wounds. Barbara Neil is such a beguiling story teller that at the time of reading everything seems quite plausible; only on reflection does the absurdity of it all reveal itself.</p>

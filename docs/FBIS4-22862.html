			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vlad Ignatov and Vera Romanova: ``Russia's </F> Nuclear Facilities Inventoried: Absolutely No Order'']    [Text] In the middle of last year, several days after the  accident in Tomsk-7, Russia's president issued directive No. 224  instructing the bodies of the Russian Federation's Oversight of  Nuclear and Radiation Safety to examine all nuclear facilities  and facilities posing a radiation threat to verify that safety  and physical shielding measures are being taken at them. By the  end of 1993, more than 200 nuclear enterprises and enterprises  posing a radiation threat that belong to such departments as the  Ministry of Atomic Energy, Russian Federation Committee on the  Defense Industry, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of  Transportation, and Kurchatovskiy Institute Russian Scientific  Center were examined. The Federal Oversight of Nuclear and  Radiation Safety focused its attention on nuclear power plants.    The results of the examination confirm that Russia's nuclear  power plants are incapable of maintaining their equipment in a  safe state or modernizing it. Twenty-nine units at nine nuclear  power plants with a total statutory capacity of 21,242 MW are  now operating in Russia. This includes 13 units with pressurized  water reactors, 15 units with uranium-graphite channel-type  reactors, and 1 unit with a fast neutron reactor. Nearly all  currently operational power plant units were started up between  1971 and 1990. The only ``latecomer'' among them is the No. 4  unit at the Balakovo Nuclear Power Plant, which was put into  operation in 1993.    From a nuclear and radiation safeguarding standpoint,  nuclear  power plant units may be divided into two generations. The  first-generation units were developed and constructed before the  main domestic normative documents regulating safety in atomic  energy came to light. Included among them are the Nos. 3 and 4  units of the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant; the first two  units at the Kola, Kursk, and Leningrad nuclear power plants;  and the No. 4 unit at the nuclear power plant in Bilibino. In  the opinion of experts of the Federal Oversight of Nuclear and  Radiation Safety, they all require radical reconstruction  because their obsolete and physically worn-out equipment and  system components are in the habit of failing very frequently.  When the second-generation units were developed, consideration  was already given to the tolerances that had been introduced at  the time. Today, however, the safety rules, and consequently the  power plant units themselves, no longer conform to standards.    The Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety has  not  recently recorded any accidents related to the meltdown of a  reactor core or the release of any significant quantities of  radioactive materials into the environment. Nor has it recorded  any serious fires with the exception of a number of  insignificant deflagrations and instances of blanketing with  smoke. Incidents involving the operating failure of relief  valves and, consequently, nondesign reactor unit shutdown  cooling have had the biggest impact on the decrease in the  safety of nuclear power plants. The most acute worsening of  operating indicators was detected at the Kola Nuclear Power  Plant. In the opinion of Federal Oversight of Nuclear and  Radiation Safety observers, it is related to a careless attitude  toward operating rules and equipment repair. Moreover, a check  of the qualifications of about 5,000 technicians at nuclear  facilities and facilities posing a radiation threat revealed  that nearly 500 of them do not have sufficient knowledge of  safety standards and rules. An analysis of violations at nuclear  power plants indicates that a significant number, i.e., nearly  40 percent of all violations, have been due to shortcomings in  the work of maintenance personnel.    The state of radwaste removal has also become  unsatisfactory.  An increase in the amount of nuclear fuel stored on site at  nuclear power plants and the complete absence of even any desire  to remove it at power plants with RBMK, EGP, and MBM reactors  have been observed. Another problem arising because of the  accumulation of waste at nuclear power plants is that there are  no free spaces for emergency dumping of the reactor's entire  core. The currently existing system of handling radwaste was  developed in the 1960s. For this reason not one Russian nuclear  power plant has a complete set of units to prepare liquid and  solid waste for burial.    At the initiative of the Federal Oversight of Nuclear and  Radiation Safety, the chairmen of its regional bodies took part  in an interdepartmental commission to check the nuclear and  radiation safety of the nuclear power facilities and equipment  of the Russian Federation Navy's northern fleet. Judging by the  results of the checks, the state of the overwhelming majority of  the northern fleet's facilities and equipment is catastrophic.  Personnel often operate the nuclear power plants of warships by  the ``poke method,'' with the most flagrant violations of safety  rules, and measures to bring them to the required level are left  virtually untaken. It is therefore entirely natural that in the  past year, seven navy men were hospitalized with a diagnosis of  ``over-irradiation.'' Another problem that has evoked serious  concern on the part of the Federal Oversight of Nuclear and  Radiation Safety is the navy's handling of radwaste. Tanks to  store it temporarily are overflowing, and the navy's admiralty  is not taking any measures to clean things up. Meanwhile, navy  men continue to insist that they do not need outside help.</p>

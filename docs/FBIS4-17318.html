			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belarusian Party of Labor [BPP] Council has  issued a statement devoted to the eighth anniversary of the  catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It is  becoming increasingly clear that most of the decisions adopted  and promises made on this issue by the Republic's leadership  have not been implemented, the statement said. In the words of  its authors, many Supreme Soviet deputies, who pledged some time  ago to free Belarusians of the Chernobyl misery, and the  government failed to protect people from the Chernobyl radiation  and drove the people into an economic Chernobyl, bringing them  to the brink of annihilation. The party council considers it  inadmissible that the authorities attempt to revise legal acts  and decisions formerly adopted regarding the protection of  people from the Chernobyl catastrophe and the level of social  benefits. The BPP Council calls on all progressive forces to  rally their efforts aimed at the survival and health of the  Belarusian people on 26 April, the day of commemoration of the  Chernobyl tragedy.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: To the leader born - A Question of Leadership: Gladstone to Thatcher by Peter Clarke Hamish Hamilton Pounds 17.99, 344pages PETER CLARKE is a Cambridge historian with a distinctive style which lends itself easily to parody. His book on British leaders from Gladstone to Thatcher is not entirely new, since he has written some of the essays before in other places. Nor does it claim to be comprehensive: Clarke takes the view that some of those who did not quite make it to the top are at least as interesting as some of those who did. In other words, he picks and chooses, although the basis for the choice is not always entirely clear. There is said to be an after-dinner game of discussing who was the best British prime minister this century. That is rather a macro-affair, and anyway depends on definitions (what does one mean by best?) and a certain detachment from the subject. Clarke's approach is decidedly micro: he is very good at producing quotations, usually without the source. He has read widely and sometimes gives the impression of having borrowed heavily: for example, from DR Thorpe's book on Selwyn Lloyd. A more appropriate game to play with Clarke might be: which is his best essay in this collection? Some of his contributions are very good, though more by fits and starts than sustained writing. He is not without some good phrases of his own, unless one has missed the source. For instance, he describes Thatcher as rampaging from summit to summit 'as a sort of fishwife Britannia demanding her money back'. On Harold Macmillan's dismissal of Dean Acheson - who said that Britain had lost an empire and not found a role - as a 'conceited ass', Clarke writes: 'The notion that the emperor had no clothes, as seemed devastatingly obvious to these foreigners, was somehow regarded as capable of refutation by shutting one's eyes and thinking of Winston Churchill'. Clarke's best essay is on Neville Chamberlain. It takes a kind of courage to say, as Chamberlain did on being offered the Treasury: 'I remain convinced that I might be a great minister of health but am not likely to be more than a second-rate chancellor'. Clarke tells the story of Chamberlain's early years trying unsuccessfully to grow sisal in the Caribbean. Churchill did not know it until 50 years later and described Chamberlain when he heard it as 'a hard-bitten pioneer from the outer marches of the British Empire.' Gladstone and Thatcher had a great deal in common, writes Clarke, since both were moralists, though he acknowledges that Thatcher owed much to Enoch Powell: 'Enoch the Baptist,' as he calls him, rather than Enoch the parliamentary leper. There are lots of insights like that, and Clarke can be good on economic questions. He has, after all, written a book called The Keynesian Revolution in the Making, which he draws on here. His essays are in general very entertaining, though somewhat mannered. If he goes on like this, and can resist the temptation to be too clever by half, he will make an excellent newspaper columnist, of which he has most of the attributes already.</p>

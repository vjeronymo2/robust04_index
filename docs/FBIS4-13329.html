			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--In its commentary today, the  newspaper AL-AKHBAR cites a warning by international observers  in Sarajevo of possible atrocities done under the policy of  ethnic cleansing by the Serbs in Bosnia, who have attacked  Goradze's only hospital. Senior Western officials, the paper  writes, have done nothing to resolve the situation in Bosnia.  Western rhetoric is nothing but a half-hearted attempt to  justify a situation that is only as disgraceful as it is  untenable, the paper states.    The tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina proves that the United  Nations is no improvement on the League of Nations. Actually,  it is even more impotent than the defunct league. The United  Nations may have 180 members and a charter that endows it with  powers the League of Nations never had, but its never assumes  these powers except to satisfy the desires of some of the major  powers.</p>

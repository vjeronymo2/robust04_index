			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Philip Morris acquires Nabisco cereal operation KRAFT General Foods, the core US food division of Philip Morris, has stepped in as the purchaser of RJR Nabisco's cold cereal business, which takes in the Shredded Wheat and Shreddies brand names. The large tobacco and food group has agreed to pay Dollars 450m in cash for the business, together with certain international trademarks. The previous potential buyer of the cereal operations, General Mills, had agreed the same price. The manufacturing facilities to be acquired will include plants in Naperville, Illinois, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, although Nabisco will keep a plant in Niagara Falls, New York, to manufacture snack crackers. Commenting on the purchase, which is still subject to regulatory review in the US and Canada, Philip Morris said that it intended to incorporate the Nabisco cereal lines into its existing line of breakfast cereals, and would market both through the Kraft sales and distribution networks. Mr Richard Mayers, head of Kraft General Foods, claimed that the ready-to-eat cereal category offered 'great potential for expanded growth and operating income'. Philip Morris's existing cereal lines include Honey Bunches, Grape-Nuts, Pebbles and Marshmallow Alpha-Bits. According to the tobacco and food group, its cereal lines have about 11.5 per cent of the US cold cereals market while the Nabisco products are estimated to have about 3 per cent - a figure which has declined from over 5 per cent in four years. Nabisco had planned to sell the cold cereals business to General Mills, a much larger player in the cereals market and a competitor to Kellogg, which remains the industry leader. This deal was announced in early-September. However, the two parties aborted the transaction in early November, when it became clear that a 'lengthy and prolonged review' by federal anti-trust authorities was likely. Speculation that another buyer would be sought immediately surfaced - with Philip Morris touted as one of the favourite replacement buyers. Yesterday, the tobacco company's shares were down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 79 3/8 . Although yesterday's deal between Philip Morris and Nabisco is subject to regulatory review, is seems less likely to provoke problems on this score. The combined shares of the US market, would be under 15 per cent, on Philip Morris's figures. There are two significantly larger players in the sector - namely Kellogg and General Mills.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy </F> Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin at Dicle University in  Diyarbakir -- live]    [Excerpts] [Ciller] Valuable citizens of Diyarbakir and  prominent members of the press and television, I salute you. We  arrived to embrace the citizens of Diyarbakir and southeast  Anatolia. I want to say that the warm welcome and the support I  saw made me very happy and confirmed once more the fact that we  are truly a united entity. The empathy we received here  constitutes our greatest force. We came here to extend support  and we leave here next year, that means on 1 January, stronger  than ever thanks to the devotion of our people.    All we wish is to be able to protect our citizens, children,  babies, and old people. Our sole wish is to be able to bring  life security as well as the state and the government to the  people of the region. What we witnessed here today proves that  whatever happens our historical unity cannot be easily  disrupted. The state is great and strong, and all our citizens  from all regions are happy to belong to such a beautiful  country. We are determined to bring the strength of the state  to all our citizens -- be they in Diyarbakir, Izmir, or Istanbul  -- who are free to live anywhere they want and when they want.  For this reason, we invested 1.6 trillion Turkish lira in  Diyarbakir last year and this year we are endeavoring to invest  an additional 3.7 trillion Turkish lira, which has already been  included in the budget. We have arrived in Diyarbakir bringing  with us approval of this additional amount within the framework  of planning. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] It has been reported that due  to financial difficulties, there has been a stand still in the  GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project]. What are your views on this  issue?    [Ciller] There is no slowdown in the GAP. We are aiming at  bringing water to Urfa by means of an internal pipeline until  summer. We had a mild backlog on this issue due to a difficulty  the contractor confronted but we want to help him. We will  overcome this problem by using state mechanisms and negotiating  with various banks, among them the Development Bank. The income  we will receive from the transportation of water will cover our  additional expenses. We are determined on this issue and I am  persuaded that we are going to solve this issue in a couple of  weeks. On the issue of the Birecik Dam: We first laid the  foundations of the dam and then started looking for financial  help. The most important event was obtaining [word indistinct],  that means Germany's, guarantee and France followed in Germany's  footsteps. We are at this moment in contact with the other two  countries who belong to the consortium, but I do not envisage  any problems on that account because Germany's guarantee was the  most important step in the establishment of the consortium. The  construction of the Birecik Dam will begin very soon. [passage  omitted]    [Unidentified correspondents] [passage indistinct]    [Ciller] As the 50th government, our main duty is to take  care of the problems and the life security of our citizens in  southeast Anatolia. We have recruited the world regarding this  issue and explained to them that we have to act together in  securing these people's right to live, their most important  right. I can say that the results we achieved were the most  positive results in the last 10 years. We have secured the  support of Germany, France, Britain, and the United States --  not achieved till now. We have also started a shuttle diplomacy  with our neighbor countries in the east. [passage omitted]    We found an opportunity to express Turkey's views on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue to the world. At the same time, we  were explaining our citizens' problems and trying to secure  their lives within the framework of human rights. What is  happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is a disgrace to humanity.  We have also pointed out that this disgrace -- in violation of  human rights -- spreads the impression of being a  Muslim-Christian conflict and therefore poses a great danger to  world stability. Within this framework, I cannot say that the  world progressed much regarding this issue but in the coming  days and months, I will be going to Bosnia-Herzegovina together  with Honorable Benazir Bhutto and Margaret Thatcher to draw the  world's attention to this disgrace and warn the world. The  issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina is not only an issue which is of  concern to Turkey but also to Europe and the whole world.  Turkey had to try and explain to the world the situation in  Bosnia and we will continue in our efforts until a solution is  found. This is not an issue that Turkey can solve alone.    Concerning Azerbaijan, we also explained to the world that  without discriminating we launched a very big aid campaign to  the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the  Soviet Union. The amount of money that we have transferred to  that region is somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion -- a  considerable amount in view of the fact that the total amount of  the aid extended by the seven big countries [as heard] together  is $5 billion. [passage omitted]    Today there is an unjust Armenian aggression against  Azerbaijan and this should be condemned. Turkey is determined  to continue with its policy of nondiscrimination within the  framework of human rights, as it did in Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia,  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Azerbaijan. Turkey is against all  unjust attacks. We expressed this view when we went to Russia.  We pointed out to Russia that it has to cooperate with Turkey  on the Azerbaijani issue. We have also warned the world in the  same way. We warned the world that one day nationalism may  raise its head in Russia and we called on the world to assess  Turkey's importance in the region as well as other regional  balances. [passage omitted]    The issue of Cyprus is a completely different matter and  great steps will be taken there in the very near future. I  think that we have been able to relay a very different picture  to the world public. When we first went to the United States,  President Clinton said: Turkey has done the best it can. It  was very important for us to have Clinton acknowledge that  Turkey did its best because till then we were being blamed for  being unjust. [passage omitted] We are reiterating that we  should not use Cyprus as a tool in foreign policy and this is  what we ask from our neighbors and Greece: Let us not make the  Cyprus issue a tool for internal politics. Let us not use the  Cyprus issue as a means for exploitation. Let us find a  solution to this issue together, jointly. The most important  point in this issue was the Cyprus administration coming to  power by democratic means. We are witness to the last stages of  this democratic process and once the government is established  we will have the opportunity to tackle this issue under the  leadership of the Turkish Cypriots, because they will have to  decide their own fate and make the proper decisions.    [Unidentified correspondent] There is concern regarding  the difficulty in holding elections in the region as well as the  designation of candidates. [passage indistinct]    [Ciller] Let no one worry. I am going to say this openly.  Elections will be held in this region and throughout the  country. Every kind of security measure will be taken and there  will be justice and freedom. We are taking every measure in  order to hold the elections under these conditions. I want to  assure the citizens and I call on them to be calm and peaceful.  [passage omitted]    [Karayalcin] I agree with honorable Ciller's statement. I  have not heard anything as to the Social Democratic Populist  Party [SDPP] mayors not submitting their candidacy for the 27  March elections. As the leader of the SDPP, I do not want my  statements to be taken as an assessment that the present SDPP  mayors' candidacy will be automatically renewed. We have not  yet reached any decisions on this issue. [passage omitted]    As the honorable prime minister expressed, there is no  reason  for the elections not to be held here. The elections will take  place and all the parties that can participate will participate.  [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] In your speech, you noted that  the population of Diyarbakir increased two to threefold in the  past two years. [passage indistinct] Over one thousand  villages have reportedly been evacuated. Does your government  have any plans to secure the villagers' return to their homes,  to guarantee their safety, and failing that, to help these  people financially?    [Karayalcin] There are no evacuated villages in the region.  There are approximately 600 empty villages. Of these, 78 have  been abandoned for economic reasons. There are also those that  have been left for security reasons, but I believe that the  phrase evacuated villages does not apply here. For us, the  resettlement of our citizens who are experiencing this internal  immigration is extremely important -- be it in Diyarbakir,  Batman, Bismil, or any other place in the region. The honorable  prime minister supplied figures for a move which is important  only for Diyarbakir. Only in Diyarbakir, we are launching a  project to include 14,000 housing units built on 280 hectares.  As mentioned by the prime minister earlier, we are considering  every means in order to overcome the settlement problems and  meet the urgent accommodation needs of our citizens in other  provinces who are living in tents.    Although I was not asked, I would like to make it very clear  that it is our aim to extensively implement the rules of  democratization in the southeast of the country as well. As the  prime minister noted, it is one of our primary goals to reduce  and eventually eliminate terrorism and stop the bloodshed in  1994. In conjunction with this goal, our government will  undertake great leaps in the field of democratization. [passage  omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Western countries adopted a  front against the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] as a result of  your visit to these countries. How long will this last? In  Antalya, you stated that terrorism will be eliminated in 1994.  We infer from this that the armed struggle will be intensified.  If in the future, these Western countries pressure you to stop  the armed struggle, then what will you do?    [Ciller] Our internal affairs are our own concern. We will  be the ones to make the decision. What we did vis-a-vis the  outside world was to tell them there are babies, women, elderly  and innocent people among our citizens living in this region.  These citizens are being cruelly murdered. We must protect  these people. We are not only protecting them, but in times of  need we also opened our borders and provided shelter and food  for 1 million of their brothers across the border. Our problem  is not with the people of this region. Our problem is with a  terrorist group which is preventing us from providing services,  investments, and state support to the region, and which is even  trying to oust the political parties and the press from the  area. Let us wage this struggle against the terrorists  together. Let us do this together in all parts of the world --  in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Azerbaijan, and Iraq. There is  no question of us redirecting our policy in line with their  various wishes, and there cannot be such a question.    It must be said, however, that until now Germany wanted to  stop us using their weapons in the struggle against terrorism,  but now the world has realized that these people are terrorists  and they are killing our innocent citizens. If our cause is  just, we can continue to defend it. It is important that we  should be in the right. It is important for us to reach out to  our citizens with compassion. To this end, we must surmount all  the obstacles before us. We are determined in this. I believe  that we have already achieved a significant stage in this  struggle and that we will advance our cause even further in 1994.    It is impossible to say that terrorism in Turkey will  suddenly disappear and be uprooted in 1994. We will, however,  reduce it to the same level as the rest of the world, to a level  where it ceases to pose a threat, to occupy first place on our  agenda, to drain the resources of the state, or to prevent the  state from investing in this region. In other words, we will  achieve a significant stage in the struggle against terrorism,  we will remove it from our priority list, and we will no longer  allow it to eat into our resources. We are determined to attain  this and I believe that we will. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] [question indistinct]    [Ciller] I would like to answer the question on what the  government plans to implement in the first part of this year.  Our first project concerns the southeast region. As you know,  we just enacted the elections law. Our agenda includes a series  of bills to fight terrorism. Immediately after this, we will  introduce the law on local administrations. Our bill on the  turn-key model for industry will resolve the financing  difficulties for the dams to be built in Birecik and its  vicinity.    The law on local administration accords more resources and  more power to municipal authorities. In other words, we want  local authorities to solve more problems themselves, rather than  involve Ankara in their solution. We will use pilot areas in  all parts of the country because we want to overcome problems  using experience and on-the-spot implementation.    More important, in the first three months of this year, we  will provide loans for shopkeepers and small businesses as well  as for the youth and housewives through the Halk Bank. We also  have a project to sell agricultural Treasury lands that are  outside the jurisdiction of the municipalities to those who are  utilizing them within their means. We also want to include in  our agenda the various Treasury lands in urban areas which have  turned into shantytowns.    I would also like to mention that we will continue to  allocate resources to this region with great determination.  This will not consist only of cotton and grain. During 1993,  we allocated 1 billion Turkish lira for tobacco to Batman. This  will continue. As you know, we have a new tobacco project. The  state is determined to continue to allocate resources to this  region. [passage omitted]</p>

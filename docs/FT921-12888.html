			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Amicable Smaller seeks Pounds 33.5m AMICABLE SMALLER Enter-prise Trust is attempting to raise up to Pounds 33.5m, after expenses, via an offer for subscription on the main market. It is the second investment trust launch over the past week to concentrate on smaller company shares. Hoare Govett's annual report on its smaller companies index, published yesterday, showed that smaller company shares have outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index since 1955 by an annual average of 4.5 per cent. However, smaller company shares have been badly hit by high interest rates and the UK economic recession, and have underperformed the All-Share over each of the past three years. The directors believe that smaller companies are due for a revival and will invest in stocks among the smallest 10 per cent, by market capitalisation, on the UK market. A maximum of 35m shares, and a minimum of 20m, are being offered at 100p each with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. The warrants confer the right to sub-scribe for one ordinary share at 100p in the years 1993 to 2000. The warrants, together with the limited 10 year life of the trust, are designed to limit the discount to net assets at which the shares trade after flotation. Scottish Amicable, which is managing the trust, is expecting an annualised yield on the shares of about 5 per cent. The management fee is 0.1875 per cent of the assets, payable quarterly. Allied Provincial Securities has undertaken to subscribe or procure subscribers for 17m ordinary shares, with warrants. Minimum application for shares in the trust, which is suitable for inclusion within a personal equity plan in both 1991-92 and 1992-93, is for 500 shares. The deadline for applications is February 26 and dealings are expected to start on March 5. See Lex</p>

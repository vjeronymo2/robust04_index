			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Fritz Wirth commentary: "A Ray of Hope"] </F>   [Text] When everything had been signed, U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher expressed the inconceivable fact in the  following words: "Up to now, the argument of force had won in  Bosnia. Now, for the first time, the force of argument has  won." This was his comment on the new Croat-Muslim federation  that was negotiated in Washington over the past four days. It  is a very Yugoslav pact. It creates hope where there was sheer  desperation only yesterday. It made peace between parties that  were bloody enemies only yesterday. And, going by the bitter  experience of the past years, it should be worthless even before  the ink has dried.    But however much past experience may suggest the opposite,  there is a ray of fresh hope after the latest agreement between  Croats and Muslims. The reason: This peace has a different  dimension. For the first time in this conflict the United  States was the guardian and director of a pact. And the part  that the long-missed world power can play in this becomes clear  by the two-week silence of the Sarajevo guns.    There is no doubt: The plan for a new federation in Bosnia  is an agreement full of snags and weaknesses. Its major  problem: It cannot succeed without the approval of the Serbs,  who are demanded to return occupied territories. This is  exactly the point where Russia comes in as the second great  director of the plan beside the United States. Only the  Russians are in a position to pressure the Serbs effectively and  to convince them that any resistance to this plan would lead  them into isolation.    What was signed in Washington is not only a great challenge  to the Serbs. It is a first test for the Russians and Boris  Yeltsin regarding their future role in this conflict and the  efficiency of their new activities in world politics. In short:  The key to solving the Bosnia crisis now lies with Moscow.</p>

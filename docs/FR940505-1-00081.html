			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Open burning operations at single and two-family dwellings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are currently exempt from most permissive burn/no-burn day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. Although EPA is not proposing that these sources be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to obtain a burn permit, the proposed FIP regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would also require that this type of burning activity be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricted to permissive burn days. Comments are requested on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impacts and issues resulting from including these sources in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed FIP regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cost resulting from the lost opportunity to burn waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the additional no-burn days would be minimized by allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources to burn on days when exceedances are not predicted. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case of Sacramento, the proposed rule is expected to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste burning during over 80 percent of the calendar days each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. However, in the South Coast, where the state ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard is exceeded roughly 50 percent of the calendar days each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year, the proposed rule would restrict burning to approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 percent of the calendar days per year. The impact of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP measure in Ventura is expected to be minimal since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the district has already instituted a policy of restricting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burning when the state standard is predicted to be exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are requested on the feasibility of this strategy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the FIP areas, especially for the South Coast FIP area. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also requests information on potential costs resulting from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP measure. Comments are also requested on alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies (e.g., soil incorporation, residue removal, after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market disposal alternatives) which will reduce waste burning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts on ambient ozone air quality. EPA seeks comments on ways  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to avoid any increased costs and increased pesticide use that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be associated with the rule. Comments are requested on potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC reductions resulting from implementation of the Connelly-Areias-Chandler Rice Straw Burning Reduction Act of 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (California Health &amp; Safety Code, Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 3,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 41865).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are requested on the necessity of exemptions in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP measure. For example, California district offices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may exempt a source from no burn day prohibitions during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances of imminent and substantial economic loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, these terms are undefined. Comments are requested on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate definition for the aforementioned terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also requesting comment on an alternative to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aforementioned strategy. As an alternative, a waste burning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure could be designed to only allow waste burning during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of the year when ozone levels are within the state ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, typically November through February depending on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area. This alternative would supplement the current no-burn day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program and prohibit burning during the ozone season. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach would provide greater certainty to affected parties so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they could adequately plan their burn schedules; however, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would also provide less flexibility by prohibiting burning on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days expected to be within ozone standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA is continuing to evaluate the emissions inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and potential reductions from the proposed FIP measure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preliminary emission reduction estimates from the 1990 baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are 1.8 to 3.6 tpd in the Sacramento area, 0.3 to 0.5 tpd in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast FIP area, and less than 0.1 tpd in the Ventura FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area. Actual reductions will depend on the overall effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the FIP measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Residential Water Heaters (Sacramento).

Emission reductions are achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by: (1) replacement of conventional gas-fired water heaters with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  units; (2) replacement of conventional gas-fired water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters with electric water heaters; or (3) installation of solar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> panels to decrease natural gas consumption associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of gas-fired water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule applies to any natural gas-fired water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heater installed in the Sacramento FIP area after August 15,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995, which emits in excess of 40 nanograms of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (calculated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight equivalent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per joule) and with a heat input rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 75,000 British thermal units per hour (Btu/hr). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule does not apply to water heaters with a rated heat input of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 75,000 Btu/hr or greater, used for recreational vehicles, or used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusively to heat swimming pools and hot tubs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule is based largely on SCAQMD Rule 1121,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAAQMD Regulation 9_Rule 6, and VCAPCD Rule 74.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule are discussed in detail in EPA's technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support document. The proposed rule is expected to result in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost savings created by the more energy efficient units and lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of the low-NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  units (compared to currently sold units).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Considering the long-term fuel costs for residential water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating, solar water heaters can also be a cost-effective option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from residential water heaters were 1.8 tpd in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento FIP area. Emissions are projected to continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grow to 2.3 tpd in 1999 and to 2.7 tpd in 2005. Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.2 and 0.6 tpd respectively at a retail cost savings of $3.00 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $19.00 per heater (1992 dollars) if replaced with a low-NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heater. Additional reductions will continue to occur until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 2008 when it is expected that all existing units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will have been replaced <FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>  by the low-NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  units. Energy savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and costs would also accrue if currently available low-NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher efficiency units or solar powered water heaters were used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While electric water heaters are also an option, electricity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently costs approximately three times the cost of natural gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Sacramento area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Estimated service life of a residential water heater is approximately twelve years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional reductions could be achieved in all three FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas by requiring that a percentage of new housing starts in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas install solar water heater systems. While it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible for EPA to require this approach through a FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, it is very feasible for local communities to adopt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordinances that require a percentage of solar water heaters in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new construction. Examples of such communities include the Gold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> River Area Housing Development in Sacramento, the City of La  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Verne in Los Angeles County, and the cities of Thousand Oaks and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Del Mar.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are requested on additional methods or options,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as market incentives and methods encouraging solar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies, which might further reduce NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residential water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) Stationary Internal Combustion Engines (Sacramento).

These engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are used for a variety of applications including electric power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation for both base and standby service, oil and gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pipeline pumping/transport, oil and gas exploration and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production, irrigation, hoisting, and nuclear power plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency cooling water pump operation. Engines are generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified by fuel type, method of ignition, combustion cycle,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and charging method. 1990 NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from IC engines in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento FIP area were estimated at 2.6 tons per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several control techniques are available for controlling NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from IC engines. Combustion controls include exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas recirculation, prestratified charge, injection timing retard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-ignition chamber combustion, control of the air-to-fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio, and wet injection. Post combustion add-on controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include selective noncatalytic reduction selective catalytic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction. Other control techniques include conversion of fuel-fired engines to electric motors or the use of alternative fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as methanol in place of diesel fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule applies to any owner or operator of an IC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine rated at 50 or more brake horsepower in the Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area.

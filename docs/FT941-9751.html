			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Funds with a Latin flavour - Bethan Hutton surveys new issues and finds Latin America is flavour of the month Latin America seems to be investment trust flavour of the month. Edinburgh Fund Managers, Morgan Grenfell and Templeton are launching London-listed trusts specialising in the area, while Gartmore has a Dublin-listed trust aimed mostly at institutional investors. As emerging markets in the Pacific rim have had such a good run, a growing number of international investors are switching their attention to Latin America. Economic reforms, and the passing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, have added to the attractions of the area. And although British investors have been less active in the region so far than their US counterparts, that is showing signs of changing. EFM is calling its fund the Inca trust, and hopes to raise between Pounds 75m and Pounds 100m. It will invest in a mix of small, medium and large companies in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia and Peru. EFM already manages a unit trust, the Edinburgh Latin American fund, which has a similar investment brief and is the third-best performer (of 150) in the international equity growth sector over the year to February 1 (source: Micropal). The public offer period for Inca is due to open in mid-March for two weeks. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and warrants will be attached on a one-for-five basis. Morgan Grenfell's Latin American investment trust aims to raise more than Pounds 100m, with a placing and public offer which opens in March. Full details have not been announced yet. Templeton has just announced its plans for a trust, which will be on offer to the public in April. Foreign &amp; Colonial, manager of the oldest and largest UK investment trust of the same name, is to set up a fund concentrating on its own backyard for the first time in its 125-year history. To date, all Foreign &amp; Colonial trusts have had a substantial overseas element. Now, though, F&amp;C is launching a purely UK fund, the Income Growth investment trust. This will be aimed largely at personal equity plan investors. It will invest in companies selected from the FT-SE 350 index, with the aim of producing long-term income growth above the rate of inflation and capital growth greater than the index. The yield is expected to be in line with the index, now about 3.3 per cent, and dividends will be paid quarterly. One warrant will be attached to every five shares in units of 500p, and the shares and warrants will be traded as a package for the first 43 days so that the warrants also can be transferred into a Pep. The public offer is open from March 1 to 22 and minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Initial expenses will be capped at 4 per cent. There will be no initial charge for Pep investors who buy during the subscription period, but there is an annual management charge of up to 1 per cent. There is an annual Pep charge of Pounds 60, and the normal initial Pep charge (for those who invest after the offer for subscription has closed) is Pounds 50. Because of the timing of the launch, investors can transfer shares into a Pep either side of the tax year-end; thus, they can invest up to Pounds 12,000 through a Pep but pay only one annual fee and no up-front fee. The new fund will also be included in the F&amp;C savings scheme. Existing trusts also are cashing in on the investment trust boom to raise more money. Templeton Emerging Markets, the largest fund in the sector and best performer over three years, is making an issue of conversion shares with warrants attached. Full details are not available yet but the public offer is likely to be during March. Abtrust is raising new money for its New Dawn trust, which invests in the Far East (excluding Japan). It is issuing up to Pounds 45m worth of conversion shares, two-thirds of which have been placed with institutions already. The remaining Pounds 15m worth are available in a public offer for subscription, open until March 2. Minimum subscription is Pounds 250. The C-shares will be converted into ordinary shares as soon as the new money is invested, and one warrant will be issued for every five new ordinary shares.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Daugavpils [town] council has presented a  protest to the command of the Northwestern Group of Forces of  the Russian Army concerning the fact that it is not observing  the schedule agreed for the withdrawal of the army from the town  and the provision of residences belonging to the special  municipal services of the town, who cannot take over the  unsupervised conditions and the ransacked apartments, depots,  and storehouses. Restoration work is, in practice, carried out  by workers paid by the municipal housing administration, but  compensation for them has not reached the town, nor does it  intend to place the burden of the expense on the people of  Daugavpils.</p>

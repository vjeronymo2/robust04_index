			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Facing the realities of recession - The fading fortunes of the hotel industry IAN AND Diana Sykes are beginning to rue the day five years ago when they bought the 12-bedroom Swan House country house hotel two-and-a-half miles outside Stratford-on-Avon. 'It seemed a good idea at the time,' recalls 30-year-old Mr Sykes. 'Everyone wanted to stay in a hotel in the country and the banks were only too willing to lend us money to renovate the house from top to bottom.' But the dream has turned sour. High interest rates, fewer Americans visitors because of the weak dollar and Gulf crisis, and a dearth of weekenders willing to enjoy short-breaks in the countryside has left the Sykes desperately trying to sell up. Two years ago their hotel was valued at Pounds 1m, but after several months on the market at Pounds 700,000 Mr Sykes is contemplating a further price cut to tempt buyers. 'It looks as if we shall have to sell our boat and our house if things don't pick up soon,' he says. The Sykes are not alone in their dilemma. Over 100 country house hotels are estimated to have been put into receivership so far this year as a result of the recession and slump in tourism. Many of these forced sales represent the end of their owners' dreams. 'It was relatively easy for people in the 1980s to sell their town house and buy a country hotel property and think they could become hoteliers as simply as that,' says Mr Bruce Williamson, chief executive of Druce Hotels and Leisure, the property agency which specialises in country houses. 'But the reality of the recession has brought home to many that it is not as easy as it looks to survive the bad times as well as good,' he adds. The slump in the country house hotel market is but a microcosm of the state of the UK hotel industry in general. After years when the most pressing concern for many British hoteliers was simply finding the best sites for hotels to meet the burgeoning leisure and business demand, the downturn this year has hit hard. During the early part of this year, UK hotels - especially those in London - saw their occupancy drop to their lowest ever level: down to 20 per cent in many cases. Newly-opened hotels such as the refurbished Dorchester in Park Lane were said to be hit even harder. Since then, both business and leisure travel has picked up substantially, to about 60 per cent on average occupancy in UK hotels. But the outlook is far from buoyant: City analysts expect at least a 20 per cent shortfall in overseas tourist numbers to Britain this summer. While individual business travel is returning after the clampdown during the Gulf war, some companies have decided to maintain a tight control on travel expenses. Conference and incentive group travel, moreover, will take several months, if not longer, to recover judging by the experience of the last downturn in trade during the post-Libyan bombing scares in 1986. 'Of course occupancy levels in hotels are higher than they were in January and February,' points out Mr Jonathan Bodlender, chairman of hotel consultants Horwath Consulting. 'But they would be expected to pick up in March and April. The question is, how far have they still to go to reach last year's levels: I would think quite a way.' Britain's top two hoteliers - Trusthouse Forte and Mount Charlotte Hotels - recently made clear the impact of the war and recession on hoteliers. THF's pre-tax profits fell 27 per cent to Pounds 190m for the year to end-January, while those of Mount Charlotte stayed virtually static at Pounds 47.5m in spite of a 55 per cent increase in turnover after acquiring Thistle Hotels last year. Only Queens Moat Houses, the third largest UK hotels operator, appears to have shrugged off the gloom that has afflicted its rivals - its recent pre-tax profits figures were some 51 per cent higher at Pounds 94.09m. But this reflected the fact some 40 per cent of its hotel stock is based on the continent where the impact of recession has been felt less. THF's response will be unveiled today when it announces the long-awaited restructuring of its 350 UK hotels, creating some five 'core' brands and possibly changing its corporate identity to simply Forte. 'We want to emphasise our strengths and make people clearly aware of what they can expect from our hotels under each brand name,' says Mr Rocco Forte, THF's chief executive, who refuses to confirm or deny until today the dropping the Trusthouse part of the THF name. Under the THF restructuring, its hotels will be brought together under three main brands: Travelodges, Post Houses, and Crest. Other hotels which do not fit these three categories will be rebranded under such names as Heritage Hotels, for country house properties, or Exclusive hotels. Those that fall into none of these five categories will be sold. THF has already earmarked some 32 hotels for sale - expected to raise over Pounds 100m - which do not fit its new strategy. It is a strategy honed to perfection over the past decade by US hotel chains such as Marriott and Hyatt as well as Holiday Inn, now owned by the Bass brewing group. These hotel groups have increasingly realised that hotel guests are not one homogeneous market: not only does the business executive during the week become the leisure traveller at weekends but both business and leisure travellers at all time want different types of accommodation. French group Accor has identified such niche marketing more than any other European hotel group and now has its growth strategy firmly targetted on the UK. In France it operates a multi-tier strategy: Sofitel hotels aimed at the city centre luxury market; Novotel, three-star properties sited close to airports and motorways; Ibis, two-star hotels for families; and Formula One  -basic accommodation with shared facilities. 'We believe that the UK market is right for a similar segmented strategy,' says Mr William Miller, Accor's UK chairman. Already Novotel and Ibis hotels have been opened in the UK, with basic Formula One properties to be built shortly. But THF's decision to segment its hotel chain may not necessarily help it out of the industry's present doldrums. 'Branding is no panacea,' says Mr Paul Slattery, senior hotels analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson. 'Hotels in a branded portfolio may bear a family resemblance to each other, but they are not and cannot be clones as is the case with consumer product brands.' THF's new brand strategy may seem far removed from the plight of Mr and Mrs Sykes in Stratford-on-Avon. But not all country house hoteliers are feeling the pinch. The Lygon Arms, part of the Savoy Group and based in the Cotswold village of Broadway, has been virtually full up with weekenders over the past month. A combination of aggressive marketing and improved facilities - it recently opened a Pounds 1.5m health complex and swimming pool - has kept the guests coming, reports Mr Kirk Ritchie, the Lygon's managing director.</p>

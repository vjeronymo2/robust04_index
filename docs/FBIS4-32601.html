			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stevo Latinovic on the talks between </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Italian  Foreign Minister Antonio Martino in Sarajevo on 27 June --  recorded]    [Text] [Latinovic] The visit by the Italian minister is  part of a several-day tour in the furtherance of peace of the  former Yugoslavia, so that Minister Martino's itinerary covers  not only Sarajevo but also Zagreb and Belgrade. Apart from  Prime Minister Silajdzic, today's talks were also attended by  Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic and Mariofil Ljubic, deputy  chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly and chairman of the  Constituent Assembly.    At the end of the talks, Antonio Martino and Dr. Haris  Silajdzic gave statements.    [Martino in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation] This is my first visit to your country. I was  looking forward to visiting Sarajevo to see for myself the marks  of war on this city. I wanted to meet the prime minister as  soon as possible, to exchange views, and to find out what the  perspective is for a complete and satisfactory solution to this  crisis. I have now been informed about the views held by the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Government as to the solution to the crisis  and the end of the war in the entire region.    We also discussed the coming summit of the G-7 in Naples. A  constructive and satisfactory debate is expected to take place  there on the Bosnian problem.    I look forward to coming to this city again in more peaceful  times.    [Silajdzic] We are pleased to have received today the  delegation of the Italian Government led by the foreign minister.    I will very briefly tell you what we discussed. Of course,  we discussed peace and the work of the contact group. As for  the contact group and the solutions that it will offer, we said  that, first and foremost, the external borders of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 1000-year-old state cannot be open to  discussion. What is open to discussion, what the contact group  is doing, is the internal reorganization of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We added that the international community should not  legitimize genocide as [words indistinct]. We said that we  expected the international community to protect the external  borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Serbia and Montenegro. That  is where the main problem lies. We also said that we expected a  lot from the coming G-7 summit in Naples on 8 July. These are  countries that are the most responsible for the world order.  Order cannot be maintained if aggression is allowed, if change  of borders is allowed, if genocide is allowed, and so on.  Therefore, we expect a lot from the Italian Government, we  expect it to contribute to that summit, we expect it to give a  constructive contribution. We have to turn a new page in  history, to (enter a period) in which genocide and aggression  will not be possible.    [Latinovic] Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino then  went for a walk in the city. After that he was received by Dr.  Mustafa Efendi Ceric, reis ul-ulema of the Islamic Community of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

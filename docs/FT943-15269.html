			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Delegates presented with a feast of puns and pasta If the summit was all about increasing personal ties, Silvio Berlusconi chose to pun himself into history by presenting each of his male guests with a special G7 tie. Naples has several famous handcrafted tie-makers and Mr Berlusconi with attention to detail as host reportedly chose the design. Each one was made to measure. To ensure a tie suited Helmut Kohl, the bulky West German Chancellor, Mr Berlusconi decided on an extra 30cm of material. The wives meanwhile were showered by local craftsmen with every gift imaginable. The hangers-on were not forgotten either, with a special packet of G7 pasta from a local company whose courtesy card boasted of its 'quality assurance and gut standing (sic) characteristics'. The prize for the best intentioned pun must go to Antonio Bassolino, left wing mayor of Naples who with justifiable pride has been showing off the marvels of his city to the summit leaders and their wives. After meeting Britain's John Major, he remarked they had something in common: A Neapolitan pronunciation of the premier's surname came up with a sound like 'Mayor'. The proprietor of the Di Matteo pizzeria who managed to interest Bill Clinton in a pizza on the US president's walkabout in the historic centre, confessed yesterday to a certain puzzlement about Mr Clinton's gourmandise. 'He wanted a pizza Margherita topped with onions, salami and fried potatoes. . . a little strange.' This concoction didn't seem to prevent Mr Clinton from his habitual early morning jogging, a rite performed along the Naples sea-front. This has been the summit where the wives have gone their own way. Hilary Rodham Clinton passed over 'Swan Lake' at the San Carlo opera house in the company of Veronica Lario, Mr Berlusconi's wife. She chose instead to visit Ravello and its most illustrious resident Gore Vidal, the American writer who has a villa there with spectacular views over the Amalfi coast. Like Jacqueline Kennedy before her, who also visited Vidal there, she was made an honorary citizen of Ravello. Health has been on the minds of everyone after the gastric complaint that felled Japanese premier Tomiichi Murayama. French president Francois Mitterrand looked clearly wan from the suffocating heat; and on Saturday evening after he had braved the 116 steps of the ceremonial staircase at the Caserta Palace for a gala dinner he looked extremely frail. The exceptional heatwave took its toll on many of the delegates in the form of dehydration; and the 2,700 journalists were for once at the trough only for water and soft drinks. By the end of the summit, the girls distributing free Coca Cola had bandages on their fingers, raw from opening so many cans.</p>

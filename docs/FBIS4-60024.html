			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian organizations opposed to the bargain  agreement between the PLO and the Zionist entity have refused to  hand over their weapons to 'Arafat's supporters in Gaza and  Jericho.    Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  spokesman in Damascus, said that the Palestinian police must  first of all disarm the Zionist occupation forces.    He added: Any person who tries to deprive us of our right to  confront the enemy will be killed.    Meanwhile a spokesman for George Habash's Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine announced that the front's forces  will not lay down their arms as long as one Zionist soldier or  settler remains in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank.    A spokesman for Nayif Hawatimah's Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine also opposed disarming the Palestinian  organizations. He said any Zionist settler or soldier seen in  Gaza or Jericho will be killed.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Major spearheads Tory drive to regain initiative A BLITZ of personal appearances by the prime minister signalled the start yesterday of an all-out Conservative drive to regain the initiative after a week that saw Labour take the offensive in the general election campaign. Labour seized on yesterday's unchanged inflation rate of 4.1 per cent to renew its charge that the government is doing nothing to promote recovery. Meanwhile, Mr John Major led an onslaught on Labour's shadow budget. His combative language displayed a fresh aggression that contrasted markedly with his affable and conciliatory prime ministerial image. In a speech last night in his Huntingdon constituency, he referred to a hardline socialism 'brewing and bubbling' under the surface in a party offering a 'dismal, destructive and divisive vision of Britain'. Mr Neil Kinnock, speaking on a campaign tour of Cardiff, described the inflation figures as 'a very grave disappointment' for the government which was 'suppressing inflation by devastating the economy'. The Labour leader said: 'They are certainly not curing it and they are not effectively controlling it.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, echoed similar charges, but Mr Major brushed aside the criticism. Welcoming the figures as 'excellent news', he denied that economists had expected a fall and said that for the first time in a quarter of a century Britain had a lower inflation rate than Germany. He spelt out his determination for Britain to achieve zero inflation. 'No other party will set that target; no other party cares so much. But it is the only long-term way to proper peace of mind for the pensioner; and the only long-term way to stable, permanent jobs.' The clash over inflation came as Tory campaign managers planned to use the weekend to reverse what is widely perceived as a narrow Labour opinion poll lead. Party strategists said they had always expected it would take some time for charges that Labour will raise taxes to pay off in the opinion polls. In the interim, cabinet ministers were laying down a barrage of attacks on Labour's shadow budget. The prime minister and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, both rounded on the proposals as a gratuitous assault on middle income earners. Mr Major warned that the increased income tax and National Insurance contributions would create a country 'where people have no incentive, no hope, no choice and no future'. He said: 'We will push this argument day after day after day after day because it is a damaging recipe for Britain.' he said. Today, the Tories are expected to publish a revised costing of Labour's policies, based on its manifesto promises. It is expected to prove the pre-cursor to a repetition of the 'tax bombshell' charge that Mr Kinnock must raise income tax to pay for his programme. The theme will be taken up this weekend by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, in speeches and by Mr Major in speeches and television interviews. The February inflation figures - the lowest rate since October last year - disappointed some expectations of a drop to 4 per cent. Prices in some components of the retail prices index - particularly clothing and footwear and household goods - bounced back after record discounts in January's sales. Higher petrol prices also kept the inflation rate up despite a sharp drop in seasonal food price inflation. A Harris poll of seats in the capital carried out for London Weekend Television, shows Labour three points ahead of the Tories.

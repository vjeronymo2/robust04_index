			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Competition on the line: AT&amp;T's bid for a UK licence heralds an upheaval in the telecommunications market Ignore reports that workmen will soon be digging up Britain's streets to lay telephone cables for new rivals to British Telecom and Mercury. Yesterday's statement on telecommunications liberalisation by the European Commission lays down a five-year timetable for full liberalisation of services, so open competition within the Community is a few years off at least. Closer on the horizon are bulldozers of US origin. American Telephone and Telegraph, the largest US telecoms operator, is seeking a UK public telecommunications licence, and wants to sell services both between the UK and the US and within the UK itself. However, it will be months before Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decides whether to grant the licence. In January 1992 Sprint, the third-largest US voice carrier, applied for licences to build its own network and buy and sell services in the UK. It is still awaiting a decision. Far wider issues than the merits of the individual applications are at stake. AT&amp;T and BT are engaged in a battle for direct access to each other's public networks. AT&amp;T's application for a UK licence was preceded by an application by BT to the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecommunications regulator, to allow it to buy and sell services in the US. Both sides are now locked in argument before the commission about the terms on which transatlantic competition should take place. AT&amp;T has called on the regulator to reject all BT's applications unless it is granted fair access to the UK market; BT will lodge a detailed rebuttal today. At the end of the day, it will almost certainly take a ministerial-level agreement to resolve the issue. BT is asking to be treated as a non-dominant carrier in the US, despite its grip over the UK market, while AT&amp;T wants to see far greater transparency in the treatment of competing companies in the UK. It also objects to having to negotiate with BT over access charges and service quality. What will Britain's telecoms market look like if the US operators are given the green light? And how keen are customers for competitors to BT and its UK rival Mercury, which is now able to reach 90 per cent of Britain and claims to have cornered 10 per cent of the market? Even if AT&amp;T and Sprint get in, they will not be the only new players. Ionica, a private company, gained a UK operators' licence earlier this year and aims to establish a national radio-based network. Several smaller operators are already reselling leased lines to the US connected to the public network on one side of the Atlantic only, under 1991 rules liberalising the resale market. At the moment it is illegal to resell lines to the US switched into the public network at both ends (known as 'international simple resale'). But since the reason for the ISR ban is the supposed absence of a 'level playing field', decisions to allow AT&amp;T and BT to enter each other's markets will very likely go hand-in-hand with an Anglo-US ISR agreement. Ionica apart, the priority for the newcomers will be to take a slice of BT's lucrative and growing international - particularly transatlantic - business. So large companies will be the main beneficiaries of greater competition, initially at least. AT&amp;T concedes that 'duplication of BT's network by a new entrant is economically unfeasible, at least in the near term'. Sprint has ideas for utilising the canal system to build its own network, but it will not be national for some time. However, the potential transatlantic pickings are large and immediate: Mr Greg Staple, a Washington consultant, estimates that US-UK voice traffic will grow from about 1.13bn minutes in 1991 to 1.5bn this year, and the room to expand the market through new data and value-added services is enormous. Prices could tumble. As an opening gambit in its battle with BT, AT&amp;T has already proposed a cut of about 60 per cent in the accounting rates for transatlantic calls. The accounting rates, in effect a wholesale price paid by one national operator to another to deliver international calls to their final destination, has fallen by nearly half in the past three years. If AT&amp;T thinks it can cut the rates by half again, that is a fair indication of how far out of line prices and costs are at present. Another pointer is the prices being touted by would-be ISR merchants. Swiftcall, a three-person company which sought (unsuccessfully) to offer ISR to the US through a link to Canada, was proposing to charge a single rate of 25p a minute for business calls and 28p for residential calls (in both cases plus the cost of a BT local call to its London office). Mercury's standard transatlantic rate is 41.1p per minute, falling to 37.5p on the best-discounted frequent caller programmes after an initial fee of Pounds 700 a quarter. BT's prices for business customers range from 47.9p a minute down to 36.5p for heavy users after an initial fee of Pounds 275 a quarter; its lowest cheap-rate residential tariff is 39p (all prices exclusive of value-added tax). The competition will not just be on price, however. Sprint and AT&amp;T also plan to offer one-stop private network services, all-in maintenance packages, and to add advanced services not yet marketed widely in the UK, such as toll-free calling services for businesses. BT wants to offer similar services in the US. Do UK companies want this increased choice? 'The more competition the merrier,' says Mr Shaun O'Byrne, technical services director at Lehman Brothers, the merchant bank. Lehman already uses three carriers (BT, Mercury, and Worldcom). 'If the price is right, it's no problem for us to diversify further.' Lehman is already refusing to sign traditional five-year contracts with BT, even with discounts as bait. 'It's not worth it - even for a few per cent off,' says Mr O'Byrne. 'Technology and prices are changing so fast, you are insane to tie yourself to contracts of more than a year or two.' On the face of it, most business users agree with him. A recent survey by the Telecommunications Users Association (TUA), which represents more than 1,100 corporate subscribers, found only 31 per cent believed there was 'adequate' competition, against 65 per cent who wanted more. The success of Swiss-owned Worldcom, which has been in the market barely 18 months yet already boasts more than 100 corporate customers and an annual turnover into eight figures, is a fair signal. At present, Worldcom connects (mainly London-based) customers to its central London exchange by private lines, and then on resold lines out of the UK. It, too, has an application pending for a public licence. Mr David Hardwick, managing director, says: 'Buying telecoms is going to be like shopping in a supermarket; once it becomes possible - as it will soon - for more operators to switch freely in and out of the public network, the hassle for customers in changing telecoms companies will be minimal.' But business users are attracted not just by price and new services. The TUA survey found 'general satisfaction' about the quality of existing service, particularly from BT, and concern that any alternative should be 'trouble free'. Mr Paul Burt, communications manager at the International Securities Markets Association, which confirms and matches Eurobond deals using data transmission services to link banks and securities houses with its computer centre, says he learnt 'through experience the consequences of dealing with inadequately resourced operators'. ISMS had a contract with a local cable company offering telecom services, 'but it failed to invest to the levels we wanted - and its technical staff and equipment were simply not up to the standards we needed'. Small businesses, in particular, are also worried by the growing complexity of tariff structures, making comparisons of overall costs increasingly difficult to make. 'Value added is critical, particularly as companies are moving from having their own private networks and looking to telecoms companies to manage the lot,' says Mr O'Byrne. 'With the likes of AT&amp;T that shouldn't be a problem; but I'm not interested in two men in a garage offering resale services.' Mr Hardwick and most of Worldcom's employees, note, are ex-BT. There are plenty more where they came from.</p>

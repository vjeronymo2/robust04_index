			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Avonside makes 'creditable' Pounds 2.8m Correction (published 11 September 1992) appended to this article. Avonside Group, the housebuilder floated by Cannon Street Investments in March, produced turnover of Pounds 25.9m and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.82m for the first half of 1992. 'A creditable achievement for a group almost wholly dependant on the housing market', said Mr Christopher Glynn, chairman. The figures compared with a pro forma Pounds 24.5m and Pounds 3.41m respectively in 1991. The housebuilding division sold 125 units (94), the increase reflecting a deliberate switch of emphasis to the relatively stronger market for lower priced units and starter homes. Earnings per share were 4.37p (5.26p) and the interim dividend is 1.8p. CSI floated 69 per cent of the capital at 106p per share; yesterday the shares were 74 1/2p. CORRECTION Cannon Street Investments has no stake in Avonside Group, the housebuilder it floated earlier this year. Yesterday's edition of the FT stated CSI had floated 69 per cent.</p>

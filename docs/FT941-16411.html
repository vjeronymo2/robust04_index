			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Central pay talks resume in Ireland Talks resumed in Dublin yesterday between the government, employers and unions on a centralised pay bargaining agreement to cover the next two to three years. The government cleared the way for fresh talks, which broke down two months ago, by agreeing to phase out an unpopular 1 per cent income levy over the next three budgets. Ireland faced a return to free collective bargaining when the talks broke down over the levy introduced in last year's budget. The negotiations are still likely to be difficult, with all sides seeking significant changes in the two previous tripartite agreements which have regulated public and private sector pay since 1987. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents most organised labour, is calling for a 'new departure' in economic policy, involving commitments to greater workforce participation in company management, together with a 'radical tax reform', aimed at job creation. The country's main employers' organisation, the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation (IBEC), also wants a reduction in personal tax rates and employers' contributions to social insurance schemes, 'to improve the incentive to work'. However, it is also pressing for a pay freeze this year, arguing that competitiveness is under threat as a result of the previous centralised pay deals. 'All the evidence suggests that income settlements throughout Europe have fallen dramatically in the recent past and are continuing to do so. . . . in contrast, the position in Ireland has been one where significant real pay increases have been achieved over the last six years,' the IBEC says. Average industrial earnings in Ireland rose by 5 per cent last year, against an inflation rate of under 2 per cent, it says. The government for its part is also seeking a freeze on public sector pay this year, and plans to introduce work-sharing and voluntary work schemes for those on unemployment benefit.</p>

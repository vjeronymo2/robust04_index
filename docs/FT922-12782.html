			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Leading Article: A patchwork of a cabinet WITH THE junior ministerial appointments announced yesterday, Mr John Major's government is complete. It has a few newcomers, notably Mr Jonathan Aitken at defence and Mr Michael Mates at the Northern Ireland Office. Although most of the faces are familiar the direction of Britain's affairs is plainly under new management. This is the first administration since 1979 not to be constructed on foundations laid by Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Her influence, which persisted after she left office, is finally set aside. The full focus of public attention is now on the commanding presence of Mr Major. Since last Thursday's convincing election victory, he is very much in charge and the uncertainty that has characterised the government may be replaced by a greater sureness of touch. If the experience of the past 16 months is any guide the new cabinet's business will be undertaken on collegiate lines. The prime minister has taken particular care to carry his colleagues with him. Prior to the election, he had little option if he was to maintain party unity. Yet there is no reason to believe that his strategy of maintaining policy decisions within a Tory consensus will be discontinued now that he is in a position to reign supreme. He is supported by Mr Douglas Hurd, a superb foreign secretary, and Mr Norman Lamont, a chancellor who has come through the fire. Study in contrasts That said, the pattern presented by his particular choices is a study in contrasts. As chancellor, Mr Lamont will reassure the wing of the party that is sceptical about the benefits of European monetary union; as secretary for trade and industry, Mr Michael Heseltine will lead the charge of the pro-Europeans. As chief secretary to the Treasury, Mr Michael Portillo will have a reputation to enhance: his task will be to oversee an even more difficult public spending round than usual. The new secretaries for education and health, Mr John Patten and Mrs Virginia Bottomley, will expect generous settlements. Mr Patten will have a powerful case to argue for more money for education. Mrs Bottomley holds the prime minister's promise to increase spending on the NHS in real terms. Some of the appointments will remain intriguing, or puzzling, until the new ministers have served a while. Mr Kenneth Clarke should be a strong home secretary, able to tame the prison officers as he has the doctors and the teachers before them, but we have to see him do it. Making Mr Peter Lilley social security secretary could be merely to hide him away; alternatively Mr Lilley could apply his sharp mind to further reforms, especially in the area of pensions. He will need to temper his unsentimental economist's approach with visible social concern. Green credentials Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, is unquestionably on the right of the party. It would be a disservice to democracy if he continued the Thatcherite assault on local government. His green credentials have yet to be established, as indeed have those of the government as a whole. Mr Malcolm Rifkind is a clever minister whose plans for the privatisation of British Rail went awry. The Department of Defence will test his abilities; he will be required to display hitherto unrevealed strengths if he is to resist the determined assaults of the defence lobbyists. It cannot be said that the other appointments are all of a piece. Putting Mr David Mellor in as secretary for the national heritage, which includes the arts and broadcasting, is imaginative. To make Mr William Waldegrave minister for the Citizen's Charter is curious. His record as health secretary does not proclaim an ability to infuse the public with enthusiasm for a novel idea. Mr John Mac-Gregor will have to draw on more than the quiet doggedness he showed as education secretary if he is to disentangle BR from public ownership. Mr Ian Lang will do best as Scottish secretary if he can bridge the gap between the aspirations of the Scottish people and the fears of the prime minister. It would be a mistake to adduce the marginal increase in support in Scotland as a reason for refusing to rethink devolution. Building a consensus government out of such a diverse cabinet will test Mr Major's mettle.</p>

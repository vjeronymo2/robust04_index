Based on the daily reports of the republic's Defense  Ministry, we can say that the enemy offensives last week ended  in failure. The tension first arose on our borders with Armenia  and around Fizuli. But the enemy's hasty offensive did not  achieve its objective. Fizuli and Alikhanly were the targets of  this attack. The enemy was forced to retreat with losses. At  least 20 Armenian soldiers were killed near our positions around  Ashagi-Seyidakhmedly. The operations around Goradiz were also  successful. Our artillery destroyed two enemy vehicles full of  troops.    But all these events have not deterred the ferocious enemy  from pursuing its objective; only the zone of confrontation is  changing. The enemy is concentrating its real force and military  equipment on our northwestern borders. The settlements in  Tauzskiy and Kazakhskiy rayons have been coming under intensive  shelling for the last three days. The occupation army's acts  were not left unanswered. Despite shifts in the locus of its  attacks, the enemy is unable to resist our army's  counterattacks. As a result, Shirvanly and Garagashly in  Agdamskiy Rayon were liberated. Many other cities are awaiting  similar liberation and many cities still suffer the enemy's  occupation. But every inch of these lands is waiting and  relying on your effort and skill, O Azerbaijani soldier.</p>

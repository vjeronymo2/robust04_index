			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Highveld Steel and Vanadium announces fall HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, a subsidiary of the Anglo American group of South Africa, announced a 36 per cent fall in attributable earnings, to R95.6m in the year to December. Weak economic conditions caused demand to drop in domestic and export markets, writes Philip Gawith. Turnover dropped to R1.38bn from R1.43bn and pre-tax profits were down to R109.2m from R201.3m. A large cut in the tax bill reduced the impact on attributable earnings. The dividend was maintained at 70 cents per share despite a fall in earnings to 130 cents a share from 208.4 cents. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said the drop in earnings was the result of lower domestic and export volumes and lower export prices.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 27 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Ferhat Ataman on Friday [27 May] said that United Nations  officials have been contacted concerning the Turkish citizens  who have migrated to northern Iraq.    Ataman said that they should be given refugee status.    Calling the issue a new deception plan, he said Turkey has  repeatedly called for those who went there to return to Turkey,  adding the state is ready to welcome them.    On the clashes between rival northern Iraqi Kurdish clans,  he  said Turkey is continously suggesting to both sides to end the  conflict and that it is ready to welcome the leaders of both  sides for agreement talks in Turkey.    Ataman said humanitarian aid by Kizilay (Red Crescent) to  northern Iraq will continue in Dahuk and that because of the  clashes those to al-Sulaymaniyah and Irbil have stopped.</p>

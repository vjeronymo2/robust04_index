			<p>BFN     [Text] Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Prime  Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich held negotiations in Vienna today.  Local political observers deemed the recently established  contacts between the two countries' leaders as fruitful.  Austria supports the balanced political line of Belarus and its  moving toward achieving accord within the CIS, as well as  strengthening ties with both Russia and European states. During  the negotiations, emphasis was placed on ways of seeking new  forms of mutual cooperation; interest was also expressed in  expanding contacts in the areas of politics, economics, and  culture, according to an ITAR-TASS correspondent.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TENSIONS PUSH CRUDE FUTURES TO $30 A BARREL;  </P> <P> ENERGY: WHOLESALE PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE. OIL CARRIERS FIND WAYS AROUND THE  SANCTIONS ON IRAQ.  </P> <P> The rising tensions in the Middle East continued to push up wholesale energy  prices -- with crude oil jumping above $30 a barrel in futures trading.  </P> <P> In mid-afternoon trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October  contract for West Texas Intermediate -- the benchmark grade of U.S. crude --  was up $1.30, to $30.01.  </P> <P> The September contract for unleaded gasoline gained 2.44 cents, to $1.035 a  gallon, while home heating oil shot up 5.79 cents, to 89.50 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Oil prices edged higher in London on crisis jitters today. North Sea Brent  crude oil for October delivery was valued at $27.90 a barrel at midday, up from  Tuesday's $27.10.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some cargoes were transferred and tankers were being reflagged to  avoid economic sanctions against Iraq.  </P> <P> The Spanish oil company Compania Espanola de Petroleo SA said it planned to  transfer 126,000 tons of Nigerian crude oil from a barred Iraqi-flagged tanker  to another ship to allow the oil to be imported to a Canary Island refinery.  </P> <P> Spain's merchant marine had barred the Iraqi-flagged Almuntanabbi from Spanish  ports Monday, but a spokesman said today that the department agreed to the  transfer of the Nigerian crude to a "neutral" ship.  </P> <P> The Kuwaiti-flagged Triden Arrow, blocked Saturday by Spain from unloading  1,000 tons of Brazilian cotton in Barcelona, switched to the Liberian flag  Tuesday and was permitted to unload.  </P> <P> Six members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were  considering holding an informal meeting this weekend to discuss the turmoil in  the oil markets caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, sources close to the cartel  said today in Brussels.  </P> <P> Indonesia suggested that six of the 13 OPEC members gather in Vienna on Sunday  to examine the situation, according to the sources, who requested anonymity.  </P> <P> The sources stressed that no final decision had yet been made on whether to  meet.  </P> <P> "It may or may not be held," one source said. "If it is, it will be very, very  informal." No decisions could be made at the gathering, he said.  </P></p>

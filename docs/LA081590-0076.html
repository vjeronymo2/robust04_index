			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FIRES CLAIM FIRST LIFE AS RECOVERY BEGINS;  </P> <P> CLEANUP: THE WORST BEHIND THEM, CREWS TAKE INITIAL STEPS TOWARD REOPENING  YOSEMITE NEXT WEEK. ELSEWHERE A FONTANA FIREFIGHTER SUCCUMBS TO INJURIES.  </P> <P> Crews began clearing fire-weakened trees from alongside Yosemite roads Tuesday  as a first step toward reopening the park to visitors next week, while  elsewhere the rash of California wild-land blazes claimed a first life.  </P> <P> Firefighter Kenneth Earl Anslow, 20, died at a Chico hospital of injuries  suffered when he was hit by a falling tree limb on a fire line in Mendocino  National Forest. Anslow was from Fontana and worked for the Corona office of  the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, a state spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Also in Northern California, helicopter pilot Van Honeycutt suffered a broken  leg and other injuries when his aircraft crashed near Burney State Park while  helping fight fires in Shasta County.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Army troops from Ft. Carson, Colo., arrived to help fight the  state's wildfires, which have burned 210,000 acres since being touched off by  lightning earlier this month. About 1,200 soldiers may be used to support fire  efforts in California, officials said.  </P> <P> The biggest of the fires, in Tehama County, had burned across 115,000 acres in  the Sierra Nevada foothills, but was 80% contained within fire lines on  Tuesday, the state fire command center announced. A second, smaller fire in  Tehama County was 60% contained.  </P> <P> Fears that new dry-lightning storms would sweep along the length of the Sierra  Nevada on Tuesday and spark additional fires went unrealized, offering welcome  relief. More than 31,000 lightning bolts have struck the ground in California's  forests and brush lands since Aug. 3, according to electronic sensors that  report strikes to fire officers.  </P> <P> Fire officials say firefighting resources across the West have been severely  taxed by the flurry of blazes, which have been fed by timber and brush dried  out by four years of drought. Across the West, more than 22,000 firefighters  were on the lines.  </P> <P> Inside Yosemite National Park, 28 separate fires continue to smolder in the  back country, where conditions are severely dry despite unusual snow flurries  early this summer. But most of the Yosemite fires were being dismissed as  insignificant.  </P> <P> Only the largest -- which have burned through 22,000 acres of mostly pine  forest -- are receiving the focused attention of firefighters. The fire near  the Arch Rock entrance that destroyed 66 buildings in the mountain village of  Foresta had burned 17,000 acres, about half inside the park and half in  Stanislaus National Forest. It was 70% contained Tuesday.  </P> <P> Backfires set by firefighters to control the movement of the blaze were  responsible for most of the approximately 3,000 additional acres scorched in  the last day.  </P> <P> Two other fires in the park, in the Steamboat and Aspen Canyon areas, were  expected to be fully contained Thursday, rangers said.  </P> <P> The impact of the disastrous fires may linger for years to come in the form of  tumbling rocks, landslides and falling trees along Yosemite's major entrance  roads, park Supt. Michael Finley said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Potential danger to visitors is figuring heavily in considerations about when  to reopen Yosemite Valley, the park's most visited feature. More than 10,000  people a day in summer visit the valley, which has been all but empty since the  evacuation of campers and tourists Friday.  </P> <P> Workers began clearing trees and fallen snags from along the park's three  western entrance roads Tuesday. The fires left a trail of burned-out trees and  a covering of ash along state California 41, and the cleanup effort will  further alter the landscape in a way that will not be "aesthetic," Finley said.  </P> <P> "We cannot leave dead trees along the roads and we will be felling those,"  Finley said. "It's unfortunate but absolutely necessary for public safety."  </P> <P> Safety of visitors also is threatened by loosened rocks on the cliffs above the  entrance roads. The cliffs are normally bonded together by the roots of trees  that burned.  </P> <P> "We expect rock falls to be a real concern for years to come," Finley said.  "It's like you've had something held together with a rope and the rope has been  severed."  </P> <P> Finley said the Tioga Pass Road, a popular route across the Sierra Nevada, is  expected to reopen by the end of this week. Detailed plans for allowing  visitors back into Yosemite Valley next week will be announced today, he said.  </P> <P> Yosemite Park and Curry Co., the private concessionaire that runs lodging for  4,600 people in the valley, said it has offered those who held reservations  this week a chance to reschedule. They also can receive refunds, but will not  get special treatment for room reservations, which are in great demand in  summer.  </P> <P> "We're not going to compound problems by bumping someone else who has a  reservation," said John Poimoroo, vice president of communications. "That would  not be fair."  </P> <P> Poimoroo and some National Park Service officials fear that hordes of the  curious may clog major highways leading into the park after it reopens. He  pointed to the case of Yellowstone National Park, which endured a crush of  people wanting to see the effects of disastrous fires there two years ago.  </P> <P> "Yosemite is only different in that it has a lot more day traffic," Poimoroo  said. "We hope they hold off on day visits for a while."  </P> <P> Anticipating the public's return, park officials also made plans Tuesday to  return rangers, campground hosts, maintenance workers and even secretaries who  were pressed into fire duty back to their regular jobs.  </P> <P> Ranger Cherry Payne, who was temporarily assigned to the fire information  center in the valley, had to abandon preparations for Yosemite's centennial  celebration scheduled for Oct. 1.  </P> <P> "I haven't even paid attention to the celebration for a week," said Payne, in  charge of organizing the event. "My No. 1 priority was to get out invitations."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a hazardous-materials team continued to examine the remains of  structures in Foresta, where firefighters found exposed asbestos and evidence  of ruptured power transformers that may have contained toxic polychlorinated  biphenyls, or PCBs.  </P> <P> Roderick reported from Los Angeles and Sahagun from Yosemite. Times staff  writer Harold Maass also contributed to this story from Yosemite.  </P></p>

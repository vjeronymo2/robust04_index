			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Councils propose to redefine allowable octocorals to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> close a potential loophole that could allow harvest of live rock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as part of the 50,000 colony annual quota for allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> octocorals. The revised definition would include as allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> octocoral only a limited amount of the attached substrate_one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inch (2.54 cm) in the South Atlantic EEZ and 3 inches (7.62 cm)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Gulf EEZ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, a Federal permit for prohibited coral is issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only when the prohibited coral is for a scientific or educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose. The Councils propose to add restoration to the purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which these permits are available. This addition recognizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the benefits of habitat restoration following ship groundings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other environmental perturbations. The Councils also propose to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow the harvest of live rock under a Federal permit issued for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a scientific, educational, or restoration purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Councils propose to require permits for and reporting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wild live rock harvest during the phase-out periods in the Gulf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEZ off Florida north of Monroe County and in the South Atlantic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEZ south of the Dade/Broward County line. Permits would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to persons who legally participated in the fishery on or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to February 3, 1994, and to the number of vessels that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated in the commercial fishery for live rock on or prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 3, 1994, as documented on trip tickets received by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida Department of Environmental Protection prior to March 15,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994. The date of February 3, 1994, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 5179, February 3, 1994) as the control date for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entry into the commercial fishery for live rock. All commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landings of live rock have been permitted and reported under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida's permitting and reporting requirements. Those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements include a Saltwater Products License with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Restricted Species Endorsement and a Marine Life Endorsement, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the submission of trip tickets. These limitations on permits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to stabilize harvest during the phase-out period to near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1992 level and to limit participants to those already in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishery. To accomplish these intended effects, NMFS finds it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to identify owners with the requisite permit history  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the number of vessels, by owner, that operated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial fishery on or prior to the control date. Vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits would be issued to such owners in corresponding numbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Councils intend to allow and facilitate live rock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquaculture to replace the wild harvest. Amendment 2 proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an aquacultured live rock permit for the harvest and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possession of live rock from aquaculture operations in the Gulf  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEZ, under specific criteria designed to protect natural hard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottom areas as specified in this rule. The aquaculture permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would also authorize an exception to the prohibition on taking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and possession of otherwise prohibited corals. Otherwise, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquaculturist could be prevented from harvesting the aquaculture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product if small polyps of such species are detected on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 2 would establish a permit requirement for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvest and possession of live rock from aquaculture operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the South Atlantic EEZ, but aquaculture permits for this area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be issued only after appropriate criteria are developed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented through a subsequent rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both Councils have agreed that management of coral, coral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reefs, live rock, and any other part of the management unit in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FMP will be the responsibility of the Council in whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction it occurs. Under this arrangement, Amendment 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to eliminate the current requirement that both Councils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve all measures in any FMP amendment submitted for agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review. This requirement exists because the FMP was designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by NMFS as a joint management plan prepared by the two Councils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the South Atlantic Council has requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation of a separate FMP for the South Atlantic because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes (1) the habitats in the Gulf and South Atlantic are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different, (2) the resource does not move between the South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Atlantic and the Gulf, (3) it should have authority to coordinate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all habitat concerns and policies in the South Atlantic, (4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are additional management needs in the South Atlantic, (5)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Councils have different management philosophies, and (6) a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate FMP will improve timeliness of management adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reduce constituent costs. The Gulf Council concurs in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Atlantic's request. NMFS requests comments on the proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to separate the FMP into an FMP for the South Atlantic and an FMP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Gulf of Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

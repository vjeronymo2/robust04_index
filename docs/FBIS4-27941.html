			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Saowalakk Phumyaem] </F>   [Excerpt] Trials of an anti-Aids vaccine produced by a U.S.  company will begin on 30 volunteers today, the first such tests  in Thailand, a senior Red Cross official said.    Prof Praphan Phanuphak, director of the society's Aids  programme, said the volunteers will be inoculated with a  synthetic protein which resembles part of the HIV virus and  should generate an immunity to the disease.    Praphan said the UBI-1 candidate vaccine is produced by  United Biomedical Inc in the United States. The vaccine has been  tested experimentally in China and Australia, and on animals and  about 100 people in the United States.    The human trials in Thailand, the first of a four planned  programmes in developing countries, are under Prahpan's  direction, with supervision by Thai Red Cross Society  secretary-general Paen Wannamethi and Prof Supphawat Chutiwong,  dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Chulalongkon University.    The World Health Organization has approved tests of UBI-1 in  four developing countries -- Thailand, Brazil, Uganda and Rwanda.    Praphan said experiments overseas had shown the vaccine can  build a resistance to infection by the HIV virus, the forerunner  of Aids.    The production process for the vaccine was easy and  inexpensive.    The programme has been approved by an ethics committee of  the  Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkon University, and an Aids  research committee at the Public Health Ministry.    He said the trials are intended to determine if the vaccine  can generate anti-bodies in the blood or a protein that can  destroy the Aids virus in a test tube.    HIV-free volunteers were selected in April from applicants  aged 20-50 years old whose behaviour patterns mean they are not  prone to HIV infection. Pregnant women were not selected.    The volunteers, 25 men and 5 women, will be vaccinated three  times in the first, second and sixth months. Their immune system  will be checked eight months after the first vaccination.    Praphan said the volunteers will be divided into two groups  of 15 each. Only 12 will be inoculated with UBI-1 candidate  vaccine and the rest will get a placebo.    Some of the 12 will receive 100 microgrammes of the vaccine  and the others 500 microgrammes, to enable a comparison of the  effects.    Those who receive the vaccine will all test "positive", but  they will not actually be infected with HIV and hospitals could  identify the difference.    The volunteers are being provided with cards stating that  their blood will test positive for two years after the end of  the experiment.    He said half of the 30 volunteers have a bachelor or masters  degree and 70-80 per cent are frequent blood donors. About half  of them have already donated their bodies to medical research  once they die.    The volunteers are from varying occupations. They include  taxi drivers, soldiers, police, engineers, nurses, teachers,  lawyers and a Buddhist monk. [passage omitted]</p>

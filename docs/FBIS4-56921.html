			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] Preliminary Electoral Tribunal [TE] election returns  indicate that, so far, there are no clear winners in 12 of the  71 Legislative Assembly seats that were up for grabs in the 8  May elections. So far, the opposition United People Alliance  has won 24 seats and the official Democratic Alliance has won 19.    According to preliminary returns, Democratic Revolutionary  Party [PRD] candidates have won 21 seats in the legislature,  while its allies, the Liberal Republican Party and Labor Party,  won two seats and one seat, respectively. Another 12 seats are  still being disputed, 11 of them between PRD and Arnulfist Party  [PA] candidates.    With 68 percent of the votes counted -- some 733,885 valid  votes -- the PA has won 12 seats; the Liberal Party has won  three; the Authentic Liberal Party has won three; and the  Independent Democratic Union [UDI] has won one.    The Change '94 coalition, which supported the candidacy of  former Comptroller General Ruben Carles, has won 8 legislative  seats -- five by Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement  (Molirena) candidates and three by candidates from the Civic  Renewal Party.    The legislative elections also resulted in the surprising  defeat of the National Renewal Movement, which, despite its  costly advertising campaign, failed to win a single seat. TE  projections show that even Marco Ameglio, former president of  the parliament, failed to get reelected.    The Christian Democratic Party was dealt the harshest blow  during the elections, winning only one legislative seat, thereby  losing the relative majority obtained in the 1989 elections with  28 legislators. Ruben Blades' Papa Egoro Movement [MPE] won six  seats, and the Solidarity Party [PS] won one seat.    TE President Eduardo Valdes said projections show the PRD  could win 11 more seats and the PA could win one. "From that  total, 11 seats might go to the PRD and one to the PA," Valdes  indicated. He stated, however, that the Molirena, UDI, PS, or  the MPE might win one of the 11 seats that are virtually in the  hands of the PRD.</p>

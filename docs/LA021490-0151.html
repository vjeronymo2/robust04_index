			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EDUCATION;  </P> <P> BLACK SUPT. GETS BOOT IN BOSTON  </P> <P> The Boston School Committee found itself in another racial controversy today  after it voted to oust Laval Wilson, the system's first black superintendent,  in a move one supporter likened to a "lynching."  </P> <P> In a stormy meeting Tuesday night, the School Committee, which fought  court-imposed busing in the 1970s, voted 7 to 1 to negotiate to buy out the  remainder of Wilson's contract.  </P> <P> The committee's four black members and one white committee member walked out of  the meeting and refused to participate in the vote.  </P> <P> "There are certain members who cannot deal with a strong black man as the  leader of the Boston public schools," said John O'Bryant, a senior black  committee member.  </P> <P> Several committee members who voted to buy out Wilson's contract said their  decision was based on the superintendent's job performance and failure to  communicate with various groups within the school system.  </P></p>

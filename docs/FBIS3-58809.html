			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 23 (AFP) -- The European Community has  proposed a draft agreement to cut overproduction of aluminium,  with regard especially to Russian exports of the metal, at talks  here, an EC spokesman said Sunday [23 January].    EC negotiator Joern Keck, who chaired the January 18-21  talks, said the draft memorandum of understanding should lead to  cuts in overproduction of aluminium, which amounts to up to two  million tonnes annually on a total of 18 million tonnes.    Details of the accord were not released, pending a response  from the EC nations, Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia and the  United States, which were asked to make their views known by  next Friday.    The participants to the talks here agreed to meet again in  Canada at the end of February, an EC spokesman said. The  Brussels talks finished on Friday, but it took two days to  prepare the memorandum, he added.    The European Commission, the executive arm of the Community,  said that participants at the Brussels talks were "conscious  that transparency and the availability of full and comprehensive  data are essential for sound commercial decisions."    They agreed that the International Primary Aluminium  Institute (IPAI) offered the "most effective mechanism" and  Russia, in particular, had begun taking steps to cooperate fully  with the IPAI, furnishing data with a view to membership, the  statement added.    Other participating nations expressed readiness to help  Russian industry in the process of integration into the world  aluminium market on the basis of fair competition and high  environmental standards, the statement said.    Overproduction of aluminium, especially following a massive  rise in Russian exports, has led to a sharp decline in world  market prices for the metal and an increase in stocks, which  currently amount to more than three times world consumption.    Between 1990 and 1993, Russian exports grew five-fold from  300,000 tonnes a year to 1.5 million at particularly low prices.    The EC has decided to limit imports from Russia to 180,000  tonnes per year, including 45,000 tonnes for the period November  30, 1993, to February 28, 1994.    At the negotiations, the Russians called for the threshold  to  be raised to 320,000 tonnes, but agreed to revise their figures  in exchange for financial and technical aid to restructuring and  modernising the industry.    The talks here followed two previous rounds in Moscow and  Washington at the end of last year that failed to lead to an  agreement. On Friday, U.S. trade representative Mickey Kantor  called on the European nations to show more flexibility with  regard to imports from Russia.</p>

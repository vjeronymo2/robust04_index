			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY BUCKLES DOWN ON SEAT BELT LAW  </P> <P> In an effort to persuade drivers to buckle up, Huntington Beach police plan to  start a special enforcement program next week along Beach Boulevard.  </P> <P> Officer Dave Humphreys said the city's team of motorcycle officers will post  additional signs warning drivers that they are entering a special traffic law  enforcement zone and advising them to make sure their seat belts are on.  </P> <P> "We're pushing this whole concept throughout the department. We going to push  this seat belt issue this whole year," Humphreys said.  </P> <P> The traffic law enforcement team has operated for months primarily as an  education tool to encourage motorists to slow down and drive more safely. While  motorists are pulled over for even the slightest infractions, they are usually  simply given warnings and a pamphlet.  </P> <P> State law prevents police from stopping drivers because of a seat belt  violation. But Humphreys said if the team's officers find unbuckled motorists  who were stopped for other reasons, they most likely will be ticketed.  </P> <P> The new seat belt program is scheduled to start Tuesday on Beach Boulevard  between the San Diego Freeway and Warner Avenue. The zone will be posted with  signs reading, "Seat Belt On?" and "Buckle Up!"  </P> <P> First-time seat belt offenders must pay fines of $20 plus court costs. CHRIS  WOODYARD  </P></p>

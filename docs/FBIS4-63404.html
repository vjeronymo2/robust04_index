			<p>BFN     [Text] The current crisis in Russia is unprecedented in  world history and is characterized by the geopolitical, social  and moral break-up of society, said leader of the Communist  Party of Russia, Gennadiy Zyuganov, addressing students and  professors of Moscow University Thursday.    He said that operating in Russia is the regime of colonial  democracy where the U.S. dollar dominates, English is commonly  used and Russian culture is deteriorating. Zyuganov believes  that events are developing in Russia along three lines: Russia  is turning into a mafiosi-criminal state, the country is on the  brink of a civil war or the coalition of left-wing and patriotic  forces may come to power.    Stressing that a civil war in a country which has 27,000  nuclear warheads could cause a catastrophe, Zyuganov expressed  hope that the situation will develop along the third channel.  He said that representatives of the Communists, the Agrarian  Party and other opposition organizations had managed to stand at  the head of local bodies of power in 70 territories of the  Russian federation.    He said that only a "constructive program" could become the  basis for civic peace in Russia. Such a program would include a  change of political course, with priority given to power  engineering, agriculture, science and culture, combating crime,  the elimination of social inequality, the scrapping of  privatization and the restoration of the Union.    He believes that the country is now like a nuclear reactor  which is being overused. Under these conditions, he said,  operators must be sure to press the right buttons at the right  moment, otherwise there may be an explosion, said Zyuganov.    He also gave a characterization of certain well-known  politicians. He said that Yegor Gaydar had settled into the  wrong office and found himself unable to look out the window and  introduce corrections in the course of reforms.    Anatoliy Chubays, he said, deceived everybody with the  privatization campaign and is "now selling out Russia wholesale  and retail." He said that later generations will denounce  Gennadiy Burbulis for being the cause of the Soviet Union's  break-up.    Zyuganov said that the state post was too difficult a job  for  Ruslan Khasbulatov. And that only at the second stage of his  political career he understood his mistakes but it was too late  to correct them.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy resembles a younger brother of Boris  Nikolayevich Yeltsin and in essence the LDP platform differs  little from what the present executive power is doing, he said.    Zyuganov also said that at the moment the Communist Party  has  550,000 members which is two times more than in all other  parties. The scale of public opinion leans to the left, he  emphasized.    About 500 people listened to the speech by the leader of the  Communist Party leader. Two-thirds of the audience were elderly  people rather than students, despite taking place in the Moscow  State University..</p>

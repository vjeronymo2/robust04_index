			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Abacha faces test on reform: Nigerian budget offers chance to point the way The first budget speech of Nigeria's new head of state General Sani Abacha, delayed since New Year's Day and now expected on Sunday, may be his only chance to convince observers at home and abroad that he is serious about economic reform. Nigerian budgets have been more notable for good intentions than accurate forecasting. In a candid budget speech a year ago, Mr Ernest Shonekan, the last prime minister under General Ibrahim Babangida's regime, said: 'The lack of fiscal discipline is the bane of our economy.' He looked forward to eight months of spending restraint in preparation for the handover to elected civilian rule in August. If Mr Shonekan's interim national government had lasted until now, he could have made the same speech, pointing to even worse figures. Both the promised fiscal controls and the democratic handover were quickly discarded as Gen Babangida increased extra-budgetary spending to try to buy an extended term of office. Mr Pius Okigbo, a former economic adviser to the government, reflected the mood of many in Lagos when he complained last month that Nigeria's per capita income was now lower on some estimates than it was in 1965, before Nigeria had any oil revenue. Inflation is near 100 per cent and the year-end budget deficit is estimated at N75.3bn (Pounds 2.5bn), two and a half times the forecast deficit, two-thirds of budgeted revenue and 15 per cent of gross domestic product. Gen Abacha's government, Nigeria's fourth in just more than a year, is in its second month but lacks an economic policy. The extension of military rule has brought condemnation and a ban on fresh aid from western donors. And unless Nigeria makes progress in reducing its citizens' role in the illicit traffic in drugs, the US could vote against International Monetary Fund and World Bank funding for Nigeria after next April. The military takeover has delayed talks with the IMF until after the budget, probably mid-month, which could have been the key to long-awaited relief for its Dollars 33bn external debt. After two years of default, Nigeria's arrears to its main creditor, the Paris Club of official creditors, stand at Dollars 6bn and the payments crisis is now threatening the country's only big source of revenue, oil exports. Bad debts at the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation are mortgaging the country's falling revenue. The arrears have passed the Dollars 500m limit beyond which its joint venture international partners are entitled to recover the funds in allocations of crude oil. The NNPC is liable for arrears to foreign contractors running into billions of dollars for projects which are over-budget and may never yield a return on capital. The NNPC's failure to maintain its refineries has forced up fuel imports and the company has used nearly Dollars 2bn of petroleum revenue to cover its losses from selling domestic fuel at heavily subsidised prices. Nor can the government afford to bail out the NNPC. Every day that the oil price stands at Dollars 14 a barrel, Nigeria earns Dollars 6.3m less than it had budgeted and the 1993 total oil revenue will fall about Dollars 800m short of the forecast Dollars 6.3bn. Despite the depressed oil market, Nigeria has the resources to turn its economy around. The new finance minister Mr Kalu I. Kalu favours a package of reforms which would be the basis for a medium-term programme to be agreed by the IMF leading to debt relief and fresh funds. The plan would involve a 'realistic rate' for the naira through a devaluation of the official rate, low inflation, and balanced budgets through cuts in spending, fuel price increases and tax reform. Cuts in bureaucracy and corruption, especially in customs and foreign exchange procedures, would be aimed at increasing growth and inward investment. The plan also would involve reduction of the NNPC's expenditure on joint ventures, possibly through a cut in the government stake, privatisation of all the big parastatal companies, and withdrawal from all industrial projects which could be run by the private sector or cancelled. There are opponents to reform in the cabinet in spite of the fact that distortions in the foreign exchange and domestic fuel markets deprive the government of about Dollars 60m at the weekly exchange auctions and much of its 300,000 barrels a day of refined products through smuggling. The opponents argue that the foreign exchange reforms would be inflationary and those to the fuel price system would be harmful to ordinary Nigerians. Private sector advisers warn that, if Mr Kalu does not win the argument, there may be a return to the system of import licences and foreign exchange allocations which would make Gen Babangida's regime seem like a heyday for market reforms.</p>

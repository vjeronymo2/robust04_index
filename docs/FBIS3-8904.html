			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 16 (TANJUG) -- President Slobodan  Milosevic of Serbia and Russian President's special envoy and  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin discussed in Belgrade on  Wednesday the peace process for the former Yugoslavia, the  Russian initiatives and conditions for a political settlement of  the crisis. Russia's efforts for disputes to be resolved  peacefully, through talks and impartial mediation by the  international community, were assessed as positive.    Milosevic and Churkin said they expected commitment to peace  to be the essential feature of the further negotiations on the  former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and set out that  commitment to peace was a basis for the reaching of a political  agreement and the fulfillment of the national and state  interests of the three warring sides.    Before meeting with Milosevic, Churkin conferred with  presidents Radovan Karadzic of the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.)  and Milan Martic of the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK). The talk  with Martic was part of a new Russian initiative for peace on  the RSK territory, which is a U.N. protected area (UNPA).  Churkin said after meeting with Martic that representatives of  Croatia and the (republic of) Serb Krajina would meet at the  Russian Embassy in Zagreb on March 22 to discuss the cessation  of hostilities. Churkin said he felt it was impossible to  resolve the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict without resolving the  Croatia-Krajina problem.    The RSK was created in 1991 out of the predominantly  Serb-populated areas within the administrative borders of the  former Yugoslav republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's  secession and the attempt of its authorities to reduce the Serb  people to a national minority. The RSK was proclaimed a U.N.  protected area (UNPA) in March last year.</p>

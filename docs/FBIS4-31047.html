			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] official Andrea  Angeli, who was arrested a few days ago at the aggressor's  checkpoint on Kasindol Street, between the Sarajevo airport and  the town center, was released from the aggressor's barracks in  Lukavica shortly before midnight last night. The remaining four  detainees continue to be imprisoned in the barracks, it was  reported today. [passage omitted]    We will continue to negotiate for their release, Major Rob  Annink said today, and added that UNPROFOR does not know why the  Serbian aggressor detained these four people or what he had  accused them of.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFICA EDGES FULLERTON, 24-20; TUSTIN IS NEXT  </P> <P> Quarterback Chris Castellano connected with wide receiver Scott Lesser on a  five-yard pass play with 6 minutes 59 seconds remaining to give Pacifica High  School a 24-20 victory over Fullerton in a Division VI first-round playoff game  Friday night.  </P> <P> Pacifica (8-3) advances to a second-round game next weekend against Tustin.  </P> <P> Pacifica took a 2-0 lead on a safety when Fullerton's David Chacon fielded a  punt at his own one-yard line and tried to escape the Mariner coverage by  running around the end zone, only to be met by Pacifica's Kevin Harbour.  </P> <P> But Fullerton (8-3) responded with two touchdowns, taking a 14-2 lead.  </P> <P> The Indians scored on a nine-yard run by David Chacon and on a one-yard bootleg  by his twin brother, quarterback Daniel Chacon.  </P> <P> David Chacon set up the second Fullerton touchdown by intercepting a Castellano  pass at the Fullerton 35-yard line and returning it 51 yards.  </P> <P> But Pacifica closed the gap to 14-9 on a one-yard keeper by Castellano with 39  seconds left in the half. That touchdown came aftera pass interference and a  personal foul call against David Chacon, who was playing safety, on a pass  intended for Lesser. The penalties gave Pacifica a first-and-10 at the  Fullerton 14.  </P> <P> Fullerton continued the see-saw battle with a three-yard touchdown run by D.C.  Olsen in the third quarter, but Pacifica mounted its final, decisive comeback.  </P> <P> Pacifica's Derek Nicholson, who had 66 yards in 17 carries, scored from two  yards out, and Castellano hit Chris Maroney on the two-point conversion to cut  Fullerton's lead to 20-17.  </P> <P> Four minutes later, Castellano connected with Lesser for the winning touchdown.  </P> <P> Castellano completed 14 of 20 passes for 138 yards, but was intercepted three  times.  </P> <P> Daniel Chacon was 12 of 24 for 167 yards.  </P></p>

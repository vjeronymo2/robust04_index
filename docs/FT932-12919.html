			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Deal soon on Leyland trucks A Pounds 40m-plus deal, including the management buy-out of Leyland Daf's Lancashire truck factory, is expected to be finalised this week following agreement over the week end by Barclays Development Capital to provide all the equity finance. An equity injection of Pounds 5m was the final piece needed to complete a complicated package involving the company's management, clearing banks, Barclays Development Capital and Lancashire Enterprises. Coopers and Lybrand, the management's principal adviser, will today start what it hopes will be final negotiations with Arthur Andersen, the Leyland Daf receiver. The aim is to complete the deal before Friday. If successful, the buy out would secure the 900 jobs remaining at the truck factory in Leyland, Lancashire. Nearly 1,200 jobs have been lost there since Daf's parent company in the Netherlands went into receivership in February. If the factory was to close, it would leave a gap in Daf's range of trucks in Europe. Under the deal now proposed by Coopers, Lancashire Enterprises - the privatised industrial development arm of Lancashire County Council - would buy the 230-acre site and 1.8m sq ft complex of factory buildings from the receiver. It would then lease back 800,000 sq ft of factory space to the truck company's management - which is all the truckmaker says it will need - and develop the rest as a science and technology park. The values of individual elements of the deal have not been disclosed but Mr Tony Hyams, director of the Manchester office of Barclays Development Capital, put the total between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m. Management would buy the business and other assets - such as equipment, stock and work-in-progress - needed to run it, but would be free of the burden of having to buy land and buildings, the bulk of which it does not need. Most of the management's deal would be financed with bank loans. It has been talking with Barclays and NatWest. The package envisages deferred terms for the buyout, involving a large down payment, of which the equity injection is an important element. Staged payments would follow over several months, funded from cash flow. The company has sufficient contracts with the British Ministry of Defence and Daf dealers throughout Europe to guarantee future payments, provided it can keep trading. Lancashire Enterprises is confident about marketing the site, which is strategically well-placed near the M6 motorway south of Preston. There is a large pool of skilled local labour because of the concentration of delining and defence industries in the area Mrs Louise Ellman, leader of Lancashire county council and deputy chairman of Lancashire Enterprises, said: 'This deal would maintain truck production in the area and safeguard thousands of jobs among suppliers, many of whom are locally-based.'</p>

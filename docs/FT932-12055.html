			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: UK machine tool maker wins Pounds  1/2 m China order THE British machine tool company FMT has won a Pounds 500,000 order from China 18 months after losing a much bigger one because of changes in the UK's Aid and Trade Provision (ATP). The Brighton-based company will supply its latest horizontal spindle machining centre to Linyi, a manufacturer of heavy earthmoving equipment based in Shandong province. The deal is a consolation for Mr Mike Bright, FMT's chairman, following the loss of a Pounds 3.5m contract with Linyi. In a series of exchanges in 1991 with the department of trade and industry, Mr Bright had protested about ATP funds being disallowed for the contract. It fell foul of the department's decision to concentrate scarce ATP resources on basic infrastructural projects in developing countries rather than those designed to increase manufacturing capacity. An Austrian company eventually won that contract. The latest order is self-financed by Linyi, said Mr Bright, and continues FMT's long-standing co-operation with China, one of the few machine tool markets to grow strongly last year. Mr Bright, known for his robust views, said he was 'extremely concerned' by the level of funding being made available to German machine tool makers for contracts in China, to compensate them for the domestic recession. FMT's contract comes as Birmingham-based Cincinnati Milacron announced a Pounds 3m co-production and technology transfer deal with the China National Machining Import and Export Corporation and the Beijing Machinery &amp; Electricity Institute. It involves the Sabre 750 machining centre, which the US-owned company developed and produces in Britain. Cincinnati will be supplying a complete model and a number of kits and will transfer manufacturing technology for the Sabre 750 and a larger Sabre machine. The company said the deal was a significant step in its far eastern marketing activity. It hopes for further agreements as other Sabre models are produced.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BRITON SENTENCED BY IRAN AS A SPY  </P> <P> A Briton jailed in Iran for more than three years on spying charges has been  sentenced, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said today.  </P> <P> The report did not specify the penalty against Roger Cooper, 52, but quoted  Iranian Intelligence Minister Mohammed Mohammedi-Reyshahri as saying a "heavy  ruling" had been issued.  </P> <P> He said Cooper, a businessman who had worked in Iran for more than 30 years,  confessed to spying and "nothing could halt this case." Cooper worked in key  Iranian government agencies since 1958 and began spying for Britain in 1966,  Mohammedi-Reyshahri said. He was arrested in November, 1985, and his continued  detention has been a source of tension between Britain and Iran.  </P></p>

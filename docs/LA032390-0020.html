			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ROHRABACHER'S OIL STANCE CRITICIZED  </P> <P> With chagrin I read about Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's (R-Lomita) current  pro-offshore oil-drilling stand. This lack of concern for the environment, this  utter disregard for his constituents' wishes, this unconscionable about-face,  (his office was contacted before his election and we were assured of his  anti-drilling stance) exhibit extremely poor judgment and disqualify him as our  representative in Congress.  </P> <P> Mr. Rohrabacher has been ill-advised. Voters are independent thinkers and  cannot be led by the nose, regardless of party affiliation. The matter of  offshore oil-drilling is of vital importance to us. Unless Rep. Rohrabacher  clearly restates his position, it is with great regret that, for the first time  in decades, my family and many fellow concerned Republicans will have to vote  for a Democrat.  </P> <P> STELLA LaROSE  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

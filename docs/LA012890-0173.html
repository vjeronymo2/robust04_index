			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT PRO-AM GOLF TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> CLAAR SCORES CLEAR VICTORY, WINNING BY 5  </P> <P> Brian Claar shot a four-under-par 67 Saturday to win the 16th Newport Pro-Am  golf tournament by five strokes over Jeff Hart at the Newport Beach Country  Club.  </P> <P> Claar had five birdies and a bogey Saturday for a two-day total of 133. He  collected $10,000 of the tournament's $50,000 purse.  </P> <P> "My bogey on 11 kicked me in the butt and got me to play well," said Claar, 30,  of Tampa, Fla. "I felt pretty solid all day, missing only two greens.  </P> <P> "The wind came up in the afternoon and the course played exactly the opposite  of how it played Friday."  </P> <P> Claar took the lead by four strokes with a birdie on the par-four 16th. On the  par-three 17th, his sand shot hit the pin and dropped five feet from the hole.  </P> <P> "When those things start happening, you know you're going to win golf  tournaments," he said.  </P> <P> Claar's victory this weekend was his second of the season. He won a pro-am by  seven strokes earlier this month in the Bahamas.  </P> <P> Claar also has earned a spot in this year's Masters by finishing fifth in the  1989 U.S. Open.  </P> <P> Hart, who tied for second in last year's tournament, struggled to a one-over 72  for a total of 138, good for $6,000. His double bogey on the par-four seventh  dropped him two strokes off the lead.  </P> <P> "The double obviously hurt a lot," said Hart, 29, of Solana Beach, Calif. "I  just couldn't get it going today. I didn't hit the driver well or putt well.  I'm glad it's over."  </P> <P> In the pro-am competition, two-time Newport winner John McComish and George  Argyros finished in a three-way tie for first with pro Kent Kluba and Peter  Foulke, and Hart and Michael Drucker.  </P> <P> After matching cards, McComish and Argyros were awarded the top honors and will  compete in the Tournament of Champions Pro-Am at La Costa next January.  </P></p>

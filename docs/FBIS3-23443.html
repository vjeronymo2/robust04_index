In a statement in London, it said: "The  murder was planned by the Turkish National Security Council and  carried out by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization's  agents." The front also claimed that it will definitely  retaliate.  <H5>  Yeoryiadhis Acted Like a Militant </H5>   Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, who was known for coordinating PKK  activities in south Cyprus, established the Committee of  Solidarity With Kurdistan in 1988. As a Turkologist who spoke  Turkish very well, he worked as a member of the Greek Cypriot  secret service organization until he was appointed head of the  PIO Turkish Department.    Yeoryiadhis visited the PKK camp in the al-Biqa' Valley  together with several Greek Cypriot deputies in 1990. In a  statement made in that camp, he claimed that the Kurds and the  Greek Cypriots shared a similar fate.    As the head of the Committee of Solidarity With Kurdistan,  Yeoryiadhis was invited to attend the PKK's activities in Europe  as a "guest of honor." He leveled serious accusations against  Turkey when he addressed the "Kurdish festivals" in Bochum and  Frankfurt.    Yeoryiadhis organized campaigns on the Greek Cypriot side to  support the PKK several times. He also opened bank accounts for  donations to provide funds for the PKK.    Yeoryiadhis refused to be interviewed by the Turkish  newspapers for a long time. However, he agreed to make a  statement to HURRIYET in December 1993. Stelios Vervirakis,  HURRIYET correspondent in Athens, interviewed him at the time.  Some of the views he expressed were as follows:    1. The PKK will definitely destroy the Turkish State.    2. The Cyprus problem can be resolved only after the Turkish  State is destroyed. Meanwhile, the Armenians will be relieved.    3. I have problems with the Cyprus Government because of my  links to the PKK and other Kurdish organizations. The Turkish  Cypriot newspapers have declared war against me.    4. A PKK camp does not exist in Cyprus. PKK leader Abdullah  Ocalan has not visited the island. I would have been the first  to be informed of his arrival. Turkish and Kurdish refugees  cross from north Cyprus to south Cyprus. However, a provision  on "refugee status" does not exist in south Cyprus. So, they  are returned or dispatched to Syria or sent to prison.    5. Abdullah Ocalan is a great leader. He travels to  wherever he wishes to go. He has fascinating capabilities. He  is definitely not a stupid person. I can help anyone who wishes  to talk to him, that is, if he agrees.</p>

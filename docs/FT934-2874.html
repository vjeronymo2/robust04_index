			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Change to Serps rebates proposed Tax rebates to encourage contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme should grow as individuals age, in order to prevent them from re-entering the state scheme, a government paper proposed yesterday. The proposals have concerned life insurance companies because the present system of flat-rate rebates has boosted sales of personal pensions to young people. Flat-rate rebates - where personal pension holders aged under 30 are entitled to an additional rebate of National Insurance contributions - allow young people to buy better pension benefits than if they remained in Serps. The life industry estimates that one-half to two-thirds of all personal pensions rely solely on the National Insurance contribution rebate for financing. The Department of Social Security estimates that only 750,000 of Britain's 5m personal pension policyholders are aged 40 or over. In its paper, the department outlines three options for setting age-related rebates: an incrementally larger rebate as individuals age; banding several ages with a single rebate rate; or a hybrid scheme combining both options. The government is seeking comments on its proposals by January 15. The paper notes that any move to age-related rebates would increase the administrative burdens of pension providers by requiring them to keep documentary evidence of each scheme member's age. The first option, that of setting a different tax rebate for each age, is the fairest, according to the document, and the most cost-effective for the government in that it could ensure that personal pensions were attractive to all age groups. But administering 49 separate tax-rebate structures could 'place a significant new burden on business' for employer-sponsored schemes. The second option, age bands of, for example, five years, might create a situation where individuals found it advantageous to switch periodically between Serps and private provision. That would also raise some issues of 'best advice' required under the Financial Services Act for financial advisers, although the burden on employer-sponsored schemes would be lower than under the first option. A hybrid scheme could operate by having two broad age bands and continuing a flat-rate rebate for people under 35 years. Five-year age bands would apply to those over 35. The scheme would ensure that the majority of working people would find a non-state pension attractive. Retiring hurt, Page 10</p>

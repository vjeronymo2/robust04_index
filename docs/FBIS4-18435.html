			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] An article in the 15 March Athens daily  ELEVTHEROTIPIA reports that Minister of National Economy Yiorgos  Yennimatas has been "admirable" during his bout with cancer and  has followed a therapy that has seemingly failed to stop the  spread of the disease. His condition has been treated with  utmost discretion by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and the  government. According to repeated statements, there will be no  government shuffle without the personal approval of Yennimatas,  who will himself decide whether to retain his ministry.    According to a brief article in the 16 March Athens daily I  KATHIMERINI, no intragovernmental changes will occur unless  Yennimatas himself requests them, for he is "precious capital"  for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and enjoys  everyone's respect. This is only natural, for during  Papandreou's illness some years ago "no one dared propose" he  should resign for health reasons.    In the course of speculating in the 20 March Athens weekly  TO  VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS on the identity of the most likely candidates  to a future PASOK leadership, I.K. Pretenderis also notes that  the expected move of ailing Yiorgos Yennimatas to the post of  deputy prime minister would leave his present position vacant.  Probable replacements for Yennimatas could be PASOK luminary  Ioannis Pottakis, who, according to Pretenderis, enjoys the  support of Andonis Livanis, deputy minister at the Prime  Minister's Office; and Bank of Greece Governor Ioannis Boutos,  who is well liked in the Papandreou entourage, Pretenderis  notes. Another potential candidate, Minister of Industry and  Commerce Kostas Simitis, would refuse to leave his ministry, and  it is also unlikely that Papandreou would appoint him minister  of national economy. While possessing the necessary  qualifications, PASOK deputy Vaso Papandreou's "cool" relations  with the prime minister would preclude her appointment. A third  candidate, Minister of National Defense Yerasimos Arsenis would  be "unacceptable" to both Papandreou and other members of the  party, Pretenderis continues. This impasse is perhaps the reason  why alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos is  promoting his own candidacy in spite of knowing that Papandreou  would not release him while Greece is European Union (EU)  president, Pretenderis concludes.    According to Nikos Nikolaou writing in the 20 March TO VIMA  TIS KIRIAKIS, while the PASOK parliamentary group and the party  seem to prefer Pottakis, a Boutos appointment enjoys important  support and would be well received in domestic and foreign  economic circles. If Boutos wins, his most likely successors at  the Bank of Greece would be Pan. Poulis and Pan. Korliras,  governors of the Commercial Bank and the Ionian Bank  respectively.</p>

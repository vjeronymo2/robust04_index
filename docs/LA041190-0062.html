			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEAR MASCOT  </P> <P> In only a few short weeks, the community of Big Bear, overcome by Cocomania,  has given the public an education unsurpassed in local history (Part A, March  27).  </P> <P> It has taught us that misguided passion (not to be confused with compassion)  has united residents and politicians alike, openly disregarding state laws and  demeaning and threatening those who enforce them.  </P> <P> It has maximized tourism through the sales of T-shirts and beverages topped  with gummy bears and littered mountain roads with distracting signs. Using this  rationale, the town insists the best interest of an innocent bear cub is to  remain in Big Bear Valley as their mascot.  </P> <P> A proposed 2-to-4 acre "natural habitat" would deprive Coco of her territorial  needs and freedom to fulfill her natural instincts, becoming frustrated and  confused as she matures. Captive bears teach us nothing about the behavior of  wild bears.  </P> <P> Wildlife is property of the state -- including citizens outside of the mountain  resort communities. The funds and energy spent to keep the cub in Big Bear  Valley would be better served preserving critical wildlife habitat, and  improving facilities for the nearby Moonridge Animal Park bears, adopting one  of the bears already in captivity as their mascot.  </P> <P> JERYE MOONEY  </P> <P> Coordinator, Los Angeles  </P> <P> The Fund for Animals Inc.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1800 GMT on 23 February carries in  its regular 31-minute newscast two reports updating the  situation on the Maglaj and Gornji Vakuf fronts.    Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the  coordinated chetnik and Croatian Defense Council soldiers'  attacks at Maglaj continue unabated in the evening hours. After  the infantry attacks were repelled, constant bombardment of the  civilian population and defense lines from howitzers, tanks, and  mortars resumed. This is one of the hardest days of the war on  the Maglaj front, yet it is just the beginning of a large-scale  and long-term offensive. This is confirmed by the constant  influx of chetnik reinforcements from Modrica, Doboj, Banjluka,  and the concentration of tanks in (?Tulnica), Medjici, and  Brankovci. The soldiers and the people of Maglaj are resolved  to defend their town and they will fight to the end."    Gornji Vakuf correspondent Atif Agic reports that "sudden  shelling from mortars and tanks was registered in the village of  Privora in the vicinity of Gornji Vakuf, and it was accompanied  by constant antiaircraft gun, antiaircraft machine gun, and  sniper fire. Of course, the Gornji Vakuf town center was not  spared. It was shelled from 60-mm and 82-mm mortars. The  ustashas also shelled the residential buildings in the village  of Purici with recoilless guns and mortars. The defense lines  are stable."</p>

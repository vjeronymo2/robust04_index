			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SHRINES OF BUDDHA;  </P> <P> TEMPLES: BUDDHISTS ARE VISITING HIGHLAND PARK SANCTUARIES TO COMMEMORATE THE  PURIFICATION OF BUDDHA.  </P> <P> Except for the colorful paper lanterns and large statue of the mother of Buddha  in its front yard, the narrow house on North Figueroa Street in Highland Park  hardly merits a second look.  </P> <P> Such details might merely indicate Asian occupants. But the wooden bungalow in  the 6800 block of Figueroa houses a Buddhist shrine.  </P> <P> It is headquarters for the Pureland Lotus Community, an organization of  Vietnamese Buddhists.  </P> <P> This is not the only Buddhist sanctuary inconspicuously nestled among  Western-style houses, apartments and small businesses in northeast Los Angeles.  Down the street about two miles, at Figueroa and Avenue 52, is the Mystic  Dharma temple. A few blocks west in the 900 block of Terrace 49, on Mt.  Washington, is the Kanzeonji Zen house of prayer.  </P> <P> The three temples represent divergent strains of Buddhism from Vietnam, China  and Japan. This week the faithful of all three are visiting their shrines to  commemorate one of Buddhism's most important events, the purification of  Buddha.  </P> <P> Although the rituals at each shrine may vary, worshipers usually come bearing  offerings of flowers, fruits and pastry to put on an altar lightly clouded by  the smoke of incense and candles. As the members gather, a priest leads the  chant of prayers retelling the life of Buddha on earth.  </P> <P> He was born Siddartha Gautama in India to a wealthy family. His deification in  566 B.C., marking his attainment of enlightenment through meditation and  rejection of materialism, is the event being celebrated this week. The Buddha's  teachings first spread north through Asia over the next thousand years and came  to the United States in the 19th Century.  </P> <P> According to the Handbook of Denominations, the first Buddhist temple in the  United States was consecrated in San Francisco a century ago.  </P> <P> In 1985 the Buddhist Churches of America said there were 250,000 followers of  Buddha in America practicing in 62 temples, the largest of which is in Hacienda  Heights.  </P> <P> Last winter the Buddhist spiritual leaders gathered in Hacienda Heights' temple  complex for the 16th conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. It was  the first time that the biennial conference was held outside Asia.  </P> <P> In America some temples are formed by immigrants as a part of their ethnic  expression and others are established to spread the teachings of Buddha to new  groups.  </P> <P> The Rev. Ryugen Watanabe of the Kanzeonji Zen shrine is one of the Buddhist  spiritual leaders who has reached beyond Asian followers.  </P> <P> At the Kanzeonji Zen shrine, 34-year-old Watanabe and his followers sat all day  Saturday in meditation before an altar that was donated by Japanese  businessmen. Watanabe, who was born in Japan, said that 90% of his members are  Caucasians. He has all of the shrine's literature printed in English to  encourage membership from all backgrounds.  </P> <P> The Pureland Lotus and the Mystic Dharma, on the other hand, are oriented  toward immigrants who speak Vietnamese and Mandarin Chinese.  </P> <P> Thich Duy Tin, an apprentice priest, said most of the members of the Pureland  Lotus shrine are Vietnamese from Monterey Park, which has a population that is  slightly more than 50% Asian.  </P> <P> Lily Lee, a worshiper, said the Mystic Dharma temple caters to Los Angeles  worshipers originally from mainland China.  </P> <P> Lee said the priest who usually presides over the monthly services was in Hong  Kong to oversee the construction of two gigantic statues for the temple, which  is on property the Buddhist congregation bought from a Christian church about  nine years ago. Because he could not return in time for the purification  services, worshipers conducted their services with a tape-recording of the  ritual chants, she said.  </P> <P> Lee said that up to a hundred worshipers would attend the big services  conducted in the main sanctuary. Otherwise, about 10 members come to the  monthly services in the basement of the fenced two-story building.  </P> <P> It is largely coincidence that Highland Park has become home to three Buddhist  shrines. The Pureland Lotus and Mystic Dharma, whose congregations are widely  dispersed, merely found the right buildings at the right price.  </P> <P> Watanabe, who ties his waist-length hair in a ponytail, said that it was no  coincidence that he established his shrine in northeast Los Angeles. He said  divine guidance informed him that Mt. Washington was one of the holiest  mountains in the world.  </P> <P> "Personally, I didn't like Los Angeles at all," he said. His first home here  was a car, but then a friend asked him to watch the house on Mt. Washington.  The friend never came back. Eventually, Watanabe bought it and started his  teachings in 1983. It was also through unforeseen circumstances that Watanabe  and his followers bought the house across the street from the shrine for a yoga  facility.  </P> <P> "Too many people were attending my yoga class, and it was crowded here," he  said. "I had been praying to Buddha to tell me what to do. Then one day, a real  estate man knocked on the door and asked if I knew of anyone who wanted to rent  the house across the street."  </P> <P> Watanabe said he and his disciples make incense, body oils, meditation cushions  and greeting cards to support the temple.  </P> <P> "I learned through meditation that I have been doing this for many lives,"  Watanabe said. "I want to help the world. It hurts me so much to see what is  out there."  </P> <P> He said he came to America in the 1960s after a friend told him of a prediction  saying that world peace will be attained when a tribe of American Indians  receive Buddha's teachings from two holy men from the East.  </P> <P> "I thought that might be me," he said.  </P></p>

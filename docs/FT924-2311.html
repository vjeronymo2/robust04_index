			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Summit success paves way for EC enlargement: Edinburgh pact on Community financing Danish opt-outs agreed GOVERNMENTS in the European Community yesterday hailed the success of the weekend summit at Edinburgh, saying it would provide a road map for the Community's political development to the end of the century. Mr John Major, UK prime minister who chaired the EC heads of government meeting, declared that it would go down 'as the summit that put the Community back together'. Leaders of the 12 agreed on the crucial issues of future EC financing and the Danish question, building a platform from which to relaunch the Community in 1993 through immediate enlargement negotiations with Austria, Sweden and Finland. In spite of continuing turbulence in the currency market, EC officials said they believed that the wide-ranging agreements in Edinburgh would restore faith in the goal of a single currency by the end of the decade. The Community faced an 'all or nothing' summit in which the much criticised UK presidency had to pull off a series of interlocking deals on the EC budget and Denmark's demands for legally-binding exemptions from the Maastricht treaty. It also had to demonstrate to the citizens of Europe that the EC could recover from the crisis triggered by Danish voters' rejection of the treaty last June. Thanks to the Edinburgh agreement, Denmark intends to resubmit the treaty to its voters by May at the latest. The Copenhagen minority government is confident of approval. Copenhagen got everything it asked for at Edinburgh, declared Mr Poul Schluter, its prime minister. In Denmark, the Edinburgh agreement was welcomed by business leaders and greeted by newspaper headlines such as 'Triumph for Denmark' and 'Europe Gave Way'. The country's leftwing Socialist People's party joined two other opposition parties in declaring support for the deal. The party's executive committee took the decision, after a five-hour meeting, to go along with the Social Democrat and Radical Liberal parties, in backing the accord. This gives it the backing of seven of the eight parties in the Folketing, the Danish parliament. Mr Major pledged to complete ratification of the treaty in the House of Commons 'hard on the heels' of the Danish vote. EC leaders agreed to make the Community more accountable through more decentralised and open decision-making. They also presented a modest growth package which calls for co-ordination of national macroeconomic policy and increased spending at EC level on capital investment, roads, telecommunications and infrastructure. The two-day meeting was marked by tough bargaining. It was 'very hard going and tense', according to prime minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain who at one stage during bilateral talks with Mr Major on Saturday threatened to walk out. Under the budget deal, EC leaders agreed to raise annual Community spending from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 52.7bn) in 1992 to Ecu84bn in 1999, in today's money. The main winners are poorer EC members, led by Spain, which will receive roughly double the amount of development aid. The finance agreement was hailed by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, who said he got '85 per cent' of what he sought. But the policies developed by Brussels in recent years will suffer as a result of the concessions to Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. EC leaders expressed frustration over delays in ratifying the treaty. Denmark and Britain were warned by EC leaders, including President Francois Mitterrand, that they wanted ratification by summer. German foreign minister Klaus Kinkel said: 'The fate of European union, which we have agreed upon in Edinburgh, now lies in the hands of Britain and Denmark.'

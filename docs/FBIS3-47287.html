Chairman Paek In-chun says that the principled stand of the  Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government on national  reunification clarified by President Kim Il-song in his New Year  address is a highly important guideline indicating a clear way  of achieving national reunification by the internal strength of  the nation in the 90s.    "All the people in the Northern half of Korea, together with  the fellow countrymen in the South and overseas, will wage a  more vigorous struggle to make this year a historic year in  opening a new phase for national reunification, meeting all  manner of challenges of the imperialists and the South Korean  authorities," he states.    Hyon Chun-kuk says that the only way of achieving the  reunification of the country peacefully is to adopt the  confederacy formula based on the three principles of national  reunification. "All the journalists and editors in the Northern  half of Korea will wield the pen more vigorously to implement  the policy," he stressed.    Saying that the women should do their share in achieving the  unity of the nation under the 10-point programme of the great  unity of the whole nation, Secretary Kang Kwan-son ardently  appealed to the Korean women in the North, South and overseas to  turn out as one in the nationwide struggle for national  reunification.</p>

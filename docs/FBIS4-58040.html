			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Not Just the Allies: America </F> Too"]    [Text] Whoever thinks America's allies and supporters in  the 30-state aggression against our country are the only ones  who changed their positions on the embargo on Iraq is totally  mistaken. This is because America itself is facing a new move  from within that centers on a demand to reestablish relations  with Iraq and end the embargo. Taking part in this move are  senior politicians, Congress members, researchers, and, above  all, prominent businessmen.    Some Congress members like Lee Hamilton, head of the Foreign  Affairs Committee at the U.S. House of Representatives, and  Senator David Banner [name as published] began to question the  wisdom behind continuing the embargo. Moreover, the two most  important newspapers in America; namely, THE NEW YORK TIMES and  THE WASHINGTON POST, are talking in a new language about the  embargo, demanding that it should be lifted because it is no  longer justified and because of Iraq's cooperation with the  United Nations. The dissatisfaction was not confined only to  elements in both political and media quarters, but also included  the economic quarter. Many U.S. companies in the sectors of  agriculture, oil, and car and airplane manufacturing began to  talk about their losses as a result of the embargo on Iraq.    Former U.S. Congress member Mervin Dimely [name as  published]  noted that the losses are estimated at more than $2 billion in  certain sectors. Therefore, preparations have begun to hold a  conference organized by American companies in Washington in May.  These companies called on the secretary of energy and secretary  of commerce to attend the conference in order to discuss the  negative effects of the embargo on the U.S. economy. Because  the three powers in America -- the political, media, and  economic powers -- are beginning to witness dissatisfaction and  an inclination toward lifting the embargo, this means action  against the embargo has begun in America as well as in other  countries. Here we can say that these positive changes have  taken place thanks to the steadfastness and sacrifices of the  Iraqi people and to the greatness of their leader Saddam Husayn.  Therefore, in order for these developments to reach a positive  result, we must reinforce the base of steadfastness and broaden  the rallying around President Saddam Husayn. We must move on  all diplomatic, commercial, media, and organizational levels to  cut short the time for achieving great changes.</p>

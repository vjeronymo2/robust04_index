			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Political motives help keep Greek carrier airborne The Greek government has strong political motives for ensuring the survival of Olympic Airways, the indebted state carrier. For a start, more than 4m Greeks, living mostly in the US, Canada and Australia, travel home frequently. They are courted as an important source of investment in Greece and influence abroad. Olympic lost Dr8.7bn (Pounds 23.6m) last year on long-haul routes to the US and Australia, equivalent to 66 per cent of overall operating losses. But, in arguing for approval of its subsidies to Olympic, the Greek government persuaded the European Commission that New York and Sydney flights should be retained under the airline's restructuring plan, approved earlier this week, because they help maintain cultural links and boost trade. Greek migrants' remittances and shipping income, the Greek negotiators pointed out, together bring in more than Dollars 4bn a year, equal to almost two-thirds of Greek export earnings. US carriers are willing to operate direct flights to Greece only in the summer tourist season. Seasonality is one of Olympic's problems. Traffic is concentrated between June and September, when passenger loads are close to maximum. In the winter, domestic flights to the Greek islands may be two-thirds empty. Nevertheless, Olympic is obliged to serve island routes year-round, unlike foreign charter operators which fly between April and October and switch destinations from year to year according to tourist demand. The government argues that a regular air service is important to keep Greek island communities alive. Population of the Aegean islands has stabilised over the past decade, after 20 years of decline. More than 20 island airports are now able to handle medium-sized passenger jets. In addition, Greece's dispute with Turkey over control of Aegean airspace means that maintaining flights to the eastern Aegean islands, close to the Turkish coast, is seen as vital to the national interest. Aside from politics, Greek passengers on international flights show a surprising degree of loyalty to their national carrier, considering its record on punctuality and customer service is considered the poorest among European Union airlines.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thierry Outrebon: "Network Interconnection: </F> Cisco Banking on ATM and Software"]    [Text] Cisco presents its first ATM [Asynchronous  Transfer Model] router and adopts a strategy based on  software.    Building upon a close cooperation with Japan's NEC, Cisco,  the world's leading manufacturer of routers, has made a  full-scale entry into ATM, and particularly with respect to  switching. From this viewpoint, the company will market a  stand-alone ATM switcher, manufactured by NEC, and a card for  its 7000 router. The 16-port ATM switcher meets ATM Forum  specifications, which include the more classic 155 Mbits/sec  data transfer rate of the Sonet SDH interface.    The ATM card designed for the 7000 router, and designated  the  AIP (ATM Interface Processor), is due to be on the market  beginning in May. According to Cisco, this array will be the  first such configuration able to link traditional networks with  ATM networks. These two products comprise the third  developmental phase of Cisco's entry into the ATM market. In  October 1992, ADC Kentrox and Cisco jointly launched a  router/DSU designed for the SMDS network. This was the first  network in the United States to operate cells comparable to  those of the ATM. Around the beginning of last year, a true  ATM/DSU switcher appeared that was capable of converting frames  into cells. This device was developed jointly by Cisco, Kentrox,  and Digital Link. Apparently, those first two products and the  cooperation agreements that preceded them have been scrapped in  favor of Cisco's agreement with NEC. The planned AIP card for  the 7000 is comprised of three subassemblies. The main one,  which does the processing, is based on two RISC [Reduced  Instruction Set Computer] processors manufactured by Mips  Computers. The "dissection" of the ATM cells (segmentation and  reassembly) is done inside the FRED [figure-reader electronic  device] component, developed by the NET/Adaptive company.  Input/output operations are controlled by an AMD Taxi processor  in the 100 Mbits/sec case, and by a PMC/Sierra-manufactured  processor in that of the Sonet interface.    Cisco is also planning to make available for its 7000 router  another so-called Ethernet switching card. An Ethernet switching  unit, called Catalyst and made by Crescendo, will also be  available. Cisco acquired Crescendo, known mainly for its CDDI  [Cable Distributed Data Interface] (FDDI [Fiber Distributed Data  Interface] on twisted pair) cards, in October 1993. The  particularity of this second card is that it provides, on the  one hand, a 100-Mbits/sec CDDI output, and eight 10 Mbits/sec 10  BaseT input ports. Each station connected to the switcher can  therefore operate at a real-time rate of 10 Mbits/sec.  <H5>  Software Turnaround </H5>   In addition to these product announcements, Cisco is  highlighting its new architecture, Cisco Fusion, which tends to  separate the software's routing function from the switching unit  itself. In effect, as networks have evolved, the growing  consumption of passband has driven the manufacturers of  concentrators to dedicate circuits to a single station. This is  the case, for example, of the new Catalyst switcher. Certain  Ethernet switchers are now referred to as "single-station"  switchers. As a result, the notion of routing as it was  previously known (with searching a table to locate the addresses  of best access) is losing its interest, since the search has  been reduced to its simplest expression. In due time, therefore,  software associated with switchers will be replacing  top-of-the-line routers.    On the occasion of its agreement with Alcatel providing for  the supply of a PABX routing card, Cisco announced that it saw  its future essentially in software. Its cooperation agreement  with Microsoft further demonstrated this. Cisco has provided  Microsoft a routing software for its Windows server, together  with a customized card. The next stage, says the firm's European  head, Philippe Brawermann, will consist of a number of  agreements with several suppliers of hardware.</p>

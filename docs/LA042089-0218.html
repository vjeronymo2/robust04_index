			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UCLA'S AIKMAN SIGNS WITH COWBOYS;  </P> <P> AGENT SAYS QUARTERBACK WILL BECOME HIGHEST-PAID ROOKIE IN NFL HISTORY  </P> <P> UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman signed today with the Dallas Cowboys, a deal his  agent has maintained will make Aikman the highest-paid rookie in NFL history.  </P> <P> The Cowboys, who own the No. 1 pick in Sunday's NFL draft and will use it to  select Aikman, ended weeks of speculation and trade rumors with the  announcement at their Valley Ranch headquarters.  </P> <P> "We have felt for quite some time -- at least as long as I've been a Cowboy as  a matter of fact -- that Troy Aikman is the No. 1 football player today in the  United States coming out of college," Cowboys owner and President Jerry Jones  said in making the announcement.  </P> <P> Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg,  has maintained that it will surpass the 6-year, $8.2-million deal quarterback  Vinny Testaverde signed with Tampa Bay as the No. 1 pick in 1987.  </P> <P> "Anytime a first overall pick comes through as a quarterback, it will be a  breakthrough deal," Steinberg said.  </P> <P> "I made no secrets about the fact that I would love to play for the Dallas  Cowboys as early as last year," Aikman said. "I think it's one of the premier  organizations in the NFL."  </P> <P> Earlier, he told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: "There were a lot of rumors  going around about trades or them taking someone else, and I said I could be  happy playing anywhere.  </P> <P> "But in the back of my mind, all along, I knew I wanted to play in Dallas."  </P> <P> Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson praised Steinberg and Mike McCoy, who represented  the Cowboys in negotiations, for the speed with which the deal was consummated.  </P> <P> The Cowboys have the No. 1 pick in the draft by virtue of their NFL-worst 3-13  record last season.  </P> <P> NFL scouts tout Aikman's good size (6-2 1/2, 218 pounds), mobility and a quick  release that makes him difficult to sack.  </P> <P> Aikman has a strong arm but also displays a nice touch on his short- and  intermediate-range passes. He scored a 29 out of 50 on the Wonderlic  intelligence exam given at the Indianapolis combine, which is considered above  average.  </P> <P> Aikman transferred to UCLA in 1986 after breaking his leg as a sophomore  starter at Oklahoma. As a two-year starter at UCLA, he passed for 5,298 yards  and 42 touchdowns, completing 65% of his passes. The Bruins were 20-4 in  Aikman's two years.  </P></p>

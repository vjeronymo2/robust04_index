			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UN attack 'crippled' Somali warlord, Clinton says PRESIDENT Bill Clinton early today declared that the United Nations military operation in Somalia was 'over' and a 'success'. He told a White House press conference that General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, had advised him that the forces of General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali warlord, had been 'crippled'. Referring to the death of 23 Pakistani peacekeepers in an ambush on June 5, Mr Clinton said: 'We could not let this go unpunished.' The credibility of UN peacekeeping and the existing relief operations in Somalia had been at stake. Gen Aideed had not been captured, Mr Clinton said. If he were, it would be up the UN to decide what action to take against him. 'The purpose of the operation was to undermine the ability of Aideed to wreak military havoc in Somalia,' he said. 'The military back of Aideed has been broken. A warrant has been issued for his arrest.' The future of Somalia, he said, lay with the Somalis themselves and he encouraged them to concentrate on 'nation building'. On Bosnia, the president said that if the three warring factions - the Serbs, Croats and Moslems - 'genuinely and honestly' agreed to a solution different from the Vance-Owen peace plan, 'I would have to look at it very seriously'. Mr Clinton stoutly reaffirmed his support for Nato, arguing that, though its enemies might be different and more diffuse, it had not lost its sense of purpose. On domestic issues, which took up most of the press conference, Mr Clinton said it was probably unrealistic to expect Congress to pass healthcare reform this year, but that there would be no excuse for ducking it next year. But, basking in the glow of Congressional action in the past 24 hours, he said it was clear 'we are now putting our economic house in order'. He had reservations about the loss of his energy tax, but took consolation in the fact that most of his investment proposals were still intact. Economic trends, he said, if not the current state of the economy, were good, not least because of the expectation that interest rates would remain low. Using charts in the manner of Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate in last year's presidential election, he maintained with some fluency that deficit reduction would benefit all Americans. There was a limit, he said, in a recession as to how far the deficit could reasonably be contracted. The five-year Dollars 500bn deficit reduction plan, therefore, was appropriate to current economic circumstances.</p>

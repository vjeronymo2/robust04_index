			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta by </F> Paolo Valentino during his flight to Vilnius, Lithuania; date  not given: "Andreatta Vents Anger Against Berlusconi: `Shameful  and Cynical Promises to Poor People'"]    [Text] Vilnius, Lithuania -- The metaphors and tone were  the deadly and refined ones of someone who learned the art of  polemics in a British university. And the substance was  political dynamite. This, especially in view of the fact that  the attacks came from the foreign minister. But not even his  own office and the silent retinue of diplomats that surround him  were able to contain Beniamino Andreatta. On the aircraft that  took us to Vilnius, Andreatta turned away from the subject of  his meeting with Boris Yeltsin and the rights of the  Russian-speaking minorities of the Baltic. He lit his pipe. He  gave his trousers a hitch, tucking his necktie into the  waistband. He half-closed his eyes, and then he let loose.    "There is a tide of anger in Italy and, as always, it has  right-wing characteristics. Those who shook the tree have  caused the apples to fall in their neighbors' garden. The Left  concentrated on the issue of the other parties' reputation  instead of on the country's problems, thus creating the  conditions for an explosion by the Right. The most  disconcerting aspect of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is the  way he has taken advantage of poor people. His are the typical  promises made in countries lacking a political structure. And  it is the poor consumers of escapist television who are  attracted by this campaign, with its cynical plan."    [Valentino] Why "cynical," minister?    [Andreatta] Because it is a form of Reaganism after the  event, a reintroduction of the "supply side" theory -- to cut  taxes in order to bring in more taxes -- that did not work in  the United States, where it left a deficit that has constituted  its greatest problem for the past nine years. The disgusting  aspect of this operation is this rummaging around in the attic  for the remnants of a past era, pulling back out of the chests  of the right the carnival costumes of past seasons and, having  shaken off a little dust, selling them back to the Italian  people, who are somewhat unaware of the complexity of the  problems. This, in the midst of an adjustment that is working  -- as the Amato and Ciampi governments have basically succeeded  in doing -- when we should not be loosening our grip. (A  steward informed us that we were about to land in Vilnius).    So, now we are entering Lithuania. Here we have a government  which, also because of anger and the difficulty of adhering to  the policy of liberalization, has become a government  representing continuity with communism. Of course, in political  terms they have done well, they too have fought for  independence, but they are managing liberalization as the  communists may have managed it, with a few concessions, and  privatizations that are more apparent than real.    [Valentino] But you do not use the word "disgusting" in  connection with [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left,  PDS] Occhetto; you seem gentler in your criticisms....    [Andreatta] Well, strong language has been used for the past  40 years. The fact that the intellectual world of the Italian  Left maintains some ambiguity and that its contempt -- which may  not be a political category -- is never brought to bear on  continuity is such old hat that it is not worth emphasizing.  The desire to break with the past and not to cultivate memories  or feelings, which I have found in Russia, is something that I  do not find among my friends on the Italian Left. In Italy the  former communists need to maintain their feelings. And I find  that this leaves me very suspicious about their ability to  tackle properly situations demanding a genuine market economy  philosophy. Then there is this operation -- one of the worst on  the Italian Left -- of exploiting people's reputation.  Basically, the democratic defense against the left is regarded  as 1948-style anticommunism.    [Valentino] But anticommunism in 1948 was a fact...    [Andreatta] Because it is part of our history and was an  important factor. If it had not been for that.... The result  can be better imagined looking at this part of the world.    [Valentino] What frightens you in Italy today?    [Andreatta] The regression of politics to primordial  feelings, to anger. Videocracy, which has reduced political  reasoning to gestures and insults. This goes profoundly  contrary to our history. In order to cast off politics as the  supreme art of compromise, which unfortunately has a negative  connotation in Italy, shouting has been introduced, which allows  even criminals to conceal their past offenses. Even P2  [outlawed Masonic lodge] members are shouting.</p>

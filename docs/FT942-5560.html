			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Flotation for Thai store operator Siam Makro, the Thai cash-and-carry store operator, is to be offered to the public later this month at Bt50 a share, giving the expanding company a market capitalisation of around Bt12bn (Dollars 480m), writes William Barnes in Bangkok. Earnings per share are forecast at Bt1.25 this year which puts the offer price on a 40 times price-earnings multiple. However, the company said this price reflected the demand shown by investors during the company's roadshow to Hong Kong, Singapore, Edinburgh and London. Siam Makro, a joint venture between the SHV group of the Netherlands and the local CP group, dominates discount shopping in Thailand. Funds raised through the flotation will be used for further expansion.</p>

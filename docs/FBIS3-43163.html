			<p>Europe     Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vol. III, No. 4, 27  January 1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Lat in America Group featuring brief summaries of  foreign media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most  recent sources available to FBIS.      Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East European Divisions of  Europe/Lat in America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for summary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications. The EER is published in two  editions, one for Western Europe (also including media coverage of  Canada and Turkey), and the other for Eastern Europe.  Drawing  primarily from domestic media sources of these countries but also  using other foreign media where appropriate, the EER focuses on  national and regional economic issues, such as economic  competitiveness, regional economic integration, economic reforms and  other changes in economic policies, and foreign trade and  investment.      FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S. Government.  All comment or analysis contained herein is  attributable to the cited media source, unless otherwise indicated.

Although  the package calls for government expenditures of 1.6 trillion lire  for 1994 and 1.3 trillion lire each for 1995 and 1996, Giugni said  that for the present, he can only guarantee the funds for 1994.  However, according to an article in LA REPUBBLICA, the labor unions  are "lukewarm" to the government's measures.  Natale Forlani,  secretary of the Italian Confederation of Trade Unions (CISL), said  that although they contribute to solving some of the unemployment  problems, the measures are far from meeting the need to increase  investment and provide adequate income to workers affected by the  industrial crisis.  The LA REPUBBLICA article details the following  provisions of the bill:      * "Mobility status" Aid--Supplemental unemployment benefits that  kick in after the regular, 36-month unemployment benefits run out  and which are intended to assist unemployed workers in the interim  between receiving unemployment benefits and pensions, will be  extended to seven years.  Participation in this "mobility" program  will be broadened to include the clothing, textile, and building  industries.  It will also be extended to Fiat's Alfa plant in Arese,  previously excluded because it was not classed as a company in  industrial decline.      * Unemployment Compensation--The benefit will be raised from 25  to 30 percent of the salary of the last year of employment and will  be gradually raised to 40 percent.  The 5 percent raise will be  accomplished in 1994 in two installments.      The IL MESSAGERO article adds details of the following  provisions:      * Unemployment Insurance (Cassa Integrazione)--This benefit will  be extended to small companies with 15 to 50 employees.  Benefits  will be increased to 1.5 million lire monthly for employees with  salaries over 32 million lire per year.  Companies such as Fiat will  be allowed to use both the unemployment insurance program and  private company benefits, called "solidarity contracts," which had  been prohibited by law.      * Research and Development--Some 40-50 billion lire have been  allocated for R&amp;D to boost hiring in technical fields and to improve   products in order to become more competitive.      * Reduced Work Week--Contributions to the unemployment fund will  be reduced from 0.45 percent to 0.20 percent for those companies  that adopt flexible or reduced work weeks.

Commenting on this  appointment, which was made by new Finance Minister Paul Martin in  December, LE DEVOIR deputy editor Jean-Robert Sansfacon writes that  monetary policy may change in the long term but not in the short  term.  The new Liberal government believes it is possible to  navigate between price stability and job creation.  Sansfacon argues  that Martin "is perfectly right" to maintain the goal of keeping  inflation under 3 percent for the next five years.  At the same  time, however, "he must not forget another objective, more  fundamental than price stability: employment."  Sansfacon concludes  by cautioning Martin that if maintaining inflation below 3 percent  forces him to raise interest rates to the point of harming  employment, he should remember that the Conservatives lost the  October 1993 election over this issue.      Commenting on the Thiessen appointment in LE SOLEIL, editor  Raymond Giroux points out that Martin "had no real choice" but to  replace Crow "if he wanted to give Canadians the image of a really  new and credible government."  Although Martin claims "the Bank of  Canada will not change its monetary policy," Giroux "is willing to  wager" that the new governor will allow inflation to rise a few  tenths of a percent during the next several months.  After all, he  adds, "no economy can really expand without an inflationary push."

During this time he  concluded the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),  participated in the completion of the Uruguay Round, traveled to  Chile to assess the chances for enlarging NAFTA, and prepared for  next month's visit by his South Korean counterpart with whom McLaren  wants to negotiate a bilateral Canada-South Korea trade agreement.  In Gherson's view, the reason behind this "frenetic activism" is the  "ambitious" minister's desire to prevent Canada from losing trade  opportunities before a new "super dynamic" World Trade Organization  (WTO) is in place.  McLaren is quoted as saying that the WTO  "embodies the realization that trade and investment are global  activities--and that's new and important."  Furthermore, McLaren  speculated that as the WTO "is built up and finds its feet," it may  overtake existing regional trading arrangements.  (SK)  (Toronto THE  GLOBE AND MAIL in English 11 Jan 94 p A16)      FRANCE      USTR KANTOR 'THREATENS' EU AUDIOVISUAL POLICY--According to a  commentary in LE FIGARO, the "threats" by U.S.Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor to apply trade sanctions against the EU in order to  open the EU audiovisual market to U.S. products is "proof" that the  United States wants to stop the EU from revising its audiovisual  legislation.  A further sign of U.S. intentions was the 11 January  meeting which brought together two European deputies with Frank  Tonini--a representative of U.S. film producers' chief Jack Valenti-  -and John Newbeggin.  Newbeggin is an assistant to David Putnam,  British film producer and a member of the EU's taskforce on its  planned audiovisual "green book."  The article contends that this  "sudden interest" by the United States in European politics is  taking place at the same time the French Government is lobbying its  European Union (EU) partners to extend the EU broadcast quota system  and industry subsidies, and to transfer the legal responsibility for  TV broadcasting decisions from the broadcasting country to the  receiving country.  The commentary notes that in shifting legal  responsibility to the receiving country, such stations as Ted  Turner's TNT would be inhibited from "inundating" Europe with U.S.  broadcasts from Britain and U.S. broadcast freedom would be  affected.

The ability of the United States--China's largest  textile market--to stem the "flood" of Chinese textiles entering  that country is a "small tour de force" for President Bill Clinton's  administration which used to advantage the "sensitive" issue of  China's diverting textile trade through third countries to conclude  the accord.  The bilateral agreement will allow the United States to  "impose a new balance" with the Chinese but may also allow it to  "play the NAFTA card," argues Weil Besancon President Denis Weil.  "Limiting Chinese textile export growth will allow the United States  to favor trade relations with Mexico, where wage costs are  competitive in textile production," Weil adds.      While the United States will profit from this agreement, Europe  may not.  The EU is China's second largest textile market and EU  industrialists fear the flow of Chinese textiles into the EU will  accelerate as it diminishes toward the United States.  Such an  increase would aggravate the trade balance between China and the EU.  In 1992, the EU had a 29 billion franc (Fr) trade deficit in  textiles with China; France alone had a deficit of Fr3.2 billion.  The article also claims the difference in tariffs between the EU and  China is "flagrant," with the EU tariff at 12 percent on imports  from China and Chinese tariffs 100 percent on imports from the EU.  The EU does not yet have the technical means to control its borders  nor viable statistics to measure the impact of any increase in  textile imports, according to Thierry Noblot of the Textile  Industries Union.   (DiI) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 20  Jan 94 p 7)      BULL PLAN 'IRRITATES' EU COMMISSION--The French Government's  delay in communicating its plans to restructure the government-  controlled Bull computer company "greatly irritates" the EU  Commission, according to an article in LES ECHOS.  Furthermore, a  report in LE FIGARO claims the Commission could block the  government's planned Fr2.5-billion capital increase for Bull because  of insufficient information about the deal.  The LES ECHOS article  cites EU Competition Commissioner Karl Van Miert in an interview  given to the Paris daily LE MONDE as stating that French plans are  "completely illegal."  Van Miert added, "The French Government  promised us a restructuring plan for months but nothing has come of  it.  Meanwhile, competitors in other member states complain.  It has  put the Commission in an impossible situation.  It can not condone  more (French Government capital increase) payments (to Bull) and if  this happens, there should be a hearing at the European Court of  Justice."      Additionally, LES ECHOS reports that the Commission, which claims  it has only received an "overview" of French Government plans, is  still reviewing the Fr4 billion that the government paid to Bull in  1992 as a capital increase and the Fr2.5 billion more supplied by  the government and co-shareholder France Telecom in February 1993.  In December 1993, the government supplied Bull with a new tranche of  Fr4 billion.  "With the new payments forecast for this year, the  total aid package could reach Fr15 billion," Van Miert claimed,  noting the case of Air France, which the French Government tried to  supply with Fr7 billion after having previously given the airline  Fr1.5 billion.  (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS in French 10 Jan 94 p 10;  Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement 21 Jan 94 p I)      INSEE ON PRIVATIZATION IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT--If the French  Government completes its plans to sell off 21 state-owned companies,  as envisaged in a law passed in 1992, it would affect 668,000  employees whose jobs would be transferred to the private sector,  according to the National Institute for Statistics and Economic  Research (INSEE).  If foreign subsidiaries of these 21 companies are  taken into consideration, 1,760 companies would be involved in the  privatization effort which would bring the total number of employees  affected to 1 million.  If the program is completed, France's public  sector will be reduced by a third.      INSEE reports that at the end of 1992, the government controlled  1,750 companies and 1.74 million workers--the largest public sector  in Europe.  In the manufacturing industries, 9 percent of the work  force would be involved if the privatizations are completed.  In the  financial industry, the share of government employees will go from  32 percent to less than 5 percent.  In the future, three quarters of  government employees will be concentrated in seven large companies  with a monopolistic character: electricity, gas, and coal companies  EDF, GDF, and CDF respectively; railroad company SNCF; metro company  RATP; the Post; and telecommunications company France Telecom.  INSEE notes that aside from privatizations, layoffs in the public  sector have affected 43,000 workers in 1992, or 2.4 percent of the  work force. (DiI)  (Paris LIBERATION in French 11 Jan 94 p 16)      PRIVATE YARD TO BUILD NAVY SHIPS--The French Navy will soon ask  the French Government to order two "assault" ships--new models  called Nimis (interarmy ships for support missions)--from a civilian  shipyard an article in LIBERATION claims.  This choice is  revolutionary because using the private company, the Chantiers de  l'Atlantique in Saint Nazaire, defies the tradition of constructing  Navy ships at the government's Department of Naval Construction  (DCN) facility in Brest.  The DCN's naval yard belongs to the  Defense Ministry and specializes in research and construction of the  country's most "important" military ships, employing more than 6,500  engineers, technicians, and workers.  It had proposed a new type of  ship for the Navy's needs, the BIP, which was to cost around Fr1.5  billion.   However, the head of Chantiers de l'Atlantique, Alain  Grill, offered to build two Nimis for the same price.      It will be some time before the government confirms the Navy's  choice.  It is clear, the article notes, that a "serious naval  battle" will erupt in the months ahead between these two shipyards.  The stakes are big since, in addition to a 9-percent subsidy from  the Ministry of Industry and advanced payments for the equipment,  they entail in large part the future of the DCN naval yard, which  will soon run out of new construction orders and if none are  forthcoming will have to rely on its maintenance contracts to  survive.  According to the article, the cost of the Nimis was not  the only factor in the Navy's choice, however.  Military studies  have all come to the same conclusion that the Nimis, which are not  built to withstand heavy attack, are what the Navy needs to perform  "showing the flag" duties rather than the BIP's, more suited for  warfare.  While the DCN has stated that it is open to adopting new  forms of manufacturing, it concluded, "if the most complex system  needed on a ship is air conditioning, this is not our line of work."  (DiI)  (Paris LIBERATION in French 22, 23 Jan 94 pp 5-6)      GERMANY      COMMENTATOR SEES RECOVERY PRODUCING CRISIS--Commentator Helmut  Maier-Mannhart believes that ongoing cost-cutting efforts may enable  German industry to recover international markets but worries that  this same development may increase unemployment, leading to a social  and financial crisis.  Writing in the 14 January Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG, Maier-Mannhart concurs with Baden-Wuerttemberg Economics  Minister Dieter Spoeri's thesis that German industry's recent  restructuring efforts will yield a great increase in productivity,  ultimately yielding substantial improvements in Germany's global  competitiveness.  As an example of this development, Maier-Mannhart  points to Volkswagen, where Chairman Ferdinand Piech has managed to  make his company operate profitably at just 90 percent of capacity,  rather than the 100 percent previously required.  Maier-Mannhart  points out, however, that this trend toward "lean production" also  has a downside:  increased productivity means it takes fewer people  to turn out the same quantity of a particular product.  On a large  scale, this means a higher unemployment rate and greater demands on  public resources to support those thrown out of work.  The expected  "Renaissance of industry," the author concludes, may thus coincide  with "a social crisis" and a "state of emergency" in public  finances.  Maier-Mannhart sees few efforts to come to terms with  this threat and notes that, in any case, Germany is incapable of  undertaking the necessary fundamental structural change in a year  punctuated by so many elections. (RH)  (Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG  in German 14 Jan 93 p 23)      TELEKOM STARTS FIBER OPTIC LINK WITH EAST EUROPE--On 13 January,  Deutsche Telekom began operating the first section of the Trans  Europe Line (TEL), a fiber optic network linking Germany and East  Europe.   According to a Telekom spokesperson, plans call for TEL  eventually to grow to 14,000 kilometers, a goal which will require  participating utility companies to invest about 700 million German  marks (DM).  The initial section, which is about 3,700 kilometers  long, runs from Frankfurt to Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava, and  Budapest in the north, with a southern spur extending to Austria,  Slovenia, and Croatia.  A subsequent phase of the project would  expand the network to include Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Romania,  Bulgaria, and Moldova.  Eventual connections to Moscow and Helsinki  are also envisioned. (RH)  (Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 14  Jan 94 p 24)      HESSE CREATES TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION FOUNDATION--The Land  Government of Hesse has decided to create a Hessian Technology  Foundation to promote industrial innovation.  According to Hessian  Economics Minister Welteke, the foundation is a response to the  "crisis of innovation" in the economy, the country's lagging  international competitiveness, and the failure of industry to  exploit new areas of technology.  According to its constitution,  which was coordinated with representatives of business, labor, and  academia, the foundation will work primarily with small businesses.  The Land of Hesse will provide the foundation with starter capital  of DM10 million, which is expected to yield DM600,O00 to DM700,0O0  annually for ongoing operations.  The Hessian Land Development and  Trust Company, an agency of the Land Government, will manage the  foundation, freeing up resources which would otherwise be absorbed  by administrative costs. (RH)  (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG in German 12 Jan 94 p 5)      ITALY      3 MILLION NEW JOBS NEEDED BY 2000--On 12 January Labor Minister  Gino Giugni presented a white paper on employment stating that 3  million new jobs must be created by the year 2000 to meet current  and future employment needs.  Giugni claimed that while such a  statement can be considered "provocative" given that 550,000 jobs  were lost in 1993 and the ranks of the unemployed grew by 350,000,  it is "exactly what Italy needs."  This is the case, he added,  because Italy has high labor costs compared with other  industrialized countries.  Giugni admitted that creating that many  new jobs is a "desperate undertaking" and although Italy's GDP is  expected to increase 3 percent per year during this time,  realistically only 600,000 jobs can be expected to be created.  Giugni suggests attacking the problem by providing better education  and increasing flexibility in the labor market.  He claims that the  market needs an additional 250,000 high school graduates and 110,000  university graduates yearly to increase the education level of  future workers, which is currently among the lowest in Europe.  As  for flexibility, he suggests that part time work should be  encouraged, along with employment mobility within industries and  geographic areas, and that measures be taken to expose the  underground economy where "millions of the employed are hiding."  (AB)  (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA in Italian 13 Jan p 19)      SWEDEN      INSTITUTE SAYS FUTURE LOOKING BRIGHTER--According to the latest  report from the Konjunktur Institut, new industrial orders are  picking up for the first time in four years, and Swedish industry  seems to be coming out of the recession.  The 1993 results were  particularly impressive in the saw mill industry, which has begun to  reach full capacity.  The construction industry, still suffering  from decreasing demand, is lagging behind.  Production is responding  only slowly to increased orders but is expected to pick up in 1994.  Some industries, especially lumber and electronics, will begin  hiring additional workers in the first quarter of this year.

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Drinks sector The chancellor's decision to exempt spirits from excise duty represents a considerable victory for the Scotch whisky lobby. At one level it marks a step towards redressing the discrimination against spirits in the tax regime for alcohol. At another it is a gesture towards harmonisation of UK duties with the much lower rates applying in Europe. The more lenient attitude of the British government will certainly give the industry some extra credibility in lobbying against possible duty increases elsewhere. But there may not be much short-run effect on earnings. Though the fall in domestic spirits consumption is expected to slow this year, the market remains soft. Consumption trends are unlikely to be affected by the chancellor's decision to forgo an indexation of duties which would have added only 17p to a bottle of spirits. For beer and wine, the story is more complicated. The decision to raise duties on these categories by twice the inflation rate will probably make little difference to overall consumption levels, but it will exacerbate the problems caused by personal imports from the continent. This affects the retail trade as much as the brewers. It is particularly unhelpful for brewers like Whitbread whose market is concentrated in the south-east, and which also owns the Threshers off-licence chain.</p>

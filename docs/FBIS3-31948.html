			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Celis Marroquin] </F>   [Text] We are in Belen, where Vice President Arturo  Herbruger is preparing to vote at voting booth No. 28. The vice  president is voting just as the president of the Republic  already voted at the center in the university assembly hall.  While the vice president is voting we would like to say at this  time the city looks very crowded, and there is much traffic. We  also observed that there are several buses parked directly in  front of the mayor's office. We do not know why so many buses  are parked there, given we have not seen any municipal officer  around the area.    As we said, the city seems increasingly crowded. Numerous  individuals are starting to approach the voting centers located  throughout the city. The vice president of the Republic is with  us now, and he will comment on the referendum taking place.    [Herbruger] My first impression is that it is quite  favorable. There are not too many people at this time, but  neither is the place deserted. There are many people right now.  I believe as the day progresses, voter turnout will increase.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you believe the campaign against  the referendum had anything to do with the low voter turnout?    [Herbruger] I cannot say anything about that specific issue,  because anything on which I may comment may be interpreted as  propaganda. [laughs]    [Reporter] It is possible, however, to see propaganda  against  the referendum scattered throughout the street. Can you comment  on that?    [Herbruger] I have not seen anything. As I was driving from  my home, there was not much traffic, and I did not see any  garbage or propaganda scattered about the streets.    [Reporter] How do you believe this process is being viewed  internationally?    [Herbruger] I believe it is being viewed positively, because  it is the first time a referendum is taking place in Guatemala  in order to approve constitutional reforms; in this respect, I  believe that internationally it is going to be viewed favorably.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / New policies on energy urged NEW policies to remove distortions in the energy market could cut emissions of carbon dioxide in the UK by 40 per cent as well as putting money back into the economy, according to a study published today by Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group. The report, by Dr Tim Jackson, an independent consultant on energy and environment policy, says failure to take action will mean market distortions will continue to misdirect Pounds 2bn a year on investment in uneconomic and carbon-intensive technologies. Friends of the Earth proposes measures including the linking of mortgage tax relief to energy efficiency in the home; tighter energy efficiency standards for buildings and appliances; new price regulations for electricity and gas companies to encourage energy saving; a carbon tax of between 4 per cent and 7 per cent to provide money for grants, loans and subsidies of up to Pounds 400m a year to spend on energy efficiency; and a National Energy Bank to distribute these grants. The study says a series of regulatory and fiscal distortions as well as a lack of information in the market for energy services means householders and businesses do not see improving energy efficiency to be in their own economic interests, in spite of its value to the economy. Efficiency Without Tears. Friends of the Earth, 26-28 Underwood St, London N1 7JQ. Pounds 10.</p>

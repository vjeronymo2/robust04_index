			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / ITV takeover measure approved The measure paving the way for new takeovers within the ITV network was passed by the Lords last night. The order, which has already cleared the Commons, removes the ban on a company holding two licences in the nine large independent television areas. But it still prohibits any company holding both the London licences. Lex, Page 18; Yorkshire-Tyne Tees deficit, Page 20</p>

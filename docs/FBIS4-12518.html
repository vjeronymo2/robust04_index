			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat by </F> correspondent del Campo in Tunis on 8 April]    [Text] [Announcer] Returning to the international news  again, we go to Tunisia where the headquarters of the PLO is.  There, barely an hour ago, a Radio Nacional de Espana special  correspondent was able to interview the Palestinian leader Yasir  'Arafat at a crucial moment for the history of the Middle East,  following the recent explosions of violence, threatening the  whole peace process. Gloria del Campo is in Tunisia. Good  evening. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent del Campo] Good evening. I have to say at the  outset that the interview was with a group of 14 European and  Japanese journalists, on a mission organized by the United  Nations to get to know at first hand the Palestinian problem.  This year, Radio Nacional de Espana represents Spain on this  mission.    Yasir 'Arafat was really pessimistic about the immediate  application of Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, which  was to have begun on 13 April, and he insistently accused Israel  of maneuvering in order not to begin this autonomy. This is  Yasir 'Arafat:    [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English fading into Spanish  translation] It is not the first maneuvering. If it is the  first manoeuvring, OK, we can let it go. [end recording]    [Del Campo] 'Arafat said that this was not the first  maneuvering by Israel, but if it was the first they could let it  go. But 'Arafat, who, incidently, looked very tired -- he had  just returned from Cairo where the negotiations between Israel  and the Palestinians are being held -- stressed that Israel has  suspended the negotiations in Cairo from Wednesday to Sunday  under the formal pretext of the celebration of the day of the  Jewish holocaust, but he emphasized that in contrast they have  not suspended for the same reason the negotations being held in  Paris with the Palestinians and Israelis on economic issues.    Thus, 'Arafat said, the date of 13 April, when, as I was  saying, Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho was to begin,  is not going to be met -- in line, incidently, with the  statements made by the Israeli foreign minister who gives as the  probable date the end of the month.    'Arafat says that after 13 April he will convene the  Palestinian leadership here in Tunisia to study what is to be  done and in addition he called on the international community,  the United States and Russia who are the co-sponsors of the  Middle East peace process, and also the European Union and  Japan, to help to resolve this impasse in the negotiations.  That is all for now.    [Announcer] Those were the views expressed less than an hour  ago by Yasir 'Arafat.</p>

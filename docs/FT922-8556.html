			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK and Vietnam sign deal on refugees' return THE GOVERNMENTS of Britain and Vietnam yesterday signed an end to Hong Kong's 13-year struggle to cope with an inflow of Vietnamese boat people, by agreeing to the forcible repatriation of all those found not to be political refugees. Mr Alistair Asprey, Hong Kong's secretary for security, estimated the overcrowded camps which currently house about 56,000 illegal Vietnamese immigrants could be emptied in three years. The agreement, signed in Hanoi yesterday morning, is the final stage in the October 29 statement of understanding between Britain and Vietnam. This permitted the forcible return of all new non-refugees and of so-called double-backers who had returned to Hong Kong after being voluntarily repatriated to Vietnam. Lord Wilson, Hong Kong's outgoing governor, welcomed the agreement. 'What we really want is that as many people as possible should volunteer to go back to their homes and I hope that this new stage in the process of reaching agreement with Vietnam will encourage that,' he said. The news was broken to the inmates of the 10 detention centres in Hong Kong last night, but there were no immediate outbreaks of violence. A concern remains that the government will have to use force in the repatriation of some boat people who have waited in appalling conditions for almost four years rather than return to what they claim will be inevitable persecution. Mr Asprey would only say that everyone would have the opportunity to return under conditions of 'order, safety and dignity'. There has already been a significant fall in the number of boat people arriving in Hong Kong since the October accord. This year there have so far been only seven arrivals, compared with 3,920 in the corresponding period in 1991. This is thought to result from the October agreement and to a reduction in the amount payable to those who volunteered to return. Mr Asprey said he did not consider it was a reaction to the riots that killed 21 Vietnamese in a refugee camp in February. He said the agreement would be likely to encourage a rapid increase in the number of Vietnamese volunteering to return. At present there are 22,466 boat people who have failed the screening process and will be forced to return to Vietnam. There are a further 29,562 which have yet to go through the screening process, while there are only 3,434 designated refugees remaining. 'One of the main objectives is to make it clear there is no future for them in wasting their lives in the camps, in the forlorn hope that they will get access to resettlement. That will not happen,' he said. Mr Asprey emphasised that neither Hong Kong nor Britain had agreed to any financial assistance connected with the agreement with Vietnam. However, the European Community has recently started a Dollars 120m (Pounds 67.7m) programme to aid re-integration of returnees.</p>

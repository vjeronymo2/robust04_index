			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Move on squatters THE GOVERNMENT is to crack down on squatting, making it a criminal offence with possible prison sentences for offenders, the Home Office said yesterday. At present, unless there is a smashed window or damage to a door or other part of the property, or drug-taking or other criminal activity, police cannot move in. The object of new legislation will be to make occupying someone else's home or premises without permission an offence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Three newspapers this morning report that General  Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front will contest next month's  election after all. However, this cannot be confirmed at this  state. According to the NATAL MERCURY, THE CAPE TIMES, and  BUSINESS DAY, the decision was taken at a secret meeting last  night. The papers said this development would almost certainly  bring about a split among right wingers. It is reported that  the front, which was registered as a party late on Friday night,  will submit lists of candidates before the deadline tomorrow.  The papers add that the leader of the Afrikaner Freedom  Foundation, Professor Carel Boshoff, has also joined the group  that is to take part in the election .</p>

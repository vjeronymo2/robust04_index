			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sharp ahead 55% at six months Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer which is a dominant maker of liquid crystal displays, increased non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - by 55 per cent in the first six months to end-September, on the strength of buoyant demand for its LCD panels and other electronic devices. The company said that in spite of persistent weakness in corporate capital investment, demand for its goods, combined with rationalisation measures, helped it to achieve a 7 per cent increase in sales to Y615.3bn (Dollars 6.35bn) compared with Y575.2bn a year ago. Operating profits more than doubled to Y25.2bn from Y11.9bn, while recurring profits surged 55 per cent to Y31.1bn from Y20.2bn. Net profits rose 24 per cent to Y15.6bn from Y12.6bn. Sharp, which has a leading position in the market for LCD panels, has benefited from strong demand, particularly from US personal computer in the US. LCD sales totalled Y113.2bn in the first half, compared with Y187.5bn for the whole of fiscal 1993. As a result, its electronic components division saw sales rise 23 per cent to Y207.3bn from Y168.4bn. In contrast, the television and video equipment division reported a 4 per cent decline in sales to Y122.9bn on continuing weak demand. Mr Haruo Tsuji, president, said recently that he expected the company's LCD operations to continue providing growth for the company for some time. Sharp is building the world's largest LCD factory in Japan, which is expected to begin operations next year and has expanded its existing facility. Sharp expects LCD sales of Y245bn in the full year, against forecast overall industry sales of Y540bn. Sharp is shifting the manufacture of some products overseas and procuring a greater volume of parts from abroad in order to combat the adverse effects of the high yen. As a result, it expects to increase sales by 6 per cent in the full year to Y1,240bn on the strength of continued demand for devices. Sharp is looking for a 41 per cent rise in recurring profits to Y64bn in the year to March, and a 31 per cent increase in net profits to Y33.5bn.</p>

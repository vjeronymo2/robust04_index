			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] RANGOON, Feb 15 (AFP) -- A senior Burmese said  Tuesday that dissident Aung San Suu Kyi would remain under house  arrest until 1995, ending speculation the Nobel laureate would  soon be freed from nearly five years' detention.    Deputy intelligence chief Colonel Kyaw Win told visiting  Japanese reporters the security act under which Aung San Suu Kyi  was held came into effect in July 1990, and the previous year of  detention was considered an "arrest period."    His remarks came amid mounting speculation that the  diminutive dissident might be released on or around the fifth  anniversary of her detention, next July, because Burmese law  permits house arrest for a maximum of five years. [passage  omitted]    Kyaw Win, meanwhile, said the military government was  willing  to talk with Aung San Suu Kyi if she makes an official request  for a dialog, and the only question was at what level the  meeting should be held. The Japanese journalists quoted him as  saying that the dissident's "rudeness and arrogance" in dealing  with the ruling junta, the State Law and Order Restoration  Council (SLORC), was one factor in deciding whether she should  meet SLORC leaders or lower officials.    The colonel said the junta had let Richardson meet with Aung  San Suu Kyi because he had asked for the meeting "as her  personal friend" and she had agreed to it. Kyaw Win added that  the SLORC was totally unconcerned about international pressure  to release the dissident and would continue to act as it sees  fit.    Richardson and Raheem on Tuesday visited Insein jail, where  Burma holds a number of political prisoners, eyewitnesses said,  before Richardson paid a second call on Aung San Suu Kyi. There  has been no official word on the substance of the meetings.  Terse reports in the Burmese state media said only that Monday's  meeting [words indistinct] place. But informed sources said  Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico, handed a personal letter  to Aung San Suu Kyi From US President Bill Clinton on Monday,  and that she had vowed to continue to champion the cause of  democracy. No Burmese government officials attended the Monday  meeting, but a US Embassy representative and US journalist were  present, reportedly at the request of the dissident herself.  [passage omitted] A source present at the Monday meeting told  AFP that Aung San Suu Kyi looked well: "She is fine. She was  smiling, but she looked a little sad, too." She was wearing a  plain brown Burmese dress when she met with her visitors. She  appeared much thinner, but otherwise in good health, the source  said. [passage omitted]    Richardson met Burma's powerful intelligence chief,  Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, on Monday and was to have met  senior SLORC officials again Tuesday before leaving for Bangkok  in the evening. Richardson is a member of the Congressional  committee monitoring human rights under the Helsinki agreement  and is said to be a close friend of President Clinton.</p>

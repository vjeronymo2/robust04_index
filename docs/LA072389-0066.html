			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MISOGYNY OF IMPRESSIONISM;  </P> <P> UTRILLO'S MOTHER BY SARAH BAYLIS (RUTGERS PRESS: $19.95; 246 PP.)  </P> <P> "I've always been a liar -- it runs in my family," begins Sarah Baylis'  brilliant and biting novel, "Utrillo's Mother." Capturing our attention and  imagination while failing speculation as to the veracity of her story, Baylis  recounts in a series of flashbacks a fictionalized biography of  Marie-Clementine (Suzanne) Valadon (1865/7-1938).  </P> <P> The mother of Utrillo, she was a talented post-Impressionist artist in a period  when the art world was experiencing tremendous growth and upheaval, though it  remained almost exclusively a male domain.  </P> <P> Baylis writes about art and politics, women and sex, oppression, freedom,  self-expression and social stigma from an ardently feminist perspective. Her  vision is frank and refreshing, sparing neither the sacred cows of  Impressionism nor our preconceptions of their world as portrayed in their  paintings.  </P> <P> Baylis' protagonist is brash. She acts without regret or apology. She sells  herself time and again, yet survives on her own terms. We may blush at her  audacious conduct but admire her courage and conviction. Her desire to paint,  to draw, to be an artist overwhelms all else. She sleeps with artists to learn  their technique, models for others to steal tubes of paint or drawing pads.  </P> <P> The novel is multidimensional. Political and social events helped to inspire  the new art and bring on the rejection of the standards of the Academie des  Beaux Arts. Turn-of-the-century artists were caught up in the spirit of  revolution which led them to strike out in new directions and experiment with  new ideas: Impressionism, Pointillism, Symbolism. Much of the descriptive  narrative involves the events of the revolution of 1860, the Paris Commune, the  Prussian War, the turn-of-the-century Parisian cafe society. Baylis gives us  characters which bring to life the period: the beautiful baker's daughter who  paints slogans, the lesbian waitress who introduces Valadon to the seedy  underground. Baylis' descriptions are luscious and earthy, giving us not only  sights and sounds but the odors and the emotional fervor of the moment.  </P> <P> This historical context is equally important in establishing the role of women,  and thus the basis for Valadon's outrage at the injustice she suffers. Baylis  gives a brutal description of the lives of the working-class women of the time  -- their backbreaking menial work, their constant fear of starvation and  poverty, the very hopelessness of their plight.  </P> <P> It is with this reference point that Baylis critiques so strongly Watteau,  Fragonard, Renoir and other artists in their rose-tinted portrayals of  shepherdesses and washerwomen: "Washerwomen were the rage. . . . Contemptible  in real life, they were now almost respectable in fine art . . . but where  slavery exists in a civilized society it must be quickly romanticized, or else  there will be complaints, petitions, fuss and bother . . . and we'll all be  waiting until domesday for our collars and cuffs. The same painted tradition  that had transformed the shepherdess from a dung-smeared illiterate into a  beribboned picnicker changed the lowly washerwoman from a tippler to a giggling  cutie."  </P> <P> Yet, on another level, the novel is atemporal. Valadon's feelings are too real,  too natural: We identify too easily with her fantasies and with her struggle.  Questions of sexual politics, of woman's role in society -- these are questions  that are valid today in our society.  </P> <P> The story begins with Valadon as an old woman, looking back on her childhood on  a farm where she lived with her mother, Madeleine. Her mother is called  Madeleine throughout the book, possibly indicating the tense and angry nature  of the mother/daughter relationship: "We were tied together by poverty and  kinship, hating both and loathing each other, eaten up by love and guilt."  </P> <P> The farm is described in detail, a dark and dirty place seen through the eyes  of an unhappy child. In one episode, there is an encounter with a Gypsy, and we  see immediately the scene through the eyes of the artist: "I wish I could have  painted her like that -- I would have made her green brown, then outlined her  hands with a strong black line and all the colours of her clothes would be rich  and sombre against the turbulent grass."  </P> <P> Having revolted against her insulting and obnoxious employer, Madeleine is  forced to leave, and with child in tow, heads for the city, hoping to improve  her lot. Their lot does not improve. Madeleine finds another menial job and  sends Valadon off to a convent school: "The place reeked of suppressed sex and  the girls were infected by it. We were the most obscene creatures; pornography  was scrawled on the toilet walls and swear words, picked up from our brothers  and fathers were the cornerstone of our language -- alongside that  cannibalistic butcherspeak that religious people use."  </P> <P> After the convent, Valadon holds a series of jobs -- in a hat factory, then in  a restaurant where she becomes a waitress and a pickpocket: "I loved thieving,  it was my chief satisfaction. They had so much it wouldn't be missed. They were  rich old cows in fancy hats and fox furs, who despised me. They deserved to be  inconvenienced."  </P> <P> After the restaurant, a vegetable stand, then, taking a 50-year-old clown as  her lover, a job with the circus. It is at the circus that she meets Theo, her  first artist, and she becomes involved with him and his world, learning from  his work and eventually becoming a model. She models for Renoir and Chavannes,  all the while drawing and painting furiously on her own. The transition from  model to artist of some renown is gradual. She meets Degas, whom she considers  brilliant: "He was called a misogynist, too. If a painter portrays a woman as  she is, that painter will be called a misogynist, a hater of women.  </P> <P> For to portray women with truthfulness is to suggest that you accept them as  they are, and that is the most dangerous thing you can do in the world. Just  think of it! If women are ever accepted as they are -- exhausted, possessed,  angry and bartered . . . then the world will have to change in every single  particle." Valadon ignores the critics and continues her art but is finally  betrayed by her femininity -- she gets pregnant and the son she bears marks  forever her destiny: "Never encourage your son to pick up a brush and dabble  with painting, within a few months they'll say he has outstripped you . . .  they'll do anything to hold a woman back, even use her poor drunken son to  betray her. . . . Christ, it's hurtful this endless punishment of being mother  to a painter." There are more liaisons -- a banker, a painter, and eventually  some fame and fortune.  </P> <P> Although today she is recognized as a gifted artist, a modern reference book  refers to Valadon's work as "violent." If this be the case, certainly Baylis  has created a biography that would explain the violent nature of her work. More  important, Baylis' rich prose brings to life a vibrant and impassioned  character -- a character whose ideas are as truthful and vital in 1989 as they  were 100 years ago.  </P></p>

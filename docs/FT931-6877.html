			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (23): Be wary when they shuffle - Variable-rate investments SAVERS ARE becoming accustomed to facing an annus horribilis every year. Base rates had fallen from a peak of 15 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent at the end of January this year. Those who are dependent on banks and building society savings for their income have therefore seen their income drop by as much as 60 per cent since interest rates were at their peak. For example, Halifax's 90-day Xtra account paid 14.65 per cent gross (adjusted for composite rate tax)in March 1990 on Pounds 25,000. The gross rate in February on the same amount, before reductions in reaction to that month's base rate fall, was 5.5 per cent. Although inflation has been falling during this period, price rises have continued and savers have therefore seen a significant drop in their disposable income. There is little, unfortunately, that savers can do about falling base rates, but they can try to protect themselves against unnecessary losses. The first thing to do is make sure that the account they are in has not been made obsolete. One of the more objectionable practices of banks and building societies is to launch a new investment account, while reducing rates significantly on the account it has replaced. Customers are not individually informed and do not realise the fate of their account. Complaints about this practice to the Building Societies' Ombudsmen increased sixfold during 1991-92, accounting for over 13 per cent of total complaints. Many were in connection with the launch of Nationwide Anglia's Bright Horizons investment range in late 1990. While noting 'widespread dissatisfaction' with this practice, the ombudsmen said that the onus was on investors to be 'vigilant' about their savings, while building societies should make information about new accounts accessible. Since the ombudsmen have not made it incumbent upon building societies to inform customers individually once their account has become obsolete, they will have to do the work themselves. Phoning or going into a branch at regular intervals, as well as checking press notices, is the only way of keeping informed. The elderly should ask relatives to keep an eye out for them. Rates offered on other accounts as well as by competitors should also be checked. Increasing competition in the savings market has challenged ordinary assumptions. For example, there was a time when 90-day accounts offered the highest rates, but a recent analysis of 90-day and instant-access accounts in the FT showed that, in most cases, the 90-day rate was beaten by a postal account. Access to funds in a postal account is between one to two weeks - much shorter than the three-month notice period required by 90-day accounts. It is hard to see any reason not to have a Tessa (Tax-exempt special savings account). These pay tax-free interest if held for five years, but all that happens if money is withdrawn during that period is that tax is paid. Given that Tessa rates are often higher than those of conventional building society accounts, this makes them highly attractive. Offshore accounts are another option. Although UK residents must declare their income for tax purposes, wherever it is held, instant-access offshore building society rates tend to be a little higher than the rates paid onshore. Moreover, it is possible to delay paying tax. Unless the saver is registered as a non-taxpayer, basic-rate tax is deducted at source when the interest is credited on building society accounts held onshore. But offshore accounts pay interest gross which then has to be declared and, in the process, payment of the tax will be delayed. For example, if interest is credited at the beginning of the tax year 1993-94, it does not have to be declared until at least one year later, with final payment of the tax delayed by another few months. With rates as low as they are today, savers should be particularly wary of being lured by 'too good to be true' high-interest promises. Higher rates do not always mean higher risk, but they often do. If the worst should happen and a bank or building society collapses, compensation is available for savers but it is very limited. The Deposit Protection Scheme for banks will cover 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000, in other words, a maximum of Pounds 15,000. The protection scheme for building societies will guarantee to repay 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000. Investors should also be wary of accounts that offer above-average rates to attract investors, only to drop them sharply a few months later. Inertia means that many people fail to spot the change and switch. (See also M for money market funds and N for National Savings.)</p>

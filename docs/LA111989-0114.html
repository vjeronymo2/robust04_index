			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> THE AIR FARE PUZZLE;  </P> <P> SOME CONTEND THAT AIRLINE MERGERS AND DEREGULATION HAVE REDUCED COMPETITION AND  BOOSTED PASSENGER RATES. SHOULD CONGRESS INTERVENE?  </P> <P> Recent reports from the General Accounting Office and Department of  Transportation contend that reduced competition, anti-competitive practices and  capacity limits are raising airline fares. In response, Sens. John C. Danforth  (R-Mo.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) recently introduced the Airline Competition  Enhancement Act. The bill would seek to increase competition by requiring  airlines to sell their computer reservation systems, extend to the airline  industry the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair competition,  revise the current system of takeoff and landing rights, and allow local  airports to tax passengers to finance airport expansion.  </P> <P>  To gather opinions on issues raised by the bill, Times researcher Melanie  Pickett interviewed Alfred E. Kahn, a Cornell University professor and chief  architect of airline deregulation while former chairman of the Civil  Aeronautics Board, and Michael E. Levine, dean of the Yale University School of  Management and former staff member of the Civil Aeronautics Board. Also  included are statements from Danforth and testimony from Robert L. Crandall,  chairman of American Airlines.  </P> <P>  Should airlines be subject to antitrust regulations under the Federal Trade  Commission Act?  </P> <P> Danforth: Airlines are no longer regulated, so the only way they are governed  is through competition. They should play by the same antitrust laws as other  industries. Applying the FTC Act to airlines will allow airlines that suspect  they are the target of unfair pricing techniques to seek relief from the FTC.  It would also enable them to challenge dominant carriers' control of terminal,  gate and baggage handling facilities.  </P> <P> Kahn: When we deregulated the airlines, we certainly did not intend to exempt  them from the antitrust laws.  </P> <P> Should passengers be required to pay a new tax tacked on to their ticket price,  to finance airport construction?  </P> <P> Levine: It is, on the whole, not a bad way to raise money. My concern is that  cities have a monopoly over their own airports (and) cities often have  political agendas other than expanding their airport capacity. The port  authority in New York has for years used the airports as a source for all kinds  of things, whether it was jobs for politically favored contractors or financing  a fleet of buses for their rapid transit system. . . . My prediction would be  that most authorities would raise money from the taxes, use some of it to  expand airports but siphon a fair amount of it off.  </P> <P> Crandall: Personally, I have no philosophical objection to passenger facility  charges so long as the enabling legislation contains adequate safeguards to  preclude their use for any purpose other than airport development. I do  believe, however, that any such charges ought to be part of a cohesive pattern  of taxes and user charges at both the federal and local levels to ensure  adequate capital investment in the airports and airways system.  </P> <P> Should takeoff and landing rights (slots) at airports be reallocated to allow  entry of other airlines?  </P> <P> Danforth: In 1985, we saw one of the great government giveaways of all time  when the Department of Transportation gave airlines, without charge, the slots  they were then holding. The DOT allowed them to buy and sell these scarce  rights, which have commanded prices of up to $1 million each. . . . Slot  holders know that without a slot, no competitor can enter a market with one of  these four airports (Chicago's O'Hare, Washington's National and New York's  Kennedy and LaGuardia) as an end point. Small or medium-sized airlines cannot  afford slots, and even if they could, those holding them will not sell.  </P> <P> Our bill would eliminate the buy-sell rule and recapture the windfall that was  given the dominant airlines in 1985 by taking the slots back and auctioning  them off. The proceeds of the auction would go for airport expansion, which  will help eliminate capacity problems at overcrowded airports. Also, it would  encourage new entry by giving entrants slot preferences and limiting the number  of slots any airline can own.  </P> <P> Crandall: The fact that operations are limited at four so-called high-density  traffic airports by means of a slot requirement is a national disgrace. It  exemplifies the monumental failure of the federal government to fulfill its  responsibility of developing an airport and airways system capable of handling  the growth in air transportation brought about by deregulation. . . . While we  are not opposed to the entry of other carriers into slot-controlled airports,  the withdrawal of slots from incumbents is neither equitable nor an appropriate  method of achieving that end.  </P> <P> A much better approach would be to compel the FAA to add one slot per hour at  LaGuardia and National -- the two airports at which there is unsatisfied demand  by new entrants and small incumbents. . . . The slots provided in this fashion  would appear to be sufficient to meet the needs of new entrant and small  incumbent carriers without disrupting the schedules of other airlines.  </P> <P> Kahn: Various studies, including those by the GAO and the testimony by the  airports people, seem to clearly show that a company is not going to sell its  slots to a competitor. I'm not at all clear why it's the airline companies that  should be permitted to pocket the benefits of scarcity that was created because  there are inadequate slots. It gives an enormous financial advantage to the  companies who happen to be there first.  </P> <P> Should computerized reservations systems (CRS) be removed from control of  individual airlines?  </P> <P> Danforth: Department of Transportation studies have found that travel agents  favor CRS-owning airlines in booking flights. . . . The CRS-owning airline can  outmaneuver its competitors because it updates its own fare and seat  availability in the system more quickly than its competitors' information. CRS  owners charge non-owner airlines a booking fee of about $2 a flight segment.  This gives the CRS-owning airline an annual subsidy of $300 million from (its)  competitors. If a fledging airline attempts to create its own CRS, it finds  that the travel agents have contracts that severely penalize them for switching  from one CRS to another.  </P> <P> Crandall: The view that competition is lacking in the CRS business has always  puzzled me. . . . Although SABRE (American Airlines' system) continues to be  the largest CRS vendor with a market share of approximately 37%, that fact  should hardly be surprising since we pioneered the development of the business  and have consistently offered a system that is technically superior to some of  the others.  </P> <P> Even if American's ownership of SABRE does give it some competitive advantage  as an airline, is that a reason for divestiture? Every airline has some  competitive strengths, just as every airline has some competitive weaknesses.  Many airlines enjoy a much lower cost structure than American because they pay  lower wages and offer fewer benefits to employees. Others enjoy a competitive  advantage in the form of higher yields because of the less competitive  composition of their route systems.  </P> <P> Kahn: American Airlines points out that originally they proposed and were in  favor of computerized reservations systems' being developed by the industry in  concert. It's one of the dumbest things the Department of Justice ever did in  saying they wouldn't look kindly on that. It may well be that the provision of  computerized reservations is best organized as a monopoly serving everybody.  </P></p>

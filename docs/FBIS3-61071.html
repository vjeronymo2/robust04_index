According to American military  sources, its Washington correspondent reported today that last  year's testing of a nuclear devise in the PRC was directly  linked to this work being carried out by Chinese missile  experts, which has allegedly entered the final stage.    The experts believe that the Soviet-built SS-24 and SS-25  strategic missiles, which have an operating range on the order  10,000 kilometers, served as the prototype for a new type of  delivery vehicle. It is their opinion that the nuclear device  exploded at the Chinese test range near Lob Nor lake in October  1993 was nothing other than one of the warheads which make up  the missile's multiple reentry vehicle, and that it had a force  on the order of 90 kilotons. The newspaper reports that the  product of the Chinese missile experts may be capable of  carrying 8-10 nuclear warheads aimed at various targets.</p>

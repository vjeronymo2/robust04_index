			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "Stop, Ferry.... Russian </F> Transit Through Lithuania Still a Problem in Relations Between  the Two Countries"]    [Text] After a period of active contacts between Moscow  and Vilnius which made it possible to conclude a number of  long-term agreements and to withdraw Russian troops from  Lithuania, an incomprehensible lull has set in. The main  problem is still the final draft of the documents on the transit  of passengers and freight through Lithuanian territory between  Russia and its Kaliningrad Oblast. Russia handed over a draft  agreement on this question to Lithuania six months ago, but to  date has not received a reply from its partner in the talks.  Vilnius's official reason for delaying making the necessary  decisions is associated with the fact that the Sejm has not yet  approved the regulations for the shipment of dangerous freight  through Lithuanian territory. But in my view the belief of a  certain section of official Vilnius circles that Russia is  creating a military fist in Kaliningrad Oblast is a still more  substantial obstacle.    "Imaginary" is how the problem of the Kaliningrad enclave's  posing a military danger was described by Viktor Isakov, head of  the Russian delegation at the talks with Lithuania. He stressed  that this is the latest card in the political game being played  by those who have no wish to improve Russian-Lithuanian  relations. Nevertheless, the latest round of talks between the  two countries' state delegations, which took place this week in  Vilnius, did not yield any impressive results. Only two  agreements were signed: on the principles of reciprocal banking  settlements and on cooperation between the customs services.</p>

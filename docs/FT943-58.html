			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (13): Golden rules are difficult to apply - Business ethics / The subject has blossomed in the wake of corporate scandals One of the most flourishing minor industries of the world is known as business ethics. The subject has blossomed since the mid-1980s in the wake of a number of corporate scandals. Some 500 business ethics courses are said to be available in the US and the subject is taught in 90 per cent of US business schools. Europe's first business ethics publication was, no one should be surprised, in Italian. The spirit of the subject is captured by an Economist headline 'How to be Ethical, and Still Come Top'. John Kay, himself a professor of business economics, has remarked: 'If Aristotle, John Stuart Mill and GE Moore could not sort out ethical problems once and for all, it is unlikely that today's business gurus can solve them with a few trite phrases. But untroubled by these concerns, they go on earning more for a single lecture than Aristotle, Mill and Moore were paid in their entire lifetime.' In the last resort, however, business ethics is not a real subject, as distinct from ethics generally. Some philosophers make a distinction between morality itself, which concerns how we should behave, and ethics, which they see as a more abstract analysis of the language of moral discourse. In ordinary language ethics is used to cover both aspects. In this sense there is only ethics and its application to different spheres. Business, medicine, politics and law all throw up their special problems; but whatever our basic morality, it should apply to all these fields as well as personal behaviour. Business ethics has become popular because the complexity of modern business makes it difficult to rely on just a few well-cherished rules. For instance, is the use of insider information a 'victimless crime', or does it do real harm to the interests of others? The problems arise in the economic analysis of consequences. Where there are, however, genuine clashes between different values, no course in business ethics will solve the resulting dilemmas. A frequent business conundrum concerns bribery. A business executive may be strongly opposed to the practice; but if he disdains a bribe from some overseas government official, his competitors may obtain a lucrative order. This dilemma is but a particular instance of the difficulty of applying the golden rule 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you' when others do not observe it. In this case the practice which you would like to see observed is: don't give or take bribes. But what do you do if others will not follow? Become a martyr; or do as others do, even though you are endorsing a pernicious practice? Those who are genuinely interested in moral reasoning rather than striking attitudes will not stop there. The maxim against bribery is a lower level rule of everyday morality, not a final principle. We think that human welfare would be greater in a world without bribery. But either to say 'Never take bribes though the heavens fall' or 'Grow up and do what others do' is equally an evasion. Circumstances need to be examined, including the validity of the maxim itself. In the would-be command Soviet economy the only way of matching supplies to requirements was by a series of side payments and unofficial deals between officials in state enterprises. In these conditions it may have been a duty to encourage such payments to help Soviet citizens lead a slightly less impoverished life. The problems are as great in post-Communist Russia. The journal Business Ethics cites in its January 1994 issue an explanation of why young people are in great professional demand in Russia today: 'Older people have an ethics problem. By that, I mean they have ethics. To survive, I can break a law if I need to and if the risks aren't too large. Older people wouldn't even think in such a way.' Consequentialist philosophers, who believe that rules should be judged by their effect on human or other valued concerns, would be less inclined to condemn this young man out of hand than deontologists, who believe that rules should be observed though the heavens fall. It must be said, however, that most published codes of business ethics are banal in the extreme and give little guide either way. One of the few books on business ethics which has something to say is Just Business by Elaine Sternberg published this year (Little, Brown, Dollars 20). The author was a lecturer in philosophy at the London School of Economics before spending 14 years as an investment banker and is now running her own consultancy. Dr Sternberg has two theses. First, the sole task of business is to maximise the long-term value of the owners' stake by selling goods and services. It is not to exercise 'social responsibility' for crime prevention, urban decay, the education of the young or the provision of managerial advice to government. Thus she has no time for fashionable ideas such as 'stakeholder theory' in which workers, customers and suppliers count equally with shareholders. Nevertheless, her attitude is far removed from the 'devil take the hindmost, anything goes' attitude. For her second main thesis is to insist that everyone in business has a duty to behave ethically. The ethics show themselves in the means used to achieve business objectives, and not in deviating from them for supposedly worthwhile goals. Ethical methods involve 'ordinary decency', which she divides into honesty, fairness, refraining from coercion and physical violence, and respecting the law. By fairness she has in mind, for instance, not deliberately misleading people or building up false expectations. The main problem with the book relates to philosophical foundations on which human beings will always differ. Dr Sternberg believes that ethics is an objective discipline, as knowable as physics, and the same for everyone, everywhere. She has no time for any degree of relativism or subjectivism. This is linked with her belief - following Aristotle - that all activities and objects have essential natures revealed by careful definition. These theoretical matters affect the business practitioner. To take one example: Dr Sternberg's objection to 'social responsibility' is that it misunderstands the nature of business. Her view of business is the mainstream Anglo-American one in which someone who wants to use corporate assets for the benefit of people other than shareholders is guilty of misappropriation, unless a clear prior warning is given. But suppose that law and practice are different? In Japan and parts of Europe corporate directors may be in part responsible to other 'stakeholders'; and there are non-profit making corporations in all countries. The author's response is that such corporations are not true businesses. The question at issue, however, is whether human needs are better served by maximising equity value or by some variant of the stakeholder approach. This is a matter of political economy, not definitions. Behind the arguments of business ethics is the age-old debate about whether or not a businessman benefits his followers most by maximising profits. The English 18th century evangelist and non-conformist, John Wesley, had three maxims: Gain all you can (honestly, of course), Save all you can, Give all you can. A clever undergraduate can show that these maxims are imperfect. But are they as good as we are likely to get in an imperfect world or can we improve them without platitude or self-defeating complication? A businessman absorbed by this question would have to spend so long studying philosophy, political economy, history and (above all) human nature that he would have no time for his proper metier. I have previously suggested that the best short cut might be the study of role models, that is of how specific admired and successful individuals coped with the problems. This would have to be done in a modern idiom, not just copying Samuel Smiles. Who will rise to the challenge? Samuel Brittan considers these matters in much greater depth in his book Capitalism with A Human Face, Edward Elgar (forthcoming).</p>

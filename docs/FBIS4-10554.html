			<p>BFN     [Text] Federal Police have begun to break up the Nigerian  cocaine connection. Police believe that nearly a metric ton of  cocaine per year still leaves Brazil and is taken to Nigeria.  Following a year of investigations, Federal Police unveiled the  daring African cocaine trafficking scheme.    The drug leaves Bolivia, is sold in Sao Paulo for $5,000 per  kilo, and then is taken by the traffickers to Lagos, Nigeria.  There, it is worth $17,000 per kilo. From Lagos, the cocaine is  taken to Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and  Canada, where a kilogram of cocaine can reach the price of  $60,000.    Given the Nigerian cocaine trafficking route, all passengers  on the weekly flight to Lagos are filmed in the airport.  Suspects are followed day and night by police. The tactic has  worked. Since the beginning of the year, Federal Police have  arrested 14 drug traffickers red-handed in Guarulhos  International Airport, Sao Paulo, and confiscated 100 kg of  cocaine from them.    The confiscations reveal that the Nigerians are experts in  camouflaging the drug; for example, drugs can be hidden inside a  spray can that, like this one, can conceal up to 300 grams of  cocaine. Cocaine also was found in the inner soles of tennis  shoes. Drug traffickers normally create double-bottom suitcases.  Nigerians go further. The whole structure of this suitcase is  pure cocaine that, mixed with a resin, has been shaped into a  suitcase. The most difficult way to detect cocaine, but also the  most dangerous for the drug trafficker, is cocaine capsules.  Nigerians can swallow up to 60 capsules at once. They thus use  their own body to hide the drugs.</p>

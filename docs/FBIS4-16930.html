			<p>BFN     [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has not managed to  dismiss Major General Ivan Kolomytsev, chief of the Crimean  Security Service. Despite the fact, so to speak, that an  alternate candidate for the office of Crimean Security Service  chief -- Reserve Major General Volodymyr Lepikov -- has appeared  at the Security Service building, Ivan Kolomytsev has left  neither his office nor duties. Our correspondent Anatoliy  Polonskyy has the details.    [Begin recording] [Polonskyy] The law has won. This was made  possible thanks to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's decree  and a clear position of the Security Service staff, who have  prevented their activities from being shifted from the legal  sphere into politics. The Crimeans have obtained great moral  support from their colleagues from other regions of Ukraine. A  tribute should also be paid to Ivan Kolomytsev himself. During  these extremely hard days, he has shown self-restraint, courage,  and allegiance to the oath. Are Kolomytsev's supervisors  satisfied with his professional skills? I have addressed this  question to Valeriy Malikov, first deputy chairman of the  Ukrainian Security Service.    [Malikov] Yes, we are satisfied. Moreover, as I have been  told, the Crimean president said that he had no reservations  toward Ivan Kolomytsev, while visiting the service and examining  the issue of replacing its chief.    [Polonskyy] Why then did he decide to dismiss him?    [Malikov] Excuse me, but this question should be addressed  to  someone else. I have met here with representatives of the  Presidential Administration and the Crimean Cabinet of  Ministers. I have also met with several representatives of  Crimean political parties and movements, and I have not  understood why such a problem has arisen. Moreover, I have  reached an understanding with the majority of people I have had  conversations with, that this issue must not be resolved in this  manner. There is a legal way of appointing or dismissing the  Crimean Security Service chief. This decision should be  coordinated with the Crimean Supreme Council and, of course, the  Ukrainian Security Service.    [Polonskyy] Valeriy Vasylovych, what could you say regarding  the Crimean press reports on reinforcing your service's military  units in the Crimea? It has also been reported that special  assignment units from Kiev arrived in the Crimea. How would you  comment on this?    [Malikov] As for reinforcing the Crimean Security Service  with our special services, I can assure you, with all the  responsibility, that such a fact has not occurred. Nobody has  arrived here, to reinforce, or do anything else. Regarding  other military units, I have received neither official nor  operational reports indicating that this has taken place here.    [Polonskyy] Is something currently threatening the national  security in the Crimea?    [Malikov] I do not know of any factors which would somehow  influence the national security of the Crimea. I do not know of  anything that would threaten the national security -- something  that exists only in the Crimea and does not occur in other  regions of Ukraine.    [Polonskyy] So, there are no grounds for introducing a state  of emergency in the Crimea?    [Malikov] As of today, I do not see any. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, June 28 (TURAN) -- Baku is deeply concerned  about the statements repeatedly distributed by Armenians  officials in Yerevan and Khankendi (Stepanakert), which report  that "Azerbaijan prepares an offensive towards  Nagorno-Karabakh", an employee of Azerbaijan's Presidential  staff told TURAN.    "Such irresponsible statements do not allow to create  favourable conditions for settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict. Both parties to the conflict have to be responsible  for their activities", reports the same source.    The Republic of Azerbaijan calls upon the Armenian  authorities and the heads of Armenian community of  Nagorno-Karabakh not to break the peace settlement process and  not to destabilize the situation.    On June 25 ITAR-TASS referring to military leaders of  Nagorno-Karabakh distributed a statement about Azerbaijan's  preparations to a large-scale offensive.</p>

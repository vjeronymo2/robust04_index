			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Today's Television Do you believe black entertainers are so hopelessly inferior that, without the help of special separatist enclaves which bar white participants, they will never make it onto television? If so, how do you explain the success of Shirley Bassey and Lenny Henry, Tina Turner and MC Hammer, Derek Griffiths and Floella Benjamin, Rusty Lee and Gary Wilmot, Willard White and Jessye Norman, and dozens of other black comedians, actors and musicians who seem to have triumphed without any such system? The mystery is why broadcasting bosses keep on setting up these insultingly condescending series and why self respecting black people don't boycott them. Latest in the deeply patronising tradition is The Real McCoy (9.00 BBC2). If this had been invented in South Africa Britain's broadcasters would have risen as one man and reviled it. BBC1 mounts a campaign with a difference: instead of appealing for money Light The Darkness (10.20) appeals for people and governments to observe the provisions of the Geneva Convention.</p>

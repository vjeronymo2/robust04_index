Foreign Ministry Spokesman Morteza Sarmadi told IRNA that  such baseless and false allegations indicated not only the  "Cairo regime's helplessness and confusion but also the critical  situation in that country."    Sarmadi expressed "deep regret" that a person at the head of  state level raised "such false claims based on fabrications"  against the Islamic Republic of Iran.    In an interview published in the latest issue of Kuwaiti  daily, AL-QABAS, Mubarak accused Iran of paying US$13,000 to an  Egyptian terrorist to assassinate the Egyptain prime minister.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zamboanga, Philippines, June 8 (AFP) -- Moslem  gunmen massacred 15 hostages, including a Catholic priest, in a  southern island Wednesday apparently to avenge an army assault  against Islamic fundamentalists, the military said.    Maj. Gen. Orlando Soriano, chief of southern military  forces,  said the victims included Father Cirilo Nacorda, his driver, and  13 male schoolteachers, who were part of a group kidnapped  earlier Wednesday in Basilan island.    Their bullet-riddled bodies were fetched by a military truck  from where they were slain and brought to funeral parlors in  Basilan's capital Isabela, 850 kilometres (531 miles) south of  Manila as night fell.    "This is a very inhuman act. They killed them like pigs,"  Soriano told AFP, saying the victims were hogtied before they  were lined up and gunned down.    He said he had asked Basilan provincial governor Gerry  Salapuddin "to do something about this" and help "get the  perpetrators in a few days."    In Manila, President Fidel Ramos issued an order to military  commanders to "launch an all-out offensive" against the killers.    But he also emphasized that the safe recovery of the  remaining teachers still being held, was to "be considered  paramount," a palace statement said.    The palace also said that "the civilian population should be  safeguarded."    Soriano last week ordered an offensive against the Abu  Sayyaf, an Islamic fundamentalist group blamed for a spate of  anti-Christian bombings and ransom kidnappings, and originally  based in Basilan.    At least 30 Abu Sayyaf men were killed in the assault on  their stronghold in Jolo island southeast of Basilan. Their main  camp fell to the military Monday in one of the military's  biggest offensives this year.    Soriano said said the kidnapping and execution of the  captives could be in retaliation for the Jolo attack since the  abductors are believed to be allies of the Abu Sayyaf group.    It could also have been aimed to divert the army's attention  from the Jolo offensive, he added.    Soriano said the Moslem gunmen flagged down a convoy of  vehicles en route to Maluso town near Isabela early Wednesday  and seized 59 persons. Thirty-seven were released and one  escaped, leaving 21 in their hands.    The gunmen separated 15 male hostages, tied their hands,  lined them up and opened fire. The fate of the six female  hostages was not yet known.    Nacorda is parish priest of Matarling town in Basilan and a  member of the Claretian religious order.    His predecessor, Spanish priest Father Bernardo Blanco,  kidnapped for ransom by the Abu Sayyaf last year but escaped.    Soriano said two battalions of marines have been deployed to  cordon off the massacre site, but said there will be no  full-scale operation immediately because this might endanger the  lives of the remaining hostages.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Romie A. Evangelista and Joe Macabalang] </F>   [Text] The on-going peace talks between the secessionist  Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the government may be  stalled further as the latter stood pat on its stand not to  allow MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari to move around Mindanao with 500  armed bodyguards.    The problem could be compounded by the military's claim that  it has uncovered an alleged plot by the MNLF to mount terrorist  attacks in the region aimed at expanding the granting of  autonomy to 13 provinces envisioned in the 1976 Tripoli  Agreement.    Armed Forces Intelligence reports claimed that during a  meeting in Maimbung, Sulu last December, MNLF Chairman Nur  Misuari allegedly issued "secret orders" to his top lieutenants  directing them to resume hostilities against the government.    The instructions were allegedly to spare the provinces under  the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao composed of Basilan,  Sulu, Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur.    Ambassador Manuel Yan, the government chief peace negotiator  said they had not received such reports.    In yesterday's press conference at Camp Aguinaldo, Yan said  the government will not allow Misuari with a brigade of armed  MNLF men.    In Cotabato City, meanwhile, a top MNLF leader said Misuari  "will definitely come" to pursue the stalled signing of his  front's formal cease fire agreement with the government.    "Ang pagdating dito ni Chairman Misuari ay medyo naantala...  lang dahil hindi nagkasundo ang MNLF at gobyerno sa proposal  namin tungkol sa security escorts niya [The arrival of Chairman  Misuari here is slightly delayed because of the disagreement  between the MNLF and the government with regards our proposal on  the size of the chairman's security escorts]," Al Fattah  Abubakar, chairman of the MNLF cease fire committee said.    Abubakar was referring to the MNLF proposal for Misuari to  bring a 500-man armed escort to the city for the duration of the  scheduled signing of the truce in time with the three day  meeting here of the RP [Republic of the Philippines]-MNLF joint  defense and security committee.    The military rejected the proposal and instead endorsed 40  Marines and 40 rebel armed escorts for the government and MNLF  panels, respectively. This amended an alleged standing rule  that allows only 15 armed escorts for each camp.    Sources said such rejection prompted Misuari not to show up  at the compound of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao  (ARMM), meeting venue, and forced the RP-MNLF joint defense  committee members to shorten their three day meeting (from  Monday to Wednesday) to two hours last Tuesday, they said.    But Abubakar expressed optimism that "higher authorities"  will reconsider the MNLF original proposal because, he said, it  was verbally agreed in Zamboanga City last week by him and DND  [Department of National Defense] Undersecretary Feliciano Gacis,  GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] defense  committee chairman.    On the basis of such optimism, Abubakar said "Chairman Nur  Misuari will definitely come" for the signing of the truce,  which contains detailed provisions of the cease fire pact agreed  by the peace panels in Indonesia last November.</p>

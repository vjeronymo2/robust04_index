			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> Charles Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum, has accepted an  invitation to join the Assn. of Art Museum Directors, a prestigious New  York-based professional organization with about 150 members in the United  States and Canada. Membership in the association is determined by the quality  of museums' collections and programs as well as directors' achievements.  </P> <P> Desmarais appears to be the only member from Orange County. Kevin E. Consey,  former Newport Harbor Art Museum director, transferred his membership when he  was named director of the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art last year.  </P> <P> Eleven Orange County artists have applied for Artists-in-Residence grants from  the California Arts Council, nine more than applied last year. A council  official largely credited Orange County artist Mary-Linn Hughes with the  increase. Hughes, last year's sole artists-in-residence grant recipient from  the county, waged a grant awareness campaign of sorts and helped organize a  recent workshop on how to apply for the grants, which pay artists to work in  schools and other community agencies. They are awarded in June.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "President Clinton Survived </F> 90-Minute TV Interrogation"]    [Text] Viewers of CNN have spent 90 minutes with the U.S.  President and his foreign policy. Bill Clinton tried to  convince the viewers that in the world arena "weakness,  indecisiveness, and a lack of principle" are qualities not  characteristic of Washington.    Not one of the journalists or politicians from the United  States, Cuba, Poland, South Korea, Israel, or the many other  countries enabled by CNN to question the president in person was  able to catch him out. The president was steadfast even though  his administration's foreign policy did not become any clearer  after his 90-minute defense of it on live television.    Bill Clinton told Lawrence Pezzullo, the U.S. representative  to Haiti, expelled from the island by the military regime, that  he has not yet abandoned the idea of using military force to  restore democracy there.    He promised North Korea friendship if Pyongyang agrees to an  international inspection of its nuclear facilities where, it is  believed, work is being carried out to create a weapon of mass  destruction.    Clinton is convinced that Beijing has partly rectified the  human rights situation and would thus like to extend to China  most-favored-nation status in trade with the United States. But  the situation is far from perfect. For that reason the  possibility of depriving China of trade privileges remains in  existence.    South Africa was promised an increase in U.S. aid, on which  a  "dream will be built" there [na kotoruyu tam budet "postroyena  skazka"]. As for Bosnia, the problems there "have proved far  more difficult than I imagined when I was running for the  presidency," Clinton said.    President Clinton claimed Russia, the Near East, and trade  problems as the big successes of his foreign policy. But at the  present time the world is in a state of turmoil and is resisting  the attempts of the United States, the world's leader and  guarantor of the universal standards of human rights, to call it  to order. Furthermore, the absence of a second superpower (the  Soviet Union) has, on the president's admission, not made  foreign policy problems any easier.</p>

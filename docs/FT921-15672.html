			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / West grapples with legacy of collective farming years RELUCTANTLY, but with mounting urgency, the outside world is assuming the task of keeping citizens of the former Soviet Union fed through the winter and exploring longer term solutions to an agricultural and distribution crisis of daunting complexity. The European Community, the US and to a much lesser extent Japan, and even Nato, are allocating ships and aircraft, opening their surplus food warehouses and seeking ways of ensuring that aid once given ends up in the hands of the needy rather than the mafia-like successors to the former communist bosses. It is already clear, however, that aid can never be more than a palliative for a problem with roots deep in the most tragic period of Soviet history. The emptiness of foodshops throughout the former Soviet Union may have got worse with the political and economic disintegration of the former Soviet Empire. But the problem stretches back at least to Stalin's forced collectivisation of the early 1930s. He eliminated the vast majority of peasant farmers who knew how to make a living, and condemned the rest to the virtual re-imposition of serfdom under the guise of collective farming. Since Stalin, successive Soviet governments have thrown billions of roubles at the collective farms, and spent an increasing portion of oil revenues on imported grain to build up cattle and dairy herds. But they never managed to solve the systemic failures in the food distribution, processing and marketing system which ensured that higher farm output translated mainly into higher wastage. The absence of a clearly defined owner of the agricultural produce at all stages of the food cycle, the limitation of private farming to small plots, centrally dictated production plans and prices, inadequate downstream investment to keep pace with the rising urban population, the absence of independent wholesale and retail networks all played their part in creating the problem. The demise of communism and the emergence of independent governments committed to price liberalisation and free market reform policies, provides an opportunity to sweep away the dead hand of the 'red barons' who controlled the collective farms. Already, in Russia alone, over 60,000 small farmers have managed to rent or lease land and acquire basic seeds and equipment. Western companies, like UK-based ICI which has been working with collective farms for a decade, have recently been able to set up joint ventures. Western agricultural experts are divided over whether the priority for western assistance and investment should be given to raising farm productivity and food output or reducing the enormous waste by building a modern distribution chain from the farmgate to the consumer. A recent survey on food pricing and distribution policy by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, showed between 30 and 50 per cent of many basic foodstuffs like potatoes and milk got lost or rot before reaching the consumer. Between 1986 and 1990 for example 50 per cent of the average annual potato crop of 72m tons was wasted. A breakdown showed that 11 per cent was lost in harvesting, 10 per cent during seed storage, 17 per cent while stored as food, 8 per cent during processing, 2 per cent during transportation and only one per cent at retail trade level. As part of its search for a valid alternative to pouring food aid down the leaky sieve of the Soviet distribution system the UK government sent a high-level mission of food industry experts to the Soviet Union last October. The essence of the British approach has been to emphasise the integrated nature of the food industry. The government agreed to a mission recommendation to send Pounds 2m of emergency feed grain to prevent the slaughter of expensively built up cattle herds, but has yet to respond to the principal recommendation - the provision of a Pounds 500m export credit line and government-backed political risk insurance to encourage British exporters and potential investors to play a role in constructing a modern farming and food distribution system. The UK Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD) suspended such cover to the then Soviet Union over a year ago.</p>

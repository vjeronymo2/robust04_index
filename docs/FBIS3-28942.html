A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said Pyongyang was  notified that Washington wanted to continue nuclear dialogue and  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board meeting  hinted its wish to conduct inspections to guarantee continuity  of nuclear safety in an interview with the Korean Central News  Agency. The spokesman added that such position was very good,  drawing a great contrast with former angry and threatening  statements from Pyongyang and hinting a change in its position  on the nuclear issue.    "This (statement) is very meaningful change. It raises the  chance of resolving the matter through dialogue," a senior  government official said Sunday.    Although the statement was in the form of an interview and  not an official announcement, it said there was no change in  North Korean position to approach the nuclear problem through  dialogue and urged Washington to act if it really wanted settle  the matter by dialogue.    "It is a great change from the Foreign Ministry statement on  Jan. 31 that threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty if the United States continues to demand  fullscope nuclear inspections," the official noted.    Both Seoul and Washington cautiously view the statement a  remarkable change in the attitude of the Stalinist country.    In Washington, visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu observed that the statement has raised the possibility  of resolving the nuclear matter to some extent.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Tightening up internal controls THE WORDS 'internal controls' act like catnip on accountants: they produce a frenzy of enthusiasm, sometimes for reasons not entirely clear to the outside world. Just such a surge of excitement was created by one of the recommendations of last year's Cadbury committee on corporate governance. 'The directors should report on the effectiveness of the company's system of internal controls,' said the Cadbury code. Since then, an accountants' working party has been fleshing out the details. Its report appeared last week, under the auspices of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Already, critics are complaining about the catnip effect. The report is a long one: six chapters, six appendices and 67 pages. It is detailed, prescriptive and wide-ranging. It includes, for example, the question of how a company seeks to enhance the expertise of its staff, communicate its ethical guidelines, 'evaluate and counsel staff on a formal basis', and assess the risks of technology, currency fluctuations or corporate acquisitions. The recommendations have immediately been criticised: too bureaucratic, too detailed, impossible to implement, say the critics, who include finance directors of some of Britain's biggest companies. Some such opposition was always likely. Much of the original Cadbury report was about the top-dressing of company life: the structure of board committees, the role of non-executive directors, and so on. The internal controls issue reaches deep into the workings of Britain's companies, and correspondingly stirs up more resentment. Nitty-gritty Both sides in the argument have a point. From the accountants' point of view, internal controls are the vital link between the good intentions of a Cadbury-conscious board and the nitty-gritty of daily business practices. Without proper internal controls - and a 'control environment' of honesty and commitment throughout the company - the governance reforms are a waste of time. From the critics' point of view, the report is yet another example of non-economic thinking. Companies are constantly urged to improve this or that internal monitoring system - environmental, equal opportunities, legal compliance, and now financial controls - on the grounds that their objectives are absolute goods, requiring no further justification. Yet all internal systems, for control or information, impose costs on the company, its customers and its shareholders. Collectively, they impose a cost on society that may be equal to or greater than the sum of the benefits they provide. Advocates of better control and monitoring usually place little weight on this possibility; the theme gets only six lines in the working party report. Financial scandals There is plenty of time for the critics to seek to influence the shape, tone and details of the working party document: the deadline for comments extends to February next year. As part of the discussion process, it is worth remembering lessons from the financial scandals that led to the Cadbury report in the first place. One common theme of the Maxwell and BCCI affairs - and of other, less spectacular crashes - was the ability of top managers to distort and manipulate the most vital records of the companies they led. In the BCCI case, for example, loan details were falsified; at the Maxwell companies, transfers of pension fund assets were recorded incorrectly. In these and other cases, the rest of the directors displayed an apparent lack of responsibility for the proper functioning of internal controls. This fully justifies Cadbury's aim of giving directors specific responsibility for assuring themselves that the company keeps proper financial records. It would not, however, justify an overly detailed set of recommendations about how directors should carry out and report on this task. If the working party has gone too far towards detail and complexity, the comment period creates an opportunity for revision. But internal controls matter, to shareholders as well as accountants, and it is important to get directors' responsibilities for them spelt out clearly. There is more than catnip here.</p>

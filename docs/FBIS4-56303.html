			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Congress yesterday approved a law that  will impose the death penalty in cases in which defendants are  convicted of kidnapping children under the age of 12 or elderly  people over the age of 70. The measure is included among the  law enforcement amendments requested by the executive branch.  The law is contained in Decree 38-94, which amends Article 201  of the Penal Code (Decree 17-73).    After President Ramiro de Leon Carpio submitted a request  asking for the death penalty, the Legislative and Constitutional  Issues Committee made some changes and overturned a ruling by  the Government Committee, which requested penalties of only  25-30 years in prison.    Article 201 of the Penal Code now reads as follows: The  abducting or kidnapping of a person to collect ransom or  payment, or to exchange the abductee for a third party, as well  as the committing of other related or similar illicit and  money-making activities shall be punished with a 25-year prison  term. The death penalty shall be imposed in the following  cases: A) should the abductee be under the age of 12 or over the  age of 70; B) should the abductee die, sustain serious or grave  injuries, or suffer permanent physical or psychological trauma  as a result of the kidnapping.    Should the criminal repent at any stage of the process or  provide leads to solve the kidnapping or abduction case  satisfactorily, the corresponding sentence could be mitigated.</p>

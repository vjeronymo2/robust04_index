Trash spills out of the few  containers available, looking ugly and acting as a vector for  "epidemics," as our grandparents used to call insect-borne  diseases. This image, which leaves much to be desired, has two  causes: inadequate trash collections, and the unfortunate  carelessness of those of us who live in the city. We toss things  to right and left as we complain about the city's trash  collection services, not thinking about the difficulties caused  by the fuel shortage and the poor condition of the equipment.  This depressing and ugly situation--which is not seen in other  Cuban cities and provinces--could be avoided if we paid a little  more attention to the beauty of which we boast. I remember the  residents of my neighborhood when I was young sweeping their  little section of sidewalk every day. One of my childhood  memories is hearing people tell us to "listen for the trash to  come," meaning the open carts that at a set time of day  collected, block by block, the cans or bins every resident took  out at that precise instant so that unpleasant odors would not  linger until the air carried them away, and so the flies would  fly after the trash collection vehicle. What do we and the  People's Councils need to do about this?</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Siberian copper deposit to be opened to west ONE OF the largest copper deposits in the world - in Siberia - is to be opened up to international tender by the Russian government in the next few weeks. The project is expected to show a different approach by the Russian government to large international tenders. The government will favour those foreign companies which will join in a consortium with Russian corporations and financial groups and will insist that both equipment and labour is sourced in Russia. The deposit, at Udocan in the Chita region of Siberia, has been estimated to be capable of producing 500,000 tonnes of copper concentrate a year when fully exploited. It contains around 1.3bn tonnes of concentrate containing 1.5 per cent of copper. The site was known to the former, Soviet, government for the past 25 years, but was considered impractical to exploit until the BAM railway, which passes within 90 km (56 miles) of the site, was completed. However, once BAM was finished in the second part of the 1980s, the Soviet government lacked the vast technical and financial resources needed to develop the project. It is now seen by the Russian government as a future flagship project, which will both prove its ability to tender on a grand scale and give Russian companies and managers experience of a world class project. Mr Alexander Rubtsov, managing director of Ernst and Young Vneshconsuklt group, which has been retained by the Chita regional authority to advise on the project, said yesterday that the investment required would be between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn. Initial calculations show that some 2,000 workers would be directly employed at the site, with a further 20,000 in various service functions. Various methods of exploiting the reserves are expected to be proposed, ranging from simple mining and exporting of the ore, through the construction of smelters on site, to the creation of a range of downstream industries to use the copper. The international companies expected to bid for the project include the UK group RTZ, the US companies Fluor Daniel and Phelps Dodge and the Australian company Broken Hill Proprietary. Japanese companies like Mitsubishi, increasingly active in mineral resources, may also be part of future consortia. Mr Robin Bhar, an independent mineral consultant, said yesterday: 'This is one of the most promising projects in the world now. It should get some very much needed foreign investment and it would have a big impact on world production.' Mr Rubtsov, a member of the council of business advisers to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said that Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, had agreed that the tender should lay down that Russian labour and equipment must be used in order to provide experience and to give work to the hard-pressed engineering sector. Mr Rubtsov said: 'If we don't begin to do this in international tenders, it will mean that foreign companies get everything and Russians only a fee. There are now companies in Russia which are ready and willing to act as partners in a consortium and have the resources or can get the resources to work on the international scale. 'There are a lot of businessmen in Russia now who are ready to move from trading, where they made a lot of money, into capital investment in Russia itself. They should now be included as members of international consortia - and Mr Yeltsin and Mr Gaidar agree with this approach.' The head of Russia's gold industry has announced his resignation, warning of a sharp fall in output by 1993 and 1994, the Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper said, reports Reuter from Moscow. It quoted Mr Valery Rudakov, head of the state monopoly for precious metals and diamonds, Rosalmazzoloto, as telling a meeting of the industry's senior figures that he was resigning because the industry had become unmanageable. He said shortcomings in the provision of resources would not send extraction plummeting this year as most inputs were provided more than a year in advance. But a sharp drop in production was inevitable by 1993 and 1994. He gave no figures. While Russia's new government had given enterprises more freedom than under Soviet rule, Mr Rudakov said it had been a mistake to keep them under formal state ownership. No one in his industry knew whose orders to obey any more, he said. 'I am a splinter of the command administrative system and I cannot work when there is no accepted hierarchy,' Mr Rudakov said.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Gardening: Living on memories Those of you with rivers at the bottom of the garden now have gardens at the bottom of the river. I am treating these rains as a finale, atmospheric applause for a previous year which gardeners, like investors, are unable to reproach. From January to January, we have all had a marvellous run. The winters never really froze; once again, the witch hazels are stupendous, my young yew hedge still has a brown complaint which is undiagnosed; these rains may be tiresome, but I am living on memories of a marvellous 1993. The first half-year of English Gardens plc turned in results which no watcher could have predicted. My highlights were endless, from January to June. Winter daphnes took a new turn for me with the discovery that Daphne Bholua Jacqueline Postill will grow and flower madly for all of us, even on lime, if we give it a south or west wall. In late spring, another new arrival, the blue Corydalis flexosa has established itself as a gardener's dream in the various forms which emerged less than 10 years ago from China: the prices are now coming down and this long-flowering plant for slight shade is within reach of all of us in 1994. Among older favourites, magnolias and camellias were marvellous and Indigo, the darkest forget-me-not, reminded me that it is better, though smaller, than all the others. In April, the sight of the best blue Echium, the one called webbii, in Tresco Gardens reminded me that it is the best of these tall, tender forms for frost-free expatriates in the south Mediterranean. In May, I made a note to buy the white-flowered Staphylea colchica because its showers of flower and easy disposition seem to be ignored by most keen gardeners. The spring had remained extremely dry, and suddenly we were plunged into an accelerated heaven. In early June we had the display of a lifetime which rolled an English June and July into one and will live in the memory of anyone who had brought their garden-visiting forwards by three weeks. We had pink old-fashioned roses among the salvias of mid-July and the paeonies of early June. Careful colour-planning went marvellously by the board and all those artful combinations were overtaken by nature's decision to let it all show at once. The half-year ended with a climax of old roses, better than ever because they flowered so profusely and were undamaged by rain while at their best. As usual, I gave the highest mark to the silver pink Fantin Latour, the essential variety for any garden, although it has usurped the name of the great flower painter and its origin remains an unsolved mystery. As Fantin faded, the rain began and the intermittent cold brought the year back into balance. At half-time, the one cloud in the report was the condition of summer bedding-plants and sweet peas, recovering from a dry start to their year. Confounding the experts they then prospered in the third quarter. Summer retained its own magic, despite the rushed results. I fell for Diascia Blackthorn Apricot, whose flowers have a pale colour of rare intensity. We will be seeing it all over the place in 1994 and as a low grower, it may be hardy, although this winter has not tested it. Buy it when you see it, along with seeds of the white venidiums, as easy as weed from Thompson and Morgan and agreed to be the bedding-plant of the year. By September, nobody could say that the second half had lost the momentum of the first. The Japanese Anemones proved equal to all the oddities of the season, reminding me that we should all grow these easy plants and not be deterred by their slowness to settle down in the first year. We had a foretaste of rain, making bulb-planting an ordeal. Against the odds, autumn colour then emerged from the gloom of October and gave us 10 days of astounding beauty. The beech trees were more brilliant than ever and I started to notice the flowers which swept my personal prizes in this year of extraordinary riches. Why are so many of us wary or unaware of the Schizostylis, the Kafir Lily of South Africa? Their rounded flowers come in shades of white, pale pink, strong pink and red and their startling clarity persists into November when this obliging year brought the yellow-flowered Mahonia Charity forward to meet them. For years, books have put me off this late-flowering family by saying that a Schizostylis must have shade or slightly sheltered conditions. I have put mine in sun for the hottest part of the day but they are thriving and growing like mad because they have found a root-run under nearby paving stones and are completely satisfied with the odd soaking. Beside a path or in gaps on a terrace, these late, bright lily-flowers seem to be wonderfully obliging. Experienced growers now tell me that they need water early in the year, from December until May and that this dampness matters more than shade or temperature. As the rains fall, our national pursuit may be a wash-out, but I'm telling myself that my Schizostylis are quietly loving every sodden minute of it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Japan is strongly seeking  North Korea's acceptance of full international inspections of  its nuclear sites suspected of being used to produce nuclear  weapons, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said Thursday  [19 May].    "We think North Korea has yet to allay concerns that it is  diverting its nuclear materials for military use," the top  government spokesman told a news conference.    "We therefore want North Korea to accept in earnest full  nuclear inspections demanded by the IAEA (International Atomic  Energy Agency)," he said.    The IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog,  has started monitoring the changing of fuel rods at a 5-megawatt  experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers  north of the North Korean capital.    But it is suspected that Pyongyang has already started the  process of removing spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor  despite warnings that international monitors need to be present.</p>

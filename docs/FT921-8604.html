			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Wace passes share dealing dossier to DTI WACE GROUP has passed the Department of Trade and Industry a dossier on 13 people who bought more than 3.7m shares (about 9 per cent of the shares in issue) in Parkway Group in the months before Wace bid for it. Six of the group, who bought more than 750,000 shares, are relatives of Mr John Clegg, Wace's chief executive who stepped down suddenly three weeks ago. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Wace's stockbrokers, were aware only of the purchase of 75,000 shares of this total when they handled the takeover, but they received written assurances from Mr Clegg that he was unaware of his relatives' share dealing. Parkway's share register, obtained by the Financial Times, reveals that Mr Clegg's relatives shared addresses in north London with other people who bought Parkway shares heavily in the months before the bid on August 1 1990. Wace's internal investigation has uncovered a pattern of purchases of nearly 2m shares registered at two addresses in Hendon, north London, Belfast, and the Anglo-Irish Bank in Dublin. Mr Clegg was a director of Anglo-Irish Bank but resigned at the same time of leaving the Wace board. The inquiry will also question why two nominee companies in the Channel Islands and Haywards Heath, Sussex, bought 400,000 shares in the months before the bid. Wace's bid of 28p per Parkway share on August 1 was double the previous day's price. However, the Parkway shares had fallen sharply during the spring of 1990 on worries about the company's indebtedness and so only those buying shares in the few weeks ahead of the bid would have made a profit. Some of the deals under investigation which stretch back to late 1989 would have made a loss. Mr Clegg left Wace after rumours - denied by him and the company - of links with the IRA. An investigation by security forces found no such links. But that investigation prompted wider inquiries into the company's financing culminating in a meeting last June with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the police in Sheffield, Mr Clegg's home town, the DTI and the London Stock Exchange's Insider Dealing unit. The DTI is now investigating whether there was insider dealing in Parkway shares.</p>

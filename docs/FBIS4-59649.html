			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  has called for an immediate cease-fire between the rival Yemeni  parties and for the start of a dialogue with help from the Arabs.    In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT newspaper today, Musa  said talks should be the basis of the process to salvage Yemeni  unity and that any military clash will be futile because there  will be no victor, only bloodshed and continuous conflict.    He emphasized that the military conflict strikes at the core  of Yemeni unity because unity should be based on mutual desire  and the converging views of everyone--people and leaders.    On reports of foreign interventions in the Yemeni war, Musa  said there is no information in this regard but there is talk  that there are groups of returnees from Afghanistan who are  pursuing certain goals in some areas of Yemen, but this issue is  under strict observation by many countries.    Commenting on Egyptian-Sudanese relations, Musa said he  intends to visit Sudan soon and noted that he had met with  Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir and Foreign Minister Husayn  Sulayman Abu-Salih during the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as  president of South Africa.    In his interview, Musa discussed Egypt's role in the peace  process, especially on the Syrian-Israeli track. He said Egypt  does not impose its role, but such a role does exist. He added:  Naturally, it is not our policy to intervene in certain tracks,  but the Egyptian role is there and ready to serve the Arab  brothers, including Syria.    Musa said: Egypt does not play the role of mediator in these  negotiations, because we are an Arab state committed to Arab  goals-- that is, a comprehensive withdrawal, the Palestinian  people's right to self-determination, and a comprehensive and  just peace between the Arabs and Israel.    Answering a question on the Lockerbie issue and whether he  had discussed it in his talks with British officials, he said:  We explained our stand on this issue to the British officials,  considering the continuous, intensive contacts between President  Mubarak and Colonel al-Qadhdhafi. Our clear stand is that we  are against any further escalation of this issue.    On the idea of a Middle Eastern market and asked if there is  a strategic Egyptian study of the issue, he said: Of course  Egypt is conducting concentrated studies concerning the region's  economic future in peacetime. However, Musa added, there is no  proposal for a Middle Eastern market; the whole issue is no more  than an idea that has often been floated. He said that there is  no study about a Middle Eastern market and it will not  materialize unless peace is established.</p>

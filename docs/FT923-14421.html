			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: No Mareva for premature claim ZUCKER AND OTHERS v TYNDALL HOLDINGS PLC Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Dillon, Lord Justice Neill and Lord Justice Staughton): May 7 1992 THE COURT has no jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction in respect of a premature claim for specific performance of a contract which has not been breached and is not threatened by prospective breach. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiff appellants, Mr Willard Zucker, three members of his family and Mr Phillipe Grossglauser, from Mr Justice Morland's order discharging a Mareva injunction obtained by them against the defendant, Tyndall Holdings plc, in proceedings for specific performance of an agreement for the sale of shares. LORD JUSTICE NEILL said that by an agreement dated June 2 1989 the appellants were allotted 25 per cent of the shares in a Swiss company called Tyndall Trust. The other 75 per cent were allotted to Tyndall International Holdings, a Bermuda company which was a wholly owned subsidiary of an English company, Tyndall Holdings. The parties to the agreement were the appellants, Tyndall Holdings and Tyndall International. At the time of the agreement Tyndall Trust's share capital was increased. The purpose of the agreement was to enable Mr Zucker and his companies to join forces with the Tyndall Group, and to enable Tyndall Group headed by Tyndall Holdings to obtain access to the Swiss market and to have the benefit of the services of Mr Zucker and Mr Grossglauser. It was a term of the agreement that if control of Tyndall Trust should ever pass out of the hands of Tyndall International the appellants would be entitled to exercise a put option to sell their shares. Article 4 of the agreement defined a 'put option' as the right of minority shareholders to sell the shares at a defined price. It provided that if on or before June 30 1992 Tyndall International, without the appellants' consent, disposed of a controlling interest in Tyndall Trust shares, then the appellants would have a right to exercise their put option against Tyndall International 'at any time after such event, but no later than September 30 1992'. The put option could be exercised by any or all of the appellants by sending a letter to Tyndall International. The agreement was governed by Swiss law and disputes were to be submitted to the non-exclusive competence of Geneva courts. In September 1991 Tyndall Holdings was taken over by another company. That had not been anticipated by the appellants. One of the effects was that Tyndall Holdings shares were no longer going to be listed on the stock exchange. On March 23 1992 the appellants exercised the put option and sent their share certificates to Tyndall International. It was accepted that if there was a valid exercise of the option the three months period for issue of the shares would expire on June 24 1992. On March 25 the appellants began proceedings in Geneva, claiming a declaration that they had validly exercised their right to 'put' the shares, and an order that Holdings and International should pay them SFr6m with interest from June 24. On March 30 the writ was issued in the present proceedings claiming specific performance of the agreement for sale of the shares constituted by notice of exercise of the option. On that day the appellants obtained an ex parte Mareva order. The question was whether the court had any jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction in the circumstances. On April 6 Mr Justice Morland concluded that the nature of the specific performance action was such that any order obtainable until or before June 24 1992 would be merely declaratory. He concluded that the court had no jurisdiction to grant a Mareva injunction. The appeal arose from that decision. It was directed solely to the question of jurisdiction. Section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 provided that the High Court might grant an injunction 'in all cases in which it appears to the court to be just and convenient to do so'. Those words were very wide indeed, but the power conferred by them had been 'circumscribed by judicial authority dating back for many years' (South Carolina (1987) AC 24,40). In the Siskina (1979) AC 210,256 Lord Diplock said the power to grant an interlocutory injunction could only be exercised 'in protection or assertion of some legal or equitable right which it has jurisdiction to enforce by final judgment'. He said a right to obtain an interlocutory injunction was dependent on there being a pre-existing cause of action against the defendant 'arising out of an invasion, actual or threatened by him, of a legal or equitable right of the plaintiff for the enforcement of which the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court'. The principle laid down in Siskina had been applied in a large number of more recent cases. In Siporex (1986) 2 Lloyd's Rep 428 Mr Justice Bingham said it was clear law that 'a Mareva injunction will not be granted to an applicant who has no cause of action at the time of application'. That sentence was cited with approval by Lord Justice Beldam in Veracruz Transportation (FT, November 19 1991). One had to consider what was meant by 'cause of action' in the present context. A Mareva injunction could not be granted unless there was an existing cause of action which could be immediately enforced. In the present case there had been no failure to pay the SFr6m. The attitude taken by Tyndall Holdings was that the circumstances which would give rise to the valid exercise of the put option had not arisen. But it was not suggested that there had been any failure to pay the money at this stage when June 24 was still weeks away and there had been no repudiatory breach. The appellants had the right to be paid but there had been no invasion or interference of that right. As the law stood at present, for the purpose of a Mareva injunction it was necessary to demonstrate that a legal or equitable right had been interfered with or invaded, or such an invasion or interference was threatened - though interlocutory relief could be obtained in certain circumstances to protect an equitable interest even before the time for performance under a contract had arisen. On the facts of the case it was not open to the court to grant an injunction. It had no jurisdiction to do so. The appeal was dismissed. LORD JUSTICE STAUGHTON agreeing, said the question was not whether the appellants had a cause of action, but whether they had a cause of action arising out of the invasion, actual or threatened of a legal or equitable right. It appeared from Veracruz (FT, November 19 1991), the Steamship Mutual case (FT, June 19 1992), Niedersachsen (1983) 2 Lloyd's Rep 600 and Siporex (1986) 2 Lloyd's Rep 428 that it did not cover a threat to break a contract which was not presently performable. In the present case there had been no actual breach, and no threat to break a term which was presently performable. LORD JUSTICE DILLON also agreeing that the appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, said a Mareva could only be granted by the English court in support of a cause of action which the English court had jurisdiction to entertain. The appellants sought to establish in the Swiss courts that they were entitled not to shares but to a money payment being the value of the shares. The Mareva relief was sought in aid of that claim. But the court's jurisdiction to award the money payment depended on Swiss law and Swiss courts, and the English court had no jurisdiction to award it, nor was it asked to. Mareva relief in aid of the claim for the money payment must be premature until the Swiss court had made its determination. The application was premature. For the appellants: Martin Mann QC and Michael Gadd (Jay Benning &amp; Levine). For Tyndall Holdings: John Thomas QC and David Foxton (Turner Kenneth Brown).</p>

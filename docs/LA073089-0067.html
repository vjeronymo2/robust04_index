			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The flight recorders of the Korean Air DC-10 that crashed at Libya's Tripoli  airport Thursday, killing 78 people, have been found, but it will take time to  analyze them, a Libyan official said. Seven Libyans on the ground were among  those killed when the plane with 197 people aboard plowed through houses and  orchards in thick, early morning mist. Mustafa Maghrebi, head of a Libyan  commission of inquiry, said that neither Libya nor a visiting team of Korean  Air experts has the means to interpret the data and voice recordings. There has  been no report that any malfunction might have caused the second DC-10 disaster  in nine days.  </P></p>

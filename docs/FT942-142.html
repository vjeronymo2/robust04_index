			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Books: Cock-a-hoop about the single market - Review THE EUROPEAN UNION: Creating the Single Market By Lord Cockfield Wiley Chancery Law Pounds 9.99 185 pages The single European market programme, once more popularly known as '1992', has been arguably the most significant advance in the development of the European Community in recent years. And since Lord Cockfield was the chief architect of that programme, as senior British commissioner in the first Delors Commission of 1985-1989, a book by him on this subject is worth reading. It has to be said right away Lord Cockfield does not err towards modesty about his performance in Brussels; on the contrary he inclines to a brisk and self-satisfied style of autobiography reminiscent of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery: 'The prime minister instructed me to move my forces to the north. I decided to move them south. And of course events proved me completely right. I won a great victory.' Here's Lord Cockfield on the drafting of the single market white paper: 'Much of the white paper on the internal market I wrote myself by hand and indeed I had started drafting before I even came to Brussels. Having been written originally in English, the white paper is an eminently readable document.' So there] Lord Cockfield is as forthright in depicting his battle to maximise his power base in the new Commission. 'It was, I said, impossible for me, if I was to complete the job properly and quickly, to be put in the position of having to argue with other commissioners and their officials. I would produce the programme; I would consult in such detail as I thought necessary; I would present the programme to the Commission; they could then accept it, modify it or reject it. But I was not prepared to get bogged down in a bureaucratic mess. I was, I said, not simply or primarily a politician; I had run a major British company and I had run it successfully; this was that sort of job and that was the way I wanted to run it.' As the tone of these quotations suggests, Lord Cockfield is not pitching for a readership of technical experts. If anyone hopes to find an in-depth explanation of the single market programme and its 300 legislative proposals, he or she will be disappointed. Apart from a cursory classification of the barriers between member states - physical, technical and fiscal - there is simply no detail about the programme. What we mainly get is a forceful exegesis of Lord Cockfield's broad strategic objectives, and a touchingly one-sided account of his complete success in bludgeoning his way through the bureaucratic and political undergrowth. But the real subject of the book is the long and counter-productive conflict between Britain and its partners. One thing the British have the greatest difficulty understanding, says Cockfield, is that the European Community has an in-built tendency towards integration. 'The Community always goes forward; never backward,' he writes. 'At times progress may be slow to the point where it appears almost to have stopped: but in due time progress will be resumed. If what has happened in recent years is anything to go by, people in this country - with distinguished exceptions - simply did not understand this. They thought they had a tabula rasa on which they could write anything that took their fancy. They did not; and they could not.' But Lord Cockfield reserves his special scorn for Mrs Thatcher's uncomprehending hostility to Europe. 'Deep down Mrs Thatcher was throughout opposed to the Community,' he says. 'She never understood the Community, neither its philosophy, its motivation, nor indeed its actual policies and legal provisions . . . Her support for the internal market programme was largely based on a misunderstanding. She was convinced throughout that the Community was simply a free trade area with one or two additions such as the Common Agricultural Policy, to which she strongly objected . . . She never seemed to realise that the internal market programme meant that all 12 member states had to conform to a common set of rules and this meant in turn that the rules had to be embodied in legislation.' What emerges clearly from Lord Cockfield's account is that Mrs Thatcher was not really familiar with the Community's basic texts, such as the Treaty of Rome. He had a difficult meeting with her on the subject of the harmonisation of VAT rates in Europe (see box). Lord Cockfield implies Mrs Thatcher must also have been unaware that the Community was committed to the objectives of economic and monetary union and of a European social policy, through the Stuttgart Declaration of 1983 and the Single European Act of 1987, both of which she had signed. But in this respect, perhaps, Mrs Thatcher was only too representative of her compatriots. Here is Cockfield on the general attitude of British politicians to the Community: 'They recall little of its history, know nothing of its philosophy; and even more striking is the virtually complete absence of hard, factual knowledge. Perhaps the most trenchant criticism of all is that they were and remain unaware of these deficiencies.'</p>

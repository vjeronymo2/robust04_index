			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Russian Scientists Laud Brazilian Universities"] </F>   [Text] There is a country where the universities have  enough advanced computers and possess well-equipped laboratories  and it is easy to make scientific contacts abroad through  computerized communication networks.    That country is Brazil, and the universities are Sao Paulo's  three state universities: the USP [University of Sao Paulo],  Unicamp [Campinas State University], and Unesp [Sao Paulo State  University], according to Russian researchers who have come here  to work. At least that is the opinion of five physicists and  chemists who participated in last Thursday's debate on "Russian  researchers in Brazil." The debate was sponsored by FOLHA DE SAO  PAULO and coordinated by the retired professor of Russian  language and literature at the University of Sao Paulo.    During the debate, the Russian scientists made it a point to  emphasize that they are not exiles who fled their country. They  were invited by Brazilian laboratories in their fields of  interest and publish articles in international scientific  periodicals. In addition, there were instances in which specific  features of Brazil made the invitation more attractive to the  scientists.    Petr Melnikov, for example, a visiting professor of  inorganic  chemistry at Unesp, came from Moscow University to continue his  research regarding rare earths, a group of chemical elements  with metallic properties, some of which are used in alloys.  According to Melnikov, not only are those elements abundant in  Brazil, but research in that field is advanced in our country.    While praising the laboratories and the availability of  computers, the scientists say they would like to return to  Russia if working conditions were good, and this in spite of  some bitter experiences. Physicist Galina Pugachev says that  members of her institute were forced by the Communist Party to  harvest wheat in Kazakhstan in order not to lose their jobs.    Galina, who is at Unicamp studying anomalies in the magnetic  field -- typical over Brazil -- says that although she has few  colleagues in that area around here, she can talk to researchers  abroad by computer.    "In three minutes, I receive answers from American  colleagues  to my questions on the computers at my university," says Galina.  Her husband, Anatoliy Gusev, says the equipment in the nuclear  physics lab at Unicamp is better than that at many U.S.  universities.    Besides good working conditions, the participants in the  debate drew attention to features common to academic work in  both Brazil and Russia. The level of students is similar, as is  freedom in the style of research -- Brazilians and Russians are  both "looser" than Americans, who are more rigid in orientation.    According to physicist Gregory Surdutovich of the Sao Carlos  campus of the USP, evaluation procedures are also similar.  "There is not a lot of checking either there or here in  comparison with the United States, and I like that. I got tired  of seeing people making out deceitful productivity reports.  Scientific activity needs to be measured by other parameters,"  he explained.</p>

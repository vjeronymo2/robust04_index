			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bonn to limit Telekom fees The German government intends to hold down the costs of the planned DM15bn (Dollars 10bn) privatisation of Deutsche Telekom by keeping a tight rein on the fees of banks handling the issue. Officials involved in the planning for the issue, expected early in 1996, said total fees to banks should be under 3 per cent; this would comprise selling, management and underwriting charges. They said the international trend was to a lower level of fees now the task of assessing investor interest was being made smoother by the book-building process. In the recent Lufthansa privatisation, which raised some DM1bn, fees were just above 3 per cent. This would mean a fee total of DM450m or so for the Telekom issue - in which 25 per cent of the shares will probably be sold off in the first tranche - compared with the DM400m or less the government is considering. The choice of banks to head the issue has still to be made. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank are expected to share overall management. Deutsche is likely to handle the international side - it said a week ago it was basing its investment banking activities in London - and Dresdner domestic sales. Several UK, US and Swiss banks are vying for the role of global co-ordinator; one will also advise the government. The officials said the government was keen that the Telekom issue should help promote the concept of share ownership among the German public and also encourage companies to offer more employee shares. Not enough companies and employee representatives took advantage of tax concessions intended to encourage employee share ownership. Nor is Germany as equity-conscious as some other countries like the US or UK, they noted. Only 6 per cent of German households own shares and their private financial assets of some DM4,000bn include only 5 per cent in equities and more than 40 per cent in bank deposits. The government does not want Telekom shares priced especially low just to encourage small investors but it would like banks to reduce or waive (for, say, two years) handling fees for shares deposited with them by private investors.</p>

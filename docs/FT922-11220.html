			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / German coalition majority fading, according to opinion poll Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition in Germany is no longer supported by a majority, while the far right Republicans are creeping up in popularity, according to the latest national opinion poll, writes Quentin Peel. The monthly survey in the weekly magazine Der Spiegel shows Mr Kohl's own Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU) slipping to 37 per cent support, a drop of 3 points over the past month. At the same time the Republicans, who won seats for the first time in the Baden-Wurttemberg state parliament earlier this month, increased their support by the same amount - from 2 to 5 per cent  - just enough to get seats in the national parliament, if there was an election tomorrow. The opposition Social Democrats pushed up their support from 38 to 39 per cent, and the Free Democrats, junior partners in the Kohl coalition, maintained their support at 10 per cent. The Greens slipped marginally from 7 to 6 per cent. The poll, confirms that the issue of controlling the inflow of asylum seekers is the single most important issue for west German voters. East Germans are more concerned about unemployment.</p>

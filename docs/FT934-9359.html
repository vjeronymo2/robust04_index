			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Kenyan post chief quits after criticism THE managing director of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has chosen to take voluntary retirement following concerns expressed by Kenya's donors of financial mismanagement and corruption in the public utility. Mr Kipng'eno arap Ng'eny said he thought it was 'wise and desirable to retire' after 14 years at the head of KPTC. Mr Philip Okundi, managing director of the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, has been appointed to replace him. Mr Ng'eny's departure follows an intense campaign by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for a complete overhaul in the way KPTC conducts its business. In an auditor-general's report, KPTC was criticised for channelling funds to insolvent local banks and for failing to remit to the Treasury the 18 per cent value added tax it charges on telephone bills. It is also in arrears on its foreign debt and in its contributions to the National Social Security Fund. The company, with a payroll of 30,000 employees, is seriously overstaffed. President Daniel arap Moi's government has promised to reform the parastatal sector in order to win back financial assistance suspended by donors in 1991. The World Bank is hosting a meeting in Paris this month to discuss the resumption of international aid to Kenya. Mr Dalmas Otieno, the minister for transport and telecommunications, yesterday denied that Mr Ng'eny had been involved in any financial impropriety at KPTC. 'Mr Ng'eny is not under investigation, and we have no intention to investigate him,' he said. 'We are not looking for criminals, just ways of enhancing the efficiency of the parastatal sector,' Mr Otieno said.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Russia, Germany in gas talks Russian and German gas industry leaders met in the Black Sea resort of Sochi yesterday to discuss marketing strategies and future co-operation, company sources said. The talks were attended by the heads of the German gas companies, Ruhrgas and BASF's BASF. F Wintershall Group, and Mr Rem Vyakhirev, chairman of Russia's Gazprom monopoly. The company sources believed this was the first time the German groups, which are fierce competitors at home, had held joint talks with Gazprom. Wintershall, a relative newcomer to the German gas business, says it has taken an eight per cent share of the domestic market, traditionally dominated by Ruhrgas. Both companies are supplied by Gazprom. The Russian company says it would like its big German clients to make peace. 'I not only want this very much, I'll fight for it,' Mr Vyakhirev said in a recent interview. Reuter, Bonn</p>

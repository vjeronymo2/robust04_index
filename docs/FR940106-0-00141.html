			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has reconsidered these matters and agrees that the comments on ``satisfactory progress'' have merit. References to ``satisfactory progress'' have therefore been removed from &sect;&sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(D), 617.15(b)(3), 617.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii), and 617.18(b)(2)(i). The references to ``successfully'' completed and ``satisfactory'' completion of training are also removed from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii) (A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and (D)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). However, the conditions for ``completed training'' in &sect;617.11(a)(2)(vii)(D)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are retained. To meet the requirements of section 231(a)(5) of the Act, it is reasonable to expect an individual who completed a training program to have satisfied the standards or conditions for the training program and, therefore, to have ``successfully'' completed such training in order to be job ready. Further, in connection with making this correction in &sect;617.11(a)(3)(i)(D), the language is modified to make it clearer that an individual must actually be enrolled in or participating in approved training in each week that TRA is claimed, and that, while the break in training provisions of &sect;617.15(d) apply, the waiver of participation provisions of &sect;617.19 shall not be applicable under paragraph (a)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Waiver appeals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PDLI commented that &sect;617.19(a)(2) provides the minimum information that shall be contained on the waiver of training participation. (&sect;617.19(c)(3) provides for equivalent information on the waiver revocation form.) These minimum information items do not include an appeal date, or instructions for appeal. However, &sect;617.19(c)(4) appears to state that waivers and waiver revocations shall be appealable. The PDLI suggests that the issuance of waivers and waiver revocations should not be appealable determinations; rather, these documents are prerequisites to determinations of entitlement to TRA payments, and these latter determinations should be appealable. The PDLI recommends further evaluation of this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1975 regulations required that all determinations relating to TAA program benefits shall be subject to appeal and review, as specifically required by section 239(d) of the Trade Act of 1974. That requirement continues in effect and is correctly implemented in the regulations in providing that &sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 shall apply to all determinations regarding waivers, as well as any determination pertaining to any other TAA program benefit. Waivers have a direct relationship to basic TRA entitlement. The Department does not believe it would be appropriate to provide that an individual should be denied the right to appeal a determination issued by the State agency that training is not feasible or appropriate, or that written notice of such determinations (granting, denying, or revoking a waiver) should not include notice of appeal rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consideration of the comments, however, reveals that there appears to be some lingering uncertainty about the scope of the waiver provision and the appeal rights of individual workers, and the reexamination of the language proposed for &sect;617.19 underscores the need for some clarification of the regulatory language so as to express the scope of the waiver provision more accurately and to declare unmistakably the appeal and review rights of individuals in regard to all determinations relating to waivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;617.19 thus is revised to state more accurately the scope of the waiver provision, and to state explicitly that a waiver pertains solely to basic TRA and may never be made applicable to additional TRA. Paragraph (a)(2) is revised so as to be more explicit about the application of the waiver provision, and to provide that waiver determinations shall include all of the information required by &sect;617.50(e), which thereby requires inclusion of notice of appeal rights in any such determination. This is in addition to other information specified in paragraph (a)(2) that is required to be furnished in the determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other important changes in paragraph (a) of &sect;617.19 are the addition of clauses (3) and (4). Clause (3) is added to make certain that denial of a waiver also is a determination to which all of the requirements for determinations apply. Clause (4) is a restatement of the provision proposed in paragraph (c)(4), and is moved in paragraph (a) and revised to make more explicit the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 to all determinations under paragraph (a) and to provide expressly that this means and includes notice of appeal rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

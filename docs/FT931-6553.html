			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: Iron hands in velvet gloves - Sponsorship Companies can expect to have their arms twisted more gently and effectively in future by the development officers of arts organisations whose task it is to drum up sponsorship money. The arrival on the scene of full-time development officers has transformed the sponsorship industry: on average, development officers will have raised around Pounds 125,000 for their arts groups last year. Last month, WH Smith sponsored, with Business in the Arts, a residential course for 16 development officers with the aim of improving their skills in persuasion and negotiation. The presence of a successful revenue raiser in an arts company takes a great burden off the shoulders of the chief executive. Artistic directors and museum directors have spent too many hours being nice to potential and existing sponsors. No wonder that good development directors are regarded as worth their weight in gold. The heavily over-subscribed course, which attracted executives from the National Theatre, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Aldeburgh festival, and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, will be repeated. Mixing business and the arts at an even more senior level is also proving a rewarding experience. In January five arts managers, including Stephen Remington, chief executive of Sadler's Wells, and Bubble Lodge, chief executive of the Everyman, Cheltenham, won bursaries which will send them to institutions such as the Cranfield School of Management. English Estates will put up about Pounds 10,000 towards their fees. So far, 23 arts executives have already received intensive management training through the bursary scheme. In addition there is the Business in the Arts placement programme which works the other way, seconding corporate managers with special skills - in computing, accountancy, marketing - to advise local arts organisations. To date there have been 250 such mind-expanding experiences. IBM has always been a stalwart sponsor of the arts. In cash terms its commitment is not amazing, about Pounds 400,000 a year, but it has been supporting them for more than 20 years. For most of this time Peter Wilkinson supervised the budget. Last year, to cut costs, IBM shed all its marketing departments. A new company, Comark, was established, mainly staffed by ex-IBM personnel, to supply advertising, PR, and marketing services generally to IBM under a five-year contract. Wilkinson's sponsorship department, which includes sport and the community, is part of Comark, and twice a year now he makes proposals to the thinned-down IBM management. So far there has been little change to the arts programme. The budget, while not increased, has not been cut, and the bias remains towards youth projects and the creation of new events with a community appeal. Corporate entertaining scarcely features. You could hardly get more innovative than 'Da Capo - From the Beginning' at the Royal Academy of Music, which IBM is sponsoring from March 8. It is a five-day festival of works by 57 living composers all of whom studied at the Royal Academy. Rodney Bennett, Maw and Tavener are composers in residence and there will be pieces by Birtwistle, Berkeley, Dankworth and many, many, more. ***** Companies are very reluctant to sponsor big, elitist, arts events in the current climate. More and more of the budget is being directed towards community, environmental, or charity causes. This is true at Thorn-EMI which has a corporate budget of about Pounds 750,000 for good works, including the arts. Last year it made a big promotional splash and invested Pounds 400,000 in touring Europe with Beethoven's Broadwood piano. This year arts expenditure is going towards such events as National Youth Theatre workshops in Feltham Prison; a residency by London Contemporary Dance at the Brimble Hill Special School; and Pounds 40,000, over three years, towards Music for Youth. Tomorrow it is underwriting a charity evening for the new musical Crazy For You which will benefit the Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood Trust by Pounds 80,000. Even the guests of chairman Colin Southgate will be expected to pay for their tickets. ***** A major new award for the arts, worth Pounds 100,000, has been announced. Each year the Vivien Duffield Foundation will present the Vivien Duffield Award to a British performing arts company to allow it to mount a project which would otherwise be beyond its means. The first recipient is Welsh National Opera, which next winter will present three operas based around the Cinderella myth. Nine other opera companies were asked to suggest ideas. Theatre companies will be approached for the 1994 award, and in subsequent years dance and classical music will benefit. ***** On the same theme the RSC is looking for a sponsor, or two, for the Prince of Wales Shakespeare School. The Prince is keen that Shakespeare should be taught in schools and he is putting his influence behind two 12-day courses at the RSC's Other Place theatre in Stratford in the summer at which 70 teachers will be trained by RSC experts. The cost of the venture is Pounds 90,000, and the Prince will be putting in an appearance. ***** British Telecom is enjoying itself as the UK's leading arts sponsor. It has now upped its 1993 budget to Pounds 1.8m, way ahead of any competitor, and is displaying its market leadership by getting into bed with the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, the industry pressure group. In future it will help fund ABSA seminars, literature, and general proselytising work. Last year's BT New Contemporaries art show is currently on display at the ICA in London at the end of its tour and BT has committed itself to sponsor the 1993-94 show, with about Pounds 65,000, starting in Manchester in June.</p>

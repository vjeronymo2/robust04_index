			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Restructuring leaves Yeoman with IPounds 137m loss CLF YEOMAN, the Dublin-based asset finance company, returned profits of IPounds 7.28m (Pounds 6.8m) pre-tax for the 18 months to end-August 1991. That compared with profits of IPounds 8.46m for the year to February 28 1990. A tax charge of IPounds 18.71m (credits IPounds 2.38m) and restructuring charges of IPounds 125.55m, which were taken below the line as extraordianry items, left the company IPounds 137m in loss for the 18 months. Along with the results the company gave further details of the sale of CLF Holdings, its troubled UK ticket leasing subsidiary. The offshoot was disposed of 'for a nominal amount' as part of a planned restructuring of the CLF Yeoman group which the board proposes should be renamed Yeoman International. Yeoman is involved in litigation arising from the acquisition of CLF but has reached agreement with its syndicate banks on the chief points involved in restructuring the Pounds 39m debt which helped fund the purchase of CLF.</p>

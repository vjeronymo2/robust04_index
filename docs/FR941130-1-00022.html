			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Relocating the slide's elastic cord ``bungee strap'' attachment point and shortening the elastic cord. This will prevent the main restraint strap of the slide from being ingested into the turbo fan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Modifying and making other changes to the regulator assembly, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifying the regulator cartridge engagement sleeve by the addition of drilled holes to prevent the potential for pressure differentials that could cause the regulator to shut down; installing a revised burst disk to prevent galling when tightening the cartridge assembly; changing the type of lubricant to reduce friction forces; and installing a new regulator release pin with a baked-on lubricant to provide a consistent release force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Replacing the turbo fan flapper retaining roll pins. This will prevent breakage of the pins, thereby preventing the possibility of the flapper falling out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Replacing the original bottle relief valve assembly (P/N 5A2644&hyph;4) with a safety plug assembly (P/N 3A3259&hyph;3); and adding a charge fitting on the reservoir safety plug assembly to allow for bottle charging after the modifications described above have been accomplished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require modifying the stretched upper deck evacuation slide by relocating the elastic cord ``bungee strap'' attachment point and shortening the elastic cord; modifying the regulator assembly; and replacing the turbo fan flapper retaining roll pins. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators should note that this proposed AD is applicable to the manufacturer of the airplane model on which the evacuation slides are installed, rather than to the manufacturer of the slide. The FAA's general policy is that, when an unsafe condition results from the installation of an appliance or other item that is installed in only one particular make and model of aircraft, the AD is issued so that it is applicable to the aircraft, rather than the item. The reason for this is simple: Making the AD applicable to the airplane model on which the item is installed ensures that operators of those airplanes will be notified directly of the unsafe condition and the action required to correct it. While it is assumed that an operator will know the models of airplanes that it operates, there is a potential that the operator will not know or be aware of specific items that are installed on its airplanes. Therefore, calling out the airplane model as the subject of the AD prevents ``unknowing non-compliance'' on the part of the operator. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (The FAA recognizes that there are situations when an unsafe condition exists in an item that is installed in many different aircraft. In those cases, the FAA considers it impractical to issue AD's against each aircraft; in fact, many times, the exact models and numbers of aircraft on which the item is installed may not be known. Therefore, in those situations, the AD is issued so that it is applicable to the item; furthermore, those AD's usually indicate that the item is known to be installed on, but not limited to, various aircraft models.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 900 BFGoodrich stretched upper deck evacuation slides of the affected design installed on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes worldwide. The FAA estimates that 100 of these slides are installed on airplanes of U.S. registry that would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take approximately 4.5 work hours per slide to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,402 per slide assembly. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $167,200, or $1,672 per slide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Ford moves 300 R&amp;D jobs to Germany FORD's restructuring of its European research and development operations will consolidate them at its sites at Dunton, Essex, and Merkenich, near Cologne in Germany. As part of the restructuring, announced earlier this week, about 300 jobs are to be transferred from the UK to Germany and 20-30 jobs will be moved from Germany to the UK. Ford's Aveley engineering site, about 10 miles from Dunton, will close. Ford said there would be no compulsory redundancies. In the UK, Ford plans to move by the end of 1994 1,200 engineering staff from satellite operations at Aveley, Basildon and Dagenham in Essex to the main R&amp;D site at Dunton, where the total workforce will be increased to nearly 4,000. In Germany, about 1,300 staff are to be relocated to Merkenich from other sites in Cologne. That will bring the total at the site to about 3,300, including the 300 jobs transferred from the UK. The engineering reorganisation follows a far-reaching review by Ford of its European automotive operations, which had a net loss last year (including Jaguar) of Dollars 1.079bn (Pounds 605m) from a net profit of Dollars 145m in 1990. Mr John Oldfield, Ford of Europe vice-president for product programmes, vehicle and design, said the company was seeking to bring together design engineers and production engineers at one site so that 'we can achieve better communication and teamwork and thereby generate significant quality and efficiency gains'. Ford says it has to spend 10 per cent to 15 per cent more than rival carmakers in Europe to have its R&amp;D operations split between the UK and Germany. However, it emphasised its continuing commitment to research and development in the UK yesterday. The company said it had invested heavily at Dunton, where the site facilities had a total capital value of about Pounds 500m. It was planning capital investment totalling Pounds 40m at Dunton this year, having spent an average of Pounds 20m a year there since 1985. Research and development expenditure at Dunton totalled Pounds 236m last year. Further jobs would be created at Dunton over the next three years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 7 TASS -- Prominent political expert  and head of a group in charge of national politics of the  presidential council, Emil Pain, believes that promoting the  activities of joint institutions of the CIS is a way for  strengthening the Commonwealth of Independent States.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS Pain said that prospects of  the Commonwealth depend not on territorial integration, but on  the creation of joint structures which would perform the  functions of the court of arbitration -- coordination of  opinions, ideas and settlement of disputes.    Pain believes that the existence of such institutions might  help resolve many problems which nowadays lead to conflicts.  "For example, the revival of the idea of joint armed forces  would practically resolve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet.  The Black Sea Fleet would be subordinate then not to Russia or  Ukraine, but to the joint armed forces of the Commonwealth,"  Pain said.    If there were a single Eurasian bank for reconstruction and  development, it would to a considerable extent promote the  solution of problems of the monetary union, while a bank in  support of refugees and resettlers would help regulate migration  processes, he said. The expert believes that on the one hand,  the optimum concept for the CIS consists in the development of  integration structures, and on the other hand, in the idea of  selective partnership at the level of bilateral relations which  cannot be avoided.    Pain thinks that "Russia must take a cautions and selective  approach to unions with its neighbours and aid to them. This  partnership should rest not on the prospect of joining other  territories to Russia, but on ensuring stability and safety of  its borders."    "In this sense, stable countries deserve better aid from  Russia," Pain said, adding that Russia can be satisfied not with  any kind of stability, but rather with stability which is based  on the operation of democratic institutions.</p>

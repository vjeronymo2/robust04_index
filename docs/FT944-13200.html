			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Country Casuals drops Pounds 1.49m into the red Shares in Country Casuals yesterday fell 6p to 82p - a record low since its 1992 flotation - after the women's wear group reported interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.49m. The group blamed the losses on the launch of Elvi, its larger women's brand, and the expansion of Koto, its fashion chain for younger women. The results were the first since the departure last month of Mr John Shannon, chief executive and chairman. Mr Shannon resigned the day after a profits warning led to the group losing more than a fifth of its market value. The deficit for the six months to July 23 compared with profits of Pounds 117,000 last time and Pounds 2.62m for the full year. This was despite a 20 per cent advance in turnover to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 16.5m). Mr Mark Bunce, chief executive, said: 'We were too ambitious about the size and speed of the shop opening programme which, with our prudent attitude to property risks, led to significant delays.' Elvi reported an operating loss of Pounds 1.59m, with the majority of its 52 stores opening in the second quarter rather than the first as planned. Mr Bunce said there had been 'too short time a period in order to gather enough data to project future sales growth.' Koto, the repackaged chain of 11 stores which were first opened under the Wild Women name, suffered from leasing problems and incurred an operating loss of Pounds 605,000 (Pounds 235,000). The company is now considering its future. However, the core Country Casuals brand increased operating profits from Pounds 195,000 to Pounds 323,000. Mr Tom Adam, chairman, said that like-for-like sales in the 166 shops rose 7 per cent in the first two months of the second half. Lerose, the manufacturing division, increased operating profits fivefold to Pounds 261,000 (Pounds 49,000) after attracting more external orders. Losses per share were 4.97p, against earnings of 0.41p. The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 1.41p. COMMENT Country Casuals has underperformed the sector for almost 18 months, in stark contrast to Moss Bros, the men's wear retailer, which reported on Monday. While Country Casuals has been forced to discount its Elvi and Koto stock, Moss Bros protected its margins and pursued a cautious expansion strategy. Pre-tax profit forecasts for the full year range widely between Pounds 500,000 and the house broker's Pounds 1.5m, the latter putting the group on a p/e of about 15 at yesterday's close of 82p. The risk seems more on the down side.</p>

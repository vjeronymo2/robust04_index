			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A matter of wording I have inherited a piece of freehold land from an aunt. She inherited this from her husband but died before a vesting assent could be made in her favour. An assent is now being made in order to vest the land in my aunt before, in turn, it can be vested in me, but I am querying the wording. It says: 'The executors hereby assent to the freehold land (described) having been vested in Mary Smith who died on January 5th 1994 . . .' But the land was not vested in her, was it? Should the wording be changed in order to give good title? As, of course, it is not possible for a dead person to have property vested in them, the correct procedure, in our opinion, would be for the executors of your uncle to assent to the land being vested in yourself. Your aunt need not be mentioned in any vesting document. (Answer by Murray Johnstone). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

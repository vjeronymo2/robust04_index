			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A bigger dose of gloom ABBEY NATIONAL this week offered cold comfort to those finding difficulty in meet their monthly mortgage payments by predicting it would take another three years before the number of repossessions fell. The UK's second-largest lender believes that 64,000 homes will be repossessed this year, with another 62,000 in 1994 and 59,000 in 1995. The record figure was in 1991 when 75,540 homes were repossessed by lenders. The forecast is based on gloomy predictions on employment and house prices. Abbey expects unemployment to continue rising until 1994 from 2.9m at present to 3.3m. It also expects house prices to fall by a further three per cent this year but expects them to rise by two per cent, five per cent and seven per cent respectively in the following three years. Final figures for repossessions in 1992 will be released later this month. There were 35,750 repossessions in the first half of of the year and the Council of Mortgage Lenders says it expects the total to be about 70,000. The reduction in repossessions is thought mainly to be the result of increased flexibility by lenders, rather than fewer people falling into mortgage arrears. The council has said that lenders preferred to accept reduced monthly payments from their borrowers rather than take possession of a house which, in an already depressed market, might take some time to sell, and could sell for less than the value of the outstanding mortgage. One consequence of a more flexible policy by lenders has been a significant increase in the number of those falling into mortgage arrears. The council estimated 89,000 borrowers had fallen behind in their payments at the end of 1989, rising to 300,000 by the end of last June. Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, said this week that while the number of repossession orders in England and Wales had dropped by 16 per cent from 55,563 in 1991 to 46,422 last year, it had been offset by the number of suspended orders. These had increased by six per cent during the first nine months of last year compared with the same period in 1991 - from 50,127 to 53,150. The process meant a possession order was made in favour of the lender but was then suspended if the borrower agreed to comply with certain terms. If those were broken, the possession order took effect. Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, the housing charity, said: 'Unless there has been a realistic assessment of repayments, this suspended order is equivalent to a repossession.' According to Shelter, the number of homeowners threatened with repossession and seeking advice at its centres increased by 50 per cent last year. Meanwhile, mortgage holders should still contact their lenders if they foresee payment problems.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APARTMENTS GET NEW NAME: METROPOLITAN  </P> <P> Skyline Two, the $45-million apartment complex being built in the South Park  area in downtown Los Angeles at 950 S. Flower St., has been renamed the  Metropolitan, according to Dianne Severance, project manager for Forest City  Properties Corp., the Los Angeles-based developer.  </P> <P> Severance said the new name will give the apartment project, the first in South  Park, a separate identity from the adjacent Skyline condominiums. They were  completed in 1983.  </P> <P> Greg Serrao, principal of Dworsky Associates of Los Angeles and the architect  in charge of the Metropolitan apartments, said the complex "will be like a  downtown resort -- an oasis complete with palm trees."  </P> <P> The project, he said, is an opportunity to create a pleasant residential  environment in what had been a neglected light industrial area.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: TRANSPORTATION  </P> <P> Hawaiian Connection: Honolulu is 3,000 miles to the west but there is still a  strong business link with Orange County (among other things, local companies  such as Ocean Pacific and Quiksilver make half the Hawaiian shirts that are  sold to tourists over there).  </P> <P> And it is getting stronger, as witnessed by these two transportation industry  items:  </P> <P> * An investment group led by Newport Beach attorney J. Thomas Talbot is moving  merrily along with its plans to acquire control of HAL Inc., the Honolulu  holding company for Hawaiian Airlines and the West Maui Airport. Talbot said  the recent tumult on Wall Street, sparked in part by the collapse of financing  arrangements for the $6.7-billion United Airlines buyout, won't affect his  group's more modest $22-million to $43-million bid for between 51% and 100% of  HAL.  </P> <P> * A Santa Ana firm, Dave Systems Inc., is one of seven companies bidding for  contracts to operate Honolulu's municipal bus system. The current operator, MTL  Inc., also is among the applicants, as are three Hawaiian tour companies --  Gray Line Hawaii, Rainbow Tours Inc. and Robert's Hawaii Inc. -- and two more  mainland firms, ATE Management and Service Co. Inc. of Cincinnati and Transit  Marketing/Laidlaw Transit Inc. of Concord in Northern California. Dave Systems  operates several municipal bus systems and dial-a-ride programs in California.  </P></p>

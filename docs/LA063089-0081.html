			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A REAL LIFE 'WEST SIDE STORY' ON THE STREETS OF LA VERNE  </P> <P> Jason and Yolanda fell in love last February.  </P> <P> He was an 18-year-old high school dropout and former neo-Nazi "skinhead"  working the counter at a fast-food outlet in La Verne.  </P> <P> Then Yolanda walked in, a pretty girl of just 15 with a frizzy mane of teased  hair looking for part-time work, something to distance her from the street gang  that, despite her protests, still considered her one of its own.  </P> <P> Jason trained her to ring up sales and take food orders from customers. One  month later they were living together with Yolanda's mother in a humble house  by the railroad tracks that pass through this San Gabriel Valley city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Barrio Gang  </P> <P> But members of the 1st and B Street Boys, a small barrio gang that Yolanda has  tried to flee, have not given their blessing to the budding cross-cultural  romance. Bristling at the sight of an Anglo youth with a Latino girl, they have  hurled bottles and epithets and threats. They have made so much trouble for the  pair, in fact, that Jason and Yolanda's affair has now become a regular entry  in the La Verne police log.  </P> <P> Officers -- who have likened the romance to a street-gang version of Romeo and  Juliet -- are so concerned that someone might get badly hurt that on Tuesday  night a patrol car was cruising past the couple's house every few minutes. On  Wednesday, Jason was given a police escort while driving in and out of town.  And on Thursday, charges of prowling were filed against four of five youths  suspected of pounding on the windows of the couple's house two weeks ago.  </P> <P> In all, officers have made 10 arrests of gang members in the neighborhood this  month for a range of misdemeanors against the couple, including prowling,  inciting a fight and hurling an object at a car.  </P> <P> "What it comes down to is that this couple has got two choices," said an  official in the district attorney's office who asked not to be identified.  "They can wait for somebody to try to kill them or they can move."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Midnight Assault  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Jason and Yolanda, who are engaged to be married, had been  awakened about midnight by five gang members who surrounded the house, pounding  violently on the window screens. Jason, who has been made muscular by a new job  as a gardener, grabbed the aluminum baseball bat that he keeps by the bed and  called the police, who arrived before there was a confrontation.  </P> <P> But the gang did not relent.  </P> <P> "Watch your back, white boy," one of them shouted to Jason last Friday after  spotting the couple driving through town. Bolstered by at least three other  gang members with him, the youth spat out the window toward the couple, hurled  a beer bottle that sailed over Jason's car and warned: "We're going to get you  for taking our home girl away."  </P> <P> Police say the 1st and B Street Boys, also known as La Verne Rifa, or La Verne  Rules, is the only gang in this city of 30,000, a bedroom community 45 minutes  from Los Angeles. They form an occasionally violent, multi-generational family  of about 15 to 25 active members whose history can be traced to the 1930s.  </P> <P> "I'll stand up to them," said Jason Mavers, talking earlier this week at the  couple's home, where a flower arrangement wrapped in cellophane, some photos of  Yolanda and a small wooden cross decorate the living room. "I'm not going to  run from anybody. Nothing's going to keep us apart."  </P> <P> Yolanda, whose mother asked that her last name not be used, is hiding for now  at a relative's house.  </P> <P> "I'm kind of scared for Jason," said Yolanda, a sophomore in high school with  dreams of attending beauty school. "But I tell him not to worry about it --  just think about us."  </P> <P> Not that Jason or Yolanda have any pretensions of glamour.  </P> <P> A big night out means hopping in Jason's purple '55 Volkswagen bug, driving to  Hollywood, grabbing a Big Mac and cuddling in a movie theater. For their  one-month anniversary, they went for the first time to Magic Mountain where  Jason won Yolanda a giant black teddy bear that nearly dwarfed her. Later, he  had "Yol" tattooed on his chest.  </P> <P> "She's the best," Jason said. "If it weren't for her, I don't think I would be  able to handle something like this."  </P> <P> Jason, a lanky youth with huge blue eyes, was born in West Germany while his  father was stationed at a U.S. military base, and grew up in East Los Angeles,  where, at 13, he joined a group of guys with shaved heads who called themselves  the Nazis of L.A. He wore a Mohawk haircut and patrolled the streets in  steel-toed boots.  </P> <P> "We were kind of like a neighborhood watch," he said. "I thought being in a  gang would change things. I guess I thought I was a man."  </P> <P> But he says he never sympathized with the group's bigotry and abandoned them  after a few years when they shot and wounded a black friend of his. He then  moved to Pomona with his mother and began high school, but dropped out just two  months before graduation.  </P> <P> "I just said, 'The hell with everything,' " said Jason, whose hope is to  someday work as an auto mechanic on big diesel rigs.  </P> <P> Yolanda grew up in La Verne, around the corner from the house where her mother,  a 34-year-old unemployed secretary, also grew up. By 11, she had her first of a  half dozen or so tattoos -- including one on her chest naming an old boyfriend  -- and had already begun befriending the gang members on her street.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be popular and hang out with a cool crowd," she said. "I wanted to  feel a part of something."  </P> <P> But she, too, grew repulsed by the violence she witnessed and says last summer  she stopped spending time with the gang. Her mother says that Yolanda is mature  for her age, although some of that was earned the hard way -- an abusive  father, easy access to drugs.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I still think they're both just kids," her mother said about the  young couple. "But if I don't allow it, I know she'll just run off with him.  So, I just tell her, if that's what you want, fine."  </P> <P> It is not, however, an arrangement that the 1st and B Street Boys are so  willing to accept.  </P> <P> On Monday, another member of the gang approached the couple at their front door  and allegedly told Jason that he was going to "end up in the hospital or some  place worse." He was arrested Wednesday and remains in custody.  </P> <P> And of the four gang members arrested in the bottle-throwing incident, only  one, a 16-year-old, has been charged with hurling the object and provoking a  fight. All four have been released from custody.  </P> <P> "Frankly, it does sort of harken back to the Montagues and Capulets or a 'West  Side Story' kind of thing," said La Verne Police Sgt. John P. Hackworth. "We  have had incidents where people are harassed by gang members, but not with this  kind of twist to it."  </P> <P> Jason and Yolanda, who say their plight has brought them even closer together,  are not yet ready to run.  </P> <P> "I love her," said Jason. "We're not going to let nobody bother us."  </P></p>

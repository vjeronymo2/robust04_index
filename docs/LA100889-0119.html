			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UCSD'S BUSINESS ROLE  </P> <P> This letter is written in response to Michael Schrage's column "Entrepreneurial  Gap at Local Universities," which ran Sept. 14 (Business). In his article, Mr.  Schrage asserted that Southern California universities have had little impact  on the new high-technology industries in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> The story in San Diego is quite different. Because of its research focus and  its development in the land-rich northern corner of the city, UC San Diego has  been instrumental in the continued growth of San Diego's electronics and  computer industry and a central player in the growth of San Diego as a center  for biotechnology. In a survey which we conducted last year, San Diego boasted  70 biotech companies, many of them started by UCSD graduates or faculty. In  addition, the number of electronics, neural network, software and medical  instruments companies is increasing. UCSD has maintained close ties to these  companies through industrial liaison programs and technical education offered  through University Extension.  </P> <P> To further stimulate the development of high-technology in San Diego, UCSD  Extension four years ago started CONNECT, an innovative program which links  high-tech entrepreneurs with the financial, managerial and technical resources  and skills they need for success. CONNECT offers seminars, lectures and courses  on topics such as raising capital, marketing technology products and  intellectual property protection. On an individual basis, CONNECT counsels  high-tech entrepreneurs on how to write their business plans and introduces  them to investors.  </P> <P> This year, UCSD is seeking to further enhance technology transfer through an  office dedicated to this activity exclusively.  </P> <P> MARY LINDENSTEIN WALSHOK  </P> <P> Associate Vice Chancellor,  </P> <P> Extended Studies and Public Service  </P> <P> UC San Diego  </P></p>

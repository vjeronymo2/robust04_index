			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOST AMERICANS FOLLOWING GULF STORY, POLL FINDS;  </P> <P> NEWS SURVEY: 62% OF THE RESPONDENTS PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CRISIS. NEARLY  HALF KEPT TRACK OF THE PLIGHT OF U.S. HOSTAGES IN IRAQ.  </P> <P> For the fourth month in a row, Americans paid extraordinary attention to news  of the Persian Gulf crisis -- even though the issue was largely ignored by  candidates in this month's elections -- according to a survey released today.  </P> <P> And although Democrats hope that their call for economic fairness will bring  them closer to the White House, the survey shows that most Americans are  unaware even of the results of the budget debate.  </P> <P> These are two of the findings in the November Times Mirror News Interest Index,  a monthly survey that measures public response to the news. The surveys are  conducted by the Times Mirror Center for People &amp; the Press, an operation  of Times Mirror, which owns the Los Angeles Times and other media enterprises.  </P> <P> A total of 62% of Americans paid close attention to news about the Persian  Gulf. No other story has held such intense public interest over so prolonged a  period in the two years that Times Mirror has conducted these monthly surveys.  The plight of American hostages in Iraq was closely followed by 49%.  </P> <P> Americans also began paying more attention to news of the economy, as much as  after the October, 1987, stock market crash. In both instances, 40% followed  the stories.  </P> <P> And 34% of respondents said that they had paid very close attention to the  budget negotiations in Congress, although most were left confused. Only 46%  knew that Congress adjourned having reached a budget agreement, while 30%  thought it had not, and 24% had no idea.  </P> <P> Some evidence suggests that respondents did not recognize many differences  between the final budget deal and the one negotiated earlier by the White House  and congressional leaders. For instance, even among those who were aware of the  budget agreement, public support was virtually identical to the earlier plan --  35% in favor, 47% opposed.  </P> <P> While analysts believe that the recent elections reflected widespread  discontent with Washington, Americans had little grasp of the lawmaking that  Congress and the White House had actually done.  </P> <P> Only one new law penetrated public consciousness -- the banning of smoking on  all domestic flights was recognized by 64%.  </P> <P> And some evidence suggests that President Bush might feel little political  fallout from legislation he had vetoed. For instance, 27% thought that Bush had  signed a civil rights bill into law. Only 29% knew that he had not. Likewise,  19% thought that he had signed into law the family leave bill, while 23% knew  that he had not.  </P> <P> This ignorance of legislation was just as evident among those most affected.  Only 29% of non-whites knew that the civil rights bill was vetoed, for  instance. And only 20% of women under age 40 knew that the family leave bill  was vetoed.  </P> <P> More generally, 32% of Americans said they paid very close attention to  criticisms of President Bush for changing his mind on taxes and for being  seemingly inconsistent in his statements about the Persian Gulf. Democrats paid  closer attention to these stories (38%) than Republicans (28%).  </P> <P> The survey, which interviewed 1,208 adults Nov. 8-11, has a margin of error of  plus or minus three percentage points.  </P></p>

Kull said that another reason to join NATO is that despite  making some positive statements, Russia has not damaged [as  received]to prove the friendliness and democracy of its foreign  policy.    "Russian statements in connection with the Lithuanian wish  to  join NATO sound a bit nervous, and, in fact, strengthen the wish  to join," Kull said. "It appears that Russia does not consider  NATO as a friendly alliance. Although Russian military doctrine  stresses that Russia has no enemies, including NATO, it still is  against other states joining NATO," Kull said.    Kull said that it must be considered, how real and possible  the widening of NATO is at the present moment. "The Lithuanian  application will most probably have no results at the present  moment, for NATO has not managed to determine its future and  identity in the changing world," Kull said.    Vello Saatpalu, head of Riigikogu foreign committee, who  returned from the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly political and  security council committee session in Brussels, said the  Lithuanian application was a "good shake to the dispersing  Western Europe", admitting, however, that Estonia and Latvia  were not yet ready for a similar statement. "We have still  several conflicts with our Eastern neighbor, but the step will  have to be taken in the future," Saatpalu said.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW UP 17.82 AS BUYERS HUNT FOR BARGAINS  </P> <P> Stocks closed higher Tuesday, as buyers moved in late in the day to grab blue  chip bargains left over after Monday's big tumble.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index rose 17.82 points to 2,922.52, recouping a  fraction of the 56.44-point fall Monday, when a broad decline saw the Dow down  as much as 107 points early in the day.  </P> <P> But most of Tuesday's Dow gain reflected movements in the oil stocks Chevron,  Exxon and Texaco. In the over-the-counter market, meanwhile, the NASDAQ  composite index lost 2.08 to 442.56, showing continued selling pressure.  </P> <P> The Dow had seesawed between minor gains and losses all morning until  futures-related sell programs pushed it to a double-digit decline in early  afternoon. Renewed buying -- particularly in the Oil Patch -- sparked a  recovery.  </P> <P> The broader market showed less movement. In nationwide trading of New York  Stock Exchange-listed stocks, 753 rose, 755 fell and 509 were unchanged. Big  Board volume shrank to 181.9 million shares from 209 million Monday.  </P> <P> Trading remained volatile as the stock market punished leading corporations  that reported earnings pressures.  </P> <P> * Two blue chip companies, Dow Chemical and Morgan Stanley, saw their stocks  plummet after they reported second-quarter profit declines. Dow fell 5 3/4 to  52 3/8, while Morgan Stanley dropped 6 to 66 1/2.  </P> <P> * Reuters Holdings, the international news organization, fell 10 to 56 1/4  after saying it expects its earnings growth to slow in the second half.  </P> <P> "One leading stock after another has been taken out and shot," said Ralph  Bloch, analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates.  </P> <P> "The oils are bolstering stocks today, but we're not seeing the broad market  participate at this point," added A. C. Moore, director of research at Argus  Research.  </P> <P> Other market highlights:  </P> <P> * The oil rally was very strong on news that Iraq had moved troops to Kuwait's  border in a dispute over Iraq's demand for higher OPEC oil prices. Exxon rose 2  1/8 to 50, Texaco added 2 3/4 to 62 1/2, Chevron rose 1 7/8 to 77 3/4, Unocal  gained 7/8 to 31 and Halliburton jumped 2 3/8 to 53 5/8.  </P> <P> * Capital Cities/ABC tumbled 55 1/2 to 533 after the company reported  second-quarter earnings below analysts' estimates and projected a weak third  quarter.  </P> <P> * Many growth stocks bounced back from Monday's selloff. Boeing added 1 to 56  7/8, 3M rose 1 1/4 to 90 1/4, Amgen rose 2 to 87 1/2 and Tokos Medical gained  5/8 to 13 3/4. But tech stocks were mostly weak. Teradata lost 1 1/2 to 23 3/4,  Intel fell 1 1/8 to 43 3/8 and Maxtor tumbled 3 5/8 to 10 3/4.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, shares closed down but well off their lows. The 225-share Nikkei  average lost 192.33 points to 31,702.46. In London, prices were generally flat.  The Financial Times 100-share index rose 1.2 points to close at 2,360.9. In  Frankfurt, shares weakened in thin trading. The DAX index fell 16.88 to  1,921.16.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT: Bond Prices Retreat on Credit Concerns  </P> <P> The bond market continued to retreat despite Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  Greenspan's pledge to continue fighting inflation.  </P> <P> The 30-year Treasury bond lost 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 in face  amount, sending its yield up to 8.57% from 8.55% late Monday.  </P> <P> Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee that the nation's central bank was  intent on reducing inflation. But he also predicted that a "credible and  enforceable" agreement between Congress and the White House to lower the  federal budget deficit would lead to a "very significant response" by the Fed  to lower interest rates.  </P> <P> Some bond traders are worried that Fed policy might become too loose, allowing  inflation to resurge.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8%, up slightly from Monday's 7.938%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY: Interest Rate Fears Push Dollar Lower  </P> <P> The dollar was mixed against key foreign currencies on the belief that U.S.  interest rates will decline.  </P> <P> Technical factors, along with news of an Iraqi troop buildup along the Kuwaiti  border, helped temper its fall, traders said.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar rose to a closing 148.70  Japanese yen from 148.50 yen Monday. But it fell to 148.35 yen in London and  148.40 yen in New York.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled at $367.90 an ounce, off  $1.20 from Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES: Oil Futures Gain as OPEC Convenes  </P> <P> September contracts for West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished at $20.56 a  barrel Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 6 cents from Monday, as  OPEC ministers began gathering for a critical strategy session.  </P> <P> A number of ministers expressed support for increasing the cartel's benchmark  price for its crude from the current $18 a barrel, which would require  agreement on new production limits.  </P> <P> Iran has proposed a reference price of $20 a barrel while Iraq wants a $25  level. Iraq is threatening Kuwait militarily over alleged production cheating.  </P></p>

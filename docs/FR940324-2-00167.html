			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extension of deadlines:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ACF may extend the deadline for all applicants because of acts of God such as floods, hurricanes, etc., or when there is a widespread disruption of the mails. However, if ACF does not extend the deadline for all applicants, it may not waive or extend the deadline for any applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Intergovernmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All States and Territories except Alaska, Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contacts (SPOCs). Applicants from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding Executive Order 12372. Applicants for projects to be administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of Executive Order 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424, item 16a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under 45 CFR 100.8(1)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline date to comment on proposed new or competing continuation awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20447.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Appendix G of this announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Application Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications which meet the screening requirements in section 5 below will be reviewed competitively. Such applications will be referred to reviewers for a numerical score and explanatory comments based solely on responsiveness to program guidelines and evaluation criteria published in this announcement. Applications will be reviewed by persons outside of the OCS unit which would be directly responsible for programmatic management of the grant. The results of these reviews will assist the Director and OCS program staff in considering competing applications. Reviewers' scores will weigh heavily in funding decisions but will not be the only factors considered. Applications will generally be considered in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers. However, highly ranked applications are not guaranteed funding since the Director may also consider other factors deemed relevant including, but not limited to, the timely and proper completion of projects funded with OCS funds granted in the last five (5) years; comments of reviewers and government officials; staff evaluation and input; geographic distribution; previous program performance of applicants; compliance with grant terms under previous DHHS grants; audit reports; investigative reports; and applicant's progress in resolving any final audit disallowances on OCS or other Federal agency grants. OCS reserves the right to discuss applications with other Federal or non-Federal funding sources to ascertain the applicant's performance record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

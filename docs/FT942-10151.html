			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Thefts of trucks 'cost Pounds 500m' Truck theft costs British industry more than Pounds 500m a year, the Freight Transport Association said yesterday. More than one in three operators had a vehicle stolen last year. An association survey of 1,200 companies found that security devices generally had only a limited effect on the numbers of thefts. One company reported 107 vehicles broken into or stolen. Some companies found novel ways of beating the thieves: one painted its vehicles bright pink, and another carried raw sewage. The survey found that 45 per cent of vehicles stolen were fitted with alarms; nearly half the thefts took place at home depots; and that most thefts were in the north-east of England with London, Birmingham and Bristol being other badly hit areas, and Scotland the most theft-free area.</p>

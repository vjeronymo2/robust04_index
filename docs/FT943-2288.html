			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: BK Vision wins rights case BK Vision, the investment company controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, has won a landmark court challenge against a Swiss company's attempt to reduce shareholder rights in issues of new equity capital. Union Bank of Switzerland, in which BK Vision is the largest single shareholder, last year won approval from its AGM to create pools of equity capital that could be used at the board's discretion for acquisitions or equity linked bond issues without seeking further authorisation from shareholders or respecting their pre-emptive rights. BK Vision claimed that a new Swiss companies act, which came into force in 1992 and authorised the creation of these pools of capital, required that companies specify to the AGM the purposes for which they would be used. The panel of five commercial court judges agreed that neither the capital nor the voting rights of shareholders could be withdrawn, even by a majority AGM vote, unless it was for a specified purpose. The court made clear that it understood that the purpose could not always be disclosed in detail, as, for example, in the case of a large acquisition. After the new act came into force, several quoted Swiss companies drew up resolutions creating pools of authorised and conditional capital which were approved by their AGMs.</p>

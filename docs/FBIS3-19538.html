In a 30-minute papal audience requested by the Israeli  leader, Mr. Rabin defined as shameful the Hebron mosque massacre.    The Vatican encounter was the first by an Israeli prime  minister since an agreement to forge diplomatic ties was signed  in December last year.    Vatican officials said Mr. Rabin renewed his invitation to  the Pope to visit Israel and that the Pontiff accepted saying he  hoped circumstances would allow a pilgrimage to the Holy Land  soon.    Mr. Rabin arrived in Rome today on his way from three days  of  talks in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Today's meeting in the Vatican came on the same day that the  Holy See's Secretary for Relations with States, Monsignor  Jean-Louis Tauran, met PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis.    Following his audience with the Pope, Mr. Rabin gave an  exclusive interview to Vatican radio during which he spoke of  the role of the Holy See in the Middle East Peace process:    [Begin Rabin recording, in English] In my meeting with His  Holiness the Pope, I found that he is more than interested to be  in a position to influence the peace process. He would like to  see a continuation of the negotiations and he would like to see  peace being achieved in the Middle East as he would like to see  it all over the world. But especially, he would like to see  peace in whatever is related to the Holy Land. I stressed the  importance of reaching peace hopefully before the year 2000 to  Christ [as heard].

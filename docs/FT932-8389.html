			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Observer: Jinxed The curse on Shakespeare seems to be spreading. Last February, the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Richard III at the Donmar Warehouse had to be repeatedly put off because Simon Russell Beale, who plays the king, developed back trouble, possibly from overdoing the hump. A few Saturdays ago at the National Theatre, Alan Howard had to race through a key speech as Macbeth before leaving the stage to be audibly sick. The production was resumed 25 minutes later with an understudy. Now the formal opening of King Lear, which should have taken place in Stratford last night, has been postponed because Robert Stephens in the title role has a foot infection. Obviously too much fooling about naked in the storm. Word is that he may be better tomorrow.</p>

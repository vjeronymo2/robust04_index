			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jan (NA) -- The Association of  State Workers (ATE) announced today that the Economy Ministry's  idea of privatizing the nuclear plants is a ``disaster'' and  warned that the initiative will mark the ``end of independent  nuclear development.''    In a communique, the state workers argue that the  privatization of the nuclear plants ``would cut the main source  of income'' of the National Atomic Energy Commission [CNEA] and  would end the chain of research, development, and production.    ``From the technical viewpoint, private capital does not  offer any guarantees because the simple market law states that  profit comes before any investment in nuclear safety,'' they  stated.    ATE workers state: ``The CNEA will be reduced to a  comptroller's office which will merely oversee nuclear safety.''    The communique is signed by ATE Secretary General Victor de  Gennaro. In it the organization ratifies its position ``in  defense of a complete CNEA within the framework of the  Presidency of the Republic and at the service of national  interests.''</p>

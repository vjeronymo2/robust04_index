			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> WELLMAN'S 'ALBANIAN SOFTSHOE' TAPS INTO ANOTHER LANGUAGE  </P> <P> Perplexity am what rules in Mac Wellman's "Albanian Softshoe" at the San Diego  Repertory Theatre; a play with its own grammar book, star chart and tide table.  </P> <P> The setting turns out to be deep space, where matter and anti-matter can set up  strange reflections of what's real. But Wellman sets his first act in an  American-style living room where things are only slightly askew. The Danish  flatware, for instance, has gone limp, a victim of "metal fatigue." That could  happen, couldn't it?  </P> <P> Then we're transported to the moons of Saturn, which seem inhabited largely by  frowning, freezing Albanians. Our heroes (the wives in the suburban segment --  Darla Cash and Jan Leslie Harding) become involved in a quest for a  900-year-old wizard named Pancake. They carry a talismanic cheese, which may  not be the "real" cheese. But then Pancake (Damon Bryant) may not be the real  pancake.  </P> <P> What is going on here? More than just a lot of "flapdoodle," I think, although  the word does come up in the text more than once, along with "hoohah." It's as  if Wellman is trying to forestall the verdict of his more literal-minded  listeners -- who do have a right to complain. There's a stretch in the middle  of the show where the wordplay gets tedious, for all the fun that Douglas  Jacobs and Michael Roth's players are having with it. They don't seem  self-indulgent, but their lines do.  </P> <P> Yet I liked "Albanian Softshoe" more than I didn't like it. To begin with, it  is not the same old thing. Wellman shows us what he thinks of the same old  thing in the suburban sequence -- the play's foyer, as it were.  </P> <P> What's being played with here isn't just the code of soap opera ("More  coffee?") but the American faith in the pursuit of happiness. Cash, Harding and  Tony Simotes have a brilliant triple spiel where they bemoan the fulfillment  that they have been cheated out of and are determined to get -- three mynah  birds saying "me, me, me."  </P> <P> On the moons of Saturn, another mind-set prevails. This is the world of the  tribe, where I do what "custom" tells me to do, a world of vendettas and blood  guilt, where every legend has a "terrible" ending.  </P> <P> The nonsense here is ritual nonsense, and Wellman can't have as much fun with  it as in the American section, because what it represents has so much weight.  When his tribe sits down to tell stories, they do so with real gravity,  pointless as some of their stories are.  </P> <P> "Sky full of things in X/Sky full of other things in Y." We register the  difference, and that alone would make the play more than flapdoodle.  </P> <P> But there's also Wellman's delight in language. "Albanian Softshoe" feels as if  it were written on the command of the author's unconscious, with his censor  bound and gagged in the next room. As in Shakespeare, the words have a contour  that doesn't depend on their meaning, which arrives an instant after they do,  like spray from a crashing wave.  </P> <P> Not that Wellman goes in for ringing pentameters. He would rather wrench the  language apart, to explore how curiously an English sentence can go and still  make a kind of sense.  </P> <P> Bruce McKenzie is particularly felicitous here, as a spiky-haired  message-bearer named Wingfoot. (The play is full of messages, riddles, charms  and spells.) At first glance it's astonishing that McKenzie and the rest of the  company have no trouble with this wayward, complicated text. But at second  glance it's perfectly clear why they don't: It's a kick to stand the language  on its ear.  </P> <P> "Albanian Softshoe" also profits from a smashing physical production -- Michael  Roth's wide-screen set, Brenda Berry's intergalactic lighting and a mountain of  costumes from Clare Henkel, sometimes witty (the price tag hanging from the  lounge suit in the suburban section), but often as harsh as the winter cold.  Although off the wall, "Albanian Softshoe" is never totally a softshoe, and  that's its salvation.  </P> <P>  Plays Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Closes Oct. 28.  Tickets $14-$22. 79 Horton Plaza, San Diego. (619) 235-8025.  </P> <P> </P></p>

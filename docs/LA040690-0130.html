			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Non-Alcoholic Beer Sales Grow: Miller Brewing Co. says sales of its new  non-alcoholic brew, Sharp's, are running twice as high as expected and that it  has sold out in some parts of the country.  </P> <P> Several company distributors across the nation -- including one serving Long  Beach -- have depleted their inventory, says Miller spokesman Ron Richards, who  declined to give specific sales figures. Miller has expanded production of  Sharp's, which was introduced nationally last December, from one to three  breweries and is considering boosting production capacity even more. Since  Sharp's contains less than .5% alcohol by volume, the beverage is classified as  a non-alcoholic brew under government regulations.  </P></p>

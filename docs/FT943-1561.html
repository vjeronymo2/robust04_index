			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Japan Japan's new tax package was broadly welcomed by the US but it seems unlikely to do much to stimulate the economy and suck in imports. While the cut in income tax will be implemented before the increase in consumption tax, the impact on consumer confidence may be limited by the Finance Ministry's emphasis on the need for fiscal revenue to care for an ageing population. Nor is the equity market likely to be particularly happy while the dollar is trading at less than Y100. So there is unlikely to be much of a boost to confidence from rising share prices either. Efforts to stimulate the economy might have more impact if they were accompanied by a further aggressive cut in official interest rates. The Bank of Japan seems reluctant to undertake this course because it fears another asset bubble. Some in the US might worry that a consequence of lower interest rates would be a weaker yen which would make Japanese goods cheaper internationally. But Japan is one industrial country where the inflationary threat remains minimal. Lower interest rates and an easier currency might also encourage an outflow of capital which would bring relief to international bond markets generally.</p>

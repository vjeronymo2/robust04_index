			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Foundation transactions 'ceased' MR WERNER KEICHER, the sole council member of the Maxwell Foundation, said yesterday that there had been no transactions through the foundation since Mr Robert Maxwell's death in November. He also said that he had not been paid for his services since then. The Maxwell Foundation is the Liechtenstein vehicle that was used by Mr Maxwell to control many of his interests. Mr Keicher, a Liechtenstein lawyer, said the foundation's objectives were: to support basic scientific and medical research; to promote lasting peace in Israel; to support capable young entrepreneurs; to support education for encouraging peace and ending racism; and to support non-profit institutions in Liechtenstein. He said the foundation, established in 1970, had probably distributed less than Pounds 2m since he took over from his father as trustee in 1985. Of this sum, Pounds 1.5m had gone to Leeds University. He denied knowledge of written instructions from people governing the foundation or its subsidiaries. He had had 'absolutely no contact' with Mr Kevin Maxwell or other members of the family in connection with distributing money, and often made decisions on donations himself. Mr Keicher, however, appears to have tremendous power, which he now intends to wield for the first time. He called the foundation the 'grandmother' of the US companies Sphere and PH (US), two companies outside the reach of administrators which are still trading. The foundation owns Swico, which controls the other two companies. He said he believed he had powers to appoint or dismiss directors, and to help determine dividends and 'absolutely would not hesitate' to remove Mr Kevin Maxwell from the board of these companies if 'it is necessary'. He said he knew nothing of transactions through PH (US) and other companies in recent months, and emphasised that he had seen his role and that of the foundation as a holding function, not a management function. Asked why he had become involved in a foundation associated with Mr Robert Maxwell, he said: 'When you look back from today, it's another situation. Mr Maxwell was one of the most wealthy men in Britain, with a big reputation . . . Now it is different, with the knowledge we have today.'</p>

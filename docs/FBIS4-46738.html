			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Debts of the USSR Savings Bank: The </F> Question, of Course, Is Interesting"]    [Text] When will the trade obligations of the Union  Savings Bank for special-purpose checks, bonds, and certificates  be paid off, how will it proceed, and who will assume the  payment?...    These questions are troubling the owners of checks. Citizens  of the local administration are also asking them. Therefore, the  mayor's office of Novosibirsk asked the Ministry of Finance of  Russia for an explanation.    The reply, signed by M. Chekurova, deputy director of the  Securities Department of the Ministry of Finance of Russia,  states:    "In accordance with Decree No. 344 of the Government of the  Russian Federation of 16 April 1994 'On State Debt Trade  Obligations,' the Ministry of Finance, from 15 June 1994 to 1  June 1995, through the system of institutions of the Savings  Bank of the Russian Federation, and other banks determined by  the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, will redeem  1990 non-interest- bearing bonds of state special-purpose loans  from owners for appropriate domestically produced consumer  commodities (except passenger cars) at existing consumer prices,  and for passenger cars--based on 60 percent of the price  determined by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation,  in coordination with plant manufacturers.    "In a priority procedure, the indicated bonds will be  redeemed from invalids and participants in the Great Patriotic  War and invalids of the Armed Forces.    "The procedure for the redemption of special-purpose loan  bonds will be developed by the Ministry of Finance of the  Russian Federation together with the Savings Bank of the Russian  Federation in the near future."    As Tamara Aleksandrovna Lyubimets, deputy chairman of the  Novosibirsk bank of the Savings Bank of Russia, reported to the  editorial office at "Krasnyy Prospekt 34," if merchandise is  issued for all trade bonds for all citizens from 1 July of this  year to 1 June of 1995 (and only for invalids of the Armed  Forces and participants of the Great Patriotic War--from 15  June), then the redemption of certificates, which ends according  to the letter of the Savings Bank on 1 March, is extended to 31  December 1994.    In addition, Tamara Aleksandrovna emphasized that the debts  will be settled by the Savings Banks only on the condition of  the payment of money for their accounts. The AKSB [expansion not  identified] of the Russian Federation, not being the legal  successor of the USSR Savings Bank, at the same time assumed  settlements with the citizens for certificates, but it will make  payment at the expense of resources of the federal budget  allocated in 1994-1995 for these purposes.</p>

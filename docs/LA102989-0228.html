			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSISSIPPI FREE SAFETY IS PARALYZED  </P> <P> Ron Lee (Chuckie) Mullins, a University of Mississippi free safety, suffered a  paralyzing neck injury Saturday when he made a first-quarter tackle in the  Rebels' game against Vanderbilt.  </P> <P> Mullins, a 6-foot, 170-pound redshirt freshman from Russellville, Ala., was  airlifted 75 miles to Baptist Central Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. A spokesman in  the hospital's critical care unit said no condition was immediately available.  </P> <P> Mullins suffered a fractured-dislocation of the fourth and fifth cervical  vertebrae in the neck, said Leroy Mullins, Mississippi's trainer.  </P> <P> Mullins, was carried from the field on a stretcher with 6:57 left in the first  quarter of the Rebels' 24-16 victory.  </P> <P> Mullins was injured when he made a jarring tackle on Vanderbilt's Brad Gaines  at the Ole Miss three-yard-line to break up a pass play.  </P> <P> "He immediately told us he could not feel anything," Leroy Mullins said.  </P> <P> The trainers cut off a portion of Mullins' face mask and hinged it back in case  they needed to assist his breathing, said school spokesman Langston Rogers.  </P> <P> "Shallow breathing was evident," said Leroy Mullins, who is not related to the  victim.  </P> <P> "Chuckie (Mullins' nickname) is paralyzed from the neck down. I've been an  athletic trainer for more than 25 years, and this is the worst on-the-field  injury I have been involved with.  </P> <P> "It's the type situation you constantly worry about and hope you never face."  </P> <P> Rogers said Mullins never lost consciousness and talked to the trainers the  entire time they worked with him.  </P></p>

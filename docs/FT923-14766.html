			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Smith says Labour split on Maastricht MR JOHN Smith, the favourite to win Labour's leadership contest, yesterday admitted that Labour MPs are likely to be split in a Commons vote on the Maastricht treaty and he did not rule out a free vote. Tory MPs opposed to the treaty believe that their chances of success depend on Labour's response, and Mr Smith said on BBC television that it would be 'impossible' to expect all Labour MPs to vote either for or against it. His comments came as Mr Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP for Southend and a prominent Euro-sceptic, said that next week Tory activists would set up a campaign to back a referendum on the treaty. Mr Smith refused to predict the party's official line when legislation on the treaty returns to the Commons after the summer recess. He did not know what would be in the legislation or whether the European Community had a strategy for overcoming Denmark's referendum rejection of the treaty. Asked about allowing a free vote, he said: 'We haven't considered that as a possibility at this stage.' However, he added: 'Always in British political parties on this issue there are going to be divisions. 'It is just impossible to expect that on a issue of this kind that they will all vote in the same way and there has to be some respect for differing options.' Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, predicted that he would come second in the deputy leadership contest to Mrs Margaret Beckett and would pick up votes from Mr Bryan Gould's supporters in a final run-off.</p>

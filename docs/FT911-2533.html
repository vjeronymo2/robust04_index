			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Brazil seeks to reopen financial links BRAZIL'S government economics team and much of its cabinet is in Washington as part ofan offensive to reopen channels with the international financial community. Ms Zelia Cardoso, economy minister, is to begin talks today with the International Monetary Fund in the hope of negotiating a Dollars 2bn stand-by facility. Aletter of intent signed with the IMF last September was torn up after Brazil had failed to meet targets such as a 6 per cent monthly inflation rate by December, and because of perceived foot-dragging on reaching agreement with creditor banks over more than Dollars 8bn in arrears. Terms were agreed with the banks this month, allowing Brazil to reopen negotiations with the fund. However, continuing economic instability in Brazil makes a new accord unlikely in the near future, as Ms Cardoso admits. This time, the Brazilian team will refuse to commit itself to specific targets for inflation, having learnt its lesson last time. Inflation is between 7 and 9 per cent a month, but most prices and wages are frozenand controls are on all sectors. While Ms Cardoso is with the IMF, Mr Ibrahim Eris, central bank governor, is meeting Mr David Mulford, US Treasury Under-secretary, and commercial bank heads to discuss opening negotiations on the stock of Brazil's Dollars 63bn commercial bank debt. John Barham reports from Buenos Aires: Uruguay, South America's only offshore banking centre, has introduced new banking guidelines to discourage money laundering. The central bank has issued the recommendations to Uruguay's 240 banks, banking houses and exchange houses, in response to US concern that Montevideo might be providing a haven for drug money.</p>

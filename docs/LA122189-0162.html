			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MISSOURI;  </P> <P> EXPLOSIVES TO CLEAR RIVER ICE REJECTED  </P> <P> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided it will not try to use explosives to  break up a huge ice jam on the Mississippi River, which has been virtually  closed to barge traffic. Corps officials met in St. Louis with officials of the  U.S. Coast Guard and representatives of the barge industry. Lt. Cmdr. Myles  Boothe of the Coast Guard said there would be no attempt to blast now because  the ice cover is not posing an immediate threat. Wednesday marked the third day  that a 203-mile stretch of the river from St. Louis to Cairo, Ill., was all but  closed because of ice and low water.  </P></p>

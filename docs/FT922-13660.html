			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: International expansion for Amec AMEC, the construction and engineering group which announced a Pounds 9.9m pre-tax loss yesterday, said it would use some of its Pounds 76.7m cash to expand on the Continent, in the Middle East and in south-east Asia via a new headquarters in Hong Kong. Mr Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said the proportion of group turnover derived from outside the UK was set to rise from just over 20 per cent in 1991 to 30 per cent this year. In building and civil engineering operating profit fell from Pounds 30.3m to Pounds 24.2m on turnover of Pounds 772m (Pounds 865m). Mr John Early, finance director, said the order book was down 5 per cent overall since the beginning of 1991. Commercial work declined by 30 per cent and now only accounted for 10 per cent of the total, whereas the fall-off was slight in industrial and public sector work. Mechanical and electrical engineering made Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 38.6m) profit on Pounds 1.41bn (Pounds 1.2bn) turnover. Orders had fallen by 10 per cent. and the proportion of commercial work declined from 16 to 9 per cent. Housing and property increased its loss from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 11.3m. Rationalisation included cutting the regional organisation from 10 units to six. The diluted loss per share figure of 3.2p counted convertible preference shares as equity. Taking it as debt, the basic loss per share was 11.9p (or 11.8p of earnings before the exceptional costs), compared with earnings of 20.8p. COMMENT It proved to be a good PR move for Amec to bring out results nities for favourable comparisons included a maintained dividend, cash in the bank, housing land valued conservatively at 20 per cent of selling prices (as opposed to 30 per cent) and no Channel tunnel involvement. Throw in some reassurance about the resilience of off-shore work, through refurbishment, and the welcome international expansion and Amec might be classed as one of the few buys in the building sector. This sentiment was reflected in an 11p rise in the share price to 149p (still well below the 200p rights issue price a year ago). The yield is attractive at just over 9 per cent. On a Pounds 45m pre-tax profit forecast the prospective p/e is less than 16 on the unfavourable basic earnings figures. But recovery potential is a bit awkward to assess because of lingering doubts about a late-cycle downturn in long-term contracting. For those braving this sector, it looks a quality stock.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are $24.93, $73.60, $171.34, $402.54, and $690.95 for standard levels 1&hyph;5,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 1 is $10.73 for the representative class; standard level 2 would reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy expenses by $17.32; standard level 3 by $29.53; standard level 4 by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $35.43; and standard level 5 by $48.24. See Technical Support Document, Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all classes of direct heating equipment show that revised standards would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause a prototypical manufacturer to have slight increases in short-run return  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on equity from the 7.4 percent in the base case except for the two most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent levels where short-run return on equity plummets. Standard levels 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 5 are projected to produce short-run return on equity's of 7.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, 7.7 percent, 7.6 percent, 5.2 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revised standards have minimal effects on long-run return on equity. Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels 1 through 5 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's of 7.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, 7.4 percent, 7.3 percent, 7.4 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Life-cycle cost and net present value.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A life-cycle cost is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative class, life-cycle costs at standard levels 1 through 3 are less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the baseline unit. Of the five candidate standard levels, a unit meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 3 has the lowest consumer life-cycle cost. See Technical Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document, Figure 4.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average consumer of $79.31 for the representative class of direct heating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. Standard levels 2 and 3 would reduce average life-cycle costs by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $23.26 and $41.65, respectively. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that standard levels 1 through 3 would not cause any economic burden on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average consumer. Standard levels 4 and 5 would increase average life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs by $132.40 and $296.32, respectively. See Technical Support Document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 4.26.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely face in financing the purchase of direct heating equipment. Similarly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that for all classes of direct heating equipment, standard level 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would produce a net present value of $9 million to consumers. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponding net present values for levels 2&hyph;5 are $63 million, $113 million,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative $259 million, and negative $930 million, respectively. See Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support Document, Table 3.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

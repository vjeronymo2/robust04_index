			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Drazen Vukov-Colic: "Clinton Is Not Defending </F> Sarajevo"]    [Text] The best-kept U.S. secret is: During the first  year of his election, Bill Clinton has proved to be a very, very  successful president. At least to the United States, to which  he promised everything, and has done a lot. His tax reforms,  his agreement on free trade between Canada, the United States,  and Mexico, his liberalization of abortion, his battle against  unobstructed accumulation of private weapons, and his elaborate  budget deficit cutdown have lead to the first real economic  take-offs: In only 10 months, the private entrepreneurs have  employed more people than in the past four years. His strength  -- and not weakness -- is proven by the fact that, in the battle  for new budgetary discipline, he won in Congress by only one  vote that is needed to have the prescribed majority, while the  unbiased experts have a lot of reason to claim that no  president, since Lyndon Johnson left in 1969, has made the  proverbially cautious American Congress so busy. However, the  man who was, in the election battle, called "the great  communicator", after Reagan, knows that both the U.S. and the  international public judge him to be as a frightened  compromiser, indecisive leader, and a very superficial expert.  In an open interview for the famous ROLLING STONE Clinton  himself admitted that he had turned from a favorite of the media  into a subject of media ridicule. "I have done a lot," said he,  "but, with all my attempts to change the American lifestyle, I  have not received a single media award."    The world thus survives in the shadow of the "Clinton  paradox": an efficient president, but an unconvincing leader, a  model of diligence, but almost provincially lonely. What is  good for the United States is not good for the world, and it  should be, at a time when it remains the only world superpower.  The first reactions to the first Clinton "European speech" also  fit into the above frame: The appearance was skillfully  prepared, but there was nothing in it that will be remembered  for very long. Regardless of the fact that Clinton also dared  to bomb Iraq, seriously threatened North Korea, took a firm  stand against the Japanese challenge, placed everything on the  Yeltsin card, speeded up the Middle Eastern and South African  peace talks, united the entire American continent, and bridged  the Pacific again, Clinton's great European tour has been  experienced only as a late routine. In Brussels he tried to  save NATO by the inadequate formula `Partnership for Peace', in  Prague he will try to restore trust in real U.S. support to the  newly-established eastern democracies, in Moscow he will  encourage Yeltsin -- and perhaps scorn him a little -- but this  extensive itinerary does not promise key answers to three  important questions: Who will the United States strategically  protect and how, will it join the general efforts to curb the  unimaginable Balkan war and how, how will it prevent the general  decay of the most talked of Western principles with this sway of  anachronic and anarchic nationalisms, and can it do that?    Naturally: Under U.S. leadership, NATO will not run with  their arms open to meet the new eastern European regimes that  could, under the same strategic umbrella, get it into dangerous  territorial or ethnic alignments. The remaining 14 members have  already had enough of Greece and Turkey because of Cyprus, and  what is again smoldering between Russia and Poland, Slovakia and  Hungary, the Baltics and Moscow. This is why it should not be  expected that the NATO summit will result in any specific  decisions on the Balkan wars. It is generally claimed that air  strike threats will be renewed, "because of the strangling of  Sarajevo", but cynics claim that NATO will move only when the  victim is dead. Karadzic has "ordered a unilateral ceasefire"  in the battles for Sarajevo, in order to prevent this  "indicative stutter". Zagreb has yet to digest the manifest  admonition of Madeleine Albright, one of whose reasons for  coming was obviously to calm down the overloquacious U.S.  ambassador. Tudjman also knows that only in its most fantastic  dreams could there be chances of "NATO applying force" if  Izetbegovic does not agree to his most generous offers. At the  moment it was still unknown whether the Bonn talks might change  anything, the only reliable thing was the bitter message that  Clinton is unequaled only at home.</p>

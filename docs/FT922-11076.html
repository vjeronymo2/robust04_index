			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Bonds: Two Eurobond offerings launched in dollar sector TWO NEW Eurobond offerings were launched in the dollar sector, which is faring better than most in generally lacklustre trading conditions. Demand in most bond markets is at a low ebb; only the sterling sector, buoyed by bullishness on the currency, is attracting any sizeable buying interest. The Export-Import Bank of Japan launched a Dollars 500m 10-year deal, a large transaction for a Japanese government-guaranteed borrower. The 8 per cent bonds, launched by IBJ International, were priced to yield 29 basis points above the 10-year Treasury, a basis point tighter than last week's Dollars 200m deal for Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises. The bonds illicited few sales in Europe, but met stronger demand in the Far East, dealers said. The large size of the deal means it will take some time to place, but should ultimately be more liquid than most Japanese government-guaranteed names. The spread was unchanged at the end of trading at 29 basis points, against a directionless US Treasury market. However, market swaps rates are very tight, which is likely to limit further supply of paper. A Dollars 200m two-year deal for the Council of Europe, arranged by UBS, met demand from specific pockets of investors. Money market funds, which are currently extending along the yield curve a little, were active buyers, and central banks also showed some interest. In addition, some European retail investors bought paper, apparently viewing the bonds as a currency play which offered higher yields than bank deposits. The bonds, priced to yield 26 basis points above the two-year Treasury, were attractively priced relative to the swap market, dealers said. Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank is expected to take advantage of attractive conditions in the sterling bond market to launch a Pounds 200m issue of 10-year Eurobonds. Yesterday, the Bank had received proposals from around half a dozen banks and was considering them, before awarding a mandate to launch the offering today. The EIB will use a deferred rate setting, which allows the borrower to fix the spread over gilts on launch, but to lock in the gilt yield at a later date. The structure is particularly suitable for the EIB, because it onlends funds raised in the capital markets. With most other markets in dismal shape, activity could well be concentrated in the sterling sector. Last week's Pounds 500m five-year deal for Hanson has held in well, and is currently trading at a spread of 77 basis points above the five-year gilt yield, on the offered side, three basis points inside its launch spread. Elsewhere, Bear Stearns is marketing a Dollars 100m Eurobond for the National Development Bank of Brazil (BNDES), which runs the country's privatisation programme. The deal is expected to be officially launched later this week.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Precious metals remained range-bound in thin trading yesterday and continued to consolidate after the recent sell-off. GOLD closed in London at Dollars 364.45 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3.45. 'Volumes are very light and there's not enough momentum to break out of the recent range,' one dealer said. Gold was expected to fluctuate between Dollars 360 and Dollars 365 in largely professional trading, with the price still too high to attract solid physical demand but too low to cause producer selling. Some dealers said US funds could still liquidate long positions, making gold vulnerable to further falls. SILVER firmed slightly to close in London at Dollars 4.245 an ounce, up 4.5 cents, after attracting light US buying. Dealers suggested the silver market may be re-evaluating the effect of Xerox's development of a new type of silverless film. Trading was extremely slow on the London Metal Exchange and markets ended mixed. After November traded option declarations passed smoothly in the morning, some technical resistance came into play during the afternoon, when COPPER and ALUMINIUM fell back. Compiled from Reuters</p>

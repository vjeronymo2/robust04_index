			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Romanian ship in sanctions inquiry BULGARIA detained a Romanian ship on suspicion of carrying up the Danube River goods banned under a United Nations embargo against former Yugoslavia, Reuter reports from Sofia. The state news agency BTA reported that the Romanian ship Jariste 5, with 860 tonnes of iron, was detained by Bulgaria's river inspection authorities at Vidin, 50km downstream from the Serbian border. The ship was sailing upstream from the Romanian Danube port of Calarasi to Turnu Severin, a Romanian port opposite Serbia, without UN sanctions committee approval to take embargoed goods through the Serbian section of the river. Several embargo-busting Yugoslav tugboats towing barges laden with tens of thousands of tonnes of petrol products eluded control by Bulgarian and Romanian customs on the Danube and sailed into Serbian waters three months ago. The US Coast Guard gave Bulgaria three fast boats in response to requests for help to enforce the embargo.</p>

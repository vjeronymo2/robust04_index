			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by WEN WEI PO special correspondent </F> Chiang Wei-ping (1203 4850 1627): "China-Japan Joint Venture  Invests $65 Million in the Construction of an Industrial Park in  Dalian"]    [Text] Dalian, 18 May (WEN WEI PO)--Today, a grand  ceremony was held for the completion of the infrastructure  construction in Dalian Industrial Park, a Sino-Japanese joint  venture. Li Tieying, state councillor and member of the  Political Bureau; and Kentaro Kiniwa, deputy director-general of  the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, cut  ribbons and praised the project as a typical example of the  successful cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese  Governments, as well as between the two countries'  entrepreneurial circles.  <H5>  First Project To Develop Whole Stretch of Land </H5>   The Dalian Industrial Park is situated in the Dalian  Economic  and Technological Development Zone. It is the first project in  which Japanese enterprises are developing a whole stretch of  land in China; in fact, it is the first project in which a whole  stretch of land is being developed in Dalian and even in China.  The Chinese side makes up the management committee overseeing  the Dalian Development Zone, and the Japanese side forms the  committee overseeing the projects in the Dalian Industrial Park  (this committee is made up of 22 Japanese enterprises, including  C. Itoh, Mitsubishi, Marubeni Corporation, the Industrial Bank  of Japan, and the Bank of Tokyo). Both sides have established  the joint-venture Dalian Industrial Park Management Company,  which makes a total investment of $65 million, of which the  Chinese side contributes 20 percent and the Japanese side 80  percent. The Chinese side's investment is in the form of the  roads leading to the park, while the Japanese side has  contributed hard currency. The operation period is 50 years,  and the joint-venture company will buy 2.169 square km of land  from the Dalian Development Zone Management Committee for its  use; this land will primarily be transferred to the Japanese  side.  <H5>  China and Japan Carefully Study Feasibility </H5>   The concept of the project was first proposed by the  Japan-China Association for the Development of the Northeast  during its visit to Dalian in February 1988 with the idea of  creating an overseas industrial park for Japan's medium-size and  small enterprises who seek to invest. In 1989, Japan's C. Itoh  Commercial Company, the Bank of Tokyo, and the Marubeni  Corporation expressed their intent of cooperation to the Dalian  Development Zone; in December of the same year, as a result of  the coordination by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade  and Industry, the five establishments of C. Itoh, Marubeni,  Mitsubishi, the Industrial Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Tokyo  formed a close union to establish the Committee Overseeing  Projects in the Dalian Industrial Park and to join forces to  promote the undertaking. Thereafter, the project was upgraded  to an international investment project with active support from  the Japanese Government. The committee inspected the investment  environment in the Dalian Development Zone and carried out  research on related matters, leading to a feasibility report on  the joint development of the Dalian Industrial Park. Hence, the  committee joined hands with 22 influential large companies,  enterprises, and financial institutions in Japan to found Dalian  Industrial Park Company Limited, and former Prime Minister  Takeshita attended the founding ceremony. In early 1992, the  draft of the agreement on developing a whole stretch of land in  Dalian Industrial Park was signed in Tokyo. In 1992, at the  State Council's 101st executive meeting, which was presided over  by Premier Li Peng, the feasibility report on the Dalian  Industrial Park project was discussed and passed. On 5 October  the same year, the official agreement was signed in Beijing, and  Vice Premier Tian Jiyun attended the signing ceremony.  <H5>  Substantive Progress in Canvassing Businesses and Funds </H5>   Since 19 October 1992, projects involving 1.4 million cubic  meters of earth and stone have been completed, 6.5 km of roads  have been built, some pipes and cables have been laid, four  power switching stations have been erected, two heat-suppling  boiler rooms and one heat exchange station have been  constructed, and all are of high quality. The work in  canvassing businesses and funds has also made substantive  progress. More than 300 enterprises specializing in machinery,  electric appliances, chemical industry, and clothing have come  to inspect the area and negotiate contracts, and a large number  of well-known enterprises have come to inspect the projects in  the industrial park, including Yamatake Honeywell Company  Limited, Fuji Electric Company Limited, Toto Limited, and  Konica, which are listed among the "world's 500 largest  industrial enterprises" by "FORTUNE" magazine. Technologically  advanced companies such as the (Namuko) Company and Takara Shuzo  Company Limited, which are the pioneers in integrated circuit  and genetic engineering, have also come on inspection visits.  Reports have indicated that 27 enterprises have now received  approval to enter the park, and their investments amount to $200  million. Seven of the enterprises have begun work, and it is  estimated that the land allocated for enterprises this year will  reach 60 percent of the total area. Finally, the park is  expected to attract a total of 100 enterprises and over $600  million in investment.</p>

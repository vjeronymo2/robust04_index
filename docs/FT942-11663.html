			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / IBM to set up data network across China International Business Machines has been chosen by China's ministry of electronics industry to lead a vast project to link about 500 cities to a national 'information highway' data network. Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed by Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, and Mr Zou Jiahua, a Chinese vice-premier, IBM will head the 'Golden Bridge' project, one of three initiatives designed to modernise China's data communications and computing infrastructure. The project will involve designing and building regional networks in cities across China, along with a 'backbone' network linking the regional systems. The effort will be led by a joint venture, based in Beijing, between IBM China and Ji Tong Communications, a company affiliated to the Chinese ministry of electronics industry. 'This is China's version of the information highway,' said Mr Ned Lautenbach, head of IBM's international operations. 'The Chinese government has set very ambitious goals and we are thrilled to have been selected to work with them.' IBM has also been chosen as the primary consultant on two other 'golden projects': Golden Card will establish facilities for the credit and debit cards throughout China, and Golden Customs will create computerised record-keeping and tracking systems for China's exports and imports. 'IBM is a famous computer company and has a long history of working with us,' said Mr Zou. 'Its technology and experience have contributed greatly to the development of the information technology industry in China.' As part of its expansion in China, IBM plans to establish a software development centre in Shanghai to develop programs for use in China and for export. Three networking technology centres will be opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou providing consulting services to Chinese customers, linking computers to networks. IBM's presence in China dates back to 1935. The company left China when the communist regime took over and came back in 1982 as an offshore business. In September 1992 IBM China became a wholly owned foreign enterprise, authorised to trade in local currency and to hire Chinese employees. 'In the last 18 months or so we have been aggressively growing our resources, our commitment and our business in China,' said Mr Lautenbach. These moves reflect the Clinton administration's liberalisation of export controls on high-technology goods sold to China.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.J. Tzou and Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan is  determined to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) to play a  positive and constructive role in the new world trade order,  Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said here Tuesday [12  April].    Chiang told participants at a ministerial meeting of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that "the Customs  Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" will do its part  to help boost the healthy development of a multilateral trade  system.    Taiwan, which applied to join GATT as a separate customs  territory in January 1990 and was accepted as an observer in  September 1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this  year.    All GATT signatories are set to become members of the WTO,  which will be given tougher enforcement powers to supersede GATT  and will start operations between January and July next year.    About 1,000 delegates from some 150 countries are attending  the four-day GATT ministerial meeting, which is set to endorse  the agreement reached during Uruguay Round talks in mid-December.    Chiang stressed that as the world's 14th largest trading  nation, Taiwan is ready to devote itself to worldwide economic  liberalization and market-oriented trading reforms.    Chiang's seven-minute speech won resounding applause from  the  other GATT delegates.    The speech also marked the first time that a ranking Taiwan  official has spoken at a gathering of international  organizations since Taiwan withdrew from the United Nations in  1971.    The GATT meeting will continue through Friday before making  a  "Marrakech Declaration" and establishing a WTO preparatory  committee.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Canadian central banker calls time Mr John Crow, the Bank of Canada governor who has built a reputation as one of the industrial world's most ardent inflation fighters, said yesterday he would not be available for another term in office when his first seven-year term expires next month. Mr Crow, who is also chairman of the Group of 10 central bank governors, cited 'personal reasons'. However, the newly elected Liberal government in Ottawa has been under strong political pressure not to offer Mr Crow a second term. While foreign investors and domestic business leaders have strongly backed his anti-inflation crusade, the Bank of Canada's tight money policies between 1988 and mid-1992 are widely blamed for exacerbating the recent recession. Mr Crow's position was also undermined by a blunt and condescending manner, which offended members of the Liberal caucus during their years in opposition. He will be replaced by his deputy, Mr Gordon Thiessen. According to one former Bank of Canada official, the two men's views on economic policy are virtually identical, but Mr Thiessen has a reputation as a more skilful communicator. 'Gordon could say the same thing and finesse it,' one former finance department official said yesterday. The Canadian dollar initially sank on news of Mr Crow's departure, but recovered quickly to 74.85 US cents in the early afternoon, half a cent above its opening level. Canada's inflation rate has dropped from 5.6 per cent in 1991 to 1.9 per cent in the year to November. The commercial banks' prime lending rate reached a peak of 14.75 per cent in mid-1990 but has since tumbled to 5.5 per cent. The finance minister, Mr Paul Martin, said the government aimed to hold Canada's annual inflation rate within a 1-3 per cent range until at least 1998. Although he stressed a commitment to containing inflation, the targets are more flexible than the 'zero inflation' policy favoured by Mr Crow.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Decline in members hits union THE FURNITURE union, FTAT, lost more than 10 per cent of its membership in the past financial year and expects to go into deficit next year for the first time since the mid 1980s. The figure, disclosed by Mr Colin Christopher, general secretary, is further evidence of a recession-led fall in union membership. All unions have suffered, particularly those in manufacturing. Mr Christopher said the decline at the FTAT was linked to the dependency of the British furniture industry on the construction industry, which has been badly affected by the recession. He said the union was bracing itself for continuing difficulties next year. 'We are losing hundreds of members every month.' Two factory closures in the past five weeks, costing 700 jobs, were typical. The union's executive is drawing up cost-cutting proposals, including scaling down its two-yearly conference and shedding officers through natural wastage. The FTAT has just more than 32,000 members, down from more than 36,000 at the begining of last year. More than 22,000 young people in London will have nowhere to go after leaving school this year in spite of a government guarantee of a training place, according to the Association of London Authorities. The association has projected figures from 1989 - 91 to this year to make the forecast. It said the numbers without any training, job or education had risen steadily since 1988.</p>

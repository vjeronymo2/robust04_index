			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Big rise in air traffic reported Strong air-traffic growth figures for June were reported yesterday by airlines and airports. The figures confirm the recovery in the UK air travel business, a traditional early barometer of overall economic activity, Paul Betts writes. British Midland Airways, the UK's second-largest scheduled airline, said passenger traffic last month rose 9 per cent compared with June last year. BAA, the privatised airports operator, also reported a 9.1 per cent increase in passenger numbers at its seven airports last month compared with June 1993. Traffic at Gatwick grew nearly 10 per cent, the biggest monthly increase for more than three years, while Heathrow was up almost 9 per cent. Both Stansted and Glasgow grew 12.3 per cent. Manchester Airport, which is not owned by BAA, reported an even higher increase last month of 14.2 per cent. The figures follow a strong performance at British Airways which last week reported an 11.2 per cent increase in passenger traffic last month.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: VHE worth Pounds 37m in placing VHE HOLDINGS, a specialist contractor, is coming to the main market via a placing which values the company at Pounds 36.9m. Founded in 1979, the Barnsley-based company is involved in environmental land reclamation and regeneration and civil engineering, mostly in the Midlands and the north of England. A roadshow has given presentations to about 100 institutions in London and a further 10 in Scotland and it is believed the placing, sponsored by Panmure Gordon, will be comfortably over-subscribed. Some 10.9m shares are being placed at 115p each, of which 2.1m are new, and represent 34 per cent of the enlarged equity. At present Mr Brian Waldron, the 54-year-old founder and chairman, and Mr Brian Thomson, the 45-year-old managing director, who joined in 1984, each hold 50 per cent. After expenses VHE will receive Pounds 2m, leaving the company with about Pounds 6m in cash. In the year to March 31 pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.89m (Pounds 946,000) on turnover of Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 15.8m). Currently its order-book stands at Pounds 20m. VHE has made no profits forecast for the year to March 31 1994, but analysts are expecting between Pounds 3.4m and Pounds 4m pre-tax. About 19 per cent of VHE's turnover in the current year is expected to derive from St Paul's, a property company of which Mr Waldron and Mr Thomson, directly or through trusts, each own 40 per cent. VHE's contracts range in value from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 10m. The reasons cited for the flotation include the fact that its enlarged capital base and increased resources will allow it to 'tender for larger contracts as main contractors and to perform those larger contracts which it is awarded'. The Department of the Environment has reckoned that there are about 101,000 acres of derelict land to be reclaimed in England, such as former coal mines, steel works and power stations. Since 1991 VHE has reclaimed about 1,000 acres of contaminated land.</p>

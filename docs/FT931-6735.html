			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad With the quibbles of the Office of Fair Trading brushed aside by Mr Michael Heseltine, the combatants in the package tour market have returned to battling each other. Owners is certainly making a spirited fight of it. The company has now promised a 43 per cent increase in this year's dividend and outlined increased benefits from its preferred alliance with Thomas Cook. This firmly lobs the beach ball back into Airtours' court. The market suggests Airtours will have to increase its offer. Airtours wants a quick resolution to ensure it benefits fully from Owners' summer holiday profits. Its cause would be greatly helped by a recommendation for any increased offer. But given Owners' fierce criticism of an enlarged Airtours' future prospects, it is unlikely to win approval for a largely paper offer. Airtours has more reason than ever, therefore, to increase the cash alternative.</p>

A spokesman for the ministry said that some foreign and  Russian media have quoted an anonymous intelligence source as  saying the program was under the Russian Defense Ministry.    The spokesman said it is astonishing that the story,  circulated by Western media in search of sensation, was  thoughtlessly repeated by some Russian mass media organs.    "Russia is neither developing nor producing biological  weapons," the spokesman stated.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives considered the  copyright bill at 1345 today. Today's session was a  continuation of two previous sessions held in the past two  weeks. The bill contains 78 articles.    During today's session the debate by opposition MP's  continued to attack the government's presentation of the bill to  parliament. They said the bill does not benefit the Thai people.  The motive for enactment of the copyright law is to exchange it  for trade privileges from the United States. The debate by  opposition MP's opposed protection for computer software, which  is considered a type of literary work. Any duplication or use  without consent by software copyright holders is punishable by  law because it constitutes a violation of copyright. To protect  copyright software amounts to hindering national progress  because opportunities for students to study computers and  programming will be limited despite the fact that computers are  a technology and equipment for modernization.    Opposition MP's also asked the commission in charge of the  copyright bill to withdraw the bill for review. They said they  disagreed with the bill from the beginning, as evidenced by  their rejection in the first reading and their refusal to join  the commission in the second reading. They will boycott any  deliberations at the next reading. They then walked out of the  session at 1600.    Before concluding at 1655, the session voted to approve the  copyright bill in the third reading so the bill will now be  forwarded to the Senate for consideration.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / TV transmission network will be sold by tender BRITAIN is to become the first country to privatise part of its television transmission network, with the sale by tender of National Transcommunications Ltd, formerly the Independent Broadcasting Authority's engineering division. City analysts believe the sale of NTL, which this year expects to make pre-tax profit of about Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 77m, may raise between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m. NTL is expected to become one of the first new entrants into the UK's liberalised telecommunications market. It is already in detailed negotiations with the Office of Telecommunications, the industry regulator, over a licence to use its network to transmit television, data and telephone services. It is thought likely that NTL might form alliances with groups such as cable television operators seeking to take advantage of the government's recent decision to end the telecommunications duopoly held by BT and Mercury. Mr Peter Lloyd, the broadcasting minister, said bidders were expected to include foreign telecommunications and television groups. The privatisation is due in 1996. Price Waterhouse, the government's lead financial adviser on the sale, said it had already received inquiries from between 30 and 40 foreign and UK companies. The company operates about 475 transmitting sites and has access to a further 475 run by the BBC. NTL's main business is transmitting for the ITV independent television companies, Channel 4, the Welsh fourth channel S4C, and 50 independent local radio stations. This will this year generate Pounds 61m, of NTL's revenues. Dr John Forrest, the company's executive chairman, forecast that within the next few years a third of NTL's income might come from new business activities, transmitting for television's planned Channel 5 and local independent radio contractors, as well as video conferencing, data transmission and telephony services to businesses. NTL's management favours a bid from a consortium that would include a 15 per cent stake for the company's 770 employees as well as bringing it access to European markets. Television South West, the ITV contractor for the west country, is backing the Channel Three Wales and the West consortium, bidding for the commercial television franchise held by HTV covering Wales and the west. TSW is joined in the consortium by a number of institutional investors.</p>

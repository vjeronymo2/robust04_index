			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED MAKES BID FOR NEW EUROPEAN ROUTES  </P> <P> United Airlines has asked the federal government for approval to serve Madrid  and Manchester, England, from its hub at Washington Dulles International  Airport.  </P> <P> United said it would provide daily service on each route, using Boeing  767-200ER aircraft.  </P> <P> Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said the applications were part of a United strategy  to become "a truly global airline in the 1990s."  </P> <P> He said United's hub at Dulles, in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, would  permit Madrid and Manchester passengers to connect with United flights to 55  other cities in the United States.  </P> <P> In Europe, he said, United's strategy is to concentrate service on primary  transportation centers in France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom and to  expand to other European cities as opportunities arise and new aircraft become  available.  </P> <P> Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow and Milan/Rome also are on United's list of cities to be  served, Wolf said.  </P> <P> United also has been expanding aggressively in the Pacific.  </P></p>

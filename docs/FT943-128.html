			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sandvik abandons German deal Sandvik, the Swedish engineering group, has abandoned plans to buy the cemented carbide activities of Germany's Krupp Widia after objections from the German cartel authorities. Its move came after the Bundeskartellamt, the German anti-trust authority, said Sandvik would gain too strong a position in certain products in Germany if the acquisition went ahead. It said Sandvik's market share would be more than 30 per cent in segments such as inserts for lathes. Sandvik believes the authority was looking too narrowly at specific market segments rather than at the wider market for metal cutting tools when it reached its decision. The purchase, which would have lifted Sandvik's turnover by SKr1.6bn a year from its current SKr22bn (Dollars 2.8bn) was agreed in February as part of the company's plans to develop its operations in Germany, its second biggest market. The purchase price was not disclosed. Sandvik said Krupp Widia would have been run independently so that competition would not have been affected. There would have been scope for technology exchange and common purchase of raw materials, it noted. Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom, Sandvik chief executive, said: 'We are convinced the transaction would have provided benefits for several parties, particularly Widia and the German engineering industry.' Sandvik stressed that its broader expansion plans had not been derailed.</p>

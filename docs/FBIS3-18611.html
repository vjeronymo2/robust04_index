In His View 12 June Poll Goes  Beyond the Specific Issue"]    [Text] Geneva, 3 Mar (ATS) -- The 12 June vote on the  creation of Swiss blue helmets has an importance which goes  "well beyond the specific issue" being put to the people. This  is what Federal Council Member Flavio Cotti said in Geneva on  Thursday [3 March] evening. The head of the DFAE [Federal  Department of Foreign Affairs], who was the guest of the  University Institute of Higher International Studies, also said  he did not want to be classed among those who "praise" the  European Union [EU] "at all costs."    The 12 June vote is very important with regard to the open  foreign policy which Switzerland intends to pursue, the head of  the DFAE said. His speech, entitled "The Integration of West  Europe Is an Omnipresent Reality for Switzerland," dealt mainly  with the Confederation's place in the community of nations.    Switzerland cannot ignore the influence which the Twelve  have  on its present and future development, Flavio Cotti pointed out.  The development of a European structure is not achieved easily,  he reaffirmed. The fact remains, the Federal Council member  stressed, that the Twelve have so far managed to overcome the  obstacles and give the Community a new dimension. The EU has  become unavoidable and Switzerland cannot ignore it.    The DFAE chief also stressed the importance of Swiss  membership of the United Nations. "Switzerland's entry into the  United Nations as a full member will show its determination to  participate in the building of a system of collective security  and the pursuit of an active policy in favor of peace."  Thinking mainly of the United Nations and the EU, Mr. Cotti  said that "this absence at the highest level can only harm  Switzerland's interests in the medium and long term."</p>

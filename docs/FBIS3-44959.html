			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael Smith, Rain Ren in Beijing and M.Y. Sung] </F>   [Text] A senior government official has denied accusations  he cancelled a visit to Beijing because of the row over calls  for civil servants to brief China's Preliminary Working  Committee (PWC).    A senior Chinese official said yesterday the Secretary for  Economic Services Gordon Siu had called off a scheduled business  trip to Beijing to avoid further confrontation over his presence  in the Chinese capital.    The incident fuelled Sino-British tensions over this week's  sensitive invitation for Hong Kong government officials to brief  the PWC.    Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office director Lu Ping said Siu  had cancelled a prearranged visit to sign a civil aviation  agreement with the mainland.    But Siu rejected the claim, saying arrangements had not been  finalised and he had not decided whether to go or not.    "I have not given any indication of when I will visit China,  and certainly as far as the signing of the agreement is  concerned it will probably be by the director (of Civil  Aviation) and his team," Siu said.    Lu maintained the visit had been called off and accused  Governor Chris Patten of confusing politics and the economy, a  criticism which he has repeatedly directed at China.    "He (Patten) has been all along talking about the separation  of politics and economy. Now he himself is mixing up the two,"  Lu said.    But Patten went on the defensive and said there were hidden  motives behind the invitation.    The Hong Kong government rejected an invitation this week  for  Siu to brief the PWC on the controversial Airport Corporation  Bill.    It is believed the invite has political motives and signals  the start of a fight for control of the Hong Kong bureaucracy  before 1997.    A government spokesman also rejected a media report which  said civil servants who accepted the PWC's invitation would be  committing an act of treason as "absolute nonsense".    He said many officials could retain contacts with the PWC on  an informal basis.    Patten said yesterday there were hidden motives behind the  invitation, arguing the PWC already had access to government  officials through their many members involved in the Airport  Consultative Committee, the Legislative Council and the  Provisional Airport Authority.    "I think one has to take this particular request with a  pinch  of salt and ask some questions about the motive, Patten said.    Patten reiterated the two sides should use the established  channels for communication.    "I very much hope that we can get through this stage of  adjectives and words being thrown at us and get on with the  business of cooperation," he said.</p>

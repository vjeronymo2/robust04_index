			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Dispute disrupts Irish mail service INTERNATIONAL mail services to and from Ireland face prolonged disruption because of a dispute over casual labour at An Post, Ireland's postal services company. The state-run company yesterday suspended more than 300 staff after they refused to work with 180 part-time and casual employees brought into Dublin's central sorting office. An Post yesterday warned the public not to post letters in Dublin until further notice. The dispute began over the implementation of measures designed to reduce An Post's projected IPounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.27m) loss this year. These include employing casual labour to reduce overtime bills, the ending of a 1987 productivity agreement and the transfer of staff to new offices. The measures have been recommended by an independent tribunal. Mr David Begg, the general secretary of the Communications Workers Union, said: 'We are very worried about An Post's intentions. 'We would be very happy to have full-time permanent staff recruited but since we cannot get the facts about the proposed casual and part-time recruits we have to be concerned that the intention is to casualise the Post Office as an employment,' he said. The union is ballotting its members on the tribunal's recommendations.</p>

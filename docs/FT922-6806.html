			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y in talks on tax payments OLYMPIA &amp; York has funnelled so much cash out of its profitable US buildings in recent months that it has asked authorities in New York for temporary relief on municipal tax payments which fall due on July 1. O&amp;Y said yesterday it was exploring 'options' with the New York City administration, and was likely to reach an agreement in the next week. About USDollars 75m in property tax payments fall due on July 1. Although only four of O&amp;Y's 12 New York buildings have cash flow problems, the company has diverted every spare dollar from its US operations to the cash-starved Canadian parent and the Canary Wharf project in London. O&amp;Y hopes that last week's Ontario court order, which freezes its Canadian debt obligations under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act (CCAA), will give it sufficient breathing space to replenish the coffers of its US operations. Its ability to do so partly depends on petitions to be brought by bondholders in the Ontario Court of Justice today to exclude some of the developer's most prized Canadian buildings from the CCAA order. The bondholders' move to reverse the order has wide implications for all forms of non-recourse finance. The bonds were issued by single-purpose companies with no recourse to O&amp;Y Developments, the parent. The bondholders had previously assumed that they would be insulated from the parent's liquidity crisis. The bondholders will argue that their claims should be separated from those of O&amp;Y's other creditors and that they should be at liberty, if necessary, to seize rents from the buildings to cover overdue debt-service payments. The CCAA order issued last week covers a total of 28 entities besides the parent company. They include First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's 72-storey flagship in Toronto, as well as other buildings in Toronto, Calgary and Ottawa. The application is likely to be opposed by O&amp;Y's bank lenders, whose claims on the projects in question generally rank behind the bondholders. However, some of the banks which provided a Dollars 2.5bn jumbo loan to O&amp;Y are expected to raise concerns of their own about the CCAA order. The banks contend that the order in its present form permits O&amp;Y to channel surplus cash from its Canadian assets to the US and UK operations, which have not been brought under court protection. The banks will also mount a separate court challenge today against the amount of collateral provided by the developer to its Canadian lenders. The international group is seeking to assert its rights to the security pledged on a Dollars 100m loan advanced earlier this year by four Canadian banks.</p>

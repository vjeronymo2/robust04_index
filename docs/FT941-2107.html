			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (8): UK visitors are the bread and butter - The island has become an all-year-round destination. During peak summer periods there are about 22,000 beds available; during the winter about 6,000 / Tourism The biggest skill we can exercise is to keep the island as it is and not destroy it. Jersey's real strength is what God built, not what we have put here. These are the words of Mrs Sheila Henwood, director of Jersey Tourism. Mrs Henwood believes that the island continues to be a good product to sell. 'We manage to keep a good balance between sophistication and simplicity. It is a very safe environment that has a similar infrastructure to that of the visitor's home but with the exotic appearance of an island.' The last buoyant trading year for Jersey's tourist industry was 1990 - before the recession hit. Since then, visitor numbers have dropped about 17 per cent which, with discounting, probably represents a 20 per cent drop in total value. But Mrs Henwood feels the tide has now turned. 'Last year, visitor numbers from the UK and Europe were up 2 per cent, but there is still a degree of discounting going on. Because the 1980s were such easy years, any drop impacts.' The two leading trends are towards short-stay visitors and more visitors from continental Europe. 'The Europeans produce very good business - they stay longer than the British and they spend well. But we recognise very strongly that the UK is our bread and butter,' says Mrs Henwood. Of an estimated 683,000 visitors who stayed overnight last year, some 542,000 were from the UK. France produced 47,900; Germany 20,700; Sweden 17,300; and Ireland 11,600. The island has become an all-year-round destination. During peak summer periods there are about 22,000 beds available; during the winter about 6,000. With several big attractions open during the winter, and the island's physical attractiveness little diminished, most hotels retain a steady flow of visitors during the cooler months. Mr Renzo Martin, president of the island's hoteliers' association and managing director of five Jersey hotels, said: 'The last two years have been tough. We have had to work harder for less bookings and the lack of money meant the local market in dinners and functions has been down this winter.' But Mr Martin says bookings and inquiries are now well up on this time last year, as are the number of conversions from inquiries to bookings. 'Because the island is geared to a higher economy than the UK, we've got to make good money. The operation costs of hotels are much higher and we do not have any passing trade. He believes the States will see the industry through this difficult time. 'For the benefit of the island overall, the tourism industry is probably number one in terms of providing resources, employment and work to other businesses. 'The hoteliers' association and the tourism department have a very good liaison. We must work together, then we can achieve a lot,' he said. The island is hoping to set up a central reservation system. Discussions about its funding are currently going on between the public and private sectors and everyone would like to see it activated later this year. Most hoteliers advertise privately in UK publications and the tourism department will this year spend about Pounds 3.5m in marketing Jersey in the UK. About Pounds 1m of this will be spent in television and Pounds 1m in the press, mostly concentrated in southern regions. Mr David de Carteret, Jersey Tourism's marketing manager, said the advertising inquiry response was so far about 20 per cent up on last year. 'This year we are getting a resurgence of interest in the family market. I think the reasons are that many of our hotels have large family rooms so they can show a 15-20 per cent price advantage over Mediterranean destinations. Also, the speed and ease of getting here is more suitable for children,' he said. He said the Irish market was picking up, largely due to an increase in departure points in Ireland. 'It is very much part of the desire of the public to travel from a local airport. Other destinations may be accessed from only three or four places, but Jersey can be accessed from many smaller airports.' The island, only 14 miles from France, also benefits from large numbers of day trip visitors. Many are from continental Europe; about 140,000 a year. Jersey's conference business has suffered because of the recession but the island still hosts about 20,000 delegates a year for conferences. Seventy-one per cent of this business comes from the UK, although last year business from continental Europe increased by 50 per cent. Big growth has been seen in small to medium-sized conferences of fewer than 100 delegates, although conferences of 1,500 or more delegates are still accommodated. Jersey offers one of the cheapest rates in Britain - about Pounds 83 a head for 24 hours in a four-star venue, compared with about Pounds 140 in London or the Home Counties. Mrs Henwood said of the whole industry: 'The message for 1994 is upbeat. The feedback is positive on inquiries and bookings and we are going for quality and sustainable development.'</p>

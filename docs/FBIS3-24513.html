Voyeykov, </F> Mechanical Problems Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC  532.527:551.515]    [Abstract] Detailed experimental studies were made of the  fine structure of a current of stratified fluid behind a  cylinder in the range of parameters: 5 &lt; Re = Ud/_n_ &lt;  1400,  0.001 &lt; Fr[.sup]i[/] = U/Nd &lt; 3, 120 &lt; C = _l_/d &lt; 15000   (0.01 &lt; U &lt; 3 cm/s, 0.2 &lt; N &lt; 1 s[.sup]-1[/], 0.8 &lt; d  &lt;  7.6 cm). In addition to internal waves, eddies and a wake  current, high-gradient envelopes arising on the boundary of the  density wake and in the wakes behind eddies are important  structural elements of a current. The rules for identification  of eddy current elements are formulated and the following types  of vortical systems are discriminated: small-scale eddies  localized in a high-gradient envelope, eddies submerged in a  density wake and so-called hanging eddies. The dependencies of  their geometric characteristics on the current parameters are  determined. A new class of instability is defined: structural  (microscale) instability when a complex relief of the horizontal  isopycnic surfaces is observed against a background of a smooth  velocity distribution. Fourteen characteristic types of  structures are discriminated and a map of current systems is  plotted. It is shown that on the (lgRe, lgFr[.sup]i[/]) plane  the boundaries between systems are segments of straight lines.  Figures 5; references 13: 8 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

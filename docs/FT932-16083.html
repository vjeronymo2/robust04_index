			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: AMD exceeds forecast ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday reported higher-than-expected first-quarter results, although an increase in tax rates caused a dip in earnings. Revenues for the first quarter were Dollars 407.4m. Net income was Dollars 61.5m before payment of preferred stock dividends. After the preferred dividend, quarterly net income amounted to Dollars 58.9m, or 63 cents a share. In the same quarter a year ago AMD reported higher earnings of Dollars 84.9m before the dividend, and Dollars 82.3m, or 90 cents, after the dividend, on the same level of revenues. AMD said its tax rate in the quarter was 28 per cent, against 15 per cent in the first quarter of 1992 when it was able to carry forward losses and use tax credits to lower its overall tax rate. It said sales of its 386 microprocessor, used in personal computers, reached record volumes, although prices were 'dramatically lower' than a year ago. Reduced microprocessor revenues were more than offset by increased sales of other products, including non-volatile memory chips. Sales in North America and Europe reached record levels in the quarter, while in Japan they declined, reflecting continued weakness in the Japanese semiconductor market. 'The current market recovery in information technology, with strong demand for computation and communications equipment, plays directly into AMD's strengths,' said Mr W. J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive. AMD also announced it had signed a definitive agreement with Fujitsu of Japan to build a Dollars 700m semiconductor plant in Wakamatsu, Japan.</p>

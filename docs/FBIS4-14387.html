			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombo, April 28 (AFP) -- Sri Lanka President  Dingiri Banda Wijetunga has indefinitely postponed a planned  visit to China amid a serious crisis within his ruling party,  press reports here said Thursday [28 April].    Wijetunga was due to leave on May 8 on a five-day tour of  China which was to be his first foreign visit since coming to  power in May last year.    State-run newspapers said Wijetunga had put off the trip  indefinitely, but gave no reason for the move. However, the  privately-ownned Sinhalese language Divaina newspaper said the  decision was due to serious squabbling within his party.    Sections of the ruling United National Party (UNP) have  openly questioned Wijetunga's ability to lead them to victory at  national elections later this year, following the UNP's  humiliating defeat at a local election last month.    The March 24 defeat in the southern provincial council  elections, is seen as the most serious set back for the UNP  since it came to power in 1977.</p>

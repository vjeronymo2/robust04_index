			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal by the Federation Council of the Russian Federation </F> Federal Assembly to the Russian Federation President in  Connection With the Russian Federation President's Message to  the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State"]    [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich!    A thorough study of the Russian Federation president's  message to the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian  State (Main Areas of Domestic and Foreign Policy)" has been  completed in the committees and commissions of the Federation  Council of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. Specific  measures have been outlined, whose implementation via the  Federation Council will guarantee steady cooperation among all  the branches of power in the interests of democracy and  prosperity in Russia.    We welcome the political desire expressed by the Russian  Federation president in his message to further pursue the  reforms course and unite all constructive forces in society with  a view to carrying out systematic, joint, and creative work for  the good of the country and its citizens in order to strengthen  the Russian state.    We view the pact on achieving civil accord in Russia as an  important step in implementing the Russian Federation  president's message, enabling us to establish democratic control  over the commitments taken on by all branches of power, parties,  and social organizations and movements.    We share the Russian Federation president's view that in  Russia today there is no firmer basis for achieving civil accord  in society, emerging from the crisis, and successfully  continuing progressive transformations than the Russian  Federation Constitution, adopted by nationwide vote in December  1993. Our task is to realize in practice the full potential of  our state's fundamental law.    In this connection the Federation Council supports the  proposal by the Russian Federation president to establish a  united constitutional commission and a united working group to  coordinate and enhance the effectiveness of legislative  activity. In formulating plans for legislative work, the  Federation Council will be guided exclusively by its own  constitutional powers and the standing orders of the first  convocation of the Federation Council formulated on the basis of  the Russian Federation Constitution.    The message rightly stresses that power in a rule-of-law  state is bound by the law. The place and extremely important  role of the Federal Assembly and its chambers within the  existing political system in Russia is determined by this fact.  We share the concern expressed in the message that practical  mechanisms for promoting democracy in Russia are underdeveloped.  At the present time work has been initiated by the Federation  Council within the limits of the chambers' powers as enshrined  by the Russian Federation Constitution to create effective legal  mechanisms of power within the Russian state both at the federal  level and in the components of the Federation.    The Federation Council supports the Russian Federation  president's stance regarding the need to find a sensible  relationship between the speed of reforms and the real social  cost of the reforms, bringing into play all available reserves  including effective state regulation compatible with market  mechanisms.    We believe it necessary at federal, regional, and local  level to urgently implement a set of measures to achieve actual  realization of the provisions of the Russian Federation  president's message.    We favor constructive and reliable cooperation among all the  federal power structures. We hereby announce our refusal to  countenance any contradictions dictated by the interests of  political opportunism that hamper the normal exercise of the  Russian Federation president's powers and those of the Russian  Federation Government.    At the same time we are entitled to count on a similarly  responsible attitude from the Russian Federation president and  the Russian Federation Government regarding problems on which  the Federation Council focuses its attention. To date,  unfortunately, there have been several occasions when appeals by  the Federation Council on extremely acute problems of economics  and politics have not met with an appropriate response from the  executive branch.    For all the different peoples who live in our state,  regardless of their ethnic, religious, and linguistic groupings,  this country is their common home. None of them should be  placed in an unequal legal or moral position. It is  particularly important to stress this fact today, when the  country is making the transition from a monopoly ideology to  cultural diversity. In accordance with the spirit of the  Russian Federation president's message, the Federation Council  is exercising all its constitutional powers to restore,  strengthen, and develop the values of this Russian superethnic  community which is unique in the world.    In its daily cooperation with the State Duma, the Russian  Federation president, and the Russian Federation Government, the  Federation Council intends to actively establish constructive  political, economic, scientific, and cultural ties among all  components of the Federation and to strengthen the planned  accord among political parties and national, social, and  political movements.    Once again stressing its fundamental agreement with the  spirit and letter of the message, the Federation Council  insistently requests the Russian Federation president and  Russian Federation Government to make every possible effort to  encourage strict observance of the provisions and standards of  the nationally adopted Russian Federation Constitution, the  Federation Treaty, and Russian Federation laws, and to create  favorable conditions for the rigorous implementation of these  provisions and norms.    We believe it necessary to speed up the preparation of a  program of practical actions across the entire spectrum of  domestic and foreign policy areas formulated in the Russian  Federation president's message.    The Federation Council sees the path to strengthening the  Russian state lying through united political will, civil accord,  and cooperation among all the branches of power and the citizens  of Russia, and it will make every effort to encourage rapid  progress along this path.    [Signed] The Federation Council of the Russian Federation  Federal Assembly</p>

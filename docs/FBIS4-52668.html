Reporters and debaters pointed out that the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song fully elucidated the programmatic tasks and  plans so that all party members and working people could  endlessly consummate the chuche revolutionary cause under the  leadership of the dear comrade leader.    Stressing that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has  victoriously led the revolution and construction with an  extraordinary wisdom and outstanding leadership and, also, is  the prominent man [wiin] who gained an immortal achievement that  will shine forever in history, they said that today our party,  people, and Army are safeguarding, adhering to, and glorifying  the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style by  upholding a slogan reading "The Whole Party, All People, and  Entire Army Should Endlessly Consummate the Socialist Cause With  Their Single-Hearted Unity."    They noted: Over the past years, KDWU organizations and  propaganda functionaries have regarded it as the most important  tasks in their ideological work to educate the union members so  that they can uphold the party's leadership with their loyalty.  They concretely proposed tasks to further strengthen the work.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: To adhere  to the popular mass-centered socialism of our country and to  brilliantly consummate the chuche revolutionary cause, the  entire party and all people should properly uphold Comrade Kim  Chong-il's leadership. Here lies the firm guarantee to  inheriting and consummating the socialist cause.    The reporters and debaters said: KDWU organizations and  propaganda functionaries at each level should strengthen  ideological and indoctrination work so that the union members  can absolutely admire and uphold our party based on their  revolutionary faith and obligation. With various forms and  methods, they should properly carry out the work of making the  union members deeply grasp our party's greatness and immortal  achievement by mobilizing and utilizing all ideological and  indoctrination work systems of the union.    They stressed that thoroughly establishing the party's  leadership system is the lifeline of the union's ideological  work, as well as the basic principle for its activity, and  pointed out that a firm discipline in which the union members  act as one under the leadership of the party, as well as a  revolutionary ethos in which the union members unconditionally  and endlessly implement the party's line and policy should be  established within the union.    They also said: All propaganda functionaries should make the  union members deeply grasp the superiority and invincibility of  socialism of our own style and should strengthen the  indoctrination work to have them cherish a firm faith that the  chuche socialist cause is certain of victory as long as there is  our party's leadership.    Saying that the union members' success in the ideological  and  indoctrination work depends on the role of propaganda  functionaries, who are directly in charge of it, the reporters  and debaters stressed: All propaganda functionaries and junior  functionaries should strongly arm themselves with our party's  revolutionary ideology, set an example in their work and life,  and practically carry out the management of junior  functionaries' days. As a result, they should responsibly and  actively carry out the propaganda and agitation work by raising  their political and practical levels.    A letter of pledge to Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader  of our party and people, was adopted at the meeting.</p>

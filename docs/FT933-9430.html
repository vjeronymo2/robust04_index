			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Oil's disappearing act: The chancellor's dilemma, an inside view One cause of our present borrowing problems that has received too little attention is the extraordinary and unexpected disappearance of tax revenues. Some of this can be attributed to the recession. But the recession cannot be blamed for the reduction in the share of national income that is taken in tax from 42 1/2 per cent in 1985-86 to 36 per cent predicted in March for 1993-94. That 6 per cent difference is worth over Pounds 35bn. It has made a significant contribution to the emergence of our Pounds 50bn borrowing problem. In a buoyant tax system, where revenue tends to rise and fall more than proportionally with national income, a recession may reduce the revenue share. But this explanation cannot account for the decline in the revenue share since 1985-86, since money incomes (and real incomes) are, despite the recession, still well above their 1985-86 levels. No, the most important single cause of the falling revenue share is the 1986 collapse in the oil price and the subsequent decline in oil production. The resulting loss of revenue was initially disguised by a surge in corporation tax (and other) revenues in the boom of the late 1980s. It has become apparent as other sources of revenue, notably corporation tax, have dried up in the recession of the early 1990s. On this view our present revenue shortfall is deep-seated and structural. Oil has gone out of the news, and people now forget that Britain's North Sea revenues have been the single most important influence on the public finances since the mid-1970s. They rose from nothing to just under 4 per cent of gross domestic product in 1984-85, and have since fallen back to pre-Thatcher levels. There was a virtually instantaneous loss of oil revenues worth nearly 2 per cent of GDP when the oil price plunged in early 1986. That revenue has never been replaced. Why did the government not act at once to replace what was (in today's money) a Pounds 12bn revenue loss? The short answer is they didn't need to because the great boom of the late 1980s increased the yield of other taxes, most notably corporation tax. The unexpected increase in corporation tax revenues from 2 per cent to 4 per cent of GDP covered the loss of oil revenues for a while. Their equally unanticipated disappearance in the early 1990s recession has now exposed the problem. The corporation tax roller-coaster is easy to explain with hindsight. The Lawson reform of 1984 had made the UK tax rate on profits one of the lowest in the world, and international companies, which always have some discretion in their internal transfer pricing, chose to take their profits in the UK. So the UK government, by taxing at a low rate, effectively bid away tax revenue from other countries. It was a version of Lafferism (low rates generating high revenues) which worked only as long as other countries allowed it. Over the years, they have responded by cutting their own corporation tax rates, and the bonanza has ended. The Lawson reform also produced a built-in rise and fall in corporation tax revenues. Cutting the tax rate from 52 per cent to 35 (now 33) per cent was bound in the long run to reduce the tax yield on a given level of profits. In the short term, however, the tax cut was phased in slowly, and more than offset by changing the system of capital allowances. Instead of writing off investment in a single year, we moved to a 25 per cent reducing balance system. Initially that produced a sharp fall in the value of allowances (and rise in the corporation tax yield) but over time, as the value of allowances has climbed back to its original level, the tax yield has fallen. A further factor was the increased investment of the late 1980s. That boosted the total value of allowances, which were carried over into the recession, enabling companies to set still-large allowances against shrinking profits. The effect was magnified by the concession made in the 1991 budget, enabling companies to set tax losses against profits earned up to three years earlier. The rise in corporation tax revenues clearly contributed to the fiscal optimism which underpinned the tax cuts of the late 1980s. Its fall in the early 1990s has aggravated the ensuing deterioration in the public finances. But if we compare tax revenue this year with the level in 1985-86, the share of corporation tax is unchanged. Of the 6 percentage point fall in the government's revenue share since then, two components stand out: the loss of oil revenues accounts for half the shortfall; income tax and National Insurance (NI) for another quarter. These figures underline the central message of this analysis, which is that today's problems have their origins in a surprisingly distant event, the 1986 collapse in the oil price, a fact that was concealed from us by the behaviour of corporation tax revenues. They also suggest that the tax cuts of 1987 and 1988, the NI reform of 1989, and the introduction of Peps, Tessas and independent taxation for women have eroded income tax revenue to an extent that now appears unsustainable. Before leaping to the conclusion that the tax cuts were wrong, we should remember two salient facts. First, and most surprising, the 6 percentage point reduction in the tax burden since 1985-86 has only brought it back to the level that Mrs Thatcher inherited from Labour in 1978-79. The main energies of the first Thatcher administration were directed to reducing borrowing, notably by means of the tax increases in the famous 1981 Budget. That, plus the new oil revenues, secured a 6 point rise in the tax burden in the first three Thatcher years. Those tax increases were reversed in the late 1980s against a background of public spending restraint (the second salient fact) which drove down its share of GDP from a peak of nearly 47 per cent in 1984-85 to 39 per cent in 1988-89. The loss of oil and income tax revenue did not matter as long as it was matched by the fall in the public spending ratio. Today's problems arise because the loss of revenue has proved permanent while the fall in spending has been reversed. Since it will be difficult to get spending down again, taxes have to go up. The government's misfortune is that the revenue from 'invisible' taxes with a low political profile (oil royalties, Petroleum Revenue Tax, corporation tax) has now to be replaced with much more visible (and therefore unpopular) tax increases. It is all part of the process of adapting to life without our North Sea riches, a theme to which l shall return next week.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bimbos finding favour, 3i says The structure of management buy-ins, a cousin of the more widely used management buy-out, has changed markedly in the past four years, according to research from 3i, the UK's largest supplier of private equity capital. The hybrid Bimbo - which stands for buy-in manage-ment buy-out - accounts for half of 3i's MBI deals, compared with about a quarter in 1990, the group says. 3i says that venture capitalists now recognise the Bimbo as less risky than the pure buy-in because the new team includes members of management already working in the company. At the same time, these MBI teams are increasingly being led by entrepreneurs who have already made money in other entrepreneurial ventures, 3i says. Nearly half the MBI teams 3i backs are now led by these 'second time entrepreneurs' compared with less than 20 per cent in 1990. These entrepreneurs will usually invest alongside the venture capitalists. Mr Patrick Dunne, the 3i director in charge of the MBI programme, says the group's experience is likely to be representative of a trend throughout the industry. 3i has backed 300 MBIs since 1986, considerably more than any competitor.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: The plot thickens for the century's final chapter - The novelist Ian McEwan explains how to read history like a book Listen, my friend,' a French academic once said to me in the early 1980s, 'you are talking as if history actually happened.' We were speaking of the Suez Crisis of 1956 which I had written about in a film. 'But didn't it?' I said to the pitying smiles and good-natured shrugs of a roomful of continental European critics. Did I not know, they asked, that history was a text to be deconstructed? It had no other reality. Ten years later, I met the same group and this time we were talking about the fall of the Berlin Wall, which I had written about in a novel. 'You lot,' I said, hoping to tease, 'don't believe that anything actually happened in Berlin at all.' Once again, the same pitying smiles. Oh that] No one believes that old stuff any more . . . But don't mock. Fashion is the very breath of our cultural energy, and we should no more deny it to intellectuals than we do to teenagers or dress designers. Spawn a thousand creatures of thought, and time and usage will select out those fittest to survive. And it is in this spirit that I want to revive the mental miniskirt or skateboard of yesteryear and consider history as a text. We have all been reading an immensely long novel and though we are in the final pages, no one quite knows how it is going to end. Its accounts of human misery and courage make the works of Primo Levi pale; its least unlovely characters could only be drawn by a godly Dostoyevsky; it has moments of invention that would have made Calvino weep with envy, and it attains peaks of tragic absurdity that would have sent Kafka cowering for solace into the arms of his father. The pages teem with interlacing plots in the manner of A Thousand and One Nights and the reader has to pick a way through. Like that classic, and like The Canterbury Tales, this book has about it a democratic plenitude because everyone gets to tell a story. The title is a little dull, but don't be put off; it is, after Marquez: A Hundred Years of Europe. Or shall we simply call this novel, The Twentieth Century? It's pretty hard to begin talking about a book this long. We all have our favourite bits, so why not be anecdotal? Personally, I like that moment near the beginning when the obscure young clerk with specs twirls his conceptual lasso and binds time, matter, space and gravity into two beautiful theories from which springs a whole new scientific paradigm. I was on the edge of my seat for the first performance of The Rite of Spring, and I was stirred by the tale of the young doctor who, one grey afternoon on an Oxford running track, pushed himself to the first four-minute mile. In fact, if you only read the chapters on scientific discovery, artistic expression and sporting achievement and skipped the rest, you would end the novel beaming with pride and love for modern Europeans. What tumultuous intellectual energy and curiosity] What humour, and brave, beautiful barings of the soul] What physical prowess and courage] What a people] But what you would have to skip is long, hard to read, and harder to understand. There are world wars, slaughter, torture, induced famine, forced migration, lies, propaganda and crazy ideologies and every cruelty and barbarity imaginable, with corpses piled a million deep page after page. The reader is insulted and disgusted by a mad and sickeningly repetitious tale of frenzied genocide in central Europe, of death factories and bureaucratic evil that seems finally to demolish his self-esteem, and cause him to damn all modern literature as an indulgent obscenity. Are we Europeans, with our 'Demoiselles d'Avignon', our heroic discovery of DNA, our European Cup, truly as bad as this? If so, can we ever forgive ourselves? And might we do it again? Troubled readers will suspect that applauding or deploring disparate episodes will take us no nearer to an understanding of this mighty novel. What we need is to discern the plot of all the plots, and we could do worse than try to think of a shape. A few years ago, when we were three-quarters of the way through, a plausible pattern for many was in the form of a V. From the imperial certainties and prosperity of the late 19th century, we descend into the mayhem of two world wars, reaching rock-bottom degradation with the Holocaust; from this point, roughly mid-century, we rise through postwar reconstruction, social stability, the German and Italian economic miracles, the entrenchment of liberal democracies, and European integration. True, there are the grey tyrannies of the east, but even here optimistic readers thought they could detect slow, if erratic, liberalisation. This simple, satisfying plot appears triumphantly vindicated by the events symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall. The second world war is finally over. Liberal democracies are inevitable everywhere. It is the end of history, some readers proclaimed, the end of this novel. But unread chapters remained, and to some the V is beginning to look like a zigzag, plunging from the peak of 1989 as the old viruses of the European disease, frozen to inaction by the Cold War, begin to swarm back into the bloodstream; on the fringes are racism, nationalism, xenophobia and anti-semitism. Among the political elites, there is a new nervousness about the European project, and helplessness before genocide in former Yugoslavia; there is unemployment, homelessness and recession; and everywhere that deep pessimism and ungenerosity of spirit known as the far right. Even as our novel squares up to its resolution, we may yet see this zigzag transformed into an asymmetrical W, for in these days of the information revolution we cram far more on the page, and events move quickly. Also, it seems unlikely that the postwar generations of Europeans, with the nightmares behind them, will easily abandon the consensual ideas that brought them prosperity and peace. Besides, the plots I have been talking of here belong to the mainstream of the political culture, and there are almost certainly other grand patterns that may turn out to be more important. The lives of women have been transformed, as have those of many working people. The environment has been degraded even as our anguish about it intensifies. Our electronic machines are becoming ever more interesting. The old are getting older, and migration is on the increase, as are anti-rational cults and religions of all kinds, with their attendant consolations and intolerance. According to literary fashion, it is for every reader to deconstruct this text. As we begin to turn to the final chapters we had better start thinking about the reviews we will prepare, not for newspapers and journals, but for bars, cafes, kitchens and bedrooms. Our chosen literary form is democratic: the more we listen to the reckonings of others, hear how they shuffle the priorities and try to see the different shapes of plots they discern, the better we will understand for ourselves this gigantic sprawling novel that no one can put down.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: No car, but a better pension Sir, The Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte analysis of the alternative ways of funding cars for employees (Management, May 10) appears to have overlooked one significant cost in the case of an increased salary. This salary would almost certainly be pensionable and so would require contributions in the order of 15 per cent. If the pension scheme were contributory, some cost would fall on the employee, for which tax relief would be available. However, the bulk of the cost, upwards of 10 per cent of salary, would fall on the employer, considerably reducing the alleged net gain to the employer as shown. To the employee, the substitution of a car by a salary increase must be an added attraction if it also enhances the pension.

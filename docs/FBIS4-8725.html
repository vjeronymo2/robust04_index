			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Borislav Mikelic, prime minister-designate </F> of the republic of Serbian Krajina, by Zoran Zivkovic in  Belgrade; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Studio announcer] In the office of the republic  of Serbian Krajina in Belgrade, Borislav Mikelic, prime minister  designate of the republic of Serbian Krajina, held consultations  with representatives of the parliamentary parties pertaining to  the formation of the government. The consultations were also  attended by Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian  Krajina. An agreement was reached on the formation of a  government of national unity that will be constituted at the  assembly session scheduled for 20 April in Knin. In the name of  the Serbian Democratic Party for Krajina [SDS], its president  Dr. Milan Babic gave his agreement and support to Prime Minister  Designate Borislav Mikelic for forming a government in which the  SDS Krajina will be represented in proportion to its  representation in the parliament. Veljko Vukelic, president of  the deputy caucus of the SDS for Serbian lands, extended his  support to this constructive agreement between Mikelic and  Babic. The composition of the new government of national unity  of the republic of Serbian Krajina was also established.    [Zivkovic] Mr. Mikelic, we have heard that on 20 April, the  republic of Serbian Krajina will get a government of national  unity.    [Mikelic] Well, yes. As soon as I was nominated prime  minister designate by President Martic, I joined these, so to  speak, active talks with the representatives and presidents of  all the parties in the republic of Serbian Krajina. Of course,  one of the central issues was the position the Serbian  Democratic Party, headed by Mr. Babic, would take.  Incidentally, the SDS has the greatest number of deputies in  the republican assembly, regarding the part of the parliamentary  coalition that existed [sentence as heard].    For my part, I also talked to the leadership of the Serbian  Radical Party [SRS], who, because of certain requests that I  obviously could not implement -- I even offered a part of their  membership to join our government -- however, owing to certain  principled or some other reasons, they remained within the  framework of their party's position [sentence as heard]. We  have reached a complete agreement, an integral agreement with  Mr. Babic, with the representatives of the SDS of the Serbian  lands and other parties, and I can say that we have already  reached an agreement on all the ministers in the framework of  the future government which I will lead.    Therefore, along with the program that I will present to the  assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina on Wednesday, 20  April, I will also present the composition of the government,  the cabinet, that is, and I believe that in such agreements,  [words indistinct] we will achieve the unity which is of extreme  importance to the Serbian people within the framework of the  republic of Serbian Krajina at a point when we have signed this  peace process, when we need to strengthen the Krajina from  within, when we need to revive production, strengthen the civic  state, and offer a perspective of our future joint state which  we will create with the Srpska republic and the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia.    I am convinced that this composition of the government and  our agreement will lessen the tensions present on the ground,  and that the Serbian people in the Krajina [changes thought],  and that more favorable news will come from the Krajina than has  been the case in the previous year and in those months when  there were significant conflicts there.</p>

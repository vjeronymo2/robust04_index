			<p>BFN     [Text] The following is a report on the Pailin battlefield  situation between 14 and 15 April 1994:    1. On 14 April, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  attacked the two-headed government troops at Toek S'am adjoining  Pailin. In the fighting from 0700 to 1800, we destroyed a T-54  tank and a military truck and we killed 17 enemy soldiers and  wounded many others. The remaining troops were forced to  retreat for their lives to Stoeng Kanh.    2. On 15 April, we intercepted a group of transport forces  on the road linking [word indistinct] and Pailin, killing 15  enemy soldiers and wounding 12 others. The remaining troops  were forced to retreat behind their lines.    3. Those in the Pailin town now are complaining about the  shortage of rice, [word indistinct], and medicine. Wounded or  killed soldiers are found everywhere. And roads are blocked  [words indistinct]. The situation so far is that the invading  forces have been routed extensively.    4. Puppet leaders, like Fifth Military Region Commander Hul  Savoan and Battambang Province Commander Manh Sophat, have  already run away from their troops, leaving their subordinates  to die in Pailin. As for the remaining 200 (Dac Cong)  Vietnamese soldiers at Phnum Yat, they are also prepared to beat  a hasty retreat. Since Pailin has completely been surrounded,  they can only run away through the bamboo-covered jungles.  Nevertheless, they will be killed by stepping on land mines or  lose their way and become foxes' or lizards' prey.</p>

The Service has reached a final decision on the petition and determines that sufficient information exists to suspend the importation of African grey parrots ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Psittacus erithacus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  and all subspecies) from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, and Guinea. Information the Service has gathered, including the petition, supports the suspension of the import of African grey parrots under the WBCA, in the interest of conservation of the species. However, because a statutorily mandated moratorium on importation of this species became effective on October 23, 1993, except as allowed pursuant to regulations which the Service has promulgated, no additional prohibition on importation of this species is necessary. The Service notes however that it is required under the WBCA to issue and publish notice of the final decision reached on this petition. The Service will take into account its decision on this petition in reviewing any future applications for the importation of African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, and Guinea to the United States under the WBCA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. Susan S.

The purposes of the WBCA include promoting the conservation of exotic birds by: ensuring that all imports into the United States of species of exotic birds are biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject to inhumane treatment; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs in countries of origin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Section 105(b) of the WBCA (16 U.S.C. 4904), ``Emergency Authority to Suspend Imports of Listed Species,'' the WBCA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to suspend the importation of exotic birds of any species that is listed in any Appendix to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES, or Convention), if the Secretary determines that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)(i) Trade in that species is detrimental to the species,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) There is not sufficient information available on which to base a judgment that the species is not detrimentally affected by trade in that species, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Chen Maodi (7115 3029 1717) and Zou Aiguo </F> (6760 1947 0948)]    [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- While inspecting  Shanghai 23-25 May, State Council Premier Li Peng pointed out:  Developing and opening up Pudong is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  major decision and is a need for the country's overall  development. The entire country must support Pudong's  development and opening up, and Pudong must serve reform,  opening up, and economic development in the entire country.    Premier Li Peng visited Shanghai after concluding his  inspection of Jiangsu. Accompanied by Wu Bangguo, member of the  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the  Shanghai municipal party committee, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju,  Li Peng inspected the New Pudong District and Yangpu Bridge and  held a discussion meeting with Shanghai comrades.    Since the party Central Committee and the State Council  decided in 1990 to develop and open up Pudong, Li Peng has  visited Shanghai every year to inspect the New Pudong District's  development and construction. Currently, initial success has  been achieved in developing the district. By the end of last  year, the district had accumulated over 3,100 domestic  investments and over 1,600 direct foreign investments, as well  as agreements on the use of $3.27 billion in foreign funds. Li  Peng was pleased with the new progress.    Li Peng pointed out: Shanghai is the seaport for the very  long Chang Jiang. It has a vast hinterland, a strong industrial  base and superiority in personnel, developed commercial  establishments, and convenient transportation. We must make  full use of these favorable conditions to build Shanghai into an  international economic, financial, and trade center. He said:  The central authorities' decision to develop and open up Pudong  is unswerving. Because the district's development is currently  in the construction stage, the central authorities still need to  support its development through their policy, and they will  maintain continuity in the policies for Pudong's development and  opening up. Following the establishment of the socialist market  economy, these policies will be gradually standardized and,  based on China's actual situation, constructive study will be  conducted. He said: To build Shanghai into an international  economic, financial, and trade center, it is still necessary to  vigorously develop international shipping to form an  international and domestic transportation network that links all  areas. It is possible for Shanghai to become an international  shipping center through harnessing the Chang Jiang. He pointed  out: To become a trade center, it is necessary to open up more  local and external trade channels as well as to train a large  group of experts in international trade.    Li Peng affirmed Shanghai's industrial restructuring policy  of "vigorously developing tertiary industry, readjusting and  upgrading secondary industry, and strengthening primary  industry." He pointed out: To build Shanghai into an  international financial center, we must vigorously develop  tertiary industry, particularly finance, trade, and shipping, to  serve economic development in the entire Chang Jiang Valley and  even the whole country. We must upgrade the structure of  secondary industry and embark on constructing some large  export-oriented projects of high and new technology to form a  new pillar industry. As a large industrial city, agriculture  should be given equal importance and strengthened, and it is  necessary to effectively tackle the "vegetable basket" project.  Village and town enterprises in Shanghai's suburbs must support  agriculture by acting as stable agricultural production bases  for the city proper. He expressed hope that Shanghai would  continue to perfect the "321" policy [not further identified] in  practice. Li Peng also affirmed Shanghai's plans to remodel old  city areas.    Speaking about Shanghai's socialist spiritual civilization,  Li Peng stressed: It is necessary to give more publicity to  workers, peasants, cadres, and intellectuals who possess a  sacrificing spirit and a lofty moral character. As for the  encouraging changes in young Shanghai students' spiritual  outlook, Li Peng said: The fact that the vast number of our  country's young students have combined their own future with the  motherland's destiny indicates that there is great hope for the  vast number of young people and our great motherland. He said:  As long as we unswervingly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  submit ourselves to the leadership of the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and do practical  work, Shanghai will definitely realize its magnificent goal.    Persons in charge of relevant State Council departments who  accompanied the inspection included Chen Jinhua, He Chunlin, Liu  Jiang, Huang Zhendong, and Jiang Yunbao.</p>

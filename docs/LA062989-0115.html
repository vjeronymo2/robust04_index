			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT CLAIMS AIR FORCE EXPOSED FAMILY TO TOXIC CHEMICAL  </P> <P> A Merced County family living next to the front gate of Castle Air Force Base  has filed a federal lawsuit here alleging that the military has not done enough  to protect it from the hazards of a cancer-causing chemical seeping from the  base in a poisonous ground-water plume.  </P> <P> Bill Burke, his wife, Diana, and their 9-year-old daughter, Billie Jo, claim in  the suit that the Air Force botched installation of a water filtration system  at their home and exposed them to levels of the industrial solvent TCE 130  times higher than the drinking water safety standard for the solvent.  </P> <P> They seek at least $1 million in damages, contending that the value of their  1.5-acre home site has been destroyed and that they face years of uncertainty  over whether they will develop cancer.  </P></p>

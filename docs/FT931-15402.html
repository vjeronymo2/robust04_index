			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Whisky sours However much Guinness protests that its rationalisation is prompted by internal efficiency considerations, it is clearly a sign of excess capacity in the whisky market. Bulk prices weakened in the second half of 1992, and expectations of other distillers' profits are falling. Perhaps the only consolation is that conditions are not as bad as in the early 1980s. Prices, though, may remain soft for some time, particularly at the commodity end of the market, and there will be knock-on effects to Guinness' premium products. So it is unfortunate Guinness' efficiency measures will not bear substantial fruit until 1995. Worldwide recession is curbing consumption of spirits and slowing the drift to upmarket brands, dulling Guinness' profits growth. Even when recession lifts, low inflation may limit the ability of distillers to raise their margins as they did in the 1980s. The glamour of whisky may just be souring slightly. Yet despite the immediate below-average earnings outlook, Guinness' strong market position and capable management can justify its rating in line with the market, so the risks are limited. Equally, the tactic of waiting until late in the day to squeeze the provision into last year's figures should at least ensure the charge is quickly forgotten. Guinness' cut in grain distilling capacity also casts an interesting sidelight on another drinks fight. Invergordon's grain distillery attracted Whyte &amp; MacKay's interest in 1991. The softness of the whisky market might be expected to deter a bid, but, with reduced capacity in the industry, Whyte may be tempted to exploit the weakness and return with a lower renewed lower bid later in the year. The Invergordon board could then have missed the best price.</p>

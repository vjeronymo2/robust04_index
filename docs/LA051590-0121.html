			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 TESTIFY IN BUSINESS WEEK INSIDER TRIAL;  </P> <P> SECURITIES: A PRINTER AND HIS BROKER SAID THEY WERE UNAWARE THAT TRADING ON  TIPS GLEANED FROM ADVANCE COPIES OF THE MAGAZINE WAS ILLEGAL.  </P> <P> The first two men to stand trial in the nationwide Business Week insider  trading scandal took the stand Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,  both claiming they were unaware that what they had done was illegal.  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged in a civil insider-trading  lawsuit that Brian J. Callahan, a former broker in the Anaheim office of  Prudential-Bache Securities, and William N. Jackson, a former quality-control  analyst at a Torrance printing plant, got early copies of Business Week and  then bought stock based on recommendations in the magazine's "Inside Wall  Street" column.  </P> <P> The SEC claims that Callahan, 30, of Anaheim, and several brokerage clients  made $19,684 in illegal profits while Jackson and two of his brothers racked up  $19,506 in ill-gotten gains. Jackson and Callahan, however, are the only two  defendants named in the SEC lawsuit, which is seeking to recover damages equal  to three times the amount of profits the two men made.  </P> <P> This one of several apparently unrelated cases around the country in which the  SEC alleges that several individuals made illicit trades using advance  information from a Business Week stock column. This is the first of the cases  to go to trial.  </P> <P> Jackson, 34, of Long Beach, testified Monday that he did pick up a copy of  Business Week at his employer -- R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons -- at about 2 a.m.  on Thursday mornings between September, 1987, and July, 1988. He said he would  then read the magazine -- including "Inside Wall Street" -- and place orders  through Callahan several hours later after the stock markets opened in New  York.  </P> <P> "I traded Business Week stocks to try and make money," Jackson testified.  "Nobody said it was illegal."  </P> <P> SEC attorneys showed Jackson a copy of a confidentiality agreement he signed  that forbade him from trading on information he learned from the company's  financial printing business. Donnelley had posted numerous warnings to  employees around its plant about insider trading, the SEC said.  </P> <P> Jackson said he never saw those posters and said he didn't think that Business  Week was considered financial printing because Donnelley didn't increase its  security provisions, such as cordoning off certain areas, when producing the  magazine as it did with annual reports or proxy statements.  </P> <P> He further testified that he noticed the prices of stocks in the magazine's  column often went up on Thursdays when he was buying the stock, so he assumed  that the recommendations he was using were public knowledge and not inside  information.  </P> <P> "I was sure it had reached the public because the stock prices went up at least  one dollar in some cases," Jackson said. "It was clearly legal."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Callahan testified that he thought Jackson was getting the  recommendations from a computer program. He said he didn't know where Jackson  worked until just a few weeks before he was questioned by the SEC in the summer  of 1988.  </P> <P> "The stock broker is first and foremost an order taker," Callahan told jurors.  </P> <P> But Jackson and a mutual friend -- who introduced the two men -- both testified  that they had told Callahan about Donnelley and the early copies of Business  Week. Callahan said they were "lying."  </P></p>

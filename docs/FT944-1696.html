			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: International accounts Could the common international accounting standard be an idea whose time has finally come? Sir Bryan Carsberg's move next year to become secretary-general of the International Accounting Standards Committee, which draws up model financial reporting rules, suggests it may. If Sir Bryan displays the same vigour and independence in his new job as he has in his present position as the UK's director-general of fair trading, the cause of common accounting standards could receive a big push. The rationale for common accounting rules is similar to that for any lingua franca: a babble of standards prevents investors making meaningful cross-border comparison of price/earnings ratios and other valuation yardsticks. With companies increasingly raising funds outside their home markets and investors keen to build diversified global portfolios, this incomprehension creates undesirable impediments to the free flow of capital. The concept of common standards is fine, but those produced by IASC have yet to make an impact on capital markets. Scores of countries use them as a model for their own local standards. But the rules are not recognised by the world's main stock markets - New York, London and Tokyo. Unsurprisingly, if a multinational like Daimler-Benz wishes to approach international shareholders, it adopts US rather than international accounting standards. The IASC is keen for its standards to be recognised by the big stock exchanges, and indeed the New York Stock Exchange may in time make such a move as a way of encouraging a greater number of foreign companies to list in the US. Fair enough. But official recognition on its own will not lead to widespread endorsement by investors. Too often the IASC decides on rules by picking the lowest common denominator among its large membership. That leads to soggy standards; and investors will always prefer firm US rules to soggy international ones. The alternative is for the IASC to improve its standards by single-mindedly putting investors' interests first - for example, by embracing greater disclosure and rooting out 'creative' accounting techniques. Even relatively investor-friendly standards bodies such as the UK's Accounting Standards Board sometimes have to compromise their principles in the face of pressure from company lobbies. The IASC need not. It would then set the standards to which others aspire.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / A reworking of television characters: A look at what is in store for LWT London Weekend Television's future as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Granada group begins this morning at 9am. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, the London ITV company which succumbed on Friday to Granada's Pounds 760m hostile bid, will go to the victors' Golden Square headquarters to meet Granada chief executive, Mr Gerry Robinson. There he will resign. 'I think that's the correct protocol,' said Sir Christopher. Mr Robinson placed a heavy emphasis on conciliation yesterday and there was no sign of a blueprint drawn up for LWT by Mr Charles Allen, chief executive of Granada Television. During the battle, Granada executives pointed to a plan which suggested that younger managers would be promoted, while many of the LWT millionaire managers might have more time to enjoy their wealth. 'People think that somehow on Monday morning Granada will be over the walls at LWT and in there hacking around. It could not be further from the truth,' said Mr Allen. This week will see the start of talks on how to integrate two of the UK's main commercial television operations, he added. It had been agreed all along that there would be no place for Sir Christopher. He will hold Granada shares worth around Pounds 14m. 'I am a bigger shareholder than either Gerry Robinson or Alex Bernstein (Granada chairman) in the company and I hope they look after my investment with care,' Sir Christopher said. The key to what happens next is the position of Mr Greg Dyke, LWT chief executive. He is seen as one of the most talented ITV executives but is now independently wealthy with Granada shares worth around Pounds 9m. 'With Greg on board we are likely to have a much, much better feel for the people within the company. How it will go without him will obviously be much more difficult to tell. Our starting point is that we hope that he will stay,' said Mr Robinson. He admits he does not have anyone else lined up if the LWT chief executive decides he does not want to work for a subsidiary of Granada. Over the weekend many LWT staff urged Mr Dyke to stay and Sir Christopher believes Mr Dyke can reach agreement with Granada. Whoever runs the weekend ITV company, which will almost certainly continue to be called London Weekend Television, costs will have to be cut and jobs will have to go. Cost cuts, however, will be modest compared with the scale of the deal - perhaps up to Pounds 10m a year - and the job losses, as yet unquantified, are likely to come from removing duplication. 'The arguments were always strategic ones and that remains,' said Mr Robinson who founded his case for the takeover on the belief that larger groupings were necessary and inevitable in the increasingly competitive world of commercial television. The studio complexes in both Manchester and London will be retained and the existing LWT specialisation in light entertainment and Granada's emphasis on serial drama such as Coronation Street will continue. Some LWT drama which now goes out to independent producers could in future be made in-house in Granada's television 'factory' in Manchester. Granada will also be 'having a very good look at production' and how programmes could be made for international markets as well as for ITV. 'Programme making is going to be a real business in its own right and as the largest player in the UK after the BBC we should be capable of doing a lot with it,' forecast Mr Robinson. The final irony is that the Granada victory finally overturns LWT's main argument against the rental and leisure group that television was only a small part of Granada's operations. Following the takeover of LWT, television will account for more than one third of the Granada business.</p>

Shalom to you, Rabbi Lau.    [Lau] Shalom.    [Nir] How did the meeting with the Cuban leader go? Are  there any messages you would like to relay at this point?    [Lau] First, I must digest it all. The meeting ended half  an hour ago, and it lasted exactly three hours: from 2155 to  0055. It was filled with so many issues and emotions, and the  hour is so late, that I am having a hard time digesting it all.  All in all, he is a very wise, brave, levelheaded, and cautious  man. As you know, I did not try to approach him from the  political point of view but rather from the spiritual and  humanitarian aspects. Two issues are very close to him: First,  the Holocaust, because he is a big enemy of anti-Semitism;  second, he is very interested in the peace talks between Israel  and its neighbors, but he knows I am not a political man who  relays political messages. The issue of relations between our  two countries came up in one way or another on various  occasions. The only news I can impart to you is that although  he did not promise anything, he evinced keen interest -- as he  was escorting me to the elevator, he wrote down the names of Ron  Arad and our three MIA's from the Sultan al-Ya'qub battle.    [Dan] Does the establishment of diplomatic relations with  Cuba seem likely in the wake of your meeting with Fidel Castro?    [Lau] I am not acting on behalf of the Foreign Ministry,  which retains full responsibility for such issues. He spoke  with great admiration about the prime minister and the foreign  minister. After having spoken to him for three hours on this  and other related issues, I can say that he is waiting to see  the progress made on the peace process. He wishes for -- and I  am quoting him -- fair peace, final, and lasting [last five  words in English]. I have more than a feeling that as progress  is made on this issue, he will be more responsive and open on  the question of relations.    [Dan] Do you think it is a condition?    [Lau] We did not use such words. He referred to it from the  humanitarian point of view. He spoke about all the years he was  isolated, especially by his neighbor, the strongest superpower  in the world, which he has been facing empty-handed, and he  noted that with the disintegration of the Soviet regime and the  ensuing collapse, he has been left with very few friends around  the world, some of whom are our neighbors. It is hard for him  to take a step that will not be accepted by those who stood by  him in times of distress. I believe I have made myself clear.  I am speaking from the official guest house of the Cuban  Government.    [Dan] Did he acquire a new friend as a result of your  meeting?    [Lau, laughing] Did he acquire a new friend? I do not know  what you call a friend. I do not see him visiting Israel  tomorrow or the day after, but he is a great friend of the  Jewish people. He deeply abhors anti-Semitism. He explained to  me that during his childhood, people tried to instill in him  notions about the Jews being guilty for the fate of Jesus. He  is very non-Catholic on this issue. He was very glad when I  mentioned that we hold fond memories of the Cuban Government and  the Cuban people for opening their country to European refugees  upon the rise of Nazism to power. He was very touched by this.    [Nir] What sort of man did you find him to be? He may be  the last vestige of an era.    [Lau] He is not a dogmatic man. In my opinion, he is very  educated. He is an interesting man, very knowledgeable about  the Bible. There is no doubt that he is charismatic. God  willing, when I return home tomorrow I will tell about the  situation here and the admiration felt toward the man  nevertheless. Then you will understand that the man is simply  brimming with personal charm.    [Dan] Thank you very much, Rabbi Lau. You say you are due  back tomorrow.    [Lau] God willing, tomorrow I will start on my way back.  [passage omitted]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0700 GMT on 8 February  carries a report on Rabbi Lau's meeting with Castro, adding that  "Castro emphasized that he has never denounced Israel and said  he is sorry about reports in the Israeli media that Israel is  not interested in establishing relations with Cuba. He asked  Rabbi Lau to relay a message to Prime Minister Rabin and to  Foreign Minister Peres expressing his admiration for the Israeli  Government in view of the courage it has evinced in the peace  process."]</p>

Concurrently with this, the  Constitutional Court will initiate an amendment to the  Constitution: the number of constitutional justices should be  nine instead of 15. In connection with the information received  by MTI, Laszlo Solyom, the chief justice of the Constitutional  Court, disclosed that approval of the legislative proposal  concerning the regulations and the requested amendment to the  constitution are on the agenda for the 24 January meeting of the  full Court. Answering a question, Laszlo Solyom said that in  contrast to assertions appearing in the media, the  Constitutional Court has not taken and is not taking any steps  toward the election of a successor to Geza Herczegh, who  resigned from his position as constitutional justice when he  became a member of the International Court in The Hague.</p>

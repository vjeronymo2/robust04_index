			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nampak Nampak, the South African paper and packaging group, increased after-tax profit before abnormal items 10 per cent to R169.2m for the half-year to March, compared with R154.1m for the same period a year ago. Attributable income rose 15 per cent to R174.3m from R151.2m on the strength of a one-off sale of some machinery. Turnover rose by only 3 per cent to R2.38bn from R2.32bn, due to a decline in volumes and pressure on selling prices.</p>

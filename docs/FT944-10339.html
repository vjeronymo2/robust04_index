			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UN seeks aid for Afghanistan The United Nations yesterday launched a Dollars 106m appeal for humanitarian aid for Afghanistan amid fears that the onset of winter will soon bring additional suffering to the country. With no end in sight to the battles between militia groups which have plagued the country since the departure of Soviet troops in 1989, the UN is making desperate efforts to relieve the misery for ordinary Afghans, including 500,000 who have abandoned their homes in the past year. Most have fled the capital, Kabul, which has lost a third of its population since January 1 when rival commanders began battling for control of the city. In addition, the UN is helping about 3m refugees still living in camps in Iran and Pakistan and about 2m who have returned to Afghanistan. UN officials say that even taking into account Bosnia and Rwanda, Afghanistan remains their biggest relief operation in the world. The latest appeal will fund operations until next autumn and follows a similar appeal which raised Dollars 60m last year.</p>

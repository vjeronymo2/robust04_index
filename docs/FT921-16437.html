			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Bush ready to wage 'dog-eat-dog' campaign PRESIDENT George Bush is ready to wage 'a dog-eat-dog' campaign for re-election, but still expects to win a second term in the White House whether or not the US economy recovers by November. In a pre-Christmas interview broadcast on US television today, Mr Bush conceded that many Americans felt worse off than when he entered office three years ago. It was vital to get the US economy moving, he said. In the interview with Mr David Frost, the British broadcaster, Mr Bush said his own economic advisers were forecasting an economic recovery by the end of the second quarter, with clear results showing in the third quarter. Fresh measures to stimulate the US economy would be unveiled shortly, he said. Yesterday, Mr Bush dropped similar hints at a news conference in Canberra, the first stop on his Far East tour. Mr Bush appeared to relish the prospect of a tough election battle: 'I'm certainly going into this as a dog-eat-dog fight. I will do what I have to do to be re-elected.' Mr Bush also expressed confidence that the new Commonwealth of Independent States will be a lasting replacement for the Soviet Union, despite 'some difficult bumps on the road'. Turning to domestic issues, Mr Bush complained about the explicit sexual descriptions during televised coverage of the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, and the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Clarence Thomas. 'Why, when you get into this kind of vivid, and gory detail of a person's sexual prowess or lack thereof, why does that have to be brought into everybody's living room . . . I think we've gone too far in that kind of thing.' On President Saddam Hussein, Mr Bush said he could not predict when the Iraqi leader would fall from power. It would have been nice if the Allies had insisted on him being removed as a ceasefire condition, but making it a war aim would have split the US-led Gulf coalition and angered Arabs. George Graham adds: The slowdown in the US economy continued into December, according to a widely watched survey of company buyers. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of business activity fell to 46.5 per cent last month, a level which indicates a drop in activity in the manufacturing sector and the lowest figure since May. The purchasing managers' index averaged 47.2 per cent for the whole of 1991, a level which in the past has been consistent with overall economic growth of only around 1 per cent. The NAPM survey showed that production and new orders fell in December. New export orders rose, but slower than in recent months. Employment fell for the 35th month in succession. At the same time, the Commerce Department said that construction spending fell 0.6 per cent in November to an annual rate of Dollars 363.2bn (Pounds 199.5bn), adjusted for inflation and seasonal variations. Residential construction spending stagnated at an annual rate of Dollars 167.3bn while non-residential private spending fell 3.6 per cent in November to a rate of Dollars 87.8bn.</p>

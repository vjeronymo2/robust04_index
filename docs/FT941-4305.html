			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Skirmishes in battle for Westland - War of words over order prospects and GKN's reasons for bid The battle for control of Westland turned more hostile yesterday after the helicopter manufacturer accused GKN of employing shallow arguments and misleading information in its Pounds 496m takeover bid. Mr Alan Jones, chairman of the Yeovil-based manufacturer, said the engineering and industrial services group had tried to cast doubt on its order prospects, while disguising its own motives for the takeover. 'GKN does not appear to understand the value of Westland's future business. The real savings arising from the possible acquisition appear to be tax benefits for GKN,' he said. His criticism, contained in a letter to shareholders, prompted an angry response from GKN, which has offered Westland investors 290p per ordinary share. Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, said: 'Mr Jones has totally failed to address the real issue, that is the price. Why should we overpay for his optimism about future orders?' He also dismissed Westland's claim that there was no synergy between the helicopter business and GKN's armoured vehicles division. GKN believes the two operations could pool their logistical and marketing operations. It has also pledged additional financial support for the company. GKN is in a strong position to win control of Westland - having boosted its existing holding to 45 per cent. Mr Jones, said: 'Collaboration with GKN would add no value to Westland's businesses. Westland has the financial strength to achieve its objectives and does not need the shelter of a larger group.' Both companies have started an intensive lobbying campaign to win the support of institutional shareholders. M&amp;G and Schroders, the two largest, have indicated they regard the offer as too low. Westland shares closed down 2p at 327p, a 13 per cent premium to the offer price.</p>

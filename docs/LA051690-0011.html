			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FRYMAN BUILDER GETS MORE TIME TO PREPARE BATTLE TO KEEP PERMIT  </P> <P> A developer trying to build houses in Studio City's Fryman Canyon won more time  Tuesday to fight for a crucial grading permit as he battles threats from City  Hall to encumber his project with additional environmental requirements.  </P> <P> Without debate, the city's Building and Safety Commission gave developer Fred  Sahadi an additional week to appeal the revocation of his grading permit after  it was learned that Sahadi was not adequately notified that the hearing on his  appeal was scheduled for Tuesday.  </P> <P> Sahadi inadvertently was not informed of the hearing, Building and Safety  Department General Manager Warren O'Brien told the commission.  </P> <P> If the commission next week upholds its staff's recommendation that Sahadi's  grading permit be voided, the developer would "probably at minimum" be required  to expand his 1978 environmental impact report if he reapplies, said Tim  Taylor, deputy general manager of the department.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley, who appoints commission members, supports requiring new  environmental reviews of the project, said Jane Blumenfeld, the mayor's  land-use deputy. The project should be subjected to current environmental  review standards, she said.  </P> <P> Taylor overturned a lower-ranking official's decision earlier this month that  would have extended Sahadi's grading permit. The permit, issued in September,  1988, required the developer to do some grading work within 180 days, but  expired with no work begun. Reznik said it would be illegal to impose new  environmental conditions as a prerequisite for applying for a new permit  because Sahadi was unable to begin work under the previous permit due to the  many roadblocks the city itself created.  </P> <P> Sahadi's project has galvanized environmentalists opposed to development in the  Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> The city's Cultural Heritage Board is scheduled to decide today whether Fryman  Canyon should be named a cultural-historic monument, which would block Sahadi's  plan to build 26 estate-sized homes on the site for up to a year.  </P> <P> Bradley's office also supports landmark status for the canyon, as have various  legislators, including Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and Assemblyman  Terry Friedman (D-Sherman Oaks).  </P></p>

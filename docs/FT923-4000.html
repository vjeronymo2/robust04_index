			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: All-round growth as Macro 4 advances 14% MACRO 4, the computer systems software developer, yesterday reported a 14 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.65m to Pounds 8.75m. Turnover grew to Pounds 19m (Pounds 18m) in the year to June 30, with the overseas activities contributing 76 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 15 per cent to 26.5p (23p), slightly outstripping the profits advance because of a small reduction in the tax rate. The proposed final dividend is increased to 12.61p, including a special 5p payment, raising the total for the year to 17.75p (11p). The company said the special dividend was being made 'because of the cash generative nature of Macro 4's business and the continuing build up of cash reserves.' However, it cautioned that it expected future dividend payments to be in line with profits growth. Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said the group had 'continued to make progress this year, against an economic background generally as difficult as the previous year'. He added that most of the company's important markets had experienced severe economic downturns. However, all subsidiaries had improved both turnover and contribution to profits. The performance in the US was the best for several years and there were strong performances in France, Italy and Switzerland. The results from the agent-run territories had been disappointing generally, said Mr Kelly, even though they had shown improvements. In Japan, a 36 per cent increase in royalty payments reflected a successful year.</p>

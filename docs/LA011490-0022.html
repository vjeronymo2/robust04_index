			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE LONG WHITE BY SHARON DILWORTH (W .W. NORTON: $7.95)  </P> <P> Many of these short stories set in Michigan's Upper Peninsula focus on the  conflicts between the Finns and the Indians, two groups who continue to  misunderstand each other despite more than a century of living in proximity.  The unhappy lives of Sharon Dilworth's characters are shaped by the harsh  winters and the continuing decline of the heavy industries that provided the  economic base of the region.  </P> <P> In the title story, a man who works the ore boats succumbs to his fears of  unemployment and to the demon-haunted storms on Lake Huron, leaving his family  to piece together a life that has been irrevocably shattered, like the ice on  the lake at winter's end. A moving account of blue-collar sorrows by a winner  of the prestigious Iowa Short Fiction Award.  </P></p>

They said more than 10,000 others were  infected by the disease, caused by rotten food and contaminated water.  </P> <P> "It's hard to control the epidemic because many areas have no supply of pure  water and people are so poor they eat anything available," said Samadul Huq,  the medical officer of Patuakhali district.  </P></p>

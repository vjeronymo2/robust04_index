			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> NBC's remarkable command of the weekly television ratings will almost certainly  end Tuesday, as a resurgent ABC -- sparked by its World Series broadcasts --  makes a bid for the Nielsen pennant. For the first time in 68 weeks, NBC is  convinced it won't be No. 1 in the A.C. Nielsen Co. weekly ratings, ending a  winning streak unmatched in television history. "I'm sorry it's come to an end,  but I hope we start a new streak soon," said Brandon Tartikoff, NBC  Entertainment's president. "I'd like to start a new one as soon as the last out  is made at the World Series." Odds are long, though, that NBC -- or any other  network -- soon will assemble such a string of consecutive triumphs. The  previous record of 46 weeks was set by CBS in the 1962-63 season.

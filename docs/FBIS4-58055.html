			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning the criminal acts perpetrated by units  of the Presidential Guard, central security, and gangs of tribes  loyal to the ruling military family in Sanaa have been renewed  against units of the 3d Armored Brigade which had succeeded on  the afternoon of 27 April in absorbing the first treacherous  offensive strike, deploying to thwart the attacks and moving to  defensive positions. This enabled the brigade to stay steadfast,  thanks to God's support, the high morale and fighting spirit of  the men of the brigade, as well as the experience of its  command, the support of the patriotic tribes and the inhabitants  of 'Imran against whom strikes by forces of the adventurist  military family were also directed.    Units of the 3d Armored Brigade are continuing courageously  and with responsible steadfastness to resist the forces of  treachery and treason [words indistinct].</p>

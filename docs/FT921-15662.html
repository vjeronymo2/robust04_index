			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Rise in sales of used cars on hire purchase THE NUMBER of used cars bought on hire purchase rose by more than 9 per cent last month compared with December 1990. Such sales are made almost wholly to private motorists, and are regarded as a minor but useful indicator of consumer confidence. The recovery came after a long decline in the autumn. Total credit purchases of used cars reported last year to HPI, the credit information agency, were 1.4 per cent higher than in 1990 at 917,116. Dr Brian Bailey, HPI chairman, said, however: 'It will nevertheless take more than a single month of improved trading to convince used-car dealers of an upturn in the market'. No consistent improvement in the markets for either new or used cars could be expected 'until the economy shows a more general recovery', he added. Statistics on credit sales of new cars last year, to be published this month, are expected to show a sharper drop than the total market for new cars. That would indicate a decline in the private motorists' share.</p>

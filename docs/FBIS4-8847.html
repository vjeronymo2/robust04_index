			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] This morning hand-to-hand fighting is under way on  the right bank of the Drina River. The Chetniks are also  situated on the left side of Gorazde, at the gates to the town  center, with a number of tanks and strong infantry forces. So  the Chetnik occupation of Gorazde is coming to a very painful  and tragic close for these people. An entire town and its  people -- who were fed lies about living in a Security Council  protected area -- is being wiped from the face of the earth,  left to the mercy of Chetniks.    This morning the Chetniks are targeting the hospital area  with chemical agents.    Yesterday, overnight, and this morning the mass slaughter of  civilians on the left bank of the Drina River is continuing, not  with knives but with shrapnel. Overnight alone thousands of  shells were fired from Jabuka and [word indistinct] at the town  center on both banks of the Drina River. Dozens of apartments  were blown apart and there were many civilian casualties. The  shells rained down only a few meters away from the headquarters  of the UN monitors.    This morning six tanks and hundreds of Chetniks are  attacking  Gorazde from the direction of (Osanica). The attacks have also  started on Ilovaca, Zorovici, and Bare. People are fleeing from  these villages toward the town. And while 60,000 people are  crowding the town center on the left bank of the Drina River,  the Chetniks are looting and burning all the villages that have  been emptied. Yesterday dozens of trucks arrived in Kopaci, 5  km from Gorazde, from Priboj and other towns in Serbia and  Montenegro, and looting is under way on a massive scale. This  was supervised yesterday by the two brothers in crime, war  criminals Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic. They also  toured the premises of the wire factory and [word indistinct] in  Kopaci, which they managed to capture with the full support of  the UN, together with the residential area [words indistinct].    The mass slaughter of these people is to happen today as the  Chetniks have already this morning activated their bloody  artillery on the surrounding hills. The shells are again  killing, and who knows for how long it will continue to claim  victims among the women, children, old folk, and all those  caught in this tiny crowded space.    Finally it must be made clear to the world that these  innocent victims and the full tragedy of the people of Gorazde  are their shame.</p>

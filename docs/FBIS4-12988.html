			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F> staff, by Army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David; place and  date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ben-David] A week ago we  witnessed the removal of equipment from IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] bases in the Gaza Strip. This was done despite the face  that the negotiations with the PLO are still in progress and no  agreement on the evacuation of Gaza and Jericho has been signed.  Has the IDF not evacuated somewhat prematurely?    [Baraq] The IDF has brought forward the evacuation date of  objects and logistics. If necessary, we can remain there just  as we are for as long as 12 days, 12 months, or 12 years. The  IDF's operational forces will neither leave nor redeploy in  accordance with the new plans -- incidentally, the redeployment  is also inside the Gaza Strip, around the Qatif Bloc, around  settlements and along traffic axes -- until we achieve an  agreement we consider reasonable from the security angle and the  political echelons consider reasonable from the political point  of view.    [Ben-David] We are waging a war against terrorism in the  north as well. The question is whether our negotiations with  Syria will be accompanied by protracted terror there, too,  carried out under Syrian auspices, more or less.    [Baraq] In my opinion, we should work on the premise of and  with a mental and physical preparedness for continuing terror in  the north. In the long run, however, political arrangements may  offer a certain chance for a long-term reduction of tension and  enmity, provided they reflect an appropriate sensitivity to the  security issue. Nothing can turn us into the Netherlands and  Belgium or Switzerland and France in this generation, but a  proper balance of security-related emphases in the political  content with a technical, a physical military preparedness....  [pauses] At present, we face almost no existential threat.  The State of Israel is very strong today in the sense of being  able to defend its existence. What is threatened is the  personal safety of its civilians, who are faced with terror.    [Ben-David] We are celebrating our Independence Day, and yet  the IDF's POW's and MIA's are still not with us. Is there  anything new in this respect?    [Baraq] There is no news; however, we will continue doing  everything that may contribute to the discovery of new  information about the fate of the MIA's and to return the POW's  home.

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> POLICE TARGET DRIVERS ON BROOKHURST ST.  </P> <P> Drivers on Brookhurst Street beware!  </P> <P> Police today will begin a monthlong crackdown of even the most minor traffic  violations on a three-mile section of the street between Adams and Warner  avenues.  </P> <P> The program, called CASE, Critical Accident Suppression and Enforcement, is  targeting a stretch of road where the number of collisions has increased  sharply.  </P> <P> "The focus of this effort is not to issue citations, though many times that  will be the result of being stopped. . . . The purpose is to reduce the  accident rate and remove unsafe drivers from the roadway," Police Sgt. Keith R.  Levin said.  </P> <P> Violations, such as right of way, speed, and following too closely will be  targeted heavily, Levin said.  </P> <P> Signs reading "Traffic Enforcement Ahead" will be posted along the street to  warn drivers that officers are working in the area.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley police, who will be working with Huntington Beach police, plan  to move to a different roadway at the end of the month.  </P></p>
